1
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:36,430
All right. Hey, good morning, everyone. Hopefully, I've got the technology going.

2
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:45,130
One of our presenters today is over Zoom. And so I'm trying to record in Panopto and trying to run through Zoom.

3
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,090
And we'll see what happens.

4
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:57,850
But the fingers crossed before we get into issues of indoor air quality, I wanted to clarify something I said regarding the course evaluations.

5
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:05,770
Right? I kind of I promise to you that none of your instructors actually see any of the course evaluations until final grades are submitted.

6
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:12,260
But I wanted to clarify also importantly, that even after they receive them, they still remain anonymous.

7
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:19,120
Right. So there's nothing tied to your name. Any comments that are listed are completely anonymous and any, you know,

8
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:24,380
scores or numerical evaluations or remain anonymous throughout the entire process.

9
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:29,830
So just wanted to make sure that the folks understand that any any questions,

10
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:37,880
I don't think I have very good answers on how to do the course evaluations for any questions that goes to the Democrats.

11
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:47,690
All right, great. So our our agenda for today is for me to be very timely and get through our kind of a half lecture

12
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:56,300
topic on indoor air quality and then to turn things over to our debate teams scheduled for today.

13
00:01:56,300 --> 00:02:05,390
So with that, let's go ahead and get going. Today, we're going to talk about indoor air quality and primarily issues.

14
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:14,750
We'll talk a little bit and kind of like office buildings settings, but then turn and focus more on household issues of air quality.

15
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,330
What are some of the common sources of household air pollution and then appreciate, you know,

16
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:30,830
really, where are the the largest threats in terms of global burden of disease impact?

17
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:40,440
So starting with a little bit of history around this, at least here in the US and this is I like to kind of put in these these old quotes.

18
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,150
I think they're pretty enlightening and sometimes some cases.

19
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:53,060
So the view that that closing buildings and recirculating air can significantly impact indoor air quality.

20
00:02:53,060 --> 00:03:01,580
This concept is not new, right? And we can see this actually in Benjamin Franklin's correspondence with the physician back in the 1780s.

21
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,550
And I'll kind of you can read it. You're welcome to read it with me.

22
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:12,770
Where he says I considered fresh air an enemy and closed with extreme care every crevice in rooms I inhabited.

23
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:15,110
Experience has convinced me of my error,

24
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:23,360
and I'm persuaded that no common air from without is so unwholesome as the air with an enclosed room that has been often breathed in,

25
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,060
not changes you physicians have have only discovered after a contrary,

26
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:37,190
opinion had prevailed some ages that a fresh and cool air does good to persons in the smallpox and other fevers.

27
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:45,110
It is to be hoped that in another century or two, we may find out that this is not bad even for people in health, right?

28
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:51,750
So I think he was he was onto something here, right with this, with this observation.

29
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,710
Fast forwarding about 100 years or so, this was one of the first cases of a,

30
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:04,850
you know, a well documented indoor air quality issue, kind of in a public building.

31
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:19,460
So this is the Ohio State House, the Capitol building in Columbus and one of its one of its features at the time in

32
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:25,400
1876 for a public statehouse building was the whole concept of indoor plumbing.

33
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:32,150
This was a great thing back then, and they realized that they needed to expand.

34
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:42,800
So they built some additional bathrooms and forth for several years after that major renovation.

35
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:50,930
There are a lot of people that were becoming ill with the term was coined statehouse malaria and is

36
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:57,350
really one of the first cases the earliest cases of a term that we use called building related illness.

37
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:04,520
So if you spend time in a certain building, whatever illness you've developed is related to that time spent in the building.

38
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:13,010
And it it turns out that it took eight years to discover this, that when that renovation was being done with these,

39
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:22,220
with these new restrooms, they unfortunately tied to the sewage ducts in with the ventilation ducts.

40
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:30,530
And so this is what people were breathing for for many, many years and obviously explains why people were not feeling so well.

41
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:34,220
And yet, once it was discovered and you know, it was a major cleanup,

42
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:43,790
they hauled out like 50 barrels of sewage from the ventilation is unbelievably awful.

43
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:54,110
Fast forwarding again another hundred years or so. And we have kind of the recent recognition of of indoor air quality issues back in the 1960s was

44
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:01,100
really when radon became one awareness around it and understanding of it came onto the scene.

45
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:07,310
This one is tough as we know it. It's not something you can see or smell because of that.

46
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:11,660
It wasn't really perceived as a problem even to this day,

47
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:22,700
although in some cases it's it's mostly comes to light through like home purchases and things so that state levels or municipality levels,

48
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:29,150
it's a requirement to do radon testing as part of a home purchase, and that's how people become aware.

49
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:34,320
But it's truly a major environmental exposure risk, and we've looked at some things,

50
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,310
some maps early on in this semester where regionally radon can be quite a big issue.

51
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,700
Moving into the 1970s, new construction materials came online.

52
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,250
Formaldehyde was a big problem,

53
00:06:49,250 --> 00:07:00,800
is a big problem used in insulation and particle boards and then combined with with lower ventilation rates led to a lot of your irritation,

54
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:09,080
recognition of it changes in industry standards and then ultimately, you know, restricted use of it.

55
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:15,410
During the 1980s, sick building syndrome also called building related symptoms.

56
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:21,260
These were feelings of discomfort and different acute symptoms that people associated with

57
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:29,160
with spending time in a certain indoor space in the 80s until the 1990s was really when mold.

58
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:42,680
Where more broadly recognized as issues are responsible for for symptoms and disease within indoor spaces.

59
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:53,420
So over this same time frame, these are some of the the energy trends that transpired from the 1960s through the 1980s.

60
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,980
Back in the 60s, we had new technologies coming online.

61
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:11,840
There was great economic expansion. New technologies like these building wide H-back systems in either workplaces or residential buildings.

62
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:20,570
And there were high ventilation rates because energy prices were low at the time, so it really wasn't a concern during the 1970s.

63
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:30,650
Energy prices increased dramatically. And with this, you know, there was a recognition to to try to be more energy efficient.

64
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,840
Because of that, we had a greater insulation in buildings,

65
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:41,850
maybe lowering the thermostat for heating to a lower indoor temperature, lower ventilation rates.

66
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:47,300
Right. If you've got, you know, warm air, the less fresh air you bring in from outside, you know, the eat,

67
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:58,370
the more energy efficient way you can keep that that room air warm and recirculating into indoor air instead of bringing in fresh air.

68
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:06,350
And of course, there was a move towards higher appliance efficiencies in the 1980s.

69
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:11,840
There was also just in general kind of the environmentalism movement.

70
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:23,990
And so recognition of things like acid rain, ozone depletion in the stratosphere, global warming, you know, came onto the scene.

71
00:09:23,990 --> 00:09:27,230
So all along these these lines, this thought, you know,

72
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:34,790
indoor air quality issues became to be a little bit more accepted and recognized and brought to a higher level of concern.

73
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:42,030
So things like environmental tobacco smoke mentioned radon as the best is the sick building syndrome and mold,

74
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:48,350
so all leading to concerns over indoor air quality.

75
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:57,320
So in terms of the significance of indoor air pollutants, the concentrations of many of these pollutants in general,

76
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:04,460
but but broadly speaking, can greatly exceed the levels of the same pollutants in outdoor environments.

77
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:12,570
So things like carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, ozone, both bio aerosols, pesticides,

78
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:21,950
environmental tobacco smoke and very very importantly, most of us on average spend the bulk of our time in indoor environments.

79
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:27,650
Right. So we can, you know, measure outdoor air pollution and be concerned about it?

80
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:35,270
Rightly so. But again, there needs to be an opportunity for exposure to take place.

81
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:40,880
And if we're all indoors, right, that maybe we shouldn't have as much concern on the outdoor environment.

82
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,130
And the concern might be more reflected in the indoor environment.

83
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:57,140
I mentioned the, you know, the energy conservation measures, reducing air exchange rates, lower rates of ventilation indoors.

84
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:04,040
This allows, you know, indoor pollution to to increase to higher levels.

85
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:11,900
And then again, mentioning the you know, we're now introducing different pollutants into these indoor environments over time.

86
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:15,950
We talked about the formaldehyde a few minutes ago.

87
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:24,170
We talked earlier in the semester about flame retardants, right? Fabric coverings, furniture, electronics, like you name it.

88
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:37,340
All of a sudden, we bring all of these into the indoor environment where we spend time, and it allows us to be exposed to to higher concentrations.

89
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:47,660
So segueing a little bit leaving kind of offices and workplace settings and shifting to household air pollution,

90
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,090
and I'm going to focus most of the effort,

91
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:58,220
I'll swing back around at the end, I'm going to focus most of the effort around a low and middle income countries settings.

92
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,740
This is really where the bulk of the problem is in terms of burden of disease.

93
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:11,840
So around three billion people worldwide still cook and heat their homes using solid fuels.

94
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:23,720
So things like would crop waste, charcoal, coal and done in and generally open fires or in stoves that are that are very leaky,

95
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,100
right, so that the emissions aren't being taken very far away.

96
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:38,300
And these inefficient cooking and heating technologies produce high levels of household air pollution with a range of pollutants.

97
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:44,660
The health effects are similar to those from outdoor air pollutants, and we're similar to outdoor air.

98
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:52,250
We're concerned about particulate matter, so said particles that can penetrate deep into our lungs.

99
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:58,380
And then, you know, in these poorly ventilated homes, the indoor smoke can be, you know,

100
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:10,160
100 times greater than outdoor air or what we consider to be acceptable levels of ppm within these indoor settings.

101
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:22,940
Looking a little bit geographically at the percent of population using solid fuels, you can see, you know, this is whatever the basic scale here is.

102
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:29,780
A light yellow is the lowest percent of population and in the orange and red to the highest percent of population,

103
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:41,780
using solid fuels and a huge concentration here in Sub Saharan Africa and then South Asia as well.

104
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:51,050
And then in terms of exposure, it's actually similar, but even worse in terms of susceptible populations within indoor environments.

105
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:56,300
We are especially concerned about women, young children,

106
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:07,010
women of childbearing age who spend the most time around the domestic are so managing those household chores of cooking, eating and so forth.

107
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:14,060
So you can see here in an image mom also rearing a child, also doing these chores.

108
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:21,530
So the result is that it's not just it's not just her exposure, it's the child exposure of concern as well.

109
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:29,930
Looking at another map, this is looking at some some impact on health, looking at disability,

110
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:37,280
adjusted life years or galleys that are specifically attributable to household air pollution.

111
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:43,070
And again, that light yellow is the lowest levels per 100000.

112
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,640
People in the orange and red are the highest levels.

113
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:59,780
And you can see very similarly right where this concentration is the largest impact on health again is sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.

114
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:05,000
In terms of impacts on health and some statistics,

115
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:12,260
and this number is really similar actually to what we estimate for impacts from outdoor air pollution.

116
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:22,550
It's about four million ish give or take, you know, some uncertainty of death, premature deaths each year from exposure to outdoor air pollutants.

117
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:31,820
It's almost equivalent in terms of the estimates of premature deaths from exposure to indoor air pollutants.

118
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:37,010
Among these deaths, kind of in terms of the distribution, about 12 percent due to pneumonia.

119
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,870
Thirty four percent from stroke. 26 percent from heart disease.

120
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:50,600
22 percent from COPD. And then six percent from lung cancers.

121
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:57,520
Continue going along with impacts on health, as I mentioned, the most vulnerable pregnant women,

122
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:04,750
young children, those that are immunosuppressed are living with some sort of chronic disease.

123
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:14,050
The elderly on the other end of the age spectrum life stage with regard to children.

124
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:22,510
Pneumonia is is a huge concern. Over half of all deaths from acute lower respiratory infections is from particulate matter.

125
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:27,610
It's inhaled from these solid fuel cooking emissions.

126
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:31,910
Asthma is another big concern in adults.

127
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:39,700
This is where the COPD also asthma but stroke, lung cancer, heart disease, cataracts, tuberculosis.

128
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,910
And then when we talk about women of childbearing age,

129
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:49,690
there are a lot of adverse birth outcomes associated with the mother's exposure during pregnancy.

130
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:59,220
So resulting in low birth weight in infants as well as stillbirth.

131
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,690
In terms of impacts on the community environment.

132
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,730
So a couple of images here that hopefully help illustrate the point.

133
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:18,240
But emissions from from fuel combustion in the home that aren't contained can easily affect nearby neighbors,

134
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,040
as well as those emissions actually reentering the home.

135
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:31,110
So, you know, combustion emissions from households in a tightly spaced community can actually make an important

136
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:39,980
contribution to the outdoor levels that people are exposed to just outside their home.

137
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:51,860
Kind of related to this solid fuel use in domestic settings, collecting fuel wood is a task that falls primarily to women.

138
00:17:51,860 --> 00:18:01,850
It can take up many hours each week and can subject them to other risks, including sexual violence.

139
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:15,290
Older children might help their parents collect the solid fuel, and this could be taking away time for further schooling.

140
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:28,670
In terms of impacts on on health, equity, on development and climate change, you know, without addressing this head on with some changes in policy,

141
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:34,820
the total number of people relying on solid fuels is really not going to change much over the coming decades.

142
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:44,900
And this, you know, we've talked about power plants, other other large, you know, automobiles, trucks, other sources of pollutants.

143
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:56,180
Just this, you know, this smaller scale household solid fuel use has a huge contribution on a couple of different scale.

144
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:01,670
The food fuel gathering itself consumes considerable time for the women and children.

145
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:05,630
We mentioned this the pollution, the black carbon.

146
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:14,480
These these soot particles, as well as the methane amended by inefficient stove combustion, are big contributors to climate change.

147
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,880
And then the lack of electricity that comes into play.

148
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:27,200
There's over a billion people, many of whom that then use kerosene lamps for lighting creates other health risks.

149
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,760
So things like burn injuries poisonings from fuel ingestion.

150
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:42,860
These are often the fuel stored in, you know, containers of convenience basically that aren't labeled and children get into them.

151
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:49,370
And as you mentioned, constraining other opportunities for health and development.

152
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:54,140
Shifting a little bit from low and middle income countries to higher income

153
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:59,540
countries and kind of the issues that reside around household air pollution.

154
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:06,630
So when a lot of rural areas, mountain areas and communities that experienced cold winters.

155
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:11,030
Wood is used as a primary source of heating.

156
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:23,710
And similarly, you know, older and poorer stoves are pretty common and can emit pollutants directly to the home again, because like these,

157
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:34,240
they're quite leaky or that they're not ventilated well and reentering the air can bring those emissions right back into the home.

158
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:42,250
And even with more modern wood burning stoves can still result in emissions that contribute to outdoor

159
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:49,300
levels of pollution that exceed guidelines and in terms of our economy and our quality standards.

160
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:59,680
And, you know, as fossil fuel prices for natural gas and whatever else electricity continue to go up, you know, people,

161
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,510
if it's if it's available and it's more cost effective or continuing to turn

162
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:13,850
to wood to eat as either a primary or as a supplemental source of heating.

163
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:20,130
I this I think I mentioned the CSO emissions from can be vented to the outside, can can reenter the home.

164
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:24,980
So here's kind of a poor ventilation and then again,

165
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:35,990
those emissions can contribute if you have enough of them collectively can contribute to actually exceedances of outdoor air quality standards.

166
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:41,780
It's especially important this is getting back to kind of meteorology and topography in areas

167
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,400
that are prone to having temperature inversions at those lowest levels of the atmosphere.

168
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,800
And then you add in some topography, right?

169
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:54,800
And you kind of see in the picture here, you know, a lot of emissions at the lower level along this community,

170
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,340
and they're not rising very much, as always, kind of hovering right there where everyone is is living.

171
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:08,330
You might remember this picture we looked at a couple of weeks ago when you're talking about outdoor air quality issues.

172
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:12,770
This again, is that that picture of Salt Lake City, you can actually see the city,

173
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:19,340
but looking from from one side of the valley across to the other side and the city is down below, right?

174
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:24,260
There's a temperature inversion in place with warmer air aloft and you can see where

175
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:29,930
it's capped and that pollution layer is all being held down close to the surface.

176
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:35,360
And this is a known thing. So in Utah,

177
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,630
it's recognized that burning wood or home heating is a huge contributor to larger

178
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:47,390
scale air quality issues and not meeting standards for protection of health.

179
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:50,990
And to the point that in how to grapple with this, you know,

180
00:22:50,990 --> 00:23:03,480
the state has considered bans on burning wood during the winter to help improve outdoor levels of air quality.

181
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:10,230
Interestingly, here in Michigan is apparently a leader in some of these,

182
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:17,970
so this is looking at two different tables related to wood woodstove emissions in terms of total,

183
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:26,600
the Michigan emissions Michigan ranks at the top and then an emissions per capita and still top 10.

184
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:34,830
So a lot here, just locally in Michigan in terms of woodstove emissions.

185
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:42,870
And then a summary while I'm doing green on time, a summary in terms of the household air pollution specifically,

186
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:51,930
we've got about three billion people that cook and heat their homes using biomass wood animals on crop waste.

187
00:23:51,930 --> 00:24:01,800
About four million people are dying prematurely each year to illnesses attributed to exposure to the indoor household air pollutants.

188
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:09,300
And this is roughly equivalent to the number that die prematurely each year from exposure to outdoor air pollutants.

189
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,980
More than 50 percent of the premature deaths among children under five are due to

190
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:20,760
pneumonia caused from the particulate matter inhaled in that household air pollution.

191
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:33,070
And I think that is there any question?

192
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:39,070
I ways to make the schools safer without getting them.

193
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:45,190
Great question. And this has been a huge focus over the last decade or so.

194
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:53,050
You might hear about, you know, improved cookstoves, you know, different types of more efficient approaches.

195
00:24:53,050 --> 00:25:09,820
There are technology wise, improved cooking and heating methods that have been developed and lots of projects to for intervention.

196
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:18,100
There's a huge logistical constraint in how to effectively implement distribution acceptance,

197
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:26,290
you know, based on different cultures, what they're used to, what sustainable use of them, right?

198
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:35,670
OK, I get a free one. But what happens when it breaks down? I don't know how to fix those types of opportunities that aren't available, so.

199
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:44,800
So yeah, it's really an implementation issue that that helps to address the indoor exposure to pollution issue,

200
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,080
which is, you know, kind of the focus of the article.

201
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:55,720
It it doesn't address nearly as much, just the total emissions write in the contributions to local outdoor air pollution,

202
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,730
you know, issues around climate change and so forth because of the study.

203
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:08,680
That's kind of looking at done in many areas where they are using unapproved stoves for mainly the man smoke a lot of cigarets.

204
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,830
I mean, I don't know if the the total emissions,

205
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:17,200
probably the total amount of smoke from like a cooking stove probably is greater than the cigarets, but on a cigarets of their own chemicals.

206
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,910
And I've done a fair bit of studies that have that together. I've looked at both.

207
00:26:20,910 --> 00:26:32,020
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And they the effects from an impact on health are not additive or synergistic.

208
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:35,320
So it's, you know, three to five times worse, you know,

209
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:45,280
impact on health if they're smoking in the home combined with air pollution, emission from from solid fuel use.

210
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,690
So yeah, it's a great question and it's a huge, huge problem.

211
00:26:50,690 --> 00:27:00,340
You know about this in terms of like the outdoor air pollution that you're talking about, how does that compare to fossil fuels?

212
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:06,130
Or I guess what is an alternative to solid fuels that would not be worth?

213
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,700
Yeah, yeah. So I don't know.

214
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:22,060
I mean, I guess if you look at high income countries that are not using solid fuels inside the home for the most part, right?

215
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:29,080
So I guess just being a local here in Michigan, apparently there's a huge population that's burning wood.

216
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:42,190
But if we if we look at that homes that aren't doing that, like there's electric sources of of heating and cooking, natural gas is is a fossil fuel.

217
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:46,180
It's not a solid fuel per se,

218
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:55,180
but it's relatively efficient and having resulting in low levels of pollution in the environment in order to heat a home.

219
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:07,410
So I mean, these are the these are what makes indoor households generally safer and having lower pollutant levels in high income countries.

220
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:13,150
It doesn't address again the impact on the outdoor environment,

221
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:22,830
whether it's actual pollutants that we inhale or related to greenhouse gases that contribute to the challenges around climate change.

222
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:28,170
So and I actually I don't want to go too far into the discussion because I know one of our debates

223
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:34,380
is around is kind of a geoengineering and different approaches around how do we address this?

224
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,820
And we talked about a little bit in the class period previously.

225
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:49,290
But yeah, that's what we get back to is, you know, renewable sources of energy sources and sinks, you know, with regard to climate and so forth.

226
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:55,710
And those are that's where we were. We're looking. And there, yeah, there's some technology that's that's promising.

227
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:03,660
But again, it kind of comes back to an implementation issue right on on a broad enough scale to actually have the impact.

228
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:12,120
Yeah, it's interesting because I feel like I've seen people push for more solid like biofuels as a sustainability measure, you know, tradeoffs?

229
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:18,300
Absolutely right. They kind of like we talked about the in our hierarchy of controls of exposure,

230
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:23,840
you know, exposure and elimination and then substitution are kind of at the top.

231
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,970
And OK, great. We might be able to substitute, but we better, better be radically analytical around.

232
00:29:29,970 --> 00:29:39,030
You know what? What are the impacts of what we're substituting? Really good question and not great answers, unfortunately.

233
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:47,100
Any other questions or comments? All right, let's see.

234
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:55,430
I'm going to do a technology test here, and as I'm doing this, I want invite.

235
00:29:55,430 --> 00:30:04,190
The first the probe group itself sharing to come out and get yourself organized.

236
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:12,760
Andrea, can you hear me? Go ahead and nominate yourself.

237
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:38,190
Hmm. So I think you're speaking, but I can't hear you. Uh, that's not good.

238
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:46,640
E.J., are you there? OK.

239
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,720
So I can't hear you yet, but let me mess around with some stuff here.

240
00:30:50,720 --> 00:31:10,710
So your audio? A system with Netflix HD that sounds really impressive.

241
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:16,310
Try one more time, Andrea, can you hear me? I can hear you there.

242
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:24,390
Yeah, yeah. Let me turn you down a little bit.

243
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:29,100
Go ahead. Do a testing one two three. Everyone asking one two three.

244
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:38,460
That sounds pretty good. All right. All right. OK. OK. So uh, before you get going, a couple of things that I know are a problem.

245
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:47,430
You'll need to share screen right through Zoom and order, heard Andrea to see what we're doing.

246
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:55,470
And and that's fine that once it's once it's going, the other one is you're going to probably log in to access a file.

247
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,880
I shared it with you, actually. And Google Slides. Yeah, to help Mexico.

248
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:06,930
So if not, I mean, you log in to get it that I think you can, but I'm already logged into everything,

249
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:12,470
so I decided to volunteer an incognito window or something like that.

250
00:32:12,470 --> 00:32:16,530
I'm logged in to canvas and logged into Zoom. I'm logged into the computer.

251
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,540
We share it with you. So it should've been sent to your email.

252
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:52,160
So if you go to that blog is typically OK, we can make fun of regret when I tried having embarrassing email waiting for me.

253
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:58,500
Okay. But if you think you guys are good.

254
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:05,930
Oh, yeah, so we just have to share to share screen, to Zoom. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

255
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:23,850
And just to remind you guys, this is where the microphone is. So as you're wandering, don't wander too far.

256
00:33:23,850 --> 00:33:35,470
Oh, no. That doesn't. They're trying to see if we could get you, your know.

257
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:42,040
These are the notes, but you guys going to see the calendar, huh?

258
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:52,040
Good pull up on someone's laptop. Yeah, you know, I figured we'd have to transport it to get a second.

259
00:33:52,040 --> 00:34:09,200
Yeah, right. That if you can't describe as a little bit better.

260
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:22,890
I don't maybe if you put this on on this, you might not think. Obviously better.

261
00:34:22,890 --> 00:34:35,910
The beginning. All right.

262
00:34:35,910 --> 00:34:36,870
All right.

263
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:44,880
So we are the first group on the question of should urban farming be permitted in heavily industrialized, industrialized cities like Detroit?

264
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:51,450
And Answers Yes, it should be, and especially in places like Detroit, because it promotes health,

265
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:59,900
develops the local economy and increases food security while managing potential health impacts from exposure.

266
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:07,730
Backups, so Detroit offers a unique opportunity for urban farming to be used as a tool to meet the needs of residents,

267
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:12,740
according to the 2020 Census, the poverty rate in Detroit is approximately 35 percent,

268
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:20,780
and about 34 percent of residents lack access to a vehicle relying on the bussing system or other forms of transportation, such as walking and biking.

269
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:27,500
This is significant considering that mode of transportation to strictly changes the level of spatial accessibility to food,

270
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,330
and many people do not shop at the food retailers closest to them.

271
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:40,580
The decline in Detroit's population from its peak of one point eighty five million to approximately 670000 in 2019

272
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:49,460
means that Detroit has both the land capacity for urban agriculture and a demand for equity regarding food access.

273
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:58,700
So the main concern regarding urban farming in industrialized cities is exposed to from sources such as waste incineration,

274
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,730
fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes.

275
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:09,200
As surface soil in urban areas is a significant sink and reservoir for anthropogenic pollutants like heavy metals.

276
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:19,400
The main concern is ingestion of the soil and inhalation of dust contaminated with agents such as LED during contact while gardening or playing,

277
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:33,530
or through eating the garden vegetables. Several studies have already demonstrated the beneficial effects of urban farming on human health

278
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:40,940
and suggested the kind of thing is that availability of green space promotes physical activity,

279
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:47,690
reducing obesity and improving cardiovascular health, as well as improving mental health.

280
00:36:47,690 --> 00:37:00,770
And so some investigators suggest that this mechanism may be particularly important for buffering the impact of stress on urban residents.

281
00:37:00,770 --> 00:37:11,350
So the first health benefits of urban farming is increasing nutrition the takes a study found that adults with household member

282
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:20,840
who participated in a community garden consumed more fruits and vegetables on average than those who did not participate,

283
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:32,840
and they were 3.5 times more likely to consume fruits and vegetables at least five times a year.

284
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:40,730
And the second health benefit of urban farming is lowering BMI and lowering risk of obesity.

285
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:52,160
A study shows that both women and men community gardeners had significantly lower BMI and lower odds of being overweight or obese.

286
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,820
Then did their otherwise similar neighbors were not in the community gardening program.

287
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:10,200
So here the table shows that women community gardeners were four to five percent less likely to be overweight or obese.

288
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,640
And the third health benefit of urban farming is improving mental health community.

289
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:26,460
Community gardeners reported a better perceived mental health and social cohesion, according to a study done by Hawkins.

290
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:33,840
A community garden over 50 years old reported lower levels of lower levels of

291
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:39,190
perceived stress than participants of other outdoor and indoor activity groups.

292
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:50,610
So this scientific evidence supports the aforementioned mechanism that bring the use of or access to green space

293
00:38:50,610 --> 00:38:59,730
plays a role in promoting emotional recovery and reducing the influence of stressors on concentration and anxiety,

294
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:07,260
or move or move in urban settings. These are away from the health perspective.

295
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:16,340
We should permit and encourage urban farming in cities like Detroit.

296
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:21,050
Another benefit, another benefit of urban farming. Can you guys hear me OK?

297
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:26,640
Is that is that it promote economic development, so area.

298
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:34,220
So areas like the in an urban area and often have food security.

299
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:40,580
Food insecurity Food insecurity is defined as a lack of access to access to food for an active, healthy life.

300
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,570
Thirty nine percent thirty nine percent of which right families referred to as if you were 19

301
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:50,990
and one in eight and one in eight of these were estimated to be part insecure and twenty twenty.

302
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:59,810
Urban farming Urban farming has the potential to reduce very inviting by providing nutritious and often offsetting your expenditures.

303
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:10,660
Food insecure families. Urban farming, urban farming also has to create drought, create jobs, urban farm, urban farms and a lot of have a lot of it.

304
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:20,230
And so they are growing in half the states that needs management, management and regulation programs to produce produce and produce sales.

305
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:28,270
As far as initial funding started in the lives, there's a lot of grants and by nature that are available available to do that.

306
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:33,550
Recently, I recently saw an urban farm that grow think they grow.

307
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:42,220
AP They were able to secure a few hundred thousand in real life and raise value for their farm,

308
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:46,120
so the money for the money is out there and also urban farm.

309
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:52,810
The last allows gradually the job. Really, cultivation motivation was really important areas.

310
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:58,180
A recent study in the UK and I found that I do think diagnosing gardening.

311
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:11,920
The main takeaway from the job related skills of thinking. And urban farming also provides overall benefits where money, where money is saved,

312
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:23,460
and that means that money programs elsewhere in the community and a community and then put it down a farmers market provide gardening for the nation.

313
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:28,170
Payroll and provide provide an important entrepreneurial experience.

314
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,670
So actually, no, actually.

315
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:43,080
Any study has shown that urban farming and the business of the mind promoted no additional magnificent sanitation and the creation of them.

316
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:49,650
They also they also promote land renewal and renewal and improve their home studies and studies proven

317
00:41:49,650 --> 00:42:02,100
that proven that the the existing community garden is really great property value for 9.4 percent.

318
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,800
So there are actually many ways to remediate soil.

319
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:12,450
Besides the obvious, just removing contaminated soil and shifting soil, which is a rather disruptive and expensive process.

320
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:17,790
So you can encapsulate the soil using like physical barriers, which sad.

321
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:24,690
This allows soil to be treated in place and typically involves the placement of clean soil over contaminated soil,

322
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:30,900
which has been done in many places such as New Orleans. And this prevents exposure before it can occur and makes it a lot more safer.

323
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:35,370
But there's also another option to do soil amendments, which is to add matter to the soil.

324
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:42,720
That either reduces the concentration of pollutants, particularly the heavy metals or and the whatever you add down to the metal,

325
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,800
which makes it less bio available, so it's less likely to be up to other plants.

326
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,770
And for example, depending on the type of exposure that you're anticipating or you've tested before,

327
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:58,320
you can add solid dust, compost or other methods rely on phosphorus.

328
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:02,010
It really depends on having specific knowledge about what contaminants is there.

329
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:05,610
However, there are many ways to make it safer process.

330
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:13,500
However, there are also many non-conventional farming practices that kind of you don't have to use any local soil whatsoever,

331
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:20,880
and it avoids any kind of concern about local soil contamination. For example, there's vertical farming, hydroponics and aquaponics.

332
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,950
Vertical farming can basically just a greenhouse or a hydroponic system that's stacked up on top of each other.

333
00:43:25,950 --> 00:43:29,910
Shallots are much greater density and production of plants. It's much more efficient.

334
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:33,330
Then there's also hydroponics, which is basically like a greenhouse,

335
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:42,690
but you use water as a medium and use different kind of nutrients to nourish the plant through the water instead of using conventional soil.

336
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:45,660
Then there's also aquaponics, which is kind of a tiered system,

337
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:52,320
which I have a picture of it in the bottom right hand corner and so basically have a hydroponic setup and any kind of excess nutrients or

338
00:43:52,320 --> 00:44:01,800
runoff that is not utilized by the plants runs to basically a fish aquarium that you can then raise fish on as a nice side process and so on.

339
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:05,370
All of these are not conventional farming practices when done in an urban setting,

340
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:11,130
so that's going to reduce food miles and have a shorter supply chain. And this is very beneficial for many reasons.

341
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:19,140
One, and we kind of see it, how COVID has super disrupted many supply chains and you grow food in your local city, you don't ship as near as far.

342
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:23,250
But on supply chains have high environmental and health costs stemming from extensive

343
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:27,960
use of fossil fuels typically and every step of the way from industrial production,

344
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:34,500
processing and packaging and transportation. All this creates environmental exposures and potential harm to people.

345
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:38,730
And so by able to do this in an urban setting, you remove much of those exposures.

346
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:43,200
And so vertical farming in particular has much higher productivity.

347
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:47,700
As your shorter growing times, it is significantly less water and as a lower carbon footprint.

348
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:52,620
You can also grow year-round, which is very nice. And so there's also greater food safety.

349
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:58,920
A study by the Swami, a 2011 show that actually indoor farms, particularly vertical farms,

350
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:04,770
are much safer than industrial and conventional farming practices because it's a sealed system.

351
00:45:04,770 --> 00:45:10,290
You can actually even make them possibly pressured so that outside air contaminants and pests can't come inside.

352
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:16,020
And so you actually do not have to use nearly as many pesticides herbicides if you ever use them at all.

353
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,800
And so this eliminates many other exposures in our food that we're concerned about.

354
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:24,300
And so on. We know vertical farming and urban farming.

355
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:31,080
It doesn't necessarily need to be 100 percent perfect, but I would argue it's a much better system than our currently industrial farming practices.

356
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,230
We've through a class, we've gone through many different kind of concerns,

357
00:45:34,230 --> 00:45:40,980
such as each vacation and hypoxic zones in the ocean that are from all this excess future runoff.

358
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,280
In addition to harmful Abdellah balloons, even in the Great Lakes.

359
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:49,290
Immediate impact, local water quality and there's no commercial farm practices done in urban setting.

360
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:58,170
You eliminate all that, and people have actually been regulating and conducting urban farming in Detroit for many years.

361
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:02,160
And so in 2013, thanks to a push by urban farmers,

362
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:09,000
the city Detroit passed an urban agriculture ordinance and codified a way for urban farms to develop safely and effectively by the city.

363
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:16,140
And so they include provisions for testing and soil and mitigating potential environmental problems such as runoff and fertilizers.

364
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:22,080
And it's not just a free for all. It prohibits farm animals and plant species from being grown in the city.

365
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:26,460
You can't have a pig farm, you can't grow. An acre of deadly nightshade is pretty common.

366
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,210
Sense and purpose can be sold on site or sold to different markets.

367
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:36,180
I believe several farms have actually been selling to Whole Foods in Detroit, which is really awesome.

368
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:41,370
And ultimately urban farming will continue in Detroit at some level, even if it is bad.

369
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:48,630
Because before this ordinance existed, there was already urban farming and so abandoned it would just make it less safe and more harmful to residents.

370
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:54,900
And lastly, I don't think the question should be should our urban farming be permitted, it will happen regardless of its legality.

371
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,460
I think the question should better be can urban farming be conducted safely and outside?

372
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:06,830
Yes, and it can be encouraged. There are many benefits to reforming regarding health, economic, community and environmental benefits.

373
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:11,150
And I think urban residents deserve the right to grow their own food as much as anyone else.

374
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:17,510
And I think that concludes our presentation. Thanks very much.

375
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:30,290
Yeah. And I'm going to go ahead and invite group number two, otherwise known as the Vegas group, to come and offer your counterpoint.

376
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:39,600
Thank you. You know, we want our laptop to show me to you, Andrea.

377
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:44,120
Oh, she remembered it was her device, her tweets or so.

378
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:51,680
Oh yeah. Thanks, David. Yes, thank you.

379
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:56,690
You know, I also had my email to you. OK, so I up.

380
00:47:56,690 --> 00:48:11,780
Yeah, it was this morning and that weren't very good at.

381
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:20,160
Yes, it is. Yeah, you just click on that going on it, bring it up.

382
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:35,330
All right, I think so just yet. Here's you and then you're go to your notes, if you can figure out.

383
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:42,370
There's a major program with a sure to give you.

384
00:48:42,370 --> 00:49:02,550
Some of you might be able to. You can't.

385
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:09,620
Not good. OK. Other material around it don't look like.

386
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:28,450
Most of us, I guess. And then. OK, so Melissa and Sam Morgan, we're going to be balancing out this argument, talking about some of the calls.

387
00:49:28,450 --> 00:49:32,130
So first of all, let's just make sure we're on the same page.

388
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:38,350
We're talking about here. Urban farming is producing food items in urban or in urban adjacent area,

389
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:45,670
so that can include animal products, plant products, insect protein sources as well.

390
00:49:45,670 --> 00:49:50,320
And it can also be land, water, land and water dwelling creatures.

391
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:58,960
So fish, marine, all that type of thing can be done on an urban setting, and this can be in a big city or small city.

392
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,580
Personal property, basically anywhere that you're thinking is not rural.

393
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:09,490
So some examples backyard gardens, I think what we all think of first and then there's something for practical gardening,

394
00:50:09,490 --> 00:50:16,450
which is where you take a space that was used for different purpose and is no longer being used and you convert it into a garden.

395
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:19,600
So this example is actually a dumpster.

396
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:30,790
And then looking for an example close to home, this is a community garden in Detroit, which I say, you know, and then, oops.

397
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,640
So this one, I thought, was really cool a street landscaping,

398
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,590
and you're putting basically like fruit trees on the sides of shade for anybody walking by then.

399
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:43,780
OK, your piece and you read forest gardening is also something I've not heard about previously.

400
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,540
That's basically what you're doing every level with food.

401
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:53,380
So down inside the dirt, you've got root vegetables, then maybe mushrooms on the surface, shrubs,

402
00:50:53,380 --> 00:51:01,870
trees up and up to get it all the way up to the canopy and then traditional greenhouses rooftop garden green walls,

403
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:07,870
which can be commercial or residential and vertical farms.

404
00:51:07,870 --> 00:51:14,380
A lot of this going on specifically. I found out in Thailand for some reason, but they're really interesting.

405
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,880
And then animal husbandry keeping animals in the city,

406
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:25,930
aquaponics and all aquaculture difference being aquaponics is one of the soil mediums and aquaculture plants,

407
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:29,380
and aquaculture is when you're going after, like marine food sources.

408
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:38,170
So fish, shrimp, things like that. And then urban beekeeping is also a source of urban farming.

409
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:42,520
OK, so there's a lot of legal issues that happen with urban farming,

410
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:47,500
the main one being zoning and different requirements for different spots in the city.

411
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:52,960
I read an article about this one area where they found land on the other side of town and do what they

412
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:59,230
want with it because they can find the things that they wanted because of all the legal requirements.

413
00:51:59,230 --> 00:52:05,150
This can lead to court battles between the city and the farmers, or even the farmers and their neighborhood farmers.

414
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:11,680
The specific types of farming that Melissa just mentioned how different types of policies with each of those farming

415
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:19,750
standards because there's not a big standard for every single type of farming that just doesn't go across the board.

416
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:20,980
So we have the Michigan right,

417
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:32,440
the farmer that was that became in 1981 because of responsive complaints from the city lawyers that were competing against certain farming.

418
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:40,630
And it addresses a lot of the environmental nuisances that happen, but it doesn't solve all the problems.

419
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:52,090
And then the last thing is the Heartsong property, as you see on this graphic, and this is where density of city owned property in Detroit in 2009.

420
00:52:52,090 --> 00:53:00,970
And because of this right, a sink shrinking city that have a lot of city owned property that can be hard to own.

421
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:06,790
On a personal level, which it's nice for urban farming to come in and use our land,

422
00:53:06,790 --> 00:53:15,340
but they have to go through certain requirements to actually own property so that they can actually farm.

423
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:19,090
OK. And then also, the water zoning is a big issue,

424
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:30,040
and some areas in certain cities have water shortages that cause for other types of water to be used that can increase the environmental damage.

425
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:36,550
This estimate of the price for water is actually in the southern half of the USA,

426
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:44,800
but it just estimates like how much of the cost is actually through a city water because when you hook up the city water,

427
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,000
it costs more than if you get it from the country or from other sources.

428
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:57,430
So that can be an issue for people who actually live in the city and don't have the ability to have water transported to their location.

429
00:53:57,430 --> 00:54:06,460
And the water management technologies really come into play because of the issues of city costs have a whole bunch of other policies that are for it,

430
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:11,140
which have different issues and different court issues as well.

431
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:18,730
And then the last thing is that the different seasons have different amounts of water, so you have to accommodate for that.

432
00:54:18,730 --> 00:54:30,690
And the issue is water shortages may be more prevalent in certain seasons and cause more trouble than.

433
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:38,190
So I'm here to talk about the environmental impacts on urban farming, especially energy and water.

434
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:43,230
So a major problem today is global warming and climate change,

435
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:49,380
and so we believe that urban farming would help to combat these issues, but we actually found the contrary.

436
00:54:49,380 --> 00:55:00,810
So greenhouse gases are a major cause of global warming, and we can see that 29 percent of it is caused by it's caused by transportation.

437
00:55:00,810 --> 00:55:05,580
They gave the tainted by reduced transportation from farming are overwhelmed

438
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:11,940
by the implications of greenhouse gases produced by urban food production.

439
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:18,660
According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, inappropriate excessive use of agricultural input from pesticides,

440
00:55:18,660 --> 00:55:25,110
fertilizer, nitrogen evaporating matter can pull in soil in an urban area.

441
00:55:25,110 --> 00:55:37,320
In this graph, we can clearly see that urban areas cause non-contact collision that goes into surface water that also goes to wastewater treatment.

442
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:45,450
Plants that are not capable of processing nutrient pollution and major pollution

443
00:55:45,450 --> 00:55:51,060
is caused by increase in nitrogen and phosphorus that enter into water sources.

444
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:57,240
Exposure to toxins produced can cause harmful effects such as liver, kidney damage,

445
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:03,900
liver and kidney damage, skin rashes, regulatory problems and there are logical issues.

446
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:13,800
Urban agriculture can cause water shortages, drought, especially in densely populated places such as major cities.

447
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:20,610
Here we can see that in comparison to traditional farming, greenhouses and vertical farms tend to have a lower energy demand,

448
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:30,840
but the very high and very low water demand, but a very high energy demand per kilogram of produce.

449
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:38,020
Then every time is needed to create a controlled environment for urban farms, have a higher magnitude than field goal crops.

450
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:45,820
Controlled environment farms have very high energy inputs for lighting, temperature, humidity control and high labor demand.

451
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,850
Here you can see some of the energy benefits and energy costs.

452
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:56,200
It's clear to see that there are a lot more energy costs than energy benefits for today's items, such as tomatoes.

453
00:56:56,200 --> 00:57:03,820
A study found that the cumulative lifecycle of energy inputs of tomatoes produce greenhouse preparers in a greenhouse,

454
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,480
or 30 percent greater than open field production.

455
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:14,110
OK, our last argument for why urban farming can be an issue is the of gentrification in these urban areas.

456
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:23,380
So gentrification is defined as the transformation of environments or community from a low income housing into a high income housing area.

457
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:29,320
This can be caused by lots of different things, such as rapid job growth, lack of housing, traffic congestion and public sectors.

458
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:35,110
Policies are changing, but the biggest contribution to gentrification now is called green gentrification,

459
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:37,330
where it's either the placement of a green space or,

460
00:57:37,330 --> 00:57:46,570
in our case, urban farms that raise the land value around that community to areas that can no longer affordable for the community.

461
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:49,600
So these are different issues that come with gentrification.

462
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:55,480
The main thing is it's the displacement of primarily minority groups that were living in those areas,

463
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:03,130
and now it's living in the area that they can no longer afford. This can also lead into limited access to affordable housing situations,

464
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:08,800
transportation choices of quality of schools and other social networks being expanded out.

465
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:17,950
Since people are forced to leave. Some other issues that come with green gentrification as food insecurity is so common thought is that

466
00:58:17,950 --> 00:58:23,440
the you put an urban farm or community farm in that area and like the food insecurities are solved.

467
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:28,750
But when you have massive urban farming and communities a lot of time,

468
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:33,040
a university and University of Kentucky show that most of the time that when those are put in,

469
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:40,900
they're actually selling those produce to to grocery stores, high end restaurants so that through their growing never even touches the community.

470
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:48,770
And where it's growing, those people won't ever be able to afford it. So a lot of common health issues come in with it.

471
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:52,090
From there just being increased stress, increased stress,

472
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:58,930
violent injuries and a lot of deeper issues since people are now being forced to leave their their community and stuff.

473
00:58:58,930 --> 00:59:03,830
And there's also a lot of social and environmental justice issues that come in with green justification.

474
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:10,760
I wanted to show you this one example of a thank you. So I had to do it on a laptop.

475
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,650
So I want to show you this one example of green certification in Detroit.

476
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:21,670
It was 2005 in this urban fabric came in and put in this community farm Typekit doing all this good stuff for the community.

477
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:30,190
But when over time, when the community was gentrified, that community farm was later bulldozed and luxury apartments were put on top of it?

478
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:38,720
So he was doing right by he, and in the end, the community was never able to fully have it or support it since it was removed.

479
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,210
So wealthier people come and thank you for inclusion.

480
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:47,200
We talked about how legal issues make urban farming harder to do.

481
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:50,500
Energy and water usage is increase in that area.

482
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:57,890
And finally, urban farming can cause gentrification, so maybe urban farming may not be all good, after all.

483
00:59:57,890 --> 01:00:09,300
Thank you. All right, thanks very much. You know, our discussion.

484
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:17,250
So I'm going to I'll invite the Pro Group to maybe step outside this door and with apologies to Andrea,

485
01:00:17,250 --> 01:00:22,530
I'm not really sure how else to manage that unless you want to stand in line over the microphone and have it.

486
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:29,760
I guess I can stop recording your your choice and then you get your data out of

487
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:34,950
here and I'll give you about two minutes to kind of come up with your rebuttal.

488
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:41,190
And then when we come back in the program, we'll have two minutes and then you guys will have two minutes.

489
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:50,210
All right. On your mark, get set. Go. Of every color outside or something.

490
01:00:50,210 --> 01:01:09,430
Yeah, definitely. Very excited you left me a lot little.

491
01:01:09,430 --> 01:01:15,780
I got a caution for a kind of a cavalier gauge of when you think those papers will be printed.

492
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:20,770
Yeah, hopefully tomorrow. Okay. With my apologies. No worries.

493
01:01:20,770 --> 01:01:25,010
I'm uh, it's my excuse.

494
01:01:25,010 --> 01:01:32,470
But with that little bit of extension and there are actually other people had other issues and so it was extended beyond that.

495
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:41,870
I totally lost my window. And I am honestly struggling a little bit like everyone else at the end of the semester grants to keep up with everything,

496
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:48,730
but I'm really hoping to have them done tomorrow. Oh, they're looking so far.

497
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:56,410
Good, you guys. I mean, overall in the class, you guys are doing a great job.

498
01:01:56,410 --> 01:02:01,730
Computer to see if I can get the person to no time.

499
01:02:01,730 --> 01:02:11,690
You're welcome to try with every line. And you probably got about 60 seconds left, but yeah, if you want to be dealing with it, not.

500
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:16,760
Yeah, that's what I was just going to try like extending the screen when you're done even on a pretty quick trip like this.

501
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:25,460
But as we're going through our rebuttal, I thought I saw only about one hundred and different room length presenter model and I gave instructions,

502
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:33,710
but I didn't like I didn't need it, so I didn't pay attention to what it said.

503
01:02:33,710 --> 01:19:41,817
Oh, here! And so say if to extend.

504
01:02:47,290 --> 01:03:02,760
What I there's also a double challenge of the electors being recorded and capturing the screening this electorate is of this group, I believe.

505
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:10,550
And you can choose, I think when you do it, when you're sharing your story, when you present that you can choose what to do.

506
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:16,870
So this string just doesn't change. And then like, I don't know how they got that sucker suddenly, who's pulled over?

507
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:20,500
Yeah, okay. It's good to know.

508
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:24,910
Do you want me to change it back? I think so. I think so.

509
01:03:24,910 --> 01:19:41,817
Change back to back. And yet there's just like and this is how we communicate with sorry.

510
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:54,940
I think think it would be nice to know just what is there to accommodate Andrea, who wasn't able to enjoy it in person today.

511
01:03:54,940 --> 01:04:02,120
So next week, on Tuesday, we should be Zoom free and just also recorded in Panopto.

512
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:12,090
But you won't have that challenge. I mean, does that mean a warning or a 20 second warning guy?

513
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:26,150
They. 1:00 in the morning.

514
01:04:26,150 --> 01:05:16,760
OK, you. I got to go first.

515
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:48,220
All right. Might even be OK to shoot.

516
01:05:48,220 --> 01:06:01,260
And whenever you guys are in A. Can you hear us?

517
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:22,010
Hey, Andrew, I think you're muted, I'm not sure if it's not like you can hear us. Go.

518
01:06:22,010 --> 01:06:38,820
We're not needed. Is there an option to unmetered?

519
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:43,410
And he said, no, I'm sorry, I didn't have my volume, OK?

520
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:50,430
First of all, to make sure you could hear. Yes, yes or no, just get going every radio.

521
01:06:50,430 --> 01:06:56,010
All right. We think the group made some pretty valid points. Obviously, there's always things that can be improved.

522
01:06:56,010 --> 01:07:03,300
However, regarding legal issues, the aspects of zoning can always be changed was are manmade concepts,

523
01:07:03,300 --> 01:07:09,720
and it's not really inherent to urban farming in of itself. And in regards to enter uses boundaries,

524
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:16,020
I'm not really sure getting produce in Singapore is really all that more energy efficient than just growing it here,

525
01:07:16,020 --> 01:07:21,870
even if there is a slight 13 percent increase in energy cost. And especially to,

526
01:07:21,870 --> 01:07:27,480
I think there's definitely issues environmental justice when we're kind of off sourcing our pollution and all those other kind of issues.

527
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:32,130
Don't the countries have less regulation? And I think it has something to say regarding community benefits.

528
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:37,890
Yeah, I think too, like a lot of, there's a couple of big urban gardens within Detroit, and they're very community based,

529
01:07:37,890 --> 01:07:43,110
and they also have programs for community gardeners and unnecessarily like a massive garden,

530
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:50,160
but for like something in your backyard where they can help you kind of restart and maintain it over the course of the year.

531
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:55,590
Yeah. And also regard to gentrification. Many of these urban farms are much more community driven, grassroots,

532
01:07:55,590 --> 01:08:04,500
organized as we started and now I've heard of like Monsanto setting up shop in like Backyard of Detroit to like kind of push people off in early.

533
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:08,820
Detroit has a significant vacant property problem, which could be leveraged with more green space debris.

534
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:15,200
Everybody, which I think is a huge element of addressing many environmental issues in the city of Detroit.

535
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:29,240
All right, great job, thank you. We'll go ahead and invite the very last minutes.

536
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:36,890
All right. Your group had a lot of good points in the hard rebuttal, something such as urban farming.

537
01:08:36,890 --> 01:08:43,910
So our main argument to issues with urban farming is the gentrification and when it is not done quite correctly.

538
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:46,760
So a lot of argument was of if for the environmental issues,

539
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:51,650
if the solid contaminants are held in the soil there and not being able to reach out to the community.

540
01:08:51,650 --> 01:08:57,020
So when we have industrial for urban farming within there for like large community centers and stuff,

541
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:05,450
if it is not done correctly, then all those contaminants can come into the community where people are exposed to and so forth.

542
01:09:05,450 --> 01:09:10,520
And then for the community aspect, it's more along the lines of just having that.

543
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:13,190
And then you can look at it like Kerry Town here in Ann Arbor,

544
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:21,560
where we have that farmer's market there and a lot of higher end apartments in that area where we're able to see where people can live in there.

545
01:09:21,560 --> 01:09:29,840
So when we have this, that quick, easy access, that there is consequences that are driven further on over time for gentrification

546
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:39,950
and issues with that as of yet also in terms of an entire stake in this at higher,

547
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:44,300
yeah, I can see why and saying perhaps can only be grown in certain areas.

548
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:50,390
So we're going to see friends across that I grew up with within the area and I will also be going it.

549
01:09:50,390 --> 01:09:55,310
The other thing we wanted to mention a little bit on the cynical side, but it kind of does.

550
01:09:55,310 --> 01:10:02,630
Everything boils down to money in the end. And so if someone has an opportunity to allow the crops to go to the community and feed people for

551
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:08,690
free as opposed to selling them to your local Whole Foods or your upscale restaurant upstate,

552
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:12,740
a lot of times they're going to take the profit, even though we wish they wouldn't.

553
01:10:12,740 --> 01:10:18,320
So that's just something to keep in mind as well. All right, great.

554
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:24,560
Thanks very, very much to both groups. All right, great.

555
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:30,050
You guys get settled. We have a few minutes for a little bit of discussion.

556
01:10:30,050 --> 01:10:40,280
So first off, setting aside what you think about this issue with this strong argument and supportive arguments.

557
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:55,060
Who thinks that group number one, the Pro Group, warned that a lot of people and then who thinks that no table in the debate?

558
01:10:55,060 --> 01:11:00,080
Yeah. All right. All right. OK, now let's go to the topic.

559
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:12,900
Uh, who is in favor of urban farming again and who is against urban farming?

560
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:17,360
You know, like, wow, that's a consensus opinion.

561
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:24,380
All right. So now we've got we've got a few minutes of time for this, for some discussion around the issue.

562
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:28,070
I would say we're going to open up to different questions.

563
01:11:28,070 --> 01:11:35,120
They don't need to be directed at anybody in particular, um, and inviting, you know, their group presenters as well.

564
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:40,580
My question is, do people have around this based on what you presented it or based on what you know about it?

565
01:11:40,580 --> 01:11:47,780
I mean, previously. I just want to say to the other group,

566
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:54,830
I think you guys definitely had the trickier problems just because like obviously, there's been no topics perfect.

567
01:11:54,830 --> 01:11:59,960
I think there's definitely ways to at least mitigate most of the harms of urban farming.

568
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:02,210
So it's like it's nothing's perfect.

569
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:09,170
But yeah, so it was really hard to find arguments against Urban Farm because everything's like we every city needs to do it.

570
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:15,800
It's so good for the city and was like, Where's that one? Or even that's kind of all right.

571
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:20,030
I do think that there's something to like the gentrification because like,

572
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:26,280
I could even see it because I lived in Chicago last year and with the pandemic, everyone was like, Oh yeah, let's get into gardening.

573
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:30,320
It's like the first season was fine. But then, like the second farming season came around,

574
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:35,630
like it was harder to find thought the community garden and a lot of times you have to pay for them.

575
01:12:35,630 --> 01:12:42,440
So it's kind of like I live in a co-op, so we wanted a plot and a community garden, but that like,

576
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:47,930
we couldn't get one because we didn't have the money to buy one, you know, so there's something to that.

577
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:52,460
It's probably like more of a problem. We've been like just this year and next year.

578
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:56,750
Yeah, I was reading a couple of articles and a lot of it, just urban farmers that have blogs and stuff.

579
01:12:56,750 --> 01:13:02,150
And I just always question stuff like, Damn, I causing this issue of gentrification in theory, like, am I doing it correctly?

580
01:13:02,150 --> 01:13:09,410
Because they would? That's always a deep fear of theirs is when they saw more and more wealthy people move into areas like Am I causing this?

581
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:17,130
So it's with all the good sides is always a bad side to it, you.

582
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:25,100
Yes, I need to know. You know, you ever present day, and with regard to that, it they bring an extra day and a day, right?

583
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:35,330
I mean, on really like, you're kind of this investment, it's, you know, ready to benefit union members and really it's it's harming them in the end.

584
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:40,710
All right. I have a couple of questions to throw out and this is probably anyway.

585
01:13:40,710 --> 01:13:48,420
Um, so how much can actually be produced, you know, an urban car?

586
01:13:48,420 --> 01:13:52,800
Let me talking to a small population and then I go through to Detroit as an example.

587
01:13:52,800 --> 01:14:01,200
I think if somebody listed like six hundred twenty five thousand or something of a population, I mean, what's the capacity it's done?

588
01:14:01,200 --> 01:14:08,790
Well, should it be people I've seen on in my undergrad do some presentations on vertical farming too.

589
01:14:08,790 --> 01:14:17,100
And so like the kind of problem or comes into areas like the hobbyist gardeners, like they're not going to feed a city like that.

590
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:21,750
I mean, like at least they're not in terms of per work and like output.

591
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:25,110
They're not super efficient even compared to industrial farming stuff,

592
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:29,580
because those are experts and they know exactly what they're doing and have consistent yields.

593
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:36,390
But to actually like feed a city, you need to have large vertical farm operations.

594
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:39,940
And I remember seeing like on something like Oreo and so on,

595
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:46,020
you can do it with like I remember seeing figures of like rooftop gardening and like

596
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:50,760
vertical farms to feed you and like this weight loss plots of land than you would think.

597
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:57,270
But it would be like acres and acres of vertical farms, which is way more efficient than life,

598
01:14:57,270 --> 01:15:02,970
but massive hundreds of square miles of farming that we use right now.

599
01:15:02,970 --> 01:15:07,140
But the issue of any kind of diet that goes into people I think I remember seeing like it

600
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:11,180
depends on your income for the city of Detroit and where you're getting it grows right now.

601
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:15,840
Ever since then, I have like some of my higher income strata and people who live in Detroit,

602
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:19,920
they get maybe 20 percent of their vegetables from local sources.

603
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,510
However, that kind of gets to issues of equity where I'm not really sure the with the

604
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:28,800
average price of a lot of that locally grown vegetables as compared to Kroger.

605
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:37,170
And like a lot of people who already have issues with food access, they probably it's not produced at the scale that they can easily go get that.

606
01:15:37,170 --> 01:15:44,090
So I think that's kind of a multifaceted issue. When I come out of three.

607
01:15:44,090 --> 01:15:50,820
It was kind of. So didn't want to say that, but that was one of the very big issues.

608
01:15:50,820 --> 01:15:57,360
How is it actually going to impact the population in terms of how?

609
01:15:57,360 --> 01:16:05,580
And they were postulating that it would not be enough to sustain the population even when a smaller city.

610
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:14,390
But again, I think a lot of time. So I just I did Google that I read the article, but just quickly,

611
01:16:14,390 --> 01:16:20,000
Googling says 15 percent of the world's food is now grown in urban areas, so that's quite a bit.

612
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:23,540
You know how accurate it is, but yeah, yeah,

613
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:32,540
I think it's not necessarily an either or we're probably not going to grow an entire city to produce it in urban farms.

614
01:16:32,540 --> 01:16:38,060
But if you can reduce anything by electronic 15 percent, that's still.

615
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:44,540
There's no evidence to that. And a lot of them a lot of ways to see it brought up to this kind of in response to their climate change,

616
01:16:44,540 --> 01:16:51,080
degrading soil or like productivity in certain areas, but also like on the Ogallala aquifer,

617
01:16:51,080 --> 01:16:54,320
which I think is like Colorado, like on where a lot of our farming is,

618
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:59,850
it's like drying up and like a lot of like the it almost all the vertical farming subsidies.

619
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:05,840
And what's wrong with future ecology in the sense of like, we could easily do this if we wanted a bit of investment,

620
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:17,010
but it wouldn't be kind of like mom and pop community garden kind of stuff, which is like a very different issue than what you're.

621
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:23,060
We have one more question I want to throw out. We have about one minute left.

622
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:31,460
So in terms of, you know, we talk about environmental failures right in the past and perhaps, you know, urban planning.

623
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:35,600
I mean, you see, this is feasible.

624
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:42,500
What about a city like Detroit that has, you know, 400 years of industrial pollution to get the oil?

625
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:47,690
I mean, how big of a challenge is that to the urban farming?

626
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:53,790
Is it really? Is it just, you know, the years of convenience and, you know, vertical farming?

627
01:17:53,790 --> 01:18:00,330
You can't use the fourth or fifth time.

628
01:18:00,330 --> 01:18:08,110
In addition to that, also think that any building the NBA Finals will also cause more pollution investigations within the city.

629
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:20,060
You're kind of like compounding the problem. The Labor Party, on the other hand, sitting down, not because people are farmers,

630
01:18:20,060 --> 01:18:25,760
family have kids are playing and that's well and you know, people are breathing in the air.

631
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:32,370
So like whether or not their farming causes more of that or and if nobody can argue with that,

632
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:35,790
that really is greater than an exclusion that they're already getting.

633
01:18:35,790 --> 01:18:41,110
Or I think your community has an opportunity to create more awareness surrounding it in their own way.

634
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:51,880
What does this look like and how would you do that? And how can you be side of the coin already?

635
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:57,800
You the groups different levels. And so that is far from the truth.

636
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:01,700
One quick reminder if you recall Partizan Green.

637
01:19:01,700 --> 01:19:06,830
Each of you is your evaluation and there is a sheet in the jury instructions

638
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:11,340
that offer you a place to kind of the only way you're here from the group,

639
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:18,770
the present today. And we're going to email you the file sometime later today with your evaluation of your view.

640
01:19:18,770 --> 01:19:41,817
Thanks again. So much guys have a great day. Well.
