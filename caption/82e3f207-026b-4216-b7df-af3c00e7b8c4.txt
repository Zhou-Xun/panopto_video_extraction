1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:12,710
Oh, I'm sorry. Do I have to make a new treatment for this?

2
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:21,510
Yeah. What do you have to do to get it right?

3
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:39,600
All this talk about our vitamin structure doesn't agree with it, but it's basically I think it's a huge problem with this.

4
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:49,590
Everyone who's like 33 or 60% of the body is going to get started.

5
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,930
Happy Friday. So to say we're we're going to do two things.

6
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,830
The first thing is generative interviewing.

7
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,480
And this is an exercise that will get you a little bit out of your comfort zone.

8
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:09,990
But it is meant to just work with someone, a peer partner,

9
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:19,860
and they'll interview you and ask you questions about all your strengths, what you really value in the field, things like that.

10
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:28,470
And it's just a chance to articulate it to someone and then also to gain their feedback or their perspectives, basically.

11
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:37,650
So once you, you know, answer their questions, then they're going to actually reflect back onto you as to what they heard.

12
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:44,340
Okay. And then the second part of the class is a chance to actually start developing some content

13
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:51,870
for your portfolio through just like a basic something I call the portfolio matrix.

14
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:57,659
It's just a a handout just with some simple guidelines to start generating actual content.

15
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:04,620
You can, you know, if you if you focus on it today, you can really just copy and paste it into your portfolio.

16
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:12,879
Okay. So before we get into generative interviewing, I just want to announce that the teams and teamwork module,

17
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:18,370
the second part is due this Sunday and I just want to acknowledge and I've heard from a couple of you,

18
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:25,149
but just again, technology and this is meant to emulate real life. So there are going to be some dysfunctional team members and we just have to

19
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,790
deal with it and move on with the team members that are working well together.

20
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:35,740
But I do just want to answer any questions if there are questions about this module.

21
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:43,120
Yeah. Part A, it's just not like graded yet.

22
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:50,409
It's not. No. Yeah. Well graded all at the end but it's just completion on, on, on that end of things.

23
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:56,590
On the instructors for the teams and teamwork module, it's just completion and then they'll just send me.

24
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:03,190
I am one of the instructors, but they'll just send me and then the other instructors just configuring something.

25
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,780
Thank you. Something else.

26
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,410
Okay. So keep working on that professional philosophy draft.

27
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:21,380
The draft is due next week and next week. All we're doing is pure evaluation.

28
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:28,770
I think actually what I'm going to do is send out a poll to see if you guys prefer to do this over Zoom or in person.

29
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:32,660
I just want to get a feel for what you guys prefer.

30
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:41,110
It just might be a chance to, you know, relax a little bit, stay at home or find a nice space just to do it over Zoom.

31
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,620
It's perfect for me. We are perfectly capable to do it over Zoom.

32
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:47,930
Sometimes it's actually easier that way. Just find a breakout room.

33
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,940
Okay. Okay. And then I just want to remind everyone, there is a interprofessional education,

34
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:07,400
experiential experience where you work with a patient and their family, doing interviews with them, working in another student professional team.

35
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:18,080
You do have to apply to this one its next winter and if you go through this application process and so I really encourage you guys to do it.

36
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:23,000
We've already gotten a few of you guys who have applied to it, so thank you for that.

37
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:31,520
But it is really public health framing around public health perspective, social determinants of health and socio ecological model.

38
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,569
So I do encourage you guys to apply for this. It's a really great experience.

39
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:40,520
It's an honor because you're applying to it if you get accepted. Here's your resume.

40
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:48,760
Questions. Okay.

41
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:50,379
Okay.

42
00:04:50,380 --> 00:05:02,590
So we'll start with generative interviewing and I'm just going to give a brief description of this it and sometimes as I explain it seems complicated,

43
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:13,090
but it is really straightforward. There are two rounds, so in one round you'll be the interviewer or the other round you'll be the interviewee, right?

44
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:18,580
But each round has two parts to it. So the first part is quite simple.

45
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:30,490
The interviewer on the handout, if you've got the handout or it's on canvas, the interviewer on page two just has a series of questions to ask.

46
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:37,809
They're here. All right. And then the computer, of course, will talk through the answers.

47
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:40,480
And as the interviewer, as you're listening to the answers,

48
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:47,790
just toss out some any notes that might be really standing out to you or are really sort of like the main points.

49
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:52,540
And then in the second part, the interviewee,

50
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,910
the person who just answered questions is actually going to ask the interviewer questions

51
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:03,970
and it's basically asking them to reflect back on what they just heard you say.

52
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:12,610
Okay. So in that part, the interviewee, you know, they're saying important things or sort of key things that are sticking out to you.

53
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,840
You can download basically just for yourself. Right.

54
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,450
And then in round two. You're just going to switch roles.

55
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:35,040
Right. And so, you know, the purpose of this is really just to sort of get practice articulating what your strengths are, getting confident in it.

56
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:42,870
And, you know, it's a chance for someone else to share their perspectives on what they're hearing and maybe where you could,

57
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,500
you know, boost yourself up a little bit more or maybe dig a little deeper.

58
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:54,450
So just a chance to hear someone else's perspectives on how you're describing yourself and questions,

59
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:58,380
you know, that you might be coming up in future interviews very soon.

60
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:10,589
Okay. So I did previous life partners and I think everyone is here so we might have to if

61
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:15,750
you don't see your partner here and I do have name tags we want to grab a name tag,

62
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:23,760
no free. But if you don't see your partner here, just come up and let me know and we'll figure things out.

63
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:31,620
I already do have what, one group of three needs, so someone in that group could probably switch out.

64
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:43,680
But let's just. Let's just see here first came together.

65
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:51,540
This is precisely what we went through necessarily.

66
00:07:54,120 --> 00:08:04,430
But like I said, I don't think, you know, they'll come all the way through.

67
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,669
You need to go. I don't think that you might say.

68
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:16,090
Okay, I guess they follow me, right?

69
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:31,170
Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Well, I come down there because I'm curious if you think I would want to go.

70
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:45,960
Oh, I heard. It must be very different for you.

71
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:00,950
Oh, well, I know, I know, I know.

72
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:25,530
The interesting thing here, it's just like I really like it, you know?

73
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:38,580
And it's not that I don't think I need some guys on the things.

74
00:09:39,340 --> 00:10:07,110
Yeah, I think I need someone to talk to me, like I say.

75
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:16,350
I mean, I don't know if you have any questions.

76
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:26,040
I'm going to check in and about 15 minutes to encourage you to swap roles or I think I'm going to 8 minutes per person.

77
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:33,580
So I don't I'm just going to check. And if you want us to switch on or.

78
00:10:39,030 --> 00:11:02,940
It's not as if your life with you enjoy most of your time really enjoying the fact that I'm really happy.

79
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:26,130
I is always on the side, so I like the nutrition, but I like the nutrition as I enjoy our lifestyle and just learn about others.

80
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:39,810
What was my interest originally? And then I also did not like so many folks personally and overall.

81
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:49,270
I believe that everybody is healthy for everyone to be able to do that.

82
00:11:49,360 --> 00:12:01,200
In order to do that, it has to be healthy. And I think the most important thing and I think everybody else's,

83
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:11,970
you go inside information management, do what they do, because otherwise, you know, you're not healthy.

84
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,420
You actually get out there and like empower people.

85
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:44,730
You also need to understand that I also look at these numbers such as, oh, sorry, I guess it was I think I was like,

86
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:58,920
which is I mean, I think we definitely have to size that understanding in the kitchen, but it's so much more than the science.

87
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:18,610
Absolutely. The environment and my workout skills are all the factors that would allow you to actually get a job.

88
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:49,930
But I think we're just having a really hard time seeing these attitudes about nutrition and health.

89
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:54,200
I think that has to be said right now.

90
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:02,260
I'm sure we're seeing other industries come down.

91
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:12,280
Yeah, there's just so much more that goes into making assumptions about the economy.

92
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:32,420
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

93
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,739
Yeah, I think so. Yeah.

94
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:51,630
I mean, if there's like a patient who is an assumption that, you know what I mean,

95
00:14:51,650 --> 00:15:13,809
like we also have like our exercise and what are you getting out of their lifestyle?

96
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:28,570
Because it's going to be, I think, in that way.

97
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:51,950
So what is the big thing that I have to say?

98
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:01,930
Yeah, you can be elected or anything like that.

99
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:10,450
I'm sorry. I feel like the person that I don't know.

100
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:24,700
But now, I mean, I guess that's what I want to say.

101
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:37,190
But also, I don't know.

102
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:53,960
I mean, I think that people say, yeah, yeah.

103
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:23,860
I think. What about social skills? Absolutely. And they're also always nice to see, which are quite interesting right there at the top.

104
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:34,600
And so your attitude is okay?

105
00:17:37,720 --> 00:18:08,049
Yeah. Everyone sometimes I think that's one of the reasons we have to take some.

106
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:13,930
I mean, I'll come back with you. I'm sorry.

107
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:18,309
Sure. Yeah, I think so.

108
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:26,670
Like. Like. It's very strange. Yeah, I got an idea.

109
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:35,100
How can you not be inspired to share information in a way that's going to bring an understanding?

110
00:18:35,960 --> 00:19:05,790
I mean, although I think perhaps what I am saying is that I'm inspired to fight and just not be afraid of anything.

111
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:23,889
When that happens, you know, just because I like to tell it like it is, I think I don't want it to sound like it's also something,

112
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:43,200
you know, everybody I mean, my husband and I think it's just a matter of my personality.

113
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:53,560
Like, I have different ways. But then you can try your best to, like, tailor like ways something.

114
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:09,940
But, you know, so I think that, you know, I'm I guess I'm just trying to our.

115
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:31,810
Just like everybody else.

116
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:45,850
Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

117
00:20:49,510 --> 00:21:04,660
Know, I guess I just want to fight for equal rights, which would not be something I think I was.

118
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:18,910
It was just like, you know, like so many hours, I think race.

119
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:39,450
But, you know, I think. I had nothing to do in their control.

120
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:46,640
How much do I appreciate?

121
00:21:46,650 --> 00:22:02,760
So it's like you're still enjoying life right now.

122
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:18,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

123
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,410
It's actually time. Really? Yeah.

124
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:41,370
Well, last year, for instance, I was also doing your email.

125
00:22:42,390 --> 00:23:48,270
You did? Okay. Right. So I just look at something like this is like, you know, it's all happening right now, but I can't say that I have been fired.

126
00:23:48,390 --> 00:24:15,360
And I feel like that's kind of my time right now.

127
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:44,190
Please feel free to move on to round two if you get there and start thinking about finishing up around one.

128
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:18,600
So I'm not taking anything for granted.

129
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:31,000
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

130
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:35,560
Yeah, I put myself in.

131
00:25:42,420 --> 00:26:13,740
It was special. I mean, it's just like at least somebody is actually on my show, so.

132
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:34,160
What's good about it, right?

133
00:26:38,700 --> 00:27:27,599
Absolutely no reason why I can say things like back to the point that I would I try not to think about it and I think I should just take it.

134
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:34,950
All right. If you're not ready to check it out.

135
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:40,650
And I was like, oh, no, no.

136
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:46,020
I want to emphasize that.

137
00:27:47,300 --> 00:28:12,650
It's like, yeah, I might change exactly how I think it's great to me.

138
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:40,510
Yeah. I mean, I think I might actually have like a little bit.

139
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:52,080
What it's like to attack.

140
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,440
I know that sounds. Got it.

141
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:12,180
Got it for me.

142
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:53,330
But I'm sure it's just like I said, you know, it's like you're just trying to find a way to fix it, all right?

143
00:29:53,660 --> 00:30:08,480
You can't. You can't do it for yourself.

144
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:23,380
I think it's hard.

145
00:30:23,390 --> 00:31:21,860
You know, what I say is that I lived in New York City recently, has been learning how to communicate with each other.

146
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:28,130
The question can hurt you. So not so fast.

147
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:56,450
And I think that's the thing about her that I've been waiting for five years.

148
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:05,020
So I wanted to work together to create an opportunity to have this idea,

149
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:44,330
had share her personal experience with her mom's side by side with natural guys and help manage their addiction because I didn't know anything else.

150
00:32:51,400 --> 00:33:07,690
Well, one of the things that I really feel like U.S. interest in graduate school.

151
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:13,400
Right. Exactly how much longer you have to take it.

152
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:46,240
You know, I inquired about. That was I had something to say and I was like, Oh, my God.

153
00:33:53,510 --> 00:34:46,870
What the other things that are happening, like so many other people that I know that might share information, like how they show.

154
00:34:46,870 --> 00:35:06,999
And just like I said, it's like, I don't know what you're saying.

155
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:16,130
Like, it was just like, oh, my goodness, it's not like, Oh, my God.

156
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:41,300
Yeah. Well, actually, you know, it was like I said.

157
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:58,770
Yeah, I just. I just wanted to walk around saying, Oh, my God.

158
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:22,120
I don't know. I don't think was like, maybe I.

159
00:36:31,080 --> 00:37:34,800
I think it is a good thing for you all that she's speaking to the reality star because I was like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

160
00:37:36,850 --> 00:38:02,610
It's always nice to know what else you know.

161
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:15,810
It's like, it's like, oh, my God.

162
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:44,990
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

163
00:38:46,280 --> 00:39:03,290
I mean, I, you know, I, I, I mean, I was like, and I don't like to, like, right now, so.

164
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:26,180
Yeah, but it's like, I, i, I mean, I, i to help myself, right?

165
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:36,359
Everyone looks like everyone is sort of finishing up the conversation, so I just, I just want to move on.

166
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:43,080
If any groups do need to finish up, you can take a few minutes into the next activity and finish up.

167
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:45,900
But thank you for doing this.

168
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:59,550
I was just trying to over here and some nice conversations and I just want to just and this by just summarizing the conversation here,

169
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:06,120
closing this broad question, how is this exercise useful to you or do you think it benefited your partner?

170
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:19,389
I think it was good to articulate your qualities and also your values that you will use in your professional career,

171
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:23,980
because will it be on the job market soon? So it's good to have that practice now.

172
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,300
Always good to have this practice and articulate it.

173
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:35,080
I mean, this kind of talked about like it was kind of good that we knew each other somewhat because like for like future references,

174
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:39,850
like, okay, you could have brought this up about yourself that you kind of maybe didn't bring up, so I found that useful.

175
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:45,100
Yeah. Yeah. And that's part of this process to write and to uncover things, right,

176
00:40:45,430 --> 00:40:49,990
that your partner may or may not know about you or that they can sort of get up.

177
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:55,870
But yeah, that's great. That's a perfect example of uncovering some things that could be brought up.

178
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:15,249
Anyone wants to share. So if you want, you can.

179
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:18,459
If you have trade notes and you want to share, give them to your partner.

180
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:23,410
You can tap the the appropriate piece of paper off and give it to your partner.

181
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:28,720
If not, no need to. But thank you guys for doing this.

182
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:37,330
I know it's not always the most comfortable thing, but it's just interesting process to walk through in your experience.

183
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:49,549
All right. So what we're going to do for the next part of class is to start looking at something called the portfolio matrix.

184
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:56,560
It's just a guide to help you write some stuff down about your skills or products

185
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,820
you have and goals and it's content that's meant to go directly into your portfolio.

186
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:11,950
And so I just want to talk a little bit about professional goals and some characteristics or aspects of them,

187
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,580
because we're going we talk about goals a lot, but maybe not explicitly what makes good quality goals.

188
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:22,660
But really, this is this line is like the purpose of a goal, right?

189
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:25,980
We want to improve kind of weakness, but not always.

190
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:31,750
Sometimes we have a strength and we want to get better at that strength and build upon that.

191
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:37,150
Setting goals is really important. We all do it.

192
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:42,700
No matter what level of our career that we're in, we're sort of forced to do it on a yearly basis.

193
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:50,140
But it's it's good because it allows us to reflect on where we're at now, in where we want to be.

194
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:53,830
And then oftentimes it's good to quantitate.

195
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:59,080
That's right. Thinking of a short term goal versus a long term goal and what that entails.

196
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:06,730
So thinking about, you know, where you're not where you are now and whether it's days, months or years, you want to complete this goal.

197
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:14,290
This slide just has some qualities of professional goals, right?

198
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:18,899
So being specific, I'm thinking about you guys so specific goals,

199
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:26,070
thinking about the the specific skill you want and how it's relevant to your specific field of work.

200
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:35,670
Maybe thinking about self branding. So thinking of like within the field of work, how do you want to be branding yourself attainable, right?

201
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:38,430
So think so. You're setting a short term goal.

202
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:47,670
Do you have the resources available to you here in the School of Public Health or Indian Arbor to be able to achieve these goals,

203
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:53,880
significance and value? This this is where you can see where your professional philosophy might come into play.

204
00:43:54,750 --> 00:44:03,390
So thinking about your goal is it is a pertinent to the field of public health and the values and the views that you hold within in the field.

205
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:13,980
That might also be sort of like a motivating factor for you to actually attain, reach your goal, and then measurable goals can be measured.

206
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:23,010
So either if it's like quantitatively and just like I'm going to do it in this X amount of days or at the end, right?

207
00:44:23,010 --> 00:44:26,910
Is there a work product that you can show for attaining your goal?

208
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:37,040
Any questions or anything anyone wants to add? Okay.

209
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,460
So for the E portfolio matrix, I just have two parts to it.

210
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:46,230
The first part is just thinking about the skills you have already.

211
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:51,270
So this is one of the requirements for the EA portfolio.

212
00:44:51,300 --> 00:45:00,080
One of the pages is dedicated to your current skills, and so it's just a table where you'll write down that skills.

213
00:45:01,590 --> 00:45:10,830
These could be your apex to write the skills you or competencies you've provided for your apex in the work products.

214
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:16,980
Now, when you write down the competency or the skill,

215
00:45:17,010 --> 00:45:23,069
you can pull the language from the public health competency is I believe there's a I'll have to actually double check,

216
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:27,060
but I think there is a list of it on the canvas site for you to look at.

217
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,120
Or you can write it in your own words. I actually prefer you write the skill or the competency in your own words.

218
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,140
It sounds more real that way. And then the second.

219
00:45:40,890 --> 00:45:51,720
The second column here is for you to describe how you developed the skill and the work product that sort of represents that skill.

220
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:59,840
This is the reflective part of your portfolio where you have to have a little reflection on how you developed your skills.

221
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:09,090
So just keep that in mind. I think that's it for this this one.

222
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:21,299
Any questions for the. And so if you focus on this and that and, you know, really write down some good content here or type it out,

223
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:24,630
you can actually just copy and paste it right into your EA portfolio.

224
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:31,230
Right. So it's not that one to set up. This one, part two is goal setting.

225
00:46:31,710 --> 00:46:39,030
And I'm taking a backwards design approach here where the first column is at that end scale.

226
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,300
So if you meet your goal, what skill is going to come out of it?

227
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,259
And then potentially the second column is like a potential work product that also comes out of that, right?

228
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:53,760
That represents your skills. And then the last column is more of your goals.

229
00:46:53,760 --> 00:47:02,130
So what activities are you going to engage in or what are you going to engage in to obtain that skill?

230
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:10,180
So just some guidance to get some content generated for your portfolio.

231
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,620
And I'm just going to let you guys work.

232
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:19,720
I'll check in in about 20 minutes and see where everyone's at.

233
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,909
And this slide is just like some guiding questions to think about.

234
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:34,090
You just did the 16 personalities test. So just think about some aspects of that that could be helpful and just thinking about how you

235
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:38,980
want to advance now in this program while you're still here or within the next five years,

236
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:43,690
3 to 5 years. Three.

237
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:53,360
You can move back to your original seat if you want to do that.

238
00:47:53,590 --> 00:48:06,760
Oh, no. Actually, I believe I do.

239
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:17,370
So you might be more.

240
00:48:20,930 --> 00:48:27,770
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

241
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:38,210
I definitely feel that these days.

242
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:52,870
You feel it is something like Angel, like I don't think you deserve it.

243
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:58,790
How did you get to my character?

244
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:06,350
I feel I used to have that. But he's actually got it and I don't know, it just really.

245
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:12,379
Yeah. I haven't talked to him, so.

246
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,440
Yeah, I know. I might change, though. Really?

247
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:20,530
Yeah. Hey, how are you? It's just.

248
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:29,010
I don't think I could have taken it.

249
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:50,810
Right, right. I was thinking. Oh, my gosh, I think it's just the second I have to live on a through the roof that is from the episode.

250
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:55,050
Or is that something that we had to come up with our own either?

251
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:10,550
You know, this was a different I can be identified like the same like in me.

252
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:18,220
Yes. Yeah, that's right. Because there wasn't a real name and.

253
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:35,510
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I just. I don't know, but I got to get something that's very clear.

254
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:43,850
What it looks like seem like. Yeah, yeah. I mean, it's like, okay,

255
00:50:44,000 --> 00:51:16,280
you're playing as you're working out how exacerbated by how I was thinking I wasn't going to see night he really last night but I mean it

256
00:51:18,010 --> 00:51:45,280
was much easier for me because I think sometimes I like I don't know if we're even if we have read do have I just I think yeah I know.

257
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:58,460
I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I have to tell you, I was like, okay.

258
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:22,220
I was like, okay to just like on Saturday Night Live in the city or not, I want to meet my, you know, my Google Drive.

259
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:41,960
You know, this is like a space where you can actually I think she was living in 69, 30 minutes.

260
00:52:45,110 --> 00:53:05,179
I don't know. Yes. So I mean, I don't know if I'm sorry that I don't think she would endanger.

261
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:14,810
So I don't really know what she was saying, saying on things like.

262
00:53:19,950 --> 00:53:25,709
I just first set the meeting the first time, actually, she didn't put her name.

263
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:33,750
And I think it's going to really do this a long time.

264
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:54,080
I don't think you have to shake your hand because they're so ready and so honest.

265
00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:18,990
Yeah, I disagree. You don't you don't need to go there.

266
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:33,620
I don't want to know what you want to see in real life and Israeli to what she said.

267
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:40,650
Sometimes you can't afford that.

268
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:46,920
She doesn't know how to expect to work that long.

269
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:59,850
We have this lady and he saved my life.

270
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:05,870
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

271
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:27,690
Actually, I think she was really, really nice because she was supposed to take this as a context.

272
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,480
I don't know how you meet match, you know,

273
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:46,640
because of the fact that claiming but you can't take obviously it's just you know it's

274
00:55:46,940 --> 00:56:18,380
you know it's surprising to hear that I was designed to get out of the 1999 not.

275
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:32,700
I don't think she was like no no no.

276
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:39,940
Oh yeah.

277
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:47,220
I really like these guys so much more with the public and I can listen.

278
00:56:47,430 --> 00:57:04,020
Yeah, I think I mean, I think it was like, well, you know, I mean, she's really interesting to me.

279
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:09,790
Oh, my God. I don't know.

280
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,070
Oh, shoot. Yeah.

281
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:49,800
I mean, I would like to say something like, I don't think, you know, it's not to say that it was because I have to be accurate,

282
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:09,420
but I think that me like she was going to lesson classes that tension between what those guys did

283
00:58:09,430 --> 00:58:25,620
that relate to that kind of like social equity in my life and I suppose the question so I was like,

284
00:58:27,480 --> 00:58:42,150
okay, I mean that's going to have to be like that and be like, Oh, okay, yeah, you look like that.

285
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:54,780
Which is not creating a debate here.

286
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:03,260
So. In Hanoi.

287
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:13,700
Police say they have to a statement on almost five.

288
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:20,400
Thank you. It's a pleasure giving back.

289
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:31,750
Yes, I think so. She's so gorgeous and so like, it's just like I don't know if it's perfectly okay.

290
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:44,700
It's a little snug, but really, it's just like, yes, unless you do something like, I feel like this is really so good.

291
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:51,690
Where does that leave exactly? Yeah, it was when I got to go with it in the spring.

292
00:59:52,160 --> 01:00:03,650
Get it? It's so, it's like, oh, that's good.

293
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:10,560
Yeah. It's like, that's not what I.

294
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:20,710
Oh, yes. No, it wasn't like a monster song.

295
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:25,740
I was just going to give it back to you guys.

296
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:48,100
You know, I do think it's really going to be a best.

297
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:54,170
Best? Yeah. Oh, yeah.

298
01:00:54,410 --> 01:00:58,350
I was like, no, no, no.

299
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:08,620
I was like, this, if you like. It's not like that.

300
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:30,880
It wasn't exactly right. And I was just like, you know, you going to do like we should be thinking about, you know,

301
01:01:31,350 --> 01:01:55,080
how many of you are going to be like, Oh, you know, I could do something like that.

302
01:01:55,310 --> 01:02:03,810
It's going to happen. I've been there, done that.

303
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:54,510
But if you look closely at the person who is going to have some sort of something far more money and like your thoughts on that.

304
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:04,220
Yeah, that's a little something.

305
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:09,410
I don't know. I don't know.

306
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:18,100
She's like three years.

307
01:03:19,710 --> 01:04:02,700
Thought I was supposed to be of something like, this is not going to give you a chance to kind of push her.

308
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:14,190
That's a couple that's kind of like, you know, just because I'm pretty.

309
01:04:19,570 --> 01:04:26,360
I don't know. I really have to figure out when you get six.

310
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:37,930
Exactly. I think that that's just an excuses.

311
01:04:38,730 --> 01:04:48,500
I think I've heard of it, but I've never seen more details.

312
01:04:48,780 --> 01:05:05,909
Yeah. Yeah. It is a classic case of.

313
01:05:05,910 --> 01:05:09,120
I don't think it was an accident.

314
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:24,540
Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, you are still somebody something I can see where you have what you want.

315
01:05:28,170 --> 01:05:33,990
I mean, I think that I still have a responsibility.

316
01:05:34,110 --> 01:05:34,830
Yeah, I did.

317
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:54,160
I was thinking about 1:00 Eastern right here on the Internet, and it just looks just like better than having a presentation that we can use it.

318
01:05:54,180 --> 01:05:58,320
Can you describe his new role?

319
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:03,920
When I saw him transition? Yeah.

320
01:06:07,780 --> 01:06:14,630
I mean, I think is the sort of like.

321
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:19,760
Yeah. Yeah. Or the other one. I just kind of I mean, I did a lot.

322
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:34,320
So I would I would just like to sit down and talk.

323
01:06:36,770 --> 01:06:46,100
But so I asked that question and I was very measured.

324
01:06:47,930 --> 01:06:56,300
Yes. I guess I just don't feel safe.

325
01:06:56,310 --> 01:07:04,950
Don't. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I guess I mean, I dropped down to six.

326
01:07:04,950 --> 01:07:09,930
I think I really got which is a shame.

327
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:20,520
So it's just so much psychosomatic.

328
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:41,670
And I think that's why I mean, like I don't think they're asking for unless they can reduce the size and scale.

329
01:07:42,270 --> 01:08:09,820
But then I got to think about this. If I'm Robin Williams and like I was like, oh, he sounds great until I know, I know, I know.

330
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:18,420
I know that my view on this is there's like a lot of things like, I'm sorry,

331
01:08:19,740 --> 01:08:42,250
I must ask you guys like around Ironman Triathlon, but it's like, you know, I really look into it.

332
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:47,910
I haven't done it for whatever.

333
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:56,190
It's what I really want to know.

334
01:08:56,190 --> 01:09:00,660
It's just I want to advance to some degree.

335
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:10,320
But like with the company as it was, it was like a droplet was like no other word.

336
01:09:10,740 --> 01:09:13,980
And I'm sure really like.

337
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:40,890
I know. But like I said, I think people can be very dear to my heart and I trusted the other taxes.

338
01:09:41,210 --> 01:10:01,950
It was just like, I'll send pictures on the most likely because in the past few days.

339
01:10:05,490 --> 01:10:27,560
How is oh we even though say oh Whitney he's either going to be an astronaut or I think the reason I didn't think it was because I was like,

340
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:32,940
Oh, I think it's science fiction.

341
01:10:33,510 --> 01:10:40,880
So I was like, I told you, I love that.

342
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:54,110
I don't think he was because there's a lot of people.

343
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:44,160
I know. I mean, like, besides the cast member like I guess I don't think there is there that's I was like, oh, yes, we know.

344
01:11:45,300 --> 01:12:01,440
He was really nice. I tell you exactly when you're going to receive the money.

345
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:09,440
So I you said it was something.

346
01:12:09,460 --> 01:12:25,940
I just feel like I don't think you really feel like you're going to be told I don't like it either.

347
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:32,250
I don't really care what I'm looking. In about 20 minutes.

348
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:35,469
And if you want to continue working, go ahead.

349
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:42,280
This room is here and tell you. So go ahead and stick around for a few more minutes if you have questions.

350
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:45,790
But if not, feel free to leave.

351
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:52,600
Just continue working on your portfolio, playing around with the site you want to use things like that.

352
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,260
Then I get your professional philosophy dropped. Students.

353
01:12:57,750 --> 01:13:03,240
You have lots of respect just like that.

354
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:07,140
What's your phone number, sir?

355
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:11,890
Just like the completion of it or the content.

356
01:13:12,510 --> 01:13:24,990
I mean, I know, like. I mean, like, I guess, like I could do just like a summary of, like, sometimes I wonder.

357
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,380
Do you want to. Yeah. Okay, let's. Let's do that.

358
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:41,730
Because it seems like these are the different types of both male and female facilities across the.

359
01:13:47,430 --> 01:14:04,850
It's sort of like 30 guys.

360
01:14:05,490 --> 01:14:10,830
I have no idea.

361
01:14:14,770 --> 01:14:38,630
Cause I guess. I mean, I got to get you to think for time.

362
01:14:41,670 --> 01:14:55,130
I just think, like, this is like, we need more security guys,

363
01:14:55,140 --> 01:15:41,410
and they really like to be able to have the threat of Scottish Government looking like if you have to whole up like I saw three years ago.

364
01:15:46,860 --> 01:16:01,980
Yeah. I mean, I guess I was like you.
