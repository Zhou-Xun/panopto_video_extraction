1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,690
I really thought this might be driving three men who really knew something.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,190
Hi, everybody. Who came today?

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:22,770
The last lecture for me for the academic year, actually, because I tell all my classes this semester moves.

4
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,150
And how many classes did you have?

5
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,470
Three. Including this one online.

6
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:37,980
Yeah, yeah. But I will say today's lecture will not take the whole time.

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:46,500
But first, I wanted to thank you, this class in particular, for being the inaugural residential offering of this course.

8
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:53,909
Thank you for taking it as a elective because it didn't count towards any certificate programs unless

9
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,670
you managed to convince your curriculum person to give you like a waiver or something like that.

10
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,060
But also for coming at 830.

11
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:09,130
I did not pick this time or this room, but I appreciate it.

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:17,250
So thank you, class. So today we're going to just be wrapping up the course, basically talking about some,

13
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,590
you know, last minute thoughts on the upstream downstream level changes.

14
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,760
We'll do like a reflection and then and then we'll do a reflection.

15
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:41,640
Before I get started, the posted announcement on canvas as well for your your commentaries, your final commentary is due a week from today.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,270
Just please note that it is due at 10 a.m. and not 11:59 p.m. ET.

17
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:55,560
And it's due at the time where if we were to normally show up here and have a final in person like that time,

18
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:04,169
but you know, if you like are late, then things are absolutely,

19
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:16,560
absolutely due Sunday because I only have 72 hours yet enter grades in for the registrar and after that it cut you off and then you get it incomplete.

20
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,740
And that's like a whole process I'm sure nobody wants.

21
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:25,260
But just please note, like for every day you do turn it in like it is, it's 5% off.

22
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,620
So just, just keep that in mind and I'll.

23
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:31,760
Again, I'll post the announcement on canvas.

24
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:37,200
Oh, okay. You did come. All right, when people are coming, we're.

25
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:42,200
We're all on the same bus. No, we know that.

26
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,520
We're like, oh, okay, everybody's here.

27
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,540
Is the doors open? Okay, thank you.

28
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,420
So, yes, you just missed the announcement. So the final commentary is due to name a week from today.

29
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:04,660
Yay! Awesome class. Okay.

30
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:13,410
Any any questions or things y'all want to bring up before we get this final lecture going?

31
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:25,350
Okay. So in terms of infectious diseases and we're thinking like very, very high level upstream responses.

32
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:34,920
So things that we've talked about this semester that obviously tie into infectious diseases, emergency response is first environmental protections.

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,269
So things that we can do like reducing industrial agriculture, reducing the destruction of natural habitats,

34
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:48,900
reducing the rate and impact of climate change, and then water quality as well.

35
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:56,980
How do y'all feel like we as a globe or a like a like internationally are doing on this front?

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,170
Do you feel like we've made any progress in the last year?

37
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:15,070
I have a question. Yes. So I can understand why reducing industrial agriculture would like curb the spread of infectious disease.

38
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,100
But then I think of our global population and our reliance on things like when you talk to the news industry, right?

39
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:28,000
Yeah. If it didn't exist within the. Demand and not that like capitalists.

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,740
I'm just like, what is an alternative red shirt?

41
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,320
Industrial agriculture. Yeah. So anyone have thoughts before I.

42
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:43,030
Yes, Chloe. They just start doing, like, lab produce.

43
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,660
Me, I think. Yes. I don't know if it was chicken.

44
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:56,970
It was chicken. Yeah. Yeah. And in terms of industrial agriculture, we certainly need industrial agriculture.

45
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:03,060
But thinking about like moving away towards these things, like we do, like mono cropping, for example,

46
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,880
with just fields and fields of like exclusively corn and soybeans, which they very much do.

47
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:21,360
Especially here in the Midwest. And in particular, that can lead to the persistence of like certain very robust pesticide resistant bugs, for example,

48
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,110
or like not properly like maintaining and rotating our crops for like soil moisture more so things like that.

49
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:32,250
They are there is a huge boom in lab produced meat.

50
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:39,090
So like, you know, like how many of you have had like an impossible or beyond meat thing?

51
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:46,190
Some of you haven't tried it yet. Okay, i, i.

52
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,680
So Burger King actually has an impossible whopper. And I've had that.

53
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,810
And I would say that it tastes almost identical to the whopper.

54
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,310
Now, for people who have been vegetarians their entire life.

55
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:02,410
So I was having this conversation with Dr. Neitzel.

56
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:06,280
So he and his entire family, including his his kid and his wife,

57
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:11,799
are vegetarians and have been for like his daughter has never tasted meat in her entire life.

58
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:17,200
And he and his wife have not eaten meat in like over 25 years. So I was like, What do you think about the Impossible Walther?

59
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:27,220
And he said that they think that like the fake blood and like how it looks like the fake meat aspect is unappealing to them.

60
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,710
But they can get how for people who do traditionally eat meat.

61
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:38,050
It is a nice like entry point into like alternative proteins.

62
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:47,290
But I was watching, I think it was Vox your like Business Insider with the the steep increase in alternative needs.

63
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,210
It hasn't decreased the consumption of regular meat.

64
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,920
People are just eating more alternative meats in parallel.

65
00:06:57,190 --> 00:07:03,399
So you don't necessarily see like meat consumption plateauing or decreasing.

66
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:10,680
You just see alternative meats increasing with the normal meat consumption and then the fake chicken in particular.

67
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:14,829
Like there are some YouTube videos on this you can watch later. It's really interesting.

68
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:20,350
It's kind of freaky. They get like one chef to like try to make something like, you know,

69
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:31,419
tasty out of it for some reason because of like the way the proteins are chained together for like a chicken breast versus like lose ground meat,

70
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,310
for example. Right now, fake chicken lab grown chicken is like essentially like.

71
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,330
Hundreds and thousands of dollars just for her, just for one breast.

72
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,030
But, you know, like people are trying to move towards some alternatives, like people have been eating tofu.

73
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,650
Tampa Bay. Satan.

74
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:59,520
I think that's Satan. I think. Yeah. You know, or like jackfruit.

75
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,870
So we'll kind of see. But in terms of like the the bad agricultural practices, I think now.

76
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,720
So more people are trying to be cognizant of like sustainable farming as well.

77
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:22,260
There's interestingly, I just finished the second season of Down to Earth with Zac Efron on Netflix,

78
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:29,380
and then one of the episodes in particular was particularly related to this film, if you want to watch it.

79
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,659
Yes. Yeah, I was watching it just from like a global health perspective.

80
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:38,740
We really want to put the emphasis on like upper middle income for sure, and move it away.

81
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,220
Like we want the lower middle income countries to have an opportunity to industrialize and benefit from all these things.

82
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,969
But it's like complicated. Very complicated. Yeah.

83
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:58,680
And I would say like another. Another problem, obviously, like upper middle income countries,

84
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,740
like we've been the biggest contributors to like climate change and like pollution and emissions and things like that.

85
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:10,770
And then these lower income countries now that are moving more towards like industrialization, for example,

86
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:17,759
don't necessarily have like the same environmental protections that our country does or like the same,

87
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,940
like even occupational protections that our country does.

88
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:29,190
So when you look at what they're doing, for example, it looks really terrible in in today's age.

89
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:35,790
But like, this is what we were doing here in the United States and like, I don't know, like the 1860s or the 1870s.

90
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:39,029
Right. But it's just like a different lens of time now.

91
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:48,269
And there's all these complexities going on as well in terms of like higher income countries like China,

92
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:55,559
for example, buying out areas of land in countries in Africa, Central Asia,

93
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,320
like use as hazardous waste sites,

94
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:11,180
or kind of get them into these essentially like predatory contracts where they owe China like a bunch of money for developing their land.

95
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:14,550
It's very, very complicated.

96
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:26,700
Now, the reducing the destruction of natural habitats, I feel like there is a push towards preservation, but this is still happening substantially,

97
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,769
like that whole, you know,

98
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:36,509
period of time where they were just destructing like swaths of the Amazonian rainforest that kind of like came and went in the news.

99
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:46,650
Obviously that land is not being recovered in Australia in particular, and I like this approach of the cat because they did have that visit as well.

100
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:50,040
In early 2020, like right as the pandemic was starting,

101
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:59,670
they had all of these wildfires throughout Australia that like destructed a lot of natural habitats and also a lot of the wildlife.

102
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:07,229
So it's interesting to see what Australia is doing in terms of recovery and play and planting these very specific trees,

103
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:18,180
which I'm forgetting the name of but has substantial like environmental impact, reducing the rate and impact of climate change.

104
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:21,389
You know, a lot of countries like with the Paris Accords and all that,

105
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:30,600
like they've signed agreements to reduce emissions and etcetera, but we still are not slowing it down in any sense.

106
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,549
And then curbing anti microbial resistance that's more so is on like the health

107
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:40,290
care front in terms of just like not wildly being prescribed antibiotics.

108
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,750
How many of you have had difficulties getting medications recently when you're sick?

109
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:54,020
Nobody. Oh, really? Okay. At least in certain health care systems in particular,

110
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:59,960
they are now very resistant to giving you any kind of medication when you see them for a doctor's visit.

111
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:05,720
So even if you see them, they'll just be like, well, do these home remedies and like, you'll be fine.

112
00:12:06,590 --> 00:12:14,990
So for example, I had what I didn't realize was bacterial bronchitis from November to February,

113
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,770
but that was when I was still in the Kaiser Permanente health care system,

114
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:23,360
which is a health care system that's like on the West Coast and only certain states in the East Coast.

115
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:28,430
And basically, like they told me, to just gargle salt water and like get rest and fluids.

116
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:32,389
And I was like having this chronic cough for four months.

117
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:36,500
And finally, like at the end of it, they were like, Oh, you had this bacterial bronchitis.

118
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:42,079
So like now you can have some antibiotics, but generally they're trying not to overprescribe it.

119
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,880
Kind of very different other parts of the world.

120
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:51,080
Yes. Mexico. Yeah.

121
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:58,280
Actually, my friend recently was in Argentina and he said, I have fever, so I'm going to take an antibiotic.

122
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:02,569
And I was like, no, it could be caused by a virus. He eventually understood why.

123
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:08,220
I was like, Do not take it. He just went to the pharmacy for Argentina and still had it.

124
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:12,830
Oh yeah. And South America and Mexico. I think you can as well.

125
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:20,000
And then certain countries and like the Middle East, I think like America and Europe is much tighter about it.

126
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:26,389
And this is one of the things the World Health Organization is trying to push towards.

127
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:30,380
But I remember, like growing up as a kid, like growing up in California,

128
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:39,350
we we were close friends with the family across the street and they were Mexican and they would frequently, like go back and forth to Mexico.

129
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:46,639
And so, like, when my mom would get sick, she would just go to the across the street neighbor and the like local village,

130
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:51,590
just have like a bunch of like penicillin or like amoxicillin or something like that.

131
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:57,230
So this is definitely like globally something that they're more focused on housing

132
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:03,650
and build environment quality in terms of like actually in particular globally.

133
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,990
This is an issue in the United States.

134
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:14,990
This is an issue they keep saying that the housing market is about to like implode on itself again, like it did in 2008.

135
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,550
I'll be very curious to see what is actually happening.

136
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,420
This is also a very complicated issue because it's focusing here on the United States.

137
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:32,510
It depends on the priority and budget that people put into the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

138
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:38,090
But then now you have this issue of all these people getting into like flipping houses, for example,

139
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:44,090
that may not know how to do improper remediation or the communities that we've talked about before

140
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:49,040
that are especially like low income and disadvantage their house floods after a hurricane.

141
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,180
They don't necessarily have the funds to like rip out all their drywall.

142
00:14:53,180 --> 00:15:00,860
Right. To get rid of the malls. So they're just going to like do what they can and move back in tackling social determinants of health,

143
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:05,390
in particular health insurance, quality of health care and health policy.

144
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:14,420
Um, you know, we talked about this in a lot of public health classes and then policies and mandates associated with aforementioned protections.

145
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,380
I know things seem very slow moving and that's because they actually are.

146
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:29,540
But I feel like if we had the same momentum, for example, for some of these issues like we've had with recent issues,

147
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:42,470
we could as our generation gen-z millennials like have the power to potentially push this forward, like, for example, in the state of Michigan, right?

148
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,000
Getting abortion as a right put into the Constitution.

149
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,170
A lot of that voter turnout was from us.

150
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:58,380
Right. Making that happen or like, you know, yesterday with a Georgia Senate runoff.

151
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:06,440
Right. Or like how we just flipped all the houses here in Michigan for the first time since, I think like the eighties, for example.

152
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:12,050
So things have to happen at the top down level.

153
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,849
Unfortunately, a lot of communities, though, have to be doing it for themselves.

154
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:22,370
Just because politicians aren't going to allocate funds properly, you know,

155
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,990
they're not going to like put resources where they you logically think they would be.

156
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:33,830
So it has to be this constant, like I said, proactive effort, equity in particular.

157
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:38,990
We're talking about time, energy, money, addressing social inequities.

158
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:46,340
Now, this paper in particular is the is a framework they have use called the enrich.

159
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:52,750
Community Resilience Framework for high risk populations created by O'Sullivan and colleagues,

160
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:56,469
where they focus on the three components of empowerment,

161
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:03,250
innovation and collaboration, where they're looking at holistic approaches to build resilient communities.

162
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:11,800
And essentially these what they believe is the fundamental crux of that is transformational leadership that aligns with human rights.

163
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,720
You are familiar with the concept of transformational leadership.

164
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:21,249
This is something that's used a lot in safety research.

165
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:31,360
And time and time again, evidence has shown that transformational leadership styles would result in healthier workplaces,

166
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:38,980
happier workers, fewer injuries and illness, less turnover, higher rates of job satisfaction.

167
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:43,120
So a transfer. Okay, so let's talk about the different leadership sets.

168
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:49,030
So like a laissez faire type of leadership is like, I don't care what you do, you do you.

169
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,370
I don't necessarily do anything either. We're very much like, go with the flow.

170
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:00,009
Autocratic or like dictator is like, I micromanage you to like the end degree.

171
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:04,030
Like what I say is the final word. People have no say.

172
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:07,690
Like what? I say, it has to be done right.

173
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:13,210
And then Democratic leadership is is not transformational leadership either.

174
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:17,050
Okay? It's like, okay, people have a voice, right?

175
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:27,160
But at the end of the day, like people in charge kind of make the decisions, whether or not that is the will of the people.

176
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:36,069
Now, transformational leadership is what we think of like as ideal leadership, where like you not only talk the talk, but you walk the walk.

177
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:41,980
So if you say that, like, for example, masking is very important to you,

178
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:48,069
you always see the leaders wearing a mask and like upholding those values and then taking

179
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:55,149
into consideration the opinions of their workers or their constituents and not just us,

180
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:02,139
like a virtue signaling kind of thing or not. Just as like we asked your opinion to check a box and say that we did it,

181
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:10,690
actually really making a concerted effort to build trust with the folks, you know, that work below them.

182
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:14,049
But it's also very nonhierarchical.

183
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:19,990
So essentially what they're proposing here is very much like community based work or community based

184
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:27,250
participatory research where like the researcher is on the same like footing or level as the community member,

185
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,050
as the government official, as like the community based organization.

186
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:37,780
No one person is more important than the other and then that aligning with human rights.

187
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:42,970
So if you want to read more details about that paper, the link is at the bottom.

188
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:49,930
And then downstream infectious diseases in emergency response, right?

189
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:58,089
Access to primary care providers, reducing attitudinal barriers, reducing delayed diagnosis and treatment,

190
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:03,190
socioeconomic status, housing instability, individual and family health, and much more.

191
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,860
So these are very much like the SDH that we think of very, very complicated.

192
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:16,930
The the area that I focus a lot on is mostly reducing attitudinal barriers.

193
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:22,870
And like we've talked about before, these are approaches and how we we as professionals,

194
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:30,339
once you go out in the field having these conversations with these people and trying to figure out what is the best way to appeal to them,

195
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:35,169
to get what you want at the end of it might not necessarily always be science.

196
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:38,230
It might not necessarily always be facts. Okay.

197
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:42,610
And then and then this last one, equity in particular.

198
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:52,450
So this is another framework by Kryger. Looking at societal patterns of disease represent the biological consequences of the ways of living and

199
00:20:52,450 --> 00:21:00,460
working differently afforded by social groups produced by each society's economic and political priorities.

200
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:09,550
So as you can see, like if we were to take this framework in particular and apply it here to the United States,

201
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:14,890
it would look very different in another country compared to like India, for example.

202
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:25,030
So I want to show you a video about just a reflection, in particular reflecting on this,

203
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:30,970
the use called How High Income, How Rich Countries are making the pandemic last longer.

204
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:39,870
And then we can kind of chat about that. Okay. Only the United States government.

205
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:43,820
In May of 2020, the United States government struck a deal.

206
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:52,040
$1.2 billion would go to the British drugmaker AstraZeneca to speed up their COVID 19 vaccine research.

207
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:59,210
In exchange, AstraZeneca promised the U.S. 300 million doses if the vaccine made it through safety and efficacy trials.

208
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:06,170
Earlier that month, the United Kingdom signed a similar deal with the same company to secure 90 million doses.

209
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:12,290
These types of transactions where a country makes it deal directly with the company are called bilateral deals.

210
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:16,310
And in 2020, rich countries made a lot of them.

211
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,770
Those billions of dollars helped fund research that brought us the world's leading COVID vaccines in record time.

212
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,210
But that money also determined where those vaccines would go.

213
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,270
By January 20, 21,

214
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:41,450
96% of the Pfizer Biontech vaccine doses that were scheduled to be produced by the end of the year had already been bought and 100% of moderna's.

215
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:49,310
Countries representing 16% of the global population held over half of the doses from the most promising vaccine developers.

216
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:54,920
Basically, rich countries got vaccines. Poorer countries didn't.

217
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,459
In Brazil and India, health systems are being pushed to the limits at the same time that the U.S. is

218
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:07,160
quickly opening up vaccinations for anyone that's making the pandemic last longer,

219
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,600
it's allowing infections to rage and new variants to arise.

220
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,420
And at the end of the day, more people are dying than need to be.

221
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:19,760
The same deals that helped develop vaccines are making it harder to get them around the world.

222
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:27,550
Oh, look, it's funny because there's not a Moderna commercial and.

223
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:46,090
So now what? What's happening now with the COVID 19 vaccine inequality isn't at all unprecedented.

224
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,860
In 2009, the World Health Organization declared swine flu a pandemic.

225
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,230
We are all in this together.

226
00:23:53,650 --> 00:24:01,990
After securing their own vaccine deals, these nine higher income countries pledged 120 million doses to the W.H.O. for lower income countries.

227
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:09,270
But they only started sending those donations after they realized the outbreak wasn't as serious as everyone initially thought.

228
00:24:09,690 --> 00:24:16,380
For years, we've seen how technology is rolled out in rich countries, and it takes decades for them to trickle down to poor countries.

229
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:26,180
The problem starts with the vaccine market itself. Getting a vaccine from development to manufacturing to distribution is a multi-step process.

230
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:30,590
By making bilateral deals with developers and suppliers early on.

231
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:33,770
Rich countries got in line here at manufacturing,

232
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:41,060
but there was no guarantee that any given vaccine would work or get passed regulators to reach the market.

233
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:47,630
If a vaccine fails shortly after funding, those billion dollar investments are lost.

234
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:57,590
So to offset that risk, countries invested in multiple options and suppliers often securing enough doses to cover their populations several times.

235
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:06,680
As of March 2021, Canada had secured over 300 million doses enough to cover their population five times over,

236
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,270
and the deals the US made were enough to cover its population at least twice,

237
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:18,949
which worked out for them because even though they secured 300 million doses of AstraZeneca a year ago as of April,

238
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,350
it still hasn't been approved for use in the country.

239
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:27,500
But the Pfizer or Moderna doses that the government pre-purchased are still enough to cover most of the population.

240
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,740
Most countries can't afford to make multiple high risk investments early on,

241
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:41,960
so they wait until the vaccine is further along in the approval process, and by then they're already at the back of a very long line.

242
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:49,070
Peru, for example, made a bilateral deal with AstraZeneca, but won't see those doses until at least September.

243
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:56,300
Those that purchased first or made the biggest orders or invest it into the research and development are standing at the front of the line,

244
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:02,330
which is why the US has gotten 240 million doses of vaccine so far at least,

245
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:08,300
and most of the poor countries in the world don't have 240 million doses combined.

246
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:14,780
So is there a way to get a lot of money here without creating a priority line over here?

247
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:24,680
Maybe. One program under way is designed to work as a sort of middleman between countries and the drug companies making vaccines.

248
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:31,940
It's called COVAX. It's an initiative formed by three global health groups, including the World Health Organization.

249
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:38,840
And its main objective is to provide vaccines to 92 middle and low income countries that were shut out for making their own deals.

250
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,010
COVAX is kind of like the Paris climate agreement of the vaccine world.

251
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,210
So it's this multilateral effort with almost 200 countries that have joined.

252
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:54,080
And the idea is that everyone has access to COVID 19 vaccines, regardless of their country's GDP.

253
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:01,820
It does this using a two part system. The first part allows high income countries to buy into and access multiple vaccines at once.

254
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,830
So instead of one country giving $2 billion directly to AstraZeneca,

255
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:11,600
they'd give the money to COVAX, which would use it to fund several different vaccines.

256
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,580
This way, if one or two of them failed early on, it wouldn't be a total loss.

257
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:25,250
The other vaccines in the portfolio would make up for it. It's a multilateral system that's much lower risk for those countries than a bilateral one.

258
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:33,470
The idea is that COVAX could use that larger purchasing power to negotiate deals with manufacturers and developers on global scale,

259
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:37,220
which would drive the costs down and fund vaccine development.

260
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:46,010
The second part buys vaccines for lower income countries. It's funded by donations from wealthier governments and charities.

261
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:49,910
The US alone has pledged $4 billion to this fund.

262
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:54,560
As vaccines become available, COVAX hands them out to every country at once.

263
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,890
So rich countries and poor countries all get a fair share.

264
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:07,940
At least that's the idea. The biggest problem with COVAX is these bilateral deals we talked about for COVAX to work as intended.

265
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,210
It needs most countries to be using its multilateral system.

266
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:18,410
But COVAX was formed a month into the pandemic when many countries had already invested in bilateral deals.

267
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:22,430
So the incentive for rich countries to join COVAX was low.

268
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:28,520
But without them, COVAX might be underfunded. So it let them have it both ways.

269
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:35,240
Rich countries could join COVAX and keep their bilateral deals that would get them more vaccines faster.

270
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,520
And those basically undermined COVAX because they put themselves at the front of the

271
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:44,300
line ahead of access that countries will get through this collective agreement.

272
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:52,370
The U.S., for example, has donated the most money to COVAX, but is also still at the front of the manufacturing lines waiting for its own doses.

273
00:28:54,440 --> 00:29:00,590
The U.S. and U.K. have both promised to donate some surplus doses to COVAX, but neither country has said when.

274
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:10,250
This means rich countries like the US decide who gets what when instead of some global collaborative process of vaccine allocation.

275
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:17,000
Experts are skeptical COVAX will meet its original goal of delivering 2 billion vaccine doses by the end of 2021.

276
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:23,330
As of April, they've only. Purchased around half that amount and delivered 45 million doses.

277
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,909
So they've reached a huge number of countries,

278
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:34,640
but nowhere near enough to cover even frontline health workers or other essential workers in most of the countries that these vaccines are going to.

279
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:40,700
Meanwhile, as of April, the U.S. has already administered over 200 million doses.

280
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:45,370
What COVAX is setting out to do, it's hugely challenging.

281
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:47,870
They probably won't meet their own first targets,

282
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:52,790
but they are getting vaccines into countries that probably wouldn't otherwise have them this quickly.

283
00:29:53,570 --> 00:29:57,170
Vaccine inequality is bigger than just bilateral deals.

284
00:29:57,770 --> 00:30:02,600
It's in every step of the process, from limited manufacturing to cold chain distribution.

285
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,380
Even debates around the intellectual property of vaccines.

286
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:16,100
Our current system is not a well-oiled machine at all, and there's a lot of work to do if we want to be better prepared for the future.

287
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:24,020
One of the things that we learned about pandemic preparedness is you can't really build it after the fact, and that's still what we're doing.

288
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:35,400
Hmm. That's a reaction to that video.

289
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:46,280
Swati I think that some countries have enough money to strike both multilateral fields and bilateral deals at the same time.

290
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,660
So, yeah, it was. I mean, the U.S. has a lot of.

291
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Other types of reactions.

292
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,750
What about for the next thing we've got going on?

293
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:06,500
Because there will be another global epidemic probably in our lifetime.

294
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:14,630
Right. They're trying to make vaccines now for various things like RSV, for example.

295
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:19,610
They're always monitoring avian influenza and apple viruses.

296
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:27,440
Do you think that there could be a different system that emerges in the future?

297
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:34,350
Hoda I think what's challenging with these types of.

298
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:43,799
Agreement is that there there is no enforcement mechanism which we see just in the world of human rights.

299
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,830
There is no like global watchdog.

300
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:50,660
That's like, hey, the US is committing. Human rights violations.

301
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,130
Right. Right. So, like thinking about.

302
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:03,500
In the future, like what the U.S. is incentive to not do, like bilateral and multilateral at the same time again.

303
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,240
And I know they were like, well, they had already signed, but in the future, the U.S. could be like,

304
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,190
okay, well, if I can do this bilateral and that's more beneficial to me than this.

305
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:20,540
So I'm just trying to think about like what would incentivize this and hold countries accountable.

306
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:25,580
I mean, like because we see this not just in, like, medicine, but in so many other.

307
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,850
Yeah. Yeah. Development. And even like.

308
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:36,920
When you think about treaties where like it's like a legally binding thing, people break treaties all the time.

309
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:37,380
Oh, yeah.

310
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:44,020
Has so many, like, reservations where it's like, why did you even sign the treaty if you're in the make all of these exceptions to the treaty.

311
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,340
So yeah. Yeah. Great point.

312
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:53,750
Like the line through pipeline that we talked about in class, they broke that treaty and there's no one to hold its accountable to it.

313
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,010
Right? Right. I'm not saying we shouldn't do that.

314
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:04,290
I see all of these jokes. Yes, that's about.

315
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:14,239
Anything, put us at our additional thoughts. I think we can overcome the challenges without dreary ends.

316
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,700
Like, yes, it's all true. I think everyone in this room thinks we can.

317
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:29,570
Otherwise we wouldn't be. Yes. Yes. I feel like things just take so much time, though, and generally have been in retrospect.

318
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:33,260
Right. So this isn't like. Great.

319
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:37,950
Yes. I don't know who's going to hold us accountable. Are these high income countries or.

320
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:45,440
But generally for a human rights like the United Nations, as who we think of as like holding other countries accountable.

321
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:55,640
Right. But then, like, you know, there's a lot of there has been a lot of documented atrocities happening with the Russian and Ukraine war,

322
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:01,520
in particular, human rights violations that people have been blowing the whistle on.

323
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:05,450
And I've. And nothing's been done. Right. Part of that is because.

324
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:12,760
So there's the International Criminal Court. You can't take a country to the International Criminal Court, only take an individual.

325
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:18,160
Heads of state have a lot of immunity for their crimes, and that's challenging.

326
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:22,270
So it's okay. So what if you take a general in the Army?

327
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:28,570
Well, to be tried in the ICC, you have to have signed the Rome Statute, which the U.S. has not signed.

328
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:32,020
China has not signed. I'm pretty sure Russia has not signed.

329
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:36,190
Okay. So the U.N. Security Council can recommend that the ICC take the case.

330
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:44,800
Of course, all three of those countries are not they're not going to say, yes, you can send us to the ICC and actually most of the cases the ICC has.

331
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:50,889
Heard are from African countries. That's where most of the verdicts have come from.

332
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:56,470
And I think they're only had 12 cases where they have had like a final.

333
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,780
Interesting because this is why I'm like, there is no.

334
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,060
Oh, I didn't know that. So thank you for sharing that with me.

335
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,920
Okay. Not great.

336
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:17,290
And then there are other like regional courts, like there's an entire American court until the ninth, which the US is also not so sure.

337
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,780
So is that what I will say,

338
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:28,000
is that why they're trying to circumvent certain things like freezing assets of like really high level people in Russia, for example,

339
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,670
seizing their yachts with the Global Magnets Key Act,

340
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,840
which is like a diplomatic way that where we can say like, oh, if you have assets here, we can use them.

341
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:49,990
That's how you can like circumvent. But you have to, I think, be like a dual and like citizen or like have at least property or something.

342
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:59,260
Uh huh. Interesting. Burnley I'm just curious and I do, this is like my naivete or ignorance,

343
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:05,739
but I just think that I could also set up mechanisms to regulate, to enforce it within our own country.

344
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,150
Right. Like of the US recognize. And who's to say this one.

345
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:13,050
Happened to us. But this made me think of all the vaccines that were wasted.

346
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:17,260
Right. Oh, my gosh. Yes. And they spoiled. Then it was like, why didn't the.

347
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,450
And people feel great? I mean, like as residents living in the U.S., I mean,

348
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:29,500
we feel the disgust and the guilt for people that and I know there's like so much corruption in elections and like,

349
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,399
I just think that maybe it's not the people that regulate it,

350
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:40,540
but hopefully people do say, is there a mechanism within the US that could say if we have extra vaccines,

351
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:46,300
we donate them or if we have like maybe there's policies that we can adapt to enforce that.

352
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:51,760
Because I think a lot of the system that we have, that's kind of the experiment in America.

353
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,250
It's like the, you know, the checks and balances and the cut.

354
00:36:55,270 --> 00:37:01,060
We've got to cut everybody. We've got all these different facets. To hopefully self-regulate.

355
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,350
But I mean, of course we need higher powers as well to.

356
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,629
The other countries and global actors to regulate us.

357
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:14,460
I mean, I don't think you can totally regulate yourself, but I wonder if these things you can pass into.

358
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,219
I would just be curious,

359
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:28,830
what is our incentive when we look to that principle and we're like people on our side with the principle of it, and that's not it.

360
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:34,450
I have found that it's not an argument that's compelling to the other side. That's like I would I just care about Americans, right?

361
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:42,430
This is a huge divide. I think we see in the US there are people who are like, I don't care about like like patriotism right now.

362
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,570
National necessarily cares about the rest of the world,

363
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:52,750
even though like if the rest of the world isn't vaccinated, like it will come back and hurt the population.

364
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,470
But I think those are those internal challenges.

365
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:02,589
Or maybe you make the argument like if you don't distribute vaccines, if you don't get in on this multilateral deal,

366
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:07,120
then your pandemic and your workforce will be out of work for this much longer.

367
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:11,950
This is how much money you're losing as the U.S. if you don't go into the military.

368
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,540
Because the infection in Pakistan,

369
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:22,670
which is why I was asking those questions like what is the return on investment for like that $26 and how much money would they need to invest?

370
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:25,780
Because those are the arguments that I think. Mm.

371
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:30,780
Yes. I don't know. Yes.

372
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:37,110
I thought it was interesting just in terms of the whole timeline when they were like 34.

373
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:44,760
Congrats COVAX. In a month they formed a month into the band and I was like, Oh, that was early.

374
00:38:44,770 --> 00:38:48,429
I thought the the talk about vaccine was within the month, you know.

375
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:51,940
So I just wanted other people to take on is that.

376
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,760
What was that timeline? Were people just jumping on Wednesday?

377
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,839
And maybe the the pharmaceutical companies are turned into like, oh,

378
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,110
there's a pandemic happening before the U.S. even recognize that there is printing.

379
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,840
Yeah, um, I mean, you wait. Yeah. Other people at that.

380
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,620
I mean, it did take a while.

381
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:17,750
If I'm not going to take a while for, like, W.H.O. to actually announce to the world that this is now officially a pandemic.

382
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,459
Three months. Yeah. Yeah.

383
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:32,060
So I think they might've been in talks with these companies beforehand, you know, like they actually made an official announcement, so.

384
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:44,780
There had also been research on coronavirus vaccines from before this idea that made it possible to start, accelerate, accelerate the process.

385
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:51,630
I will say the. Going back 15 weeks ago.

386
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:57,830
Yeah, I remember I said that this class would not give you more answers.

387
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:01,139
It might about some things, right? You all know what a reproduction number is.

388
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:11,460
Now, I'd like disinfection decontamination, but you're probably going to leave this class with more questions, which I certainly am.

389
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:17,670
I think you all certainly are as well. And so unless you take Dr. Seuss class, the one right after this,

390
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:21,420
where he talks about research, then maybe he's giving you some answers I haven't given you.

391
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:27,660
I don't know. But I will say, like in particular, Burnley, to your point about here in the United States,

392
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:33,239
I think that we know what the United States is like, right?

393
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:40,640
So like every time some tragedy happens or like something happens, they're like, this is not who America is.

394
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:44,460
It's like, actually, this is exactly what America is.

395
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,280
So I think that they were being, you know, the federal government in particular, we're talking like,

396
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,870
you know, the executive branch, but also like the Department of Health and Human Services.

397
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,699
We're being very,

398
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:07,470
very optimistic in thinking that they could get the entire population vaccinated and that the entire population would want to be vaccinated.

399
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:13,530
But now we know realistically that's probably only about 50% of the population.

400
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:18,120
Right. So in the future, thinking about supply chain in particular,

401
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:25,620
rather than like getting vaccine doses to cover everybody in the country four times over baby,

402
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:32,129
which is cool like one time over because we know a bunch of people are not going to opt into this anyway.

403
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:35,459
Like they were really pushing number very early on the pandemic,

404
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:45,420
the language of like flattening the curve or like, you know, population immunity that's out the window now.

405
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,690
Okay. Like I think after a certain point, like they just gave up on that.

406
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:57,690
So I think being realistic about not resource priority is like the whole toilet paper situation, right?

407
00:41:57,690 --> 00:42:02,910
Like people know they don't need all that toilet paper. Go install Labor Day.

408
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:09,630
Okay. Game changer is like 20 bucks on Amazon but like they it's just the, the, the,

409
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:16,530
the the perception of scarcity of resources that makes people over purchase.

410
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:24,630
And very early on, you know Pfizer was slightly more efficacious the Moderna but that was the one that wasn't shelf stable.

411
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:28,139
Right. It required lower levels of refrigeration.

412
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:31,950
So the Pfizer one was the one that people were like chucking left and right.

413
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:35,279
Eventually they donated them to Canada because it was close enough.

414
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,719
Right. And then Mexico because it you know, they were close enough to donate those two and still have it be like not totally defrosted or whatever,

415
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:49,440
but being realistic about what do we actually need versus just like having it all.

416
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:55,130
I think is one point that I will say yes.

417
00:42:55,700 --> 00:43:02,540
I also thought it's not in the video but like talking about AstraZeneca and how the US hasn't approved it.

418
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:07,190
And I know there are a few international students who got the AstraZeneca vaccine and then.

419
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:14,200
Like the University of Michigan did not accept it. So they had to get another vaccine.

420
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,809
And like that, I think is another thing where you're like, seriously,

421
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:24,670
like someone has been vaccinated like twice now we're talking about like what do boosters do to people that that's not even a booster.

422
00:43:24,670 --> 00:43:28,900
That's like a full, complete dosage, right?

423
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:37,479
Or like I know there was a lot of like, you know, the Johnson like people were like, I don't give you that Johnson Johnson vaccine,

424
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:43,510
although I know some people opted it for it because they don't like getting shots, so they prefer to just get one right.

425
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:51,040
But I remember seeing like a bunch of weird tech talks that were like only attractive people get the Pfizer vaccine.

426
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,160
And I was like, what is happening? Or are like.

427
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:59,830
I forget the name, but like, see, you know, something that was developed by China,

428
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:06,640
like India started developing there and China started developing their own like respective countries started developing their own COVID vaccine.

429
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:12,549
Then Pfizer went back and tried to like essentially like patent their formula.

430
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:20,500
And it's like what happened to vaccine equity? Hello. Like now you're making these things proprietary and like you can sue them, for example.

431
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,940
So we've started some open discussion. This isn't a video, but I just want to scroll through.

432
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:36,340
So Vox made that video we just watched. So this is a, a, an article related to that where poorer countries might not get vaccinated until 2023.

433
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:44,350
Right. So looking at COVID doses administered poor per 100 people zoom in.

434
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:52,300
Here is North America, Europe, South America, Asia, Oceana and Africa.

435
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:59,740
And then that's the video where it came from. And they talk about the home court advantage in particular.

436
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:06,000
I don't know who this person is, but he's verified he's the, uh.

437
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:13,100
The Serum Institute of India is what manufactured the vaccines in India.

438
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:17,180
Okay. Runs that place. Oh, okay. So like a CEO kind of person.

439
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:24,109
So respected poetess. If we are to truly unite beating this virus on behalf of the vaccine industry outside of the U.S.,

440
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:31,460
I humbly request you lift the embargo on raw material exports out of the U.S. so that vaccine production can ramp up.

441
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,820
Your administration has the details. Okay.

442
00:45:34,850 --> 00:45:38,480
So they were even like embargoed raw product materials, for example,

443
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:47,059
like I had an industrial hygiene student a couple of years ago who did a internship at Bayer Pharmaceutical,

444
00:45:47,060 --> 00:45:49,370
which is located in the middle of nowhere, Ohio.

445
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:58,879
And the reason they do that is because attached to the factory where they manufacture the drugs is a mining facility where they mine the raw material.

446
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,950
So it's like directly like a out of the ground back into a medicine being then boom, right?

447
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:09,829
So a lot of the raw materials are harvested from only certain countries as well.

448
00:46:09,830 --> 00:46:15,530
They talk about how, again, 190 countries signed on to Novavax.

449
00:46:15,530 --> 00:46:18,649
There's bottlenecks even waiving patents can fix.

450
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:27,380
So some have suggested COVID 19 vaccine makers should waive their patents, making it possible for more manufacturers to come online.

451
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:34,850
But for example, there have been reports that filters used in the manufacturing process and large plastic

452
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:41,450
bags for lining bioreactors where pharmaceutical ingredients have been mixed are run short.

453
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:53,660
Right. So even like these little like very small supply chain issues that we think about in making an actual vaccine are missing as well.

454
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:00,290
And so they kind of have like a call to action in particular.

455
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:04,370
Let me look at this. Okay. I didn't get to I don't know. Sorry.

456
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:14,879
I was trying to report me. Where's this?

457
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:21,570
Our gas map. Sorry. It's okay. Here it is. So if we look in particular.

458
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:27,690
Okay. So the Hopkins beautiful gas and the gas.

459
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:33,959
Wonderful skill that people should get. I'm not going to do it because I'm too late in my career, I guess.

460
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,450
But if AP people in particular. So here we are.

461
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:40,920
This global dashboard, this was updated an hour ago.

462
00:47:41,250 --> 00:47:47,160
We've, you know, globally to this date have had almost 700 million cases of COVID.

463
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:51,509
Almost 7 million deaths. And then vaccines administered.

464
00:47:51,510 --> 00:48:03,629
So if we look at global vaccinations for this time, in particular, a vaccine vaccine doses administered per 100,000 persons by country,

465
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:10,950
region and sovereignty, Afghanistan is technically closer to zero.

466
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:16,320
They round to the nearest whole number. Okay, so point five lesson points.

467
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:22,440
I double round out Afghanistan, Albania, Andorra in particular.

468
00:48:23,370 --> 00:48:28,890
I don't know that. Oh, sorry. Of which we should be looking at the world of zero.

469
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,180
Hello. I know you're not zero.

470
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:36,280
Okay. This is annoying.

471
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:46,620
Okay. Sorry. Let me refresh this. Global vaccinations.

472
00:48:47,830 --> 00:48:50,880
Yeah. It's all zero. That's what.

473
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:58,260
There should be a number there because I don't know the population of Zimbabwe off of the top of my head.

474
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:06,990
But if we look in particular, let's click on just a random country here like Singapore.

475
00:49:07,530 --> 00:49:11,910
Can we get more data on Singapore? No.

476
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,720
Okay. This is not helpful for me then, huh?

477
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:19,250
Okay. Sorry about that. I don't know.

478
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:24,560
So do we have any.

479
00:49:24,710 --> 00:49:31,330
Any additional thought? So just say like. I don't know, four years from now.

480
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:35,800
There is another huge outbreak of avian influenza.

481
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:43,630
Right. Are we going to try to focus on vaccination then globally or you think we should do something else?

482
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:50,060
Hood, just like I thought going back to really quick about distribution.

483
00:49:50,150 --> 00:50:00,350
Yes, it's so complex because even in low and middle income countries like syringes are standard size.

484
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:07,160
So that like bit like locks once you use it to make sure that people are not reusing syringes.

485
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:13,910
So there's the standard size. And then the dosage for the Pfizer vaccine did not work with the standards.

486
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:18,829
So even just in like the ways that like people think about like manufactured and is it accessible,

487
00:50:18,830 --> 00:50:24,630
like once it gets to those countries for them to use it? Do they even have the ability to administer it?

488
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:29,900
I think it's just like even another piece that's not considered. Yeah.

489
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:33,050
Just to show how it is. Very. Yes.

490
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:40,399
I will say maybe one thing that we could do internally here in the U.S., because all of these companies like Pfizer,

491
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,400
Moderna, AstraZeneca, they are seeking these patterns here in the United States.

492
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,780
And there is a centralized body that does issue patents.

493
00:50:51,230 --> 00:51:00,230
So if it is for like a humanitarian cause or global cause, not allowing folks to have like pop patents,

494
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:05,120
proprietary patents on these types of pharmaceutical medications.

495
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:11,420
Right. Like if it's something like, oh, you made the very desk, which is like you can like an ergonomic desk,

496
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:14,720
you can lift up fine, whatever, like do your patent on that. Right?

497
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:21,560
But if it's a humanitarian cause, why are you allowing people to have patents issued in the first place on these things?

498
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:28,170
That's just not. Yes. Berman I just think that gets really tribute for something very different.

499
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:32,180
That's right. And then there's the open. I mean, I agree that that should happen.

500
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:38,060
But then the line of like when is a a there's a lot of drugs up there.

501
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:42,930
Yes. Vaccines. Vaccines, like. That's right. So it's like and people pharmaceutically.

502
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,580
But pharmaceutical companies make a ton of money off of that pattern.

503
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:52,399
There's something about like you have the and then you can get the drug for like 20 years and you can like do a

504
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,070
small tweak and upgrade it and then upgrade your cotton or your new cotton and then you can make the generic drug.

505
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:04,550
So you're making money off of that cotton and I don't know where that they cut the line.

506
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:09,850
Here's a humanitarian issue, right? You just like h.

507
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:14,659
I just think I mean, I don't know, see some of that research going into Asia.

508
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:17,180
I mean, that's sort of like all this.

509
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:25,460
There's so much that's kept vaccines from being made or I mean, they are just the money, how people are profiting so much.

510
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:34,030
And it's like not even vaccines because like with insulin, Frederick Banting sold his patent for insulin for a dollar.

511
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:42,080
Yes. To make sure that it was accessible. And now, like so many people are dying, they can't they can't afford it anymore.

512
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:46,550
Yeah. Yeah. Do pharmaceutical companies need to be making all this money?

513
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:47,750
Oh, yes. Hold up.

514
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:56,830
I thought it was interesting that the US was like, very like, yeah, we don't need a patent for COVID vaccines, but it was the EU that was like, no.

515
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,190
Like there needs to be a patent.

516
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:05,280
There's actually a professor in the School of Public Policy Studies that Parthasarathy She does a lot of research on it.

517
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:09,610
So if you want to know more about it, she's written. Stuff.

518
00:53:09,610 --> 00:53:13,419
She does like a book and he talks about it in her class like why it was interesting

519
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:19,600
that that you because they're more of like moral guidance in their decision making.

520
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:25,629
So it was hurt that they made that decision. Yeah, but there's also the example of HIV medication.

521
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:32,590
A lot of people from African countries advocated and were like, this is so expensive, like we cannot afford it.

522
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:35,970
And it was actually successful there.

523
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:41,350
So I don't know. You say the reducing the cost of the like are drugs like.

524
00:53:41,350 --> 00:53:45,820
Yeah, hurts like by the art director. What was the thing that reduced the cost?

525
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:51,110
The latest negotiated negotiating activities. The bulk of that will happen.

526
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:57,260
So there are examples in the world of like being successful, right?

527
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:00,260
Or like that whole pharma bro situation.

528
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,680
Was that insulin or EpiPens was one of those.

529
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,590
Insulin, yeah. So I think yeah.

530
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:20,450
I feel like one thing that these countries could definitely do is at least have equitable distribution of raw materials to manufacture these vaccines.

531
00:54:20,450 --> 00:54:26,410
Because when you showed the article with the tweet by the CEO,

532
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:31,700
it actually Serum Institute of India is actually the largest manufacturer of vaccines in the world,

533
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:40,009
and they were struggling to make enough number of vaccines to support the entire population of the

534
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:44,899
country simply because they couldn't do they didn't receive the raw materials that they needed,

535
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:50,420
which is why the whole request to the president even came up in the first place.

536
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:59,360
So I feel like. If you know, they're not able to export the vaccines themselves,

537
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:08,570
at least be able to give them the materials to companies that have the resources to make.

538
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:24,130
Yeah. Think I'll be, like, an alternative to. I mean, I know a lot of companies want to, you know, have companies for their business,

539
00:55:24,170 --> 00:55:29,260
but I feel like at least for, uh, developing and for countries.

540
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,800
Just distributing them on Tuesday so that they can make their money.

541
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:38,150
Yeah. Eradication would be huge.

542
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,680
It would be nice. Yes, great point.

543
00:55:41,700 --> 00:55:53,219
I would love ten, 15 years from now, maybe five years from now, to see some of you at the heads of some of these companies.

544
00:55:53,220 --> 00:56:00,180
Like how I mean, you mentioned that video I showed a couple lectures ago was an alumni of the Ford School.

545
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:05,159
That could be you. I could definitely see like your head.

546
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:10,360
I could see you potentially at a like some kind of, like, political role in the future.

547
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:15,870
I never wanted to be a. Okay. So my advocacy role, trying to be an acting coach.

548
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:22,030
Okay. Okay. Maybe the next A340 or, you know, soccer and go to medical school, right?

549
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:30,729
Be the next PoUce or, you know. But I mean like because they run that they have just essentially like just to be frank,

550
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:34,990
like just a bunch of old people running this country right now.

551
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:40,180
They're not thinking about equity. They're not thinking about social determinants of health.

552
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:47,740
They actually probably don't know what they are. Right. You still have a lot of folks who make the decisions that are still very much like this,

553
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:56,220
like pull yourself up by your bootstraps mentality here in the United States and nothing's going to change like that.

554
00:56:56,230 --> 00:57:00,850
So sometimes, unfortunately, like as I was discussing earlier at the beginning of class,

555
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:07,120
you just have to kind of be the perfect person to disrupt and disrupt the status quo.

556
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:12,320
Therefore, for discussion. Okay, I you know, I do not think we'll take the time.

557
00:57:12,350 --> 00:57:16,389
Here we go. So this last final activity is unrelated.

558
00:57:16,390 --> 00:57:21,220
I guess it's really just class. It's a game board, basically.

559
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,450
It's I put the link in a canvas announcement. This is to help me.

560
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:30,700
So. But. There should be headings here.

561
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:39,410
I don't know. What can you see? Headings on your end. They were here earlier today.

562
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:46,070
Delete them. I thought that I up and did. And then I put a clicking undo and I was like it's not coming back.

563
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:51,060
Okay. It was there. It was there yesterday afternoon.

564
00:57:51,070 --> 00:57:54,460
Let me put it back in there this morning. Yeah. Aspects.

565
00:57:54,480 --> 00:58:02,940
Okay. Favorite aspects slash top plot topics from the class.

566
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:06,840
And this includes activities and things like that.

567
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:13,560
And then this column is what I wish we had learned.

568
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,090
Right. Again, keeping in mind like this, classes was like a survey class, right?

569
00:58:18,090 --> 00:58:21,930
It wasn't like a field trip class or anything like that.

570
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:26,580
And like, you know, we had the guest lectures and things like that.

571
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:30,330
Some, some some people feel very strongly.

572
00:58:30,330 --> 00:58:38,270
Some people are like, I love guest lectures. People like that take us lectures. So just, you know, improve this class for future offerings.

573
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:41,910
I would like to get an idea of like what you all liked about the class.

574
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:47,360
This is open range. You can be like, I love this one design. And I hated this whole idea to have it like forever.

575
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:54,030
And then what I wish we, I, we had learned and this can get as granular as you like or you're like,

576
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,780
I wish we actually talked about like HIV more or something like that.

577
00:58:58,110 --> 00:59:01,620
So we've done a jam board before in this class.

578
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:09,240
You can just use the sticky note component and then I'll let you all like I'll give you like 10 minutes to populate this.

579
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:14,940
And this is just in addition to, like your course evaluations, right?

580
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:23,930
Because of course, evaluations tend to ask you very standard questions and then people on their open ended topics get really different range.

581
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:24,340
Right?

582
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:32,070
Like I've had some that are like no one thankfully has commented on like my appearance and outfits which a lot of female professors actually get.

583
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:40,200
Yeah. Yeah. But like, you know, like generally the open comments are like she clearly thinks of ass and blah, blah, blah, which is nice.

584
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:44,190
But this is that that's not necessarily like helping you reshape the syllabus.

585
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:54,060
So I will let you do your thing and you can like if it gets too much, you can start like overlapping the Post-its on top of one another.

586
00:59:55,810 --> 01:00:05,830
And then once we're done with this activity, I will say, like, if you feel like you're done filling out your thoughts, you can just you can just go.

587
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:13,930
You could just leave. But I will stay and hang out a little bit if people still want to talk about their commentary,

588
01:00:13,930 --> 01:00:18,610
because I've gotten a couple of questions in the last few days about clarifications.

589
01:00:19,690 --> 01:00:23,410
So I just I'll I'll hang out here if you want to talk about your paper as well.

590
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:29,780
Okay. Yeah. Thanks again for being a great class.

591
01:00:55,660 --> 01:01:54,440
I'm going to do. On the written assignments.

592
01:01:54,440 --> 01:02:05,969
Hot take. I take. How did you all feel?

593
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:09,360
Like the course load was reasonable. Okay.

594
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,040
I guess I can set the record.
