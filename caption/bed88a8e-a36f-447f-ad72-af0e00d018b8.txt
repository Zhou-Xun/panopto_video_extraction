1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:40,130
Yeah. It's so nice. So you Americans.

2
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:48,340
I'm just. But I want to go back.

3
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:05,160
Britney Spears. So rather than something like that.

4
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,640
Maybe they. But I saw this one place.

5
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,070
And somehow. Hey, guys. Sorry.

6
00:01:19,810 --> 00:01:22,930
It's Sunday.

7
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,230
Amy. I read the articles like those that just started.

8
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,550
I'm going. Okay.

9
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,970
I figured. Let's see the slides.

10
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:48,260
It's a little counterintuitive. I think this one gets really hot.

11
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:57,270
Maybe you should. You want to go first and then we'll talk about.

12
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:05,590
Conflict of interest. So. First.

13
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:16,660
The guys are so stressful and like a lot of them are like little short, like, this is crazy.

14
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,890
Well, that. Stuff is 8 a.m. calls.

15
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,010
One more the monthly hundred.

16
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,610
Everything that's in the car we're going to touch base that to.

17
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,720
And then I can find an animal.

18
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:23,560
And that's its name. So that. And.

19
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:34,740
Do you guys have a 700 and. Get over fall break.

20
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,630
Don't get me a break. Okay. Yes, that's good.

21
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,850
He actually talked about extending the deadline week. I don't know if you were there that week when he talked about making this an extra.

22
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:58,810
I know things are starting to percolate. Yeah. Okay.

23
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:12,330
Yeah. Yeah. The first paper came in and I was like content to really quickly get in.

24
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,600
That was not the time, but I was going to have.

25
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:31,180
Actually speaking, I don't know if you guys have the experience of teaching plagiarism.

26
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,470
That system.

27
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:51,110
The sinking feeling that this is so glamorous that, like most of us, certainly had a very hard time with marriages like this not feeling like that.

28
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,680
Such a stressful plagiarism experience from my master's prior.

29
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,700
Yeah. So I know how stressful it would be. Yeah.

30
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:10,810
Yeah. Takes a lot of work on that sort of operating side of life.

31
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:19,350
One of those started by talking more about like let them. It's just like it changes your perspective forever and you're so much more skeptical.

32
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:27,790
And it's like, that's so true. But friends, you know.

33
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:37,030
Teaching undergraduates. A lot of students see.

34
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:44,610
Do you guys mind if I take my mask off? I get nervous because I think I need this much airflow.

35
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:51,440
Okay? I'm not even going to get what Arlene means.

36
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,100
That she gets really hot up here. She's freezing. Thank you for that.

37
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:02,440
These lines are, like, really hot. And I think there's, like, heat coming from right here.

38
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:06,970
Maybe she forgets. Cool.

39
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,480
Good morning, everyone. It's nice to see you all.

40
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:16,260
You have to close the door. I think.

41
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:24,000
So we'll go through this as I'm talking about it. But just to give you a structure of how I've sort of thought about talking to you

42
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,899
guys about community college mental health is start just thinking about college

43
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:31,860
mental health in general and thinking about some of the differences between community

44
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:36,300
colleges and larger four year public and private institutions like Michigan.

45
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,060
And then since there's very, very little research specifically on mental health for community college students in Michigan,

46
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:51,120
I brought in some of my work and thought I could share some of the early findings that I've done that sort of inspired my interest in this process.

47
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,410
But if you guys have questions or want to interact at any time, like please feel free to stop me.

48
00:06:56,430 --> 00:07:02,100
I'd like it much better that way. So but since it's morning, I thought we could start with an activity.

49
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:07,920
So just. I thought we could take a few minutes and you can either write this down or type it out, or just think about it in your head.

50
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,000
But think about your experience as a college student or the experience of a community

51
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,540
college student that you know and I want you to think about these questions.

52
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,200
How did you find out about campus mental health services when you were a student?

53
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,350
How easy was it to access mental health services?

54
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:28,800
What was the campus climate towards mental health and what were the biggest barriers or facilitators that you or people you know,

55
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:35,820
experienced when seeking mental health while you were a college student, I think gave you a few minutes to talk about it.

56
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:45,090
So it looks like you guys have some chance to talk about it. Anyone be interested in sharing either their experiences or experiences of others?

57
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,410
When thinking about where you went to college or colleges that you know.

58
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:53,889
People spend money, it's kind of cool.

59
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:57,100
They had a specific door, so it's like, Oh, you make your.

60
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:06,740
Building where the Constitution. Upstairs. And so there was a designated place in the center of Canada.

61
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,620
So that was nice. And then I also had peer counseling, too, with some of the same people.

62
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,260
So you could sign up if you didn't want to take the condition of counseling. Counseling.

63
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,500
The only thing that was, I guess, the biggest barrier was that the counseling services were limited to like two or three sessions.

64
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:33,680
So when you start to get comfortable over the counter to improve your good fight.

65
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,680
But I see the kid this time in a world. There be big.

66
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,650
Self-care. Mental health, all overall. Well, there's been a lot of.

67
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:58,260
Work on your overall. Everything. So yeah, those are definitely real experiences that people across colleges experience.

68
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:07,320
I was there, know I don't remember them, but for the mental health service that was in my undergrad.

69
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:18,090
It was a huge support. And I remember at least when I was in combat, it felt like super cutthroat, kind of everybody had their own kind of thing.

70
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,559
So I'm just thinking like, wow, I wasn't aware of what my culture isn't really maybe part of that might.

71
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:33,160
Maybe it's kind of a bit of a tester in my family, and folks are just barely starting talking about mental health as adults.

72
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:41,900
But that might be something thing. Definitely.

73
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,700
Yeah, I would say so. I like that. I don't know.

74
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:54,310
But I don't think there were officially named a mental health service.

75
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,030
But small school and.

76
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:11,590
I remember some friends who really did struggle in that area, but I think there were peer counselors like a phone line, but it was not one person.

77
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:20,380
Organized in memory of. Something else.

78
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:25,550
Oh, and I think I just. I was aware of people having mental health supports, but never thought.

79
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:37,080
Like not only. Well, those are really excellent examples.

80
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,530
And we're going to be talking on a lot of about these today.

81
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,149
And I think the biggest takeaway I'm going to start with this, you know, I probably should do this at the end.

82
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:52,860
But what I've been finding in research on this topic is just the huge amount of heterogeneity that we see in college mental health services.

83
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,409
And thinking about how that impacts, how we can measure it and how we can design interventions is a really important piece.

84
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:04,860
Or even just that the three of us in here, we see that there's a lot of heterogeneity in what is being offered and what can be access.

85
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,909
And so I like just start thinking about framing your experiences since we all have the

86
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:13,889
experience of being in college and potentially wanting mental health support in some capacity.

87
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:17,549
So I think that's helpful for going forward, just keeping these things in mind.

88
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:24,710
And we can definitely go back to them to. So thinking about college mental health overall,

89
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,820
I just wanted to start by giving a bird's eye view of what this looks like and starting with something positive,

90
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,460
which I think often when you're talking about mental health, there's not that many positive points that are being made.

91
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,850
But in the last year, the last decade or so, I would say mental health has really become a top concern in higher education.

92
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,840
I think speaking to your experiences, Alison,

93
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:57,260
I think a few years ago it wasn't something that educators and administrators at universities felt that they needed to provide for students.

94
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,030
But in the last decade or so,

95
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:07,460
we've really seen more of a focus and a want from our school based administrators and stakeholders to focus on mental health for students.

96
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,900
And this can be for what I sort of think is noble purposes like improving the health and wellbeing of their students,

97
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,110
but also from a number standpoint,

98
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:25,490
better mental health support can also increase grades and retention, which colleges like to see and likes to promote for their students.

99
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:33,410
For students attending colleges across all levels, there's been a huge increase in reporting of mental health distress.

100
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,290
And so from 2009 to 2019, we've seen about a doubling of students that are actually saying,

101
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:43,940
I have a mental health concern that's depression, anxiety, PTSD or others.

102
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:51,260
That's what we're seeing in the literature. And the number of students seeking mental health support is also drastically increasing.

103
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,460
And this varies a lot across the type of colleges where colleges are located.

104
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:02,149
But pretty much across the board there is this increased need and this increased attention that's being put to this topic.

105
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:08,180
And that's why I think it's really important to focus on this. And there's this idea that I've come across,

106
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:16,069
like in local Prentice or I don't know if you guys are familiar with that term, but especially for four year institutions,

107
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:22,070
there's sort of this expectation that students that are coming directly out of high school often and attending college,

108
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:29,240
there's sort of an expectation that the college acts as the parent in a way as they're transitioning into this new learning environment.

109
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:35,000
And mental health care is something that people are more and more expecting these institutions to provide.

110
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,310
And so that's something that also, I think, has been framing this increased interest in overall mental health.

111
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:50,130
This is something that is took my head a little bit, but it took me a little bit to grasp.

112
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:57,580
But when we're talking about community college myself, I think it's really easy to refer to thinking about how students access college resources,

113
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:05,080
whether that's counseling service, peer organizations like you mentioned, choir or other things like mental health, phone lines or apps.

114
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,460
That's sort of what people often think about when referring to college mental health.

115
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:15,490
But there is this other piece that I think is really important and how students can access community resources,

116
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,279
whether that's through community mental health programs,

117
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:25,030
private practices, other things, and then thinking again how there might be a limit to the number of services that are provided.

118
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,020
Being able to sustain support for student mental health is really important.

119
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:33,950
I think both about the college resources as well as the community setting that students are situated in.

120
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,740
It's hard to talk about mental health without talking about COVID as well.

121
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,520
And I think we probably all experience this. But across the board,

122
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,559
especially in schools and mental health concerns that have existed before COVID

123
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,420
19 have really been magnified by the isolation that students often felt,

124
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:59,760
the lack of awareness of services, the lack of ability to access services.

125
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,920
And so I think how the need has been impacted by COVID 19 has been both positive and negative.

126
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:10,530
We're seeing a greater need, and often schools are struggling to meet that need.

127
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,729
But at the same time,

128
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:20,700
I think the pandemic has brought about more attention and resources such as virtual counseling that didn't really exist before COVID 19,

129
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,930
sort of really drastically came on the scene. And so they're thinking about COVID 19 and the mental health context.

130
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:31,800
I think while it seems like the literature is kind of moving away from it,

131
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,210
it still is something that is sort of framing the conversations about this approach.

132
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:44,040
And so, again, just to sort of impact show the impacts of why I think this topic is important.

133
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:51,030
And this is across from a study in 2019 across both large four year institutions and community colleges.

134
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:56,370
Is that over half of students, 56%, are reporting that their mental health was poor or fair.

135
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:04,980
Thinking about COVID use again, only 13% of students said they use on campus counseling since the onset of the pandemic,

136
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:12,240
which is less than it was before COVID. I think it was more like a year before, so still small, but that definitely has shrunk more.

137
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:18,479
And 57% of students of other colleges do not provide us support to connect them to off campus.

138
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,250
Therapist So again, when thinking about those two pieces of what's encompassing student mental health,

139
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:30,240
that there are some holes in terms of providing whole services for students for whatever their needs are.

140
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:38,459
Yes and yes. Abuse on campus students like are they for their core in their camp.

141
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:44,790
So this is not yet a community college example. I think this sample was including students that were enrolled across the board.

142
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:48,929
So it wasn't specific between community colleges for your institution.

143
00:17:48,930 --> 00:17:57,360
There was sort of a very large swath of sort of cherry picking different samples because that's what I was wondering,

144
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:02,099
is that 13 that shrinkage was due to students moving home.

145
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,820
So not getting on campus like that could be not that it's artificial.

146
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:14,990
Yeah, I think that's what you said, right? Yeah, definitely. Because if if you aren't, it feels like, wow, that movement for safety.

147
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,730
Yeah, definitely. And I think that's an important point to think about, too.

148
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:28,190
Any questions about the overall student to meet college mental health before I move on to community colleges specifically?

149
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:34,670
Great. And so when I'm talking to probably mostly my family about this work,

150
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:40,370
I've gotten the question a lot of like why community colleges and why is this an important thing to specifically focus on?

151
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:48,379
And so thinking about the students that attend community colleges, just to give some background for community colleges nationally,

152
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,130
only about 70% of them offer any mental health counseling at all.

153
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:59,570
So there's a large proportion of students that are attending community colleges that just don't have any mental health support for them on campus.

154
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:07,280
A majority of community college counselors, when this is available, often have responsibilities beyond mental health counseling.

155
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,380
They may be academic advisors, they may be professors, they may be deans of organizations.

156
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:20,030
And so these counselors are often wearing many hats. And so they can't give their full attention specifically to counseling.

157
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:25,440
And when you're thinking about community colleges compared to four year institutions,

158
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,070
these community colleges typically have a student to counselor ratio.

159
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:32,160
That's double that of what we see for four year institutions.

160
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:35,100
So you have more students trying to access counselors,

161
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:44,970
counselors that are not being able to get their 100% attention to providing counseling services or schools that aren't offering any support at all.

162
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,780
And so there really is a dearth of support for students in this space.

163
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:56,330
One thing that seems to be one of the big differences when talking about four year institutions and community

164
00:19:56,330 --> 00:20:02,480
colleges are the students that are attending and accessing services at four year institutions like Michigan.

165
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:06,140
The majority of students are what we call traditional students,

166
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:12,710
or those that are coming directly from high school, are younger, don't really have responsibilities.

167
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,140
And in community colleges, they're more apt to serve students that are nontraditional.

168
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:21,650
They tend to be racial and ethnic minority students.

169
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,690
They more often come from low income families. They're more often first generation students.

170
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:31,909
And a lot of these students are working full or part time in addition to taking classes and

171
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:36,530
often have caregiving responsibilities and taking care of other family members or children.

172
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:43,129
And so I think it's really important when thinking about these students that that their ability to access services

173
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:47,930
and their needs are often much more heterogeneous than what we would think about for a traditional student.

174
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:53,000
And so, in addition to more limited access to care,

175
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,340
community college students often have a much higher need for mental health services, which we're seeing in the literature.

176
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:04,280
So rates of depression, anxiety and sood suicidal ideation are more frequent in community college students.

177
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:14,210
In 2018, I think it was close to I think it was 45% higher than what we were seeing in four year institutions using healthy minds data and.

178
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:22,170
And two year college students were also about 45% more likely to attempt suicide than students attending four universities.

179
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:27,300
So in addition to this lack of support there, also we're seeing this greater mental health need.

180
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:38,740
And so again, when thinking about the sort of map I've drawn of how students are able to access resource in community college students,

181
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:47,799
I think we see a lot more and could ability between the errors and how students are typically accessing services at larger institutions.

182
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,550
I think this arrow tends to be where all the attention is, giving it a lot more focus.

183
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,640
But thinking about the limitations of community college students,

184
00:21:54,940 --> 00:22:00,940
this community resources piece often is something that was more important for providing long term care for students.

185
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:08,440
However, these are often really difficult to navigate, and students don't know how to access these services at all.

186
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:14,110
And so that accessibility and availability piece is something that is really important to even help

187
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:19,090
bring students into these mechanisms to start being able to access the access services that exist.

188
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:28,389
And so I also wanted to take a time to focus specifically on community colleges in Michigan.

189
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:32,770
And so this will be I'll be sharing some of the work I've been doing over the last year to sort of

190
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:37,300
frame what we're seeing specifically in Michigan in terms of community college seeking mental health.

191
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,530
So in Michigan, nearly half of undergrads attend a community college.

192
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,959
And I think that number is sort of increasing even closer to 60% of any person

193
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,590
in Michigan that has touched a community college at some point in their life.

194
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,460
And sort of situating that in the state overall in the U.S.

195
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,850
Michigan is even among states in terms of community college enrollment and with COVID 19.

196
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:11,160
While enrollment initially dropped, we're expected to see an increase in community college enrollment following COVID.

197
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:17,500
Which will help magnify the mental health problems while schools are experiencing a reduction in state budgets.

198
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:24,480
And I think that's available to them. I don't know if you guys have heard about this, but in I think it was 2021,

199
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:33,440
Governor Whitmer passed a bill that allowed people that were over 25 to use they had funding for community college services.

200
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:39,320
And so that is why we're expected to see a greater increase in terms of community college romance following the pandemic,

201
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,790
even though enrollment across the board has decreased.

202
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:50,510
Again thinking about that diversity piece and sort of who are the students that are attending community colleges?

203
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,650
Nearly half of community college students in Michigan are students of color.

204
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,710
We have over like about two thirds of them that have family incomes that were less than $50,000 a year.

205
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:04,280
And again, about two thirds of work and study all that.

206
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:10,309
They're attending school. And so one thing that I think is also very exciting about work in this space is

207
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:15,860
community college education is often one of the biggest proponents for social mobility.

208
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:24,710
And so thinking about how we can use promoting student mental health to help students succeed in community college and help reduce some of the

209
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:30,680
equity and inequality gaps we're seeing across the board is something that I think is really important and exciting to be thinking about as well.

210
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:37,760
Just to give you guys a sense of where Michigan community colleges are.

211
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:42,030
There's 28 community colleges in Michigan and three tribal colleges.

212
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,939
And this is something that I've been really interested in,

213
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,340
is why are tribal community colleges sort of considered a different group, the community colleges.

214
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:57,450
And I actually found that there's the Michigan Community Colleges Association, and tribal community colleges are not allowed to join them.

215
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:02,600
But when I'm thinking about this work, I think that it's very important to include both.

216
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,390
And so our tribal colleges are here, here and here.

217
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,900
But you can see across the state sort of the spread of community colleges where students can access these services.

218
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,720
So again, thinking a little bit more about this tribal community college piece, which is something that I've been really interested in recently.

219
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,859
For those of you that may not know, tribal colleges are institutions that offer higher education with an emphasis on

220
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,880
probably preserving traditional Native American cultural values and practices.

221
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:39,510
Often these institutions are on or near tribal lands, and so we have three of them in Michigan.

222
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:43,139
And these functioned very similarly to a community college,

223
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:48,150
is that they often are in more rural areas and have smaller student populations

224
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,430
and are under-resourced that I haven't really understood the funding mechanism,

225
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:59,249
but tribal colleges are only funded federally and so some of the statewide funding

226
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,900
mechanisms that exist for community colleges are not available to our tribal schools,

227
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,980
which is something that I'm really interested in understanding about.

228
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:11,340
So if anyone knows anything about this space, please let me know.

229
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:21,030
When thinking about sort of the additional limited barriers that students that are

230
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,530
both community college students and community college students at tribal colleges,

231
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:33,150
one of the biggest barriers that we've heard is transportation, and especially when thinking about accessing those community resources.

232
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:41,340
There also is a dearth of behavioral health clinicians in these areas, especially in the U.P. and Clara.

233
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,240
I think this Clara will sort of tie in to your point about taboo.

234
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:54,570
But often in these tribal community colleges, the populations are very connected and there is stigma in terms of seeking mental health.

235
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,849
Students are worried about, will someone I know know I'm accessing mental services?

236
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,139
And that is something that might get back to their family and is something that seems

237
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,340
to be a really big barrier in terms of seeking mental health care in this space.

238
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:14,040
These barriers put a heavy mental health burden on mental health specialists.

239
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:21,780
I think in Michigan, each community tribe, college, tribal college has one mental health provider for their students.

240
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:27,300
And so it's something that there really isn't a lot of support available for these students.

241
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:35,640
Another point that I've been finding in conversations with these schools is a big question.

242
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,240
They have are evidence based interventions,

243
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:44,610
evidence based specifically for community college populations and specifically for tribal college populations.

244
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:52,029
In all of the research that I've been able to find so far, the evidence based interventions that have been given to community,

245
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:56,250
to college students have been validated in four year institutions.

246
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:01,800
And so when you think back to our conversation about the difference between the students that are attending these populations,

247
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:07,950
that is another big problem in the space and something that I think is really important for researchers to address moving forward.

248
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:14,490
So to understand more about community colleges in Michigan,

249
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:22,440
I've been working on a landscape analysis and I'll just really briefly go through some of our very early findings,

250
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,850
but I'm very happy to talk more about this if people love interest later.

251
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:34,830
But we weren't able to find much information about what actually is happening at community colleges in Michigan,

252
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:39,360
what services are being provided, where students are accessing services.

253
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:48,090
And so we set off and I had a series of metrics that I was interested in gathering both for community colleges and from the community.

254
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:53,910
So at schools we were interested in the number of mental health providers that are available on campuses across the state.

255
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,560
What are the off campuses resources that colleges can connect students to?

256
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,660
Are there presence of things like a behavioral intervention team to help support student mental health?

257
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:11,640
And are there formal contracts with off campus providers to again facilitate where students form that era of seeking resources?

258
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,099
I so was interested in what are the community resources available for students?

259
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,580
Are there CAMH availability? Are there psychiatric services?

260
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:24,150
How easy is it for students to access private practice?

261
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,379
And so those are some of the things that I've been interested in and sort of scoping out

262
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:32,640
since there isn't really a way to track that or understand that in Michigan right now.

263
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:41,909
To do this, I was able to look both at community college websites to again sort of put myself in the

264
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:46,140
shoes of a student and to understand if I was a student and needed to access services,

265
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:56,159
how would I find out about it at my school? I also was looking at the CMH Resources and I did a survey from with Michigan CAMH just to sort of

266
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:01,350
understand what are the services that are provided and are these available for community college students?

267
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:07,140
When we were drawing our conceptual models two weeks ago, I talked about this a little bit.

268
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:13,170
But one thing that I think is really interesting is that community college students often fall through the cracks here

269
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:18,840
and that community colleges think that the community that they're in should be supporting students in their services.

270
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:23,640
But these community resources are like these people aren't necessarily taxpayers.

271
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:28,499
My money can't be used to support them. And so you get students that don't know where to go.

272
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:34,950
And often no one really wants to take advantage of providing services to them, and that's when they're actually really challenging.

273
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:42,149
Using the information from the landscape analysis I've been working on sort of compiling a

274
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:48,030
report for state schools that compares them to other schools around the state of Michigan.

275
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:53,670
And so just to give you a sense of some of the metrics that these schools have been interested in is sort of overall,

276
00:30:53,670 --> 00:31:00,690
how is my school doing, what resources are available at my school, and how does this compare to other schools across the state?

277
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:05,630
What how our student our perceived student access,

278
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,510
how easy it is for students to understand what services are available, where opportunities to improve.

279
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,350
And what is the community resource availability?

280
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,680
How resource how high resource or low resources is my community for providing support for students as well?

281
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,040
And that's something that our schools have been really interested in wanting to know,

282
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:29,300
sort of where do they fit in terms of the larger state structure.

283
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:34,910
I've also found that there is a huge amount of heterogeneity across Michigan.

284
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:42,080
And so understanding that is something that's been a little bit interesting in terms of presenting this information to schools.

285
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:49,970
But just some early statewide findings. The median number of mental health professionals for community colleges in Michigan is two.

286
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,710
We have one outlier with Oakland Community College.

287
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:58,880
They have like 60 mental health providers across. They have like multiple satellite campuses.

288
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:09,500
So that's why I went with the media. But about just shy of 40% offer a behavioral intervention team.

289
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,820
About half offer off campus referrals and about half offer tele therapy.

290
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:21,710
Although we think that this number is likely increase over the last year since COVID, but still about half are reporting it.

291
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,660
Still, there were a lot of missing data in terms of what we could find.

292
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:33,059
And so I've been conducting interviews with stakeholders at each community college, and I think this is really interesting.

293
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:37,379
So I'll really briefly go over some of the findings here. In these interviews,

294
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:44,760
we really wanted to ascertain what are the availability and accessibility of school resources for students attending Michigan community colleges?

295
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,990
What are the availability, accessibility of local resources, and how are these services promoted and available for students?

296
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:59,580
In the process of completing this. But I think we have about 20 of 31 of community colleges that we've talked to,

297
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:04,890
but we're really trying to reach 31 to make sure everyone is represented in this work.

298
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:06,959
But across the board,

299
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,830
what we're hearing is that some of the strengths that community college mental health services can offer are their availability to students.

300
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,780
When students are able to find these resources, there isn't a large wait time.

301
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:22,679
I don't know if any of you have tried to access services like caps here,

302
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:27,270
but when I was a student you'd like reach out and they'll be like, We can see you in a month.

303
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,280
And so the way that community colleges structure their work right now allows

304
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:36,360
students to access services a little more quickly than they have in the past.

305
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,320
There also is a large amount of appointment numbers that seems to be available for students when services are offered.

306
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,080
I think similar cogency your point that there was like two or three times you could access services.

307
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,340
Often community colleges have a gap like a limit per se,

308
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:57,750
but they're not enforcing it and that they're able to sort of bend the rules to make

309
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:01,440
sure that students are able to access services for as long as they really need it.

310
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:06,480
I think this, again, ties in sort of the change that we're seeing towards mental health.

311
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:13,050
But administration support for the service has also been increasing a lot over the last few years.

312
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:20,009
And then that collaboration with faculty and using faculty as a bridge to connect students to mental health services seems

313
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:25,530
to be one of the most common and successful ways to actually let students know that these services are available to them.

314
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:30,390
And so from some of my interviews, I pulled a few quotes.

315
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:37,800
One counselor told us that we are fortunate that we can provide students as many appointments as needed as long as there is a demonstrated need.

316
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,280
And that's quite different than what we fear from a place like Michigan.

317
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,899
Another school told us that our president has been the biggest supporter of

318
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,650
improving mental health by allowing us to offer a full spectrum of services.

319
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,830
So, again, getting into that administrative support.

320
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:59,540
However, there are a ton of barriers that we're seeing in Michigan for accessing mental health services.

321
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:04,820
The number of counselors and funding for counseling services is very small in Michigan.

322
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,880
And counseling staff are often overburdened.

323
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:15,380
It's also very difficult for community colleges to let students know that these services are available and even when they are available.

324
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,360
Many schools talked about the physical location of the counseling office being a problem for them.

325
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:26,810
Counseling offices are often situated in academic advising, and if someone is in mental health distress,

326
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,620
they might be hesitant to like walk through one of the busiest offices on campus with people that they know around.

327
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:39,350
And so that is something that quite a few colleges have been talking about over the last few years.

328
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:45,010
Demonstrating some of these barriers. Someone told us an issue is funding.

329
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:48,259
Nobody really wants to fund mental health services at community colleges,

330
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:52,010
and we don't have a whole lot of leeway, leeway for funding funding from other places.

331
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:57,710
And another councilor, as well as the biggest barrier to our counseling services, is students not knowing about it.

332
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:03,080
And so even if resources are exists, if that's something that's, you know, about, they can't use it.

333
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:08,240
When thinking about college and community integrations.

334
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:17,600
This is something that seems to be a place for future exploration and figuring out how to make this a more smooth transition.

335
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:24,080
Often provider availability in communities are low, that psychiatric services may or may not be available,

336
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:29,420
that students might have difficulties getting transportation to these outside services off campus,

337
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:33,980
and that their insurance status is something that can be problematic and seeking long term care.

338
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,300
And so this is the first quote here is from one of our tribal colleges, I believe.

339
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:45,430
And she said, Transportation is a big, big problem for students accessing community resources.

340
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:51,610
The nearest psychiatric services are two counties away. For me, I have to drive over 75 miles to get there.

341
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,790
And so thinking about sort of the scope of Michigan and especially in the Upper Peninsula, where it's very low resourced,

342
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:07,540
that that is something that a student can't physically can do when they have all these other class work and obligations to go to take up

343
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:17,319
their time to another person from a community college in southeast Michigan said There may be a plethora of providers in our community,

344
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:22,420
but the ones that students are able to access, given their limitations financially or with regard to insurance,

345
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:27,970
is going to paint a really different picture. And so I think it's important to think about that, the data we're presenting.

346
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:33,010
And even if community resources are high, our students may have people that access it.

347
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:39,750
But overall funding seems to be the biggest issue for community college students.

348
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,550
It's universally what was quoted as the most significant barrier.

349
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,230
So I wanted to look a little bit into funding mechanisms for community colleges.

350
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:59,099
It seems like. About 5050 in terms of how community colleges are funding their medical services, either through grants.

351
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:06,570
And so there's a strengthening institutions program grant that many Michigan community colleges are using to fund their counseling services.

352
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:11,190
The caveat with that is these grants are offered for a few years at a time.

353
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:18,940
And so it's hard to convince an administrator to hire a counselor if funding is only secured for 2 to 3 years often.

354
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:29,790
And so these are what seems to be working for schools when government funding and school funding budget allocation is not available.

355
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:37,470
But that is something that often community colleges can't swing just because there is such a resource low setting.

356
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:44,550
There also has been the high, the hurt, the Higher Education Emergency Relief Fund for COVID.

357
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,320
And with that, government funds could potentially be used for student mental health services.

358
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,190
However, to my understanding, no schools in Michigan are utilizing this for funding any mental health support and students,

359
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,470
and it's more use for student need overall.

360
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:08,530
And so thinking about next steps of this work, I'm really hopeful to use some of the data that healthy minds has collected.

361
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,140
They are starting to increase the number of community colleges that they enroll.

362
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:19,070
But I think this is I know that I've talked about it, too. I wanted to give you guys a little snippet of what healthy minds is,

363
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:25,190
but hoping to use this to see what is the state of mental health on community college campuses overall,

364
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:30,890
and also how might this compare to other four year large institutions that are participating in this survey?

365
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:37,459
Another next step that I think is really promising in terms of increasing community college mental

366
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,350
health services is the potential of digital mental health interventions for community college students.

367
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:49,820
They often can offer alternatives to overburdened counseling systems and provide anonymity for students,

368
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:54,710
which can be important when stigma is a piece in terms of the services seeking that's being offered.

369
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:58,130
But this is still a very new field.

370
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:05,210
And so understanding how this works specifically in the community context is something that I think researchers should focus on first and next steps.

371
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,310
With. These are some of the benefits that you see for using these as especially for rural and tribal schools which have limited resources.

372
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:21,030
Not being able to use a digital mental health intervention might help with some of the concerns that I talked about previously.

373
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:28,920
And there is like a community college conglomerate in California that is starting to test these specifically

374
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,979
for community college students to understand if these evidence based programs work specifically for students,

375
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,330
since often these are tested in not community settings.

376
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,439
But there still are many barriers to digital mental health interventions,

377
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,850
including cost to school buying from students and the limited or lack of evidence.

378
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:51,150
And is this effective for this population?

379
00:40:53,910 --> 00:41:00,389
And then overall, what's needed is research specifically for community college students is still really, really limited.

380
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:09,930
And so I'm hopeful that other people will think this is important to the funding piece, I think is something that's also really important.

381
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:18,240
So thinking about ways that policymakers can be used as tools for bringing increased community college student mental health support.

382
00:41:19,470 --> 00:41:22,230
And then a third thing that from my review of the literature,

383
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:29,910
I think it has a lot of room for improvement is the relationship between college services and community services for an improving mental health,

384
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:34,979
but overall just a better understanding of the strategies to improve for mental health availability

385
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:38,910
and accessibility for students is the first step in how to implement these in schools,

386
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:43,920
especially those that are lower research communities, is what is really important here.

387
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,420
That is my. Thoughts on community college mental health.

388
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:59,860
I've been working on an Instagram to promote this, so if you want to follow, we have eight followers, so we try to share resources there as well.

389
00:41:59,870 --> 00:42:15,200
But I'm happy for any questions or comments. Tell your data visualization person me.

390
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:22,690
Like I said, that way too late last night. Like working. I think it was pretty awesome.

391
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:29,140
Triangle. Yeah. I forget where they included in your name.

392
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:37,170
There was a quarter. Yeah. So I've talked to two counselors at two different tribal communities, two in Michigan.

393
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:43,469
Really trying hard to get that they're on board because I think it's such an important population to focus on.

394
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:50,910
And like when I was going through the literature that there's nothing on tribal colleges and mental health that I was able to find.

395
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:56,129
Maybe I should go to the Life Sciences Library to get some help on that.

396
00:42:56,130 --> 00:42:59,430
But this is a a group that's not.

397
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:09,010
Very studied people. There's a lot I know just from New Mexico with a huge tribal population, and it's a really different community to work with.

398
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,680
They're very and understandably so, very protective of their community.

399
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:22,450
I just think that the digital health piece that would be so cool, at least in New Mexico and the rest of the reservations don't have any other.

400
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:32,440
Yeah, exactly. And that's one thing that we've talked about, like for when COVID happened and one of the tribal schools and AP,

401
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:35,889
they switched really quickly to virtual services, which was great,

402
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:39,400
but students that were living on the reservation often couldn't connect to Zoom,

403
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:46,330
to have these services and a sort of a shared to me of a student that would like drive 20 minutes to the top of a hill.

404
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:51,100
And that's where they were able to like join counseling services from their car.

405
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:57,189
So that's something that we see. And that's also something that's been seen like in other rural settings across Michigan.

406
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:03,550
And just that the infrastructure doesn't really exist to support some of these mental health, digital mental health interventions.

407
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:13,360
And I think with the pivot to a lot of virtual counseling following COVID 19, students sort of felt left behind when they weren't able to access that.

408
00:44:15,170 --> 00:44:19,000
So I think it's this is something that I've been thinking through a lot.

409
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:21,410
Like, I think that's a really important piece.

410
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:29,990
But also there's like this pass that students have that many students like the flexibility that these digital services can provide.

411
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:37,590
And so I think thinking about ways to, like, encourage policymakers to think about how can we fund Internet infrastructure,

412
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,810
got to make sure everyone has access to the computers and smartphones and tablets is something that is really important pieces as well.

413
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:59,840
Do you have data on the turnaround? Yeah.

414
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:07,969
So that's something that also is really varied. There seems to be like these different flavors of community college students.

415
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:12,110
And I think thinking about how to serve those needs differently is something that's hard.

416
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:18,300
We're seeing more and more students that are attending community college classes while in high school as like

417
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:24,860
one group of students that have a very specific need and are often like only in for like a few semesters.

418
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:31,100
Then we have students that are using community colleges as a stepping stone before transferring to other institutions.

419
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:36,979
Or we have this group of students that may be working full time and often take a lot longer

420
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:41,570
to complete their degree programs where they might be taking a class or two every semester,

421
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:49,180
but that they're attending these schools for a longer than like the two year institutions that they're built to be that.

422
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:56,280
Answer your question. I had like so many thoughts on starting down.

423
00:45:57,330 --> 00:46:04,889
And one of the along that infrastructure line too is that it was something that came up as like something they would

424
00:46:04,890 --> 00:46:11,160
use the funding for in terms of taking all of these policies covered whenever there's a crisis in their funding.

425
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:18,710
You know, there was a burst and then it goes away. So we have to think about strategically using those funds to build a structure.

426
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:25,250
Yeah. Supports and obviously counselors, hiring counselors, that's critical.

427
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:31,610
But if there's a way of figuring out a way to get correspondence or something that people are structure wise.

428
00:46:31,970 --> 00:46:36,860
Yeah. And I think what I've seen most is sort of the use of those hurt funds.

429
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:41,920
So there's higher education. I think it was like half three that had these I.

430
00:46:42,290 --> 00:46:43,580
So many. There's so many.

431
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:54,379
But I think the problem with these funds is, again, they're like sort of this is the government has like attention on COVID right now.

432
00:46:54,380 --> 00:47:01,430
And so for the students that are attending school in this moment right now, that we're able to provide laptops and hotspots and things like that,

433
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:09,319
but with the government changing that is that's funding, that's not guaranteed moving forward.

434
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:16,580
And so thinking sort of about the sustainability of these programs, if students if one group of students has it but the next,

435
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:20,180
you know, the funding to do that, I think that's really challenging.

436
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:25,040
And that also goes to sort of like the nonprofit and the grant funding mechanisms,

437
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:30,050
which seem to be more flexible in offering these services but aren't sustainable.

438
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:38,290
And so I think with those as the funding mechanisms, it often puts like another burden on these counselors that are already overburdened.

439
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:44,240
But every three years they actually be submitting a new grant and sort of the future of that is up in the air.

440
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:49,309
I don't see that as sort of a sustainable way for providing this infrastructure.

441
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:54,860
So I think a different policy approach is needed to to make sure that's available for all students.

442
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:03,360
One of the questions I had to thinking about potential research topics or ideas,

443
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:09,730
or that idea of just sort of community connections and whether or not community college can

444
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:14,740
whether you would look at that as an outcome like your connection to services kind of outcome,

445
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,999
like there's a warm handoff that gets to student services,

446
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,150
which I know I can see delving into all of the different concerns as a resident of the community.

447
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:29,520
Like all of those elements that are for students to.

448
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:37,010
There'd be services. But if there's. He was like a person who was not necessarily a counselor, but.

449
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:47,980
Yeah. The Connector, the logistics, if you're out there and there aren't many community colleges in Michigan,

450
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:54,790
but there are a few that sort of have it's like a student support specialist, I think is the more common term.

451
00:48:55,150 --> 00:49:00,490
And that often is a place where they can connect students both on campus and community resources.

452
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:01,959
I think with that,

453
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:10,510
just like the awareness of that service overall is something that doesn't seem very like well known across community college populations.

454
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:17,290
And then another complaint that I've sort of heard from these community colleges is that they refer to

455
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:22,419
just two services and they do everything that they can to facilitate that handoff if it's available,

456
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:29,200
which only a few schools are doing this, but then there's like no feedback and they don't know our students are actually accessing these services.

457
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:32,800
And I know that there's like HIPA is a big concern in privacy.

458
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:38,710
And also thinking about student preference, like if they have a mental health concern, they might not want their college to know.

459
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:43,840
And that varies a lot by student. Some students want their community colleges to provide everything.

460
00:49:44,290 --> 00:49:53,079
But I think like if there is a way for it to be more of like a back and forth instead of just like the errors out that

461
00:49:53,080 --> 00:50:00,280
schools could be like communicating across school and community resources that I think ideally would create much more.

462
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:07,260
Holistic and sustainable support. But I don't see that happening really in Michigan at all, at least.

463
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:14,110
So you're talking also to the committees. You didn't talk to the same agents.

464
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:18,340
They're like that back to the community college.

465
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:21,310
That is something that I'd love to do.

466
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:27,490
I've had like an informal conversation with the director of the Community Mental Health Association of Michigan.

467
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:34,839
But again, he's sort of like bird's eye view and haven't really had a chance to talk to like specific creatures

468
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:39,100
about what they're actually doing or what they would be able to do or interested in doing.

469
00:50:39,490 --> 00:50:48,820
And I think in Michigan, the CMH structure is also very, very like, ah, I think like the Washtenaw Community Mental Health Services.

470
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:53,720
It's like super impressive everything they offer. But then we like look at the one in a peanut.

471
00:50:53,740 --> 00:51:00,340
They're covering like a five county radius and they have a lot more of those structural barriers.

472
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:04,690
And so that's about it. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:17,509
I was also thinking, speaking of the tribal populations there are I can't remember.

474
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:24,550
And I think some of these were like in Alaska, but there are sort of different models of like really cool health centers that benefited mental health.

475
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:35,650
That was very community based. Which could be kind of neat to look at it depending on how you find that space.

476
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:40,500
But there are some kind of. Community place.

477
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:46,749
In that population, not the community college side.

478
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:54,629
But like it might be interesting, but. Yeah, I haven't yet, but yeah, but it's a pretty neat literature.

479
00:51:54,630 --> 00:52:01,890
And also I feel like there's there's one particularly in Alaska, I think that's like a, you know, amazing example.

480
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:09,540
It's it's like pretty dependent on the last few years ago. It's. Kind of delve into some of the issues that you were talking about and also to

481
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:15,270
design mental health and housing in the promise and still a promissory note,

482
00:52:15,330 --> 00:52:22,090
if we really don't know. But there are there's certainly so much interest and activity in that area.

483
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:25,110
Yeah, we have to figure it out also.

484
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:30,570
And I'm sure if you guys haven't seen this, but The New York Times. On mental health right now.

485
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:34,310
And they just had a. Piece of analysis.

486
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:40,800
This is all a little bit off, but in the digital space there.

487
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,960
There's always been so much interest in like this.

488
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:52,850
Solace, not being able to figure out in the moment somebody is going to know from their skin response or something like.

489
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:00,370
They could intervene at an individual health like nudge and sort of how that relates to suicide prevention.

490
00:53:01,030 --> 00:53:04,409
Matthew. Anyway.

491
00:53:04,410 --> 00:53:08,580
So I just thought it was a really interesting read and we haven't read that particular one.

492
00:53:08,580 --> 00:53:12,120
But yeah, there's so much potential.

493
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,770
So it's hard to, you know, we're so not there yet.

494
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:24,210
Yeah, that idea I'm trying to figure out and just sort of thinking strategically for you to like,

495
00:53:25,230 --> 00:53:31,020
could there be these, like, focused threats to your research that.

496
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:36,380
Start talking to people around here about terms like digital space.

497
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:40,579
Tribal space. Mental health.

498
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,160
Community college. College campus. It's a good place to.

499
00:53:44,910 --> 00:53:48,600
I think that that digital health piece, I'm so fascinated by it.

500
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,220
To me,

501
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:58,920
I had like a few informal conversations with some of like the mental health that are being like wherewithal and talk campus and things like that.

502
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:06,659
And it's just like so fascinating to talk to them from a research perspective and be like, So what is the evidence for what you're doing?

503
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:16,080
And Oh yeah, like we internally have like looks at this and that's evidence based, but they're building it as an evidence based intervention.

504
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:26,520
And so like the marketing side of it for something that is like this public good is like a very different space to be in.

505
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,610
And it's just been a very interesting to have some of those conversations.

506
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:42,120
It's weird. Yeah. Well, my wife, my former costar, is now working for in modern times and things like that.

507
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:46,360
She was interviewed with comments that perhaps some relaxation.

508
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:53,229
And she is going to make it for director of research or something like a big, you know, it would've been really cool.

509
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:58,030
But then that was kind of her take to things like that.

510
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:03,740
I guess she was very she struggled a lot to figure out she's very interested in this.

511
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:07,240
That was sort of her staying home and wanting to.

512
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:14,900
Do it at the industry is like so far ahead of the evidence now that it's like a tricky space.

513
00:55:15,170 --> 00:55:22,069
Yeah, but maybe think and so forth and so important to figure out what what can be

514
00:55:22,070 --> 00:55:27,400
addressed by that and what is more like that matching up needs and modality this.

515
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:35,560
Awesome, fascinating, and something that I ran out of time to like, including this.

516
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:39,790
But if anyone's interested in sort of this community college, digital, mental health space,

517
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:47,290
I think like last week there was like a review of like digital intervention specifically for community colleges.

518
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:51,130
So that's on my to read list if.

519
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:55,660
Yeah, I could send that to you as well. Yeah. I just had two more thoughts.

520
00:55:55,750 --> 00:56:02,900
Number one, my neighbor, Southern California Community College Consortium.

521
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,630
I feel like that's like her thing where she's isolated by her for like college in California.

522
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:14,590
I don't know how she does. And so she, like, flies on to this.

523
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:22,430
But anyway, she is really knowledgeable about the community college system in California and these big initiatives and just a lot of teamwork.

524
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:27,339
So that's cool if you need it. And she's like the one person I love super enthusiastic.

525
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:33,480
And she's like, community college just, like, are my thing. I just thought of her, like, I feel like you should meet her.

526
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:36,520
So there's a lot of work to do.

527
00:56:36,550 --> 00:56:39,100
Oh, she's very in that space.

528
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:47,319
And then the other person I this person, I can't remember their name, but there's someone in social work who does travel,

529
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:56,440
mental health, sort of like a diabetes meeting, but she's much more like community based mental health.

530
00:56:56,440 --> 00:57:01,390
But it's interesting. So now I can go further down that road and I'll figure out for me.

531
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:05,650
Yeah, because I have talked with Addy Weaver over in social work.

532
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:09,250
Is that who you're talking about? Yeah, because she does like rural.

533
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:13,320
Rural health is her disease. Yeah. Yeah. So she's.

534
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:17,620
She's cool. Okay, good. So you're connected by circumstance, like working on that person.

535
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:25,270
Okay. Yeah, I know you're on this, like, very interesting the last few years, like,

536
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,069
where community college health, mental health is sort of like it's very regional.

537
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:33,670
And so we have like California that has this weird conglomeration.

538
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:43,209
And then this organization called Jed has like a cohort in Georgia where like all the Georgia University community colleges are like in this cohort,

539
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:49,030
I like the Jed program. And then like right now there's like a consortium being set up in Connecticut.

540
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:52,750
So there's like very weird pockets of where this is being talked about.

541
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:59,060
But like the Midwest seems to be pretty. Jed does that?

542
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:03,200
Is that community college specific? It's broader.

543
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:10,760
But they have like I think they're like Georgia cohort includes like community colleges, campus university.

544
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,989
So again, thinking I would be curious your thoughts about this,

545
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:20,780
but I keep going back to sort of like the comparison between four year institutions and community colleges.

546
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:24,560
I sort of think that is a very compelling policy piece.

547
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,330
I don't know. Or maybe just, like, focus on community college system.

548
00:58:31,780 --> 00:58:40,310
But. I mean, I think for like the first paragraph paragraphs, the program proposal, and you need that comparison.

549
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:46,399
And I think one of those articles and my third one was that article that was talking

550
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:53,450
about like the diagnostic versus mental health considerations and what wasn't there.

551
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:57,890
Like there were more symptoms being acknowledged.

552
00:59:00,530 --> 00:59:09,260
Like, I think. Just sort of highlight that difference between kind of awareness and functioning and certainly.

553
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:17,160
College students. Harrison And then the thing about having the spaces available.

554
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:25,290
I was really surprised. I'm thinking there's so much need, but.

555
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:30,720
Lack of awareness, a lack of time. What is it that is causing her to?

556
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:34,950
Is available for counseling slots. That seems unusual.

557
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:42,430
Yeah. Yeah. And I think with that and it could be just like the counselors that we were talking with,

558
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:48,819
I think the people that are working in the community, college mental states are just like some of the most inspiring people I've met.

559
00:59:48,820 --> 00:59:52,780
And so they go above and beyond to make that space and make that time.

560
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:58,389
And some schools have done this better than others and sort of setting up like triage thing.

561
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:03,280
So like, if a student comes into our office, like in crisis, this is like the plan of action.

562
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:11,860
We have to be able to like make space for them. And I think in smaller, more like tightknit communities, it often is easier to navigate those like.

563
01:00:12,740 --> 01:00:17,610
Things, whereas other larger universes feel like a very particle sized approach to it.

564
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:32,940
Thank you for listening to me. Yeah, it's a great interest and great.

565
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:44,760
Do you want me to log out of this or. Oh, yeah, I guess I.

566
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:52,280
My. Friend.

567
01:01:16,010 --> 01:01:19,340
In my in my white tennis shoes are making my.

568
01:01:24,600 --> 01:01:28,470
I think they're kind of under. I need to be more efficient with great numbers.

569
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:40,070
Yeah. Very easy for them to solve all.

570
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:46,540
She was. They said you.

571
01:01:55,630 --> 01:02:01,710
Not for anything. It's kind of.

572
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:11,480
I tell myself I'm going to go on tour. I know that.

573
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:16,680
Have a do. I want to see the boots.

574
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:26,250
I'll get back to you. I love the school.

575
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:35,510
The. They're great.

576
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:42,570
There should be some. Yeah.

577
01:02:47,810 --> 01:02:51,260
Yeah. Yeah.

578
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:54,860
Then I get an idea. Exactly.

579
01:02:56,150 --> 01:03:34,830
Yeah. I think we're onto a weapon. What do you do there? My little timer concerns.

580
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:44,420
Right. Yeah.

581
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:49,580
I was going to say to you, I just I love those reports that look like they will be super helpful for.

582
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:05,910
Understanding. It's like thinking about Florida.

583
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:21,460
We've worked with the team over time. So.

584
01:04:30,150 --> 01:04:33,890
Yeah. I mean, if you could. Yeah, I mean, I still like it.

585
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:39,989
Try to do this in so many different projects. It's like that mapping of Here's what's available and it's hard.

586
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:47,700
It gets out of date and you know, all those data being updated, it seems like, you know, figure out how to do that.

587
01:04:49,680 --> 01:05:00,470
But the person. Oh.

588
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:19,130
Sorry. 6000 windows a day.

589
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:45,030
Yeah. It'll be interesting, Amy, to see like to what comes in in terms of what you have access to in healthy minds.

590
01:05:45,030 --> 01:05:50,540
What. What's happening around in terms of what might be.

591
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:58,090
A conversation you started.

592
01:05:59,780 --> 01:06:04,360
It's. Or. This is like.

593
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:15,510
There are. Hearings on what future?

594
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,610
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah. It's really cool.

595
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:29,930
Interesting. Cool.

596
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:36,580
Okay. Well, we can talk about research misconduct.

597
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:45,669
This is one of those, like, sessions that. Is one of those are CRC sessions and we can just kind of dove into a few different

598
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:52,420
examples and like definitions and then also talk about kind of like what to do.

599
01:06:54,010 --> 01:07:00,070
And then if we have time, I have time maybe to look at some of these videos which.

600
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:09,580
I think we're kind of fun. Like, I don't know, queer things, you know, like and I says these training videos and they're like with actors that are,

601
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:12,650
you know, they're like a little hokey, but I think so.

602
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:15,310
Oh, are they? Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

603
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:20,090
So I feel like some now they're like when they first came out, like, nobody's seen them and they're not really, you know, but,

604
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:28,740
but I think they do kind of illustrate these points well and just I think so much of all this like research misconduct stuff and I hope

605
01:07:28,880 --> 01:07:36,890
comes out in these cases and readings and stuff is like it can be it can be really good legis like to the point that you're like,

606
01:07:36,890 --> 01:07:40,480
oh my gosh, I can't believe that happened that they got away with that for so long and it's become,

607
01:07:40,970 --> 01:07:47,570
you know, or it can be like a real gray zone and like then it's like really hard to figure out what to do.

608
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:51,200
And I think it's just to, like, center the conversation of like.

609
01:07:52,790 --> 01:08:02,160
You know, there can be really big famous people you're working on a research project with and if you feel like, Oh, this is something not right here.

610
01:08:02,660 --> 01:08:07,670
As a graduate student, I don't have a lot of, you know, power in that situation.

611
01:08:07,670 --> 01:08:13,190
And so I think the pressures can be really different kind of from a like a quote unquote,

612
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:20,780
like an underling perspective compared to like, oh, the API and who's role kind of is impacted in which way.

613
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:25,070
So I think there's a lot in this whole space so we can talk about those.

614
01:08:26,330 --> 01:08:35,239
Okay. So just to kind of dove in to research misconduct and there's lots of different forms of research misconduct,

615
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:46,340
but the Big B is this idea of fraud, data fabrication, so like really making stuff up, which really happens.

616
01:08:47,820 --> 01:08:54,920
The other thing that's a little bit more getting into the gray zone is that idea of like ignoring the wrong data, right?

617
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:57,980
Ignoring data that doesn't quite fit your hypothesis.

618
01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:02,130
You're like, Oh, you know what? Maybe it's an outlier.

619
01:09:02,190 --> 01:09:05,430
Maybe it's, you know, I'm just cleaning my data.

620
01:09:05,490 --> 01:09:09,060
You know, for talking about, like, some weird point on a survey.

621
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:15,840
And that could be true. But just sort of understanding, like why something might be an outlier on a survey.

622
01:09:15,930 --> 01:09:21,690
Like it's sort of like, um, very dry type of data, right?

623
01:09:22,050 --> 01:09:25,680
That's sort of one type of the data cleaning.

624
01:09:26,190 --> 01:09:30,380
But then of course, also like in qualitative data, it's much more of a gray zone.

625
01:09:30,390 --> 01:09:35,070
I think sometimes because we're choosing interview quote records that we just saw.

626
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,390
We're analyzing themes. You know, everybody has biases.

627
01:09:39,390 --> 01:09:44,730
And so I think this applies both to quantitative data and to qualitative data.

628
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:55,890
I think that it's like, you know, in the qualitative space, it's a little bit more gray sometimes.

629
01:09:55,890 --> 01:10:00,300
But, you know, certainly this happens in the quantitative space, too,

630
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:07,709
even like with something that we were talking about around like what do you how do you split your moderate or variable?

631
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:14,160
Like all of that could kind of, you know, see the story that we're telling with our data.

632
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:23,340
And so, you know, there's always interpretive interpretation of data, but this is sort of something to just sort of be mindful of.

633
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:32,850
And I think that everybody's probably done this a little bit just in like analyzing, you know,

634
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:38,040
for a paper and you're like, oh, is this, you know, does this paper like have legs?

635
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:46,440
Is this paper going to go somewhere? And then if you get sort of results that seem odd, like shelving it and saying, okay, that paper was a bad idea,

636
01:10:46,620 --> 01:10:51,210
you know, I'm not saying that's a research fraud, but like this sort of gray area of like,

637
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:58,200
what do I do with these data that I'm flexing is important to kind of think about how we use it, which is,

638
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:04,710
of course, why it's important to be hypothesis driven and have a research question and then analyze our data.

639
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:09,150
But we also know that in the real world that doesn't always happen in that order.

640
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:19,050
Um, and then I think some challenges with this whole fraud piece like it came up in, a lot of the articles are like, who is the whistle blower?

641
01:11:19,080 --> 01:11:21,450
Like, what does that do to your career?

642
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:28,439
In a lot of cases, or at least in a few of these cases, it's like the graduate student who's, you know, running the analysis, cleaning the data.

643
01:11:28,440 --> 01:11:34,860
They see what the results were, and then the results change after someone else looks at them.

644
01:11:36,120 --> 01:11:40,439
You know what if your was what if your, you know, data manipulator is your boss?

645
01:11:40,440 --> 01:11:44,130
You know, how do those things work and how do we handle them?

646
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:54,240
And so I think that's a really important challenge. And when we suspect something's off with the data that Brian Wansink I'll talk more about,

647
01:11:54,240 --> 01:12:04,290
but he's like a obesity prevention researcher and is actually based in a business school of business and life hotel management.

648
01:12:04,290 --> 01:12:10,979
He who's at Cornell and gotten really big trouble and was just like, we're kind of talking about digital mental health.

649
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:19,350
Like he was writing books on all these findings that he had that were really based on like fabricated data and that they were like sort of pop,

650
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:23,640
kind of pop culture, more oriented, like diet books and stuff like that.

651
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:33,540
And I think we one time saw how he came to gave a talk at Michigan before he got kind of called out as a research fraud fraudster.

652
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:40,200
And he was sort of telling the story about how he had done this study.

653
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:44,729
It was really interesting because research was about, you know,

654
01:12:44,730 --> 01:12:53,280
a kind of behavioral economics kind of things like you place, you know, cookies in a harder to get place than carrots.

655
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:58,229
And people be more likely to eat the carrots than the cookies or like you mess with the size of plates.

656
01:12:58,230 --> 01:13:03,270
And so people who eat different portions of things, bigger or small and with wine taste different.

657
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:07,920
If it has a label of like North Dakota versus France, you know, these kinds of things.

658
01:13:08,370 --> 01:13:13,199
So he was doing a lot of this kind of research, which is like really fast and it's like, we all want that stuff to work, right?

659
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:18,960
We all want it to work. And then he was so prolific with his findings about this that.

660
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:24,140
Tons of research was kind of based on his findings.

661
01:13:24,150 --> 01:13:30,320
So if you go back into this like what I call it, behavioral type interventions for obesity prevention,

662
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:38,840
they're like a lot of the justification for the set up of these studies is his research, and they got very debunked.

663
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:46,610
So anyway, so he gave this talk at Michigan and he was telling an example of he had a Chinese food buffet.

664
01:13:46,610 --> 01:13:50,210
He was interested in looking at people's, like, famous food selection behavior.

665
01:13:51,110 --> 01:13:54,410
And it was a real, you know, restaurant.

666
01:13:54,590 --> 01:14:00,800
And like in real life, they put a max that could detect the weight at the front door.

667
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:06,290
And then he had somebody sit with like a laser pointer and judge people's height as they walked in the door.

668
01:14:06,290 --> 01:14:13,700
So no consent, like no. You know, I'd say that goes beyond, like, you know, observation of people's social behavior.

669
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:20,870
So people walked in across this map. They've measured their height. And he likes to look to see what they selected in the buffet.

670
01:14:22,190 --> 01:14:27,470
So he totally collected their BMI. They calculated their BMI data, and he, like, looked at their food selection.

671
01:14:27,940 --> 01:14:30,500
And so he's telling this story in like a public talk.

672
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:37,430
And Palmer and a bunch of us are sitting there in the audience were like, it doesn't seem that seems a little sketchy.

673
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:41,450
And then he made some joke and is like, Yeah, this, this wasn't IAB approved.

674
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:45,440
But then they told me I had to get IAB and we were like, Oh gosh, we've been fighting this guy.

675
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:50,719
Like, it was this very stressful thing that was a total coup to get him to come because his research showed prolific.

676
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:56,629
And so just that story really sticks with me because he was so blasé about telling

677
01:14:56,630 --> 01:15:02,330
a sort of a joke and it was very interesting to meet him personally in that way.

678
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:07,000
And then a few years later, all this stuff came out and was like, Oh, I knew it.

679
01:15:07,130 --> 01:15:12,770
You know, you had that like personality of like kind of larger than life.

680
01:15:12,770 --> 01:15:17,989
And I'm like really passionately invested, as many of us are in like my research and my story.

681
01:15:17,990 --> 01:15:23,480
But like it was really based on, you know, data falsification.

682
01:15:24,830 --> 01:15:30,739
And then the other one not really recent article is the ad is Alzheimer's.

683
01:15:30,740 --> 01:15:36,410
So they had this whole Alzheimer's case that had just come to light over the summer again.

684
01:15:37,490 --> 01:15:42,930
And this is a much higher stakes kind of case because it's like billions of dollars have been thrown,

685
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:50,930
you know, invested in this hypothesis that kind of is maybe based on really questionable findings.

686
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:58,850
And like it was sort of it really kind of turns that field to say, like, oh, you know what?

687
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:00,860
Here's like the signal that we're looking for.

688
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:09,140
And so all this other potential mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease are not as important because this data or these data are so compelling.

689
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:18,950
But again, and this was just a highlight, Brian Wansink, a lot of his graduate students were sort of actively involved in the data stuff.

690
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:24,110
And then this one was also like a he was a postdoctoral fellow who was like rising in the ranks,

691
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:31,940
who evidently and I can't I feel like it's under investigation still, but.

692
01:16:32,850 --> 01:16:36,210
Perhaps it looks like they have altered the slides, the pictures.

693
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:44,070
Okay. So and then this pre-registration we've talked about a little bit already that processes that Open Science Foundation.

694
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:50,790
And so this idea of in order to avoid going down the road of ignoring wrong data,

695
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:59,580
we want to have a testable hypothesis, ideally when we're going into our research projects and a research question.

696
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:04,590
And if you have, you know, sort of firmed up enough research question,

697
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:10,709
then pre-registering your question or your analysis plan or your analysis on hope,

698
01:17:10,710 --> 01:17:15,150
open science will sort of hold you to that research question in an external way.

699
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:20,880
I will say this is this fits for some questions really well.

700
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:24,149
Does it fit for all questions at the same time?

701
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:28,500
And I think Kiesel and maybe was talking about this like this is kind of kind of becoming more broad,

702
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:35,820
broadly used for like lit reviews and other things that you can kind of put up there just to have this sort of like it's like,

703
01:17:36,150 --> 01:17:44,550
you know, an external checker that we can use to just like hold ourselves accountable to these research ideas.

704
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:53,820
And so that's kind of a tool. And then here, plagiarism that was pretty strong talking about this, but one thing.

705
01:17:54,090 --> 01:18:00,210
So like, there's sort of the classic plagiarism, you know, like I'm reading my papers and I'm like, this is very beautifully written.

706
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:01,740
Let me Google that phrase.

707
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:10,860
And then like this happened last year, like an entire blog post, like was just plopped in as the paper and, you know, master's student.

708
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:13,930
And I'm like, no way. Like, why?

709
01:18:13,950 --> 01:18:19,740
And it's it's like your own reflections on this film. It was not a hard paper, and it was just.

710
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:26,280
You know. Again, stomach sinking when you're like, what are you, you know?

711
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:32,570
Talk to the student. What do they say about this? You know, just just a challenging situation.

712
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:42,839
So there's that very blatant plagiarism then I'm sure we've all seen writing that is like and you know,

713
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:48,629
it's totally understandable if you find a perfect article that like addresses exactly your question,

714
01:18:48,630 --> 01:18:56,820
like, oh, this is the article that I really need and like meets the need for, you know, my stuckness in my writing.

715
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:01,709
So I'm going to use like its exact headings and structure.

716
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:05,400
And now that I've read it, it's really hard to get away from the phrasing.

717
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:08,870
So like, again, like it's a real, it's a gray area, right?

718
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:14,670
Like it can't be a gray area. And then that kind of leads also to a self plagiarism idea.

719
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:18,480
So those of us who've like worked with the same dataset for a long time,

720
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:25,260
it's like there's only so many ways that you can talk about how subjects were recruited and what methods were used and how things were measured.

721
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:33,720
And I find this really interesting because on the one hand, like we did the study one time,

722
01:19:33,930 --> 01:19:39,870
it led to 50 papers, but like it was done the same way each time.

723
01:19:39,870 --> 01:19:42,750
So like, shouldn't we've made it exactly the same way each time?

724
01:19:43,830 --> 01:19:53,040
So it's a balance between that and being accurate with accurately representing what was done and then having the same words appear in the same papers.

725
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:56,220
And I will just say this as a cautionary note.

726
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:03,059
A graduate student, his dissertation, you know, he published it was like a three manuscript dissertation,

727
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:11,219
which I feel like they almost all are at this point. One of the manuscripts submitted for publication and it was like bounced back to us.

728
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:16,710
They said, oh, 70% of these words appear in some other document, which was his dissertation.

729
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:24,900
But like it clearly they were using like an automatic checker to sort of pull, you know, from the same text or whatever.

730
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:30,180
And we like wrote the journal back and we said, look, this was his dissertation.

731
01:20:30,180 --> 01:20:35,910
Like this paper is based on his dissertation. His dissertation is kind of living in like a vault somewhere, you know?

732
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:43,079
And so how much do we need to really revise this? And so he was able to resubmit it, but it was still this very alarming thing.

733
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,590
And all of us on the team like this has never happened. What is this? This is taking it too far.

734
01:20:46,590 --> 01:20:52,379
So there is there are because of plagiarism, regular plagiarism,

735
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:57,720
there are a lot of these like automatic checker things that could maybe pick up, you know.

736
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:03,839
So I think it's a balance then, especially if it's with methods, sections or a topic you're writing about all the time,

737
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:09,960
like you want to justify community college student needs are different from for your college student needs.

738
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:17,820
Like how many different ways can you say that? You know? So I think it's a real struggle sometimes, like how much do you sort of self plagiarize?

739
01:21:20,590 --> 01:21:24,389
And I think we've talked about these a little bit already for authorship guidelines,

740
01:21:24,390 --> 01:21:34,020
but there are good reference sources for like what should be true for authorship guidelines.

741
01:21:35,010 --> 01:21:42,540
And I think also this is a place where talking with colleagues and people who are in your research space like how do I see this?

742
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:46,890
Do you think this is enough changed from so-and-so's paper in terms of the methods that

743
01:21:46,980 --> 01:21:51,059
it's still accurate but it's not going to be like picked up a theoretical paragraph.

744
01:21:51,060 --> 01:21:58,020
So there's a lot to kind of work with in that space of quote unquote plagiarism,

745
01:21:58,710 --> 01:22:03,690
which is like a big, heavy word, but there's a lot of gray area in there.

746
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:11,579
Okay. And so a lot of the articles went through, a lot of these of examples.

747
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:21,690
But there's so many costs, right, to research fraud, misconduct, and the institution can lose money, grant money,

748
01:22:21,720 --> 01:22:27,360
which that's when the institution gets very involved and cares a lot because that is a big problem.

749
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:34,830
The investigator can be barred and usually is barred for at least a while for from applying to grants.

750
01:22:36,540 --> 01:22:46,199
And I don't know if you guys are on these like NIH email blast lists, but there's, you know, every I don't think it's weekly,

751
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:53,760
but it's every so often there's like a notice of research misconduct that comes out and it's kind of like a public shaming.

752
01:22:53,910 --> 01:23:00,719
It's like this investigator is associated with this project that is has been found to have research misconduct.

753
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:06,960
And so it's like an email blast and no one wants that.

754
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:16,229
So there's this idea that I think they talked about, especially in the what's the same,

755
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:22,110
gosh, like Francis Collins the article and he was like this promising students have.

756
01:23:22,620 --> 01:23:30,630
You know, engage in research and fraud. And and like, I just it just personally affected me, like, for so long.

757
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:38,100
I've never thought about it the same way again and that sort of personal distress, professional advising, shame,

758
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:48,659
and it can just sort of shape one's thoughts and careers as well as how the actual concrete impacts like job loss and lack of advancement.

759
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:51,930
For somebody who has been affiliated with that lab, even the, you know,

760
01:23:52,590 --> 01:23:57,360
one didn't work with that other grad student and wasn't on the paper or was on the paper.

761
01:23:57,360 --> 01:24:06,530
So there's all this sort of cost as well as bad science, bad interventions or bad decision making.

762
01:24:06,540 --> 01:24:10,500
So like if we have bad science, like the brain wants like science.

763
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:16,000
As the basis for all this behavioral economic nudge obesity prevention research.

764
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:21,610
The word like designing and redesigning school cafeteria is based on that research because

765
01:24:21,610 --> 01:24:26,230
we think it's effective and not giving money to like mental health counseling instead,

766
01:24:26,830 --> 01:24:33,370
that's a problem. And then I think there is, of course, this bigger social context, you know,

767
01:24:33,370 --> 01:24:42,850
societal issue of like when scientists engage in research and fraud and it appropriately receives publicity,

768
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:48,760
then we just undermine trust in science and the scientific process.

769
01:24:48,880 --> 01:24:52,150
So all of that can be problematic.

770
01:24:54,430 --> 01:25:01,950
Okay. So I kind of like this one because I think it lays out why.

771
01:25:01,990 --> 01:25:06,280
So like with all of those costs, like, oh my gosh, why I would want to get this contact.

772
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:11,889
But there's many reasons. One, for the kids in research misconduct or one would be tempted to rate.

773
01:25:11,890 --> 01:25:18,190
So there are all these different sort of motivations and processes like temptation.

774
01:25:19,330 --> 01:25:24,010
You know, I really need to get this paper out rationalization. Oh, I'm only like excluding a few data points.

775
01:25:24,010 --> 01:25:28,960
They seem like weird outliers. I don't know what's going on. They must not be relevant to my research question.

776
01:25:29,740 --> 01:25:33,219
Ambition and career pressure. Like that's a huge one.

777
01:25:33,220 --> 01:25:37,510
I mean, I think we all can resonate group pressure.

778
01:25:37,510 --> 01:25:37,870
And again,

779
01:25:37,870 --> 01:25:46,990
this is like where I think it comes up critically for graduate students like our my leader or my group leader or whoever is pressuring me to do this,

780
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:52,420
even if it's really if it's not, you know, usually not directly stated.

781
01:25:52,420 --> 01:26:00,210
That's sort of implied. I might put Wansink here because he kind of had that, like, entitlement vibe to him.

782
01:26:00,220 --> 01:26:04,090
He was like, I like this. My message is truth, you know?

783
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:06,880
And like, no data was going to dissuade him.

784
01:26:08,290 --> 01:26:18,459
And then this idea of deception claiming somebody else's work, this is a little tricky for authorship, too.

785
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:21,880
That's why I put those authorship guidelines, because like in those authorship guidelines,

786
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:27,400
you if you're an author, you claim, you know, the responsibility for the data.

787
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,840
And so that's also an argument for not just being like sure looks good,

788
01:26:32,110 --> 01:26:35,829
awesome paper good another publication but actually to go and look at it and

789
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:42,309
understand the analysis and any decision making that people did like in a lit review,

790
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:45,010
why did you exclude this group and not the like?

791
01:26:45,010 --> 01:26:53,890
So asking those questions so that you understand and then you did actually engage in the work incrementalism.

792
01:26:53,950 --> 01:27:00,100
And this is like we all know this phenomenon from life, but like I'll just do this one time and then,

793
01:27:00,460 --> 01:27:06,340
you know, you kind of break the seal on, you know, doing it in a sloppy or sort of.

794
01:27:07,990 --> 01:27:11,110
Unexamined way, and then it happens over and over.

795
01:27:11,440 --> 01:27:17,649
And then this idea of embarrassment. So, like, I don't want to admit that I don't know something about the research process.

796
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:23,230
And I'm just going to assume like, okay, I guess it just happened that way and it feels like too late to ask now, you know?

797
01:27:24,550 --> 01:27:30,640
And then I don't want to be a whistleblower and I want to I call attention to this question, but like, I'm sure it's fine.

798
01:27:31,180 --> 01:27:34,570
This is a big, well-known research team. Like, who am I to question this?

799
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:41,710
And then this idea of like stupid systems of this is why we get these sort of pressures, I think in particular.

800
01:27:44,020 --> 01:27:54,700
So kind of thinking through these examples, if we were like encountering these, you know, temptations or processes.

801
01:27:56,860 --> 01:28:00,550
You know, what would we. What would we do about this?

802
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:06,100
And what other sort of like, particularly as a student, is like starting out, what other temptations are?

803
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:12,300
Challenges for divisiveness and hysteria. Research misconduct.

804
01:28:19,770 --> 01:28:26,400
That's a big list. I think having been in cancer for.

805
01:28:28,740 --> 01:28:33,690
And being able to communicate with them. I think some of these pressures come up when you're in your own head and.

806
01:28:34,870 --> 01:28:40,000
A lot of them are so precious. And so if you're communicating like that.

807
01:28:40,450 --> 01:28:45,730
So here they're having good mentors, advisors who will help you navigate that.

808
01:28:46,550 --> 01:28:51,730
Proper way. You know when.

809
01:28:53,150 --> 01:28:57,380
Definitely. And I would say like all along the process, right.

810
01:28:57,530 --> 01:29:02,540
So that they're kind of looped into your thinking from, you know, early on.

811
01:29:02,690 --> 01:29:06,470
So people are seeing sort of the evolution of where your what you've been thinking about.

812
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:09,720
I think that's important as well. Very good.

813
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:19,710
Also documentation of the stuff you've been working on in the way I've been thinking about things that I feel like can come up.

814
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:26,370
Here's the one about like the idea that I didn't do a review to work, like to sort of keeping notes.

815
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:33,070
It's helpful. And again you know when you can from my heart I know science background, but like a lab notebook idea,

816
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:39,579
I feel like that's less of a culture in, you know, public health or social sciences.

817
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:48,370
But the value of having a lab notebook of, you know, your plans or processes or ideas or analyzes of things you tried that didn't work,

818
01:29:48,370 --> 01:29:51,790
that didn't work for organization, it's been helpful.

819
01:29:51,790 --> 01:29:55,810
But also just for this idea of like documenting that, yeah, this was my idea.

820
01:29:55,900 --> 01:29:59,440
I was thinking that, sir, I didn't try. This could be another.

821
01:30:00,530 --> 01:30:06,360
Just sort of thing to to engage and make it. Defense.

822
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:10,780
You needed to have it, but it's also for.

823
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:25,740
If we're in a place where. Our concern is that our.

824
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:44,360
And I think that does come up actually around the mentoring as well because you know, we've talked about with having these mentoring meetings,

825
01:30:44,360 --> 01:30:54,840
having an agenda and I think at least having some mentor person in place who you can it's like you can go too with like half baked ideas,

826
01:30:54,920 --> 01:30:58,770
you know, it doesn't need to be like a formal presentation.

827
01:30:58,820 --> 01:31:02,540
Here's my stuff that I really feel like I'm going to be judged on.

828
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:06,829
You know, and again, I'm just sort of I don't think anybody's mentoring here is like that.

829
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:16,790
But that idea of could fall into is is tragedies if one feels like it has to be really high stakes.

830
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,550
Presentation to a mentor and everything has to be done and checked by a mentor as opposed to like,

831
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:32,110
here are the things I'm thinking about helping to shape them and in a way that is open to yeah,

832
01:31:32,130 --> 01:31:40,250
like you said, that psychological safety is a good way to think about it. And so I feel like lots of things come up.

833
01:31:40,250 --> 01:31:45,890
And we'll talk also about how one might handle these things as they come up.

834
01:31:47,360 --> 01:31:54,110
So what to do? Like if you suspect misconduct or you think about, you know, you might think about misconduct.

835
01:31:54,110 --> 01:31:55,909
And I think it's sort of these two level things.

836
01:31:55,910 --> 01:32:06,260
So here we want to you know, it's important not only to recognize misconduct and I say, gosh, that sounds like it could be misconduct.

837
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:14,300
Is that true? Like and then going to resources and seeing like what counts as misconduct, but what is a gray area.

838
01:32:15,710 --> 01:32:18,260
So that's sort of all a really important process.

839
01:32:18,260 --> 01:32:26,150
But then also know how to like if you really think there is misconduct, like what to do and what action steps to take as individuals.

840
01:32:26,600 --> 01:32:30,440
And then also we want to try to create this transparent culture.

841
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:36,060
And I like the term psychological safety with that, that promotes integrity and rewards ethics.

842
01:32:36,080 --> 01:32:41,600
So like at a systems level, right? So you guys are not necessarily able to change the systems level,

843
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:51,889
but hopefully adding to a system that is promoting integrity like this, I think this is kind of with regard to the individual piece,

844
01:32:51,890 --> 01:32:58,490
but there are multiple things we can do if we're like suspecting misconduct or if we're just unsure,

845
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:03,950
because I think there's plenty of times when we can be unsure about what we're seeing.

846
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:09,950
Maybe we just didn't. Maybe we missed a meeting. Maybe we just didn't get the full story of how this paper came about.

847
01:33:10,640 --> 01:33:15,890
Maybe we're sitting in a meeting and somebody is presenting paper and you're like, Oh my God, those are my ideas.

848
01:33:15,890 --> 01:33:17,030
That's what I was working on.

849
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:24,559
What can like like it's like it's all this internal, like, and then you kind of check in with the person after and they're like, Oh no,

850
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:32,240
I'm using these variables like paper on the paper tracker, like writing down variables, and then you go, Oh, okay, that is actually a different paper.

851
01:33:32,240 --> 01:33:35,750
It sounded really similar to my paper. And so you just don't have that communication.

852
01:33:35,750 --> 01:33:39,229
But it's really hard because we're all very invested, right?

853
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:48,920
And it's like really in the process you feel like you haven't necessarily like maybe claimed were part of the project or it isn't very clear.

854
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:52,340
Like you could work on this paper, you could work on this one, you may or may not.

855
01:33:52,340 --> 01:33:54,050
So there's a lot of like flux,

856
01:33:54,950 --> 01:34:03,530
but so if we're really thinking about misconduct review in the guidelines and we can also you can pull up the compliance side of the U of M site,

857
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:12,799
but also talk to the individual. Now, if it's a situation, we're like, oh my gosh, this seems really bad or really sketchy.

858
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:17,810
And like, I really feel like something's wrong here and I don't feel comfortable talking to the individual.

859
01:34:18,890 --> 01:34:22,760
It's kind of like going down a list of who you think you can talk to about this, right?

860
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:28,280
So you don't want to like foment drama in a research group or whatever.

861
01:34:28,280 --> 01:34:32,850
But if there is some, some particular person that you're like, Oh,

862
01:34:32,870 --> 01:34:37,730
I just feel like they're not doing stuff the right way, like, and I don't feel comfortable to talk to that person.

863
01:34:38,120 --> 01:34:45,710
Can you talk to, you know, your own PI and confidentially and have it in person?

864
01:34:46,430 --> 01:34:50,870
Can you talk to an external person meaning like someone else on the faculty,

865
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:56,359
someone you know that you have a relationship with but maybe is not in the research team.

866
01:34:56,360 --> 01:35:01,850
So like you can get this sort of more, you know, outsider objective perspective.

867
01:35:02,420 --> 01:35:08,960
And then there is also the official office of this Research Office of Research Integrity question.

868
01:35:09,950 --> 01:35:13,909
And that's, I would say like that sort of like quote unquote, the big guns, right?

869
01:35:13,910 --> 01:35:21,379
So you don't go immediately to that if you're suspecting there may be something going, but there should be these sort of checking points.

870
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:24,570
And then if you feel like, I don't know who to talk to, you know, talk to me.

871
01:35:24,590 --> 01:35:34,730
You talk to someone, talked to Cleo, talk to, you know, somebody about the process of what to do if you're thinking about this or witnessing this.

872
01:35:35,210 --> 01:35:38,570
And then you can get into the details like if it comes to light.

873
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:45,090
There is research, misconduct and arrests like my peer engaging in research conduct misconduct.

874
01:35:45,090 --> 01:35:52,380
My supervisor seems to endorse it. It's totally stressing me out and I have like reason to believe this is happening.

875
01:35:53,070 --> 01:35:57,390
At that point, if you end up talking to an external person and they're like, Huh,

876
01:35:57,420 --> 01:36:01,080
sounds like there's something going on, maybe check in with this Office of Research Integrity.

877
01:36:01,800 --> 01:36:09,900
At that point, you want to make sure to have, like, you know, evidence or, you know, clear examples and that kind of thing.

878
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,970
So that's when it becomes more of like a case.

879
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:18,239
It's still not, you know, it's like that that may not even be investigated, but if it rises to that level,

880
01:36:18,240 --> 01:36:23,580
then it would require sort of more, you know, as with all things reporting, you know.

881
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:33,560
And so that's just the practice guide. But let's see, I was going to pull up, so I had my website up.

882
01:36:35,220 --> 01:36:44,850
So this is like that same site where like we go for like peers training and everything,

883
01:36:44,850 --> 01:36:54,450
but there's a lot of info on here and so it's under research integrity and this is just a

884
01:36:54,450 --> 01:37:00,149
helpful one to know of to like when you're looking at the authorship stuff in particular,

885
01:37:00,150 --> 01:37:07,800
like the authorship guidelines are under here. Here's some, you know, again, research, misconduct, fabrication, just making stuff up,

886
01:37:08,220 --> 01:37:13,740
falsification that's like, you know, ignoring the outlier and then plagiarism.

887
01:37:14,430 --> 01:37:19,590
And here's the links to those SPG stands for Standard Practice Guide.

888
01:37:20,070 --> 01:37:23,580
There's an SPG for like all policies and procedures.

889
01:37:24,540 --> 01:37:28,559
You can also look up, oh my gosh, I think I might need to make a report.

890
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:40,900
Like, what does that what would that entail? And it's basically meeting with people like at the unit level and, you know, going over what happened.

891
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,430
There was another thing I was going to show you guys on here,

892
01:37:46,330 --> 01:37:52,600
I think this box of like other violations of research integrity, we've talked about a few of these,

893
01:37:52,600 --> 01:37:57,729
but these are kind of broad and something like, you know,

894
01:37:57,730 --> 01:38:04,210
abuse of confidentiality that can be like of a participant of anything somebody told you in confidence.

895
01:38:04,720 --> 01:38:14,530
And that's why I would say also, like, if you do have concerns, you know, meet with somebody and then, you know, kind of document your conversation.

896
01:38:14,530 --> 01:38:20,079
Document what date have the conversation dishonesty in publication.

897
01:38:20,080 --> 01:38:25,450
We've talked about a little bit property violations and abuse or certain misconduct all over,

898
01:38:25,450 --> 01:38:31,540
but failing to report observed misconduct, that's something that could happen, right?

899
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:35,469
Because like we could see something and just be like, oh, my gosh, I don't even want to know.

900
01:38:35,470 --> 01:38:37,480
I got to walk away from that situation.

901
01:38:37,960 --> 01:38:45,610
But technically, like, we're, you know, obligated to report it like a mandated reporter of research misconduct,

902
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:50,799
retaliation, encouraging others to engage in research misconduct.

903
01:38:50,800 --> 01:38:56,200
So there's a lot of, again, kind of gray area, but a lot of, you know,

904
01:38:56,410 --> 01:39:06,190
let's problems like bad behaviors but we understand motivations for bad behaviors sometimes there was another one.

905
01:39:06,970 --> 01:39:12,790
Yeah. So there is this compliance hotline again like that will go like to the vice president of research.

906
01:39:12,790 --> 01:39:21,639
So you know that you want to make sure, you know, you know, you've got some some not proven because that's kind of their job.

907
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:27,100
But like the fair bit of evidence that you would want to bring to their attention.

908
01:39:28,480 --> 01:39:32,020
And then here's what they do. They do this misconduct procedures.

909
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:35,250
And again, we talked about, you know, the Martin Philbert case, right?

910
01:39:35,260 --> 01:39:43,209
Like these things do happen. And that was sexual misconduct, but research misconduct, same kind of process.

911
01:39:43,210 --> 01:39:47,680
So they do an assessment and then they do like a deep inquiry.

912
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:54,759
And I have had not research misconduct, but like I had to go before,

913
01:39:54,760 --> 01:40:07,360
like the who are the Office of General Counsel because they had questions about some research assistant and time reporting activities.

914
01:40:07,360 --> 01:40:13,450
And one of the things is that we did data collection like off site and so they were sort of confused,

915
01:40:13,450 --> 01:40:19,309
like what are people doing in their time off site? Because there was a lot of driving back and forth like an hour to a participant.

916
01:40:19,310 --> 01:40:22,620
So and then they come back and sometimes the participants are home and they're right.

917
01:40:23,260 --> 01:40:29,200
So and it was highly stressful for me as a peer to meet with, you know, these officers.

918
01:40:29,200 --> 01:40:35,140
And it wasn't the misconduct, but it was the general counsel. But it was that same sort of idea of like, oh my gosh, what's going to happen, you know?

919
01:40:35,590 --> 01:40:40,750
And I got like a ton of paperwork together and, you know, just sort of reviewed all our processes.

920
01:40:42,430 --> 01:40:46,989
And so they, you know, they did this inquiry into like time reporting and then they were like,

921
01:40:46,990 --> 01:40:51,190
okay, we're satisfied that it was, you know, a huge time investment.

922
01:40:51,190 --> 01:40:53,319
It was a huge amount of stress.

923
01:40:53,320 --> 01:41:00,250
It was like you probably appropriately, like, you know, we reviewed all of our stuff and it was all in good, you know, good.

924
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:04,150
Our processes were in good condition, but it was probably good practice to do that.

925
01:41:05,710 --> 01:41:08,770
And so then they were like, okay, you're fine. We just wanted to check.

926
01:41:08,770 --> 01:41:16,450
And I was like, Oh, you know, you recover like so, you know, but so that is also to say, like,

927
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:21,490
these officers are obviously really important and they have a process that they go through.

928
01:41:22,090 --> 01:41:27,430
And the other thing that I wanted to just highlight and you guys mean may or may not be in this situation,

929
01:41:27,430 --> 01:41:31,960
but if you're starting up a research project, this is more like basic research ethics kind of stuff,

930
01:41:32,710 --> 01:41:40,510
but they are starting a process where they'll do a consultation with you about just everything from like,

931
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:47,290
you know, here's our proposal to like how we're going to recruit participants, here's what our consent form looks like,

932
01:41:47,290 --> 01:41:53,349
here's our research process, you know, does that all look right to you or are we missing anything?

933
01:41:53,350 --> 01:41:57,729
You know, how how should we run this, you know, data collection process?

934
01:41:57,730 --> 01:42:01,990
And so they it's the it's oh RCR.

935
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:10,190
Office of Research Compliance. I sit on that committee, but we only meet twice a year.

936
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:11,460
Something like this at the initial.

937
01:42:12,450 --> 01:42:21,239
But they actually certify on my and some other people's urging have started to do consultations with people because that issue of like my

938
01:42:21,240 --> 01:42:29,790
research assistants driving out and coming back like that's not a very standard like lab based kind of research study that they observed.

939
01:42:29,790 --> 01:42:35,710
So they were like, What is this? That's weird. This does this violate our, you know, research processes?

940
01:42:37,320 --> 01:42:43,170
And I and some other project managers in public health were like, well, public health is like really varied.

941
01:42:43,170 --> 01:42:45,090
We do lots of different kinds of things.

942
01:42:45,090 --> 01:42:52,139
And so sometimes the things that emanate in the medical school for the medical model don't always apply and can seem funky and weird.

943
01:42:52,140 --> 01:42:56,910
So why don't you guys come over and talk with people who do this kind of research?

944
01:42:57,210 --> 01:43:03,420
Another thing where this came up and again, this is like could be a part, could be it could be financial fraud.

945
01:43:04,740 --> 01:43:10,469
How were research participants being paid who are doing like community interviews and stuff?

946
01:43:10,470 --> 01:43:14,160
Some are undocumented and they don't want to give a Social Security number.

947
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:19,229
And then the research is that, you know, financial services office is like, we want a security number.

948
01:43:19,230 --> 01:43:21,389
We're like, well, we're not going to get our data.

949
01:43:21,390 --> 01:43:29,610
So there's all these sort of like opportunities to when these process, you know, given that these processes exist,

950
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:36,209
there's opportunity to shape them and to inform them like, hey, this doesn't work because of this.

951
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:40,320
This is something that happens like in this type of research that you might not be aware of.

952
01:43:40,320 --> 01:43:45,450
So let's figure out a process to, you know, look for misconduct in this type of research.

953
01:43:45,450 --> 01:43:49,979
So that's all sort of to say like it's good that these are here.

954
01:43:49,980 --> 01:43:58,590
It's a little intimidating to interact with them. But they do they do have a lot of these reporting and everything processes worked out.

955
01:44:00,420 --> 01:44:05,370
Okay. So those are there are some links to like those cookies, the research integrity.

956
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:12,360
Yeah. So for the example we do of like students driving like yeah, I applied for.

957
01:44:14,130 --> 01:44:16,140
Yeah, they did. And so it's a great question.

958
01:44:16,140 --> 01:44:22,650
So we did, we outlined and that was all fine and RB And we'd have some we'd been doing that for like eight years or something.

959
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:28,440
Anyway, what they were wondering about was the time reporting and like effort.

960
01:44:28,440 --> 01:44:32,610
So they were saying it was really in the case.

961
01:44:32,610 --> 01:44:38,820
It's like really boil down to in the case of a canceled home visit, they were like, why don't they know in advance that a home visit is canceled?

962
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:43,230
And so we were doing all this data collection for families who live like an hour away.

963
01:44:43,620 --> 01:44:45,929
And so something that would confirm, confirm, confirm.

964
01:44:45,930 --> 01:44:53,340
And then we're like, well, they didn't confirm, but we're going to better to get the data and have a wasted drive than not get the data.

965
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:56,940
And so what they were saying is like, can you confirm the appointment?

966
01:44:56,940 --> 01:45:04,020
Because also we were getting reimbursed for gas mileage and so they were like, Oh, you should know before you go on the visit.

967
01:45:05,490 --> 01:45:12,180
Yeah. And so it was just, it was really, I think it was one of these like misunderstandings of like how this type of research works.

968
01:45:12,900 --> 01:45:19,889
And so somebody who was like, you know, like a bean counter in the office was like, why are these like,

969
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:29,760
why are we getting charged for these drives if there's not a participant visit linked to it and the time of the research assistant?

970
01:45:29,760 --> 01:45:31,589
Because that could be like, you know,

971
01:45:31,590 --> 01:45:36,130
you drive 45 minutes and you wait like an hour to make sure they're not going to come on and then you drive for it.

972
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:41,219
So that's like a more of an entire half day of like, what was the person doing?

973
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:46,860
And there's no participants like reimbursement connected to that drive.

974
01:45:47,490 --> 01:45:54,990
It's like really they were like what it boils down to. But yeah, it was very detailed and it like, I don't know what kind of flagged it.

975
01:45:55,590 --> 01:46:01,230
Maybe we had a high ratio of like driving time to like participant disbursement or something, but.

976
01:46:02,530 --> 01:46:08,520
It was like it was really stressful and you know, and again, like,

977
01:46:08,530 --> 01:46:15,340
we all can appreciate like it's so hard to, you know, go do these visits and have these data.

978
01:46:15,350 --> 01:46:21,340
And, you know, it's not like, oh, they didn't show up for their clinic visit.

979
01:46:21,880 --> 01:46:26,880
I guess that didn't happen. You know, like that's also a hassle to do data collection,

980
01:46:26,980 --> 01:46:34,350
but like it's a whole different level to do a community site news and then the, the payment and stuff for each.

981
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:44,380
So this is the group that does like subject reimbursement, participant reimbursement and they really wanted to give like bank card or visa gift cards.

982
01:46:45,280 --> 01:46:46,509
And sometimes that was fine,

983
01:46:46,510 --> 01:46:53,440
but then sometimes it was not fine from the participants perspective and they wanted cash and like that was a different, you know,

984
01:46:53,440 --> 01:47:03,610
so there's a lot of these systems that like work very well and then you have like a situation that doesn't fit the system and sometimes you're like,

985
01:47:03,610 --> 01:47:09,159
okay, I'll make it fit the system. I get it. It's not, you know, it basically fits the system.

986
01:47:09,160 --> 01:47:11,680
It's a little more work for us to make it fit the system.

987
01:47:12,040 --> 01:47:18,279
But sometimes, like in the case of giving a Social Security number like that can't happen for everybody.

988
01:47:18,280 --> 01:47:26,890
So but there's a there's like a limit. If you make more than $600 in research, you have to report it.

989
01:47:27,670 --> 01:47:31,750
And so that was one of the, like, that was one of the, um,

990
01:47:32,200 --> 01:47:38,410
the rationales for needing to get the Social Security number to track the amount that people were making in research.

991
01:47:39,430 --> 01:47:49,240
And that's like, and that's, you know, this office's, you know, mission is like we have to make sure grant funds aren't being misspent.

992
01:47:49,390 --> 01:47:54,700
Right. And so how do we have record of how they're being spent without a Social Security number?

993
01:47:54,820 --> 01:47:58,719
So what was the workaround for that is we came up with this.

994
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:01,440
Up against this. Yeah. Yeah.

995
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:11,799
And you know, I feel like the person who's really taken on over, I would say this issue is Laura Jadwin Samad, who she works with, Gary Harper.

996
01:48:11,800 --> 01:48:17,980
She's his lab manager. And so I don't know where it stands right now, but it's.

997
01:48:19,120 --> 01:48:21,519
That would actually be a good person to follow up with.

998
01:48:21,520 --> 01:48:27,370
And I know that there have been some, you know, people who do global research on pay participants.

999
01:48:27,390 --> 01:48:35,140
I know there are systems for that, too, that also might kind of fall outside the system, but I think that's been more common.

1000
01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:42,310
And so it wasn't as much of my like I think it was also like people who are unbanked and

1001
01:48:42,310 --> 01:48:48,670
don't have bank accounts like the visa gift card thing and they expire and need to reload.

1002
01:48:48,670 --> 01:48:52,180
But I think if you reload, you need to somehow have linked to something.

1003
01:48:52,180 --> 01:49:00,520
So there's a lot of complexity in figuring it out and I think we ended up fighting back and we sort of said,

1004
01:49:01,120 --> 01:49:04,899
so sorry, we don't have Social Security numbers, but like here are some signed papers.

1005
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:10,750
Like, yeah, kind of trust us. Yeah. But I think of the entire stuff.

1006
01:49:10,750 --> 01:49:16,300
Like it's probably worth like with the whole RCR group doing that consultation beforehand to be like,

1007
01:49:16,570 --> 01:49:20,139
we know this is going to be a population like what are you guys suggests because

1008
01:49:20,140 --> 01:49:23,850
we're going to either that or we're going to like bug you about it like 85 times,

1009
01:49:23,860 --> 01:49:29,340
you know, I think that's the other that's the other time systems changes that they're like, okay,

1010
01:49:30,050 --> 01:49:37,600
they put a button on so you can add somebody to your study for without having to do a whole IAB amendment, you know, yeah, that type of thing.

1011
01:49:38,740 --> 01:49:45,660
So yeah, there's a lot, a lot in that research ethics space that I do feel like public health like pushes the envelope, right?

1012
01:49:45,880 --> 01:49:53,080
Because it's not like undergrads come to a psych lab or like participants in med school, which are much more differently regulated.

1013
01:49:53,080 --> 01:49:57,110
But this is like, you know. Yes.

1014
01:49:57,200 --> 01:50:00,680
Yes. So definitely a lot to have a lot to consider.

1015
01:50:01,790 --> 01:50:05,630
Um, let me see. Oh, I wanted to.

1016
01:50:06,530 --> 01:50:15,290
This is another. This is the like. And I enter the DHS, DHHS site of research integrity.

1017
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:19,280
So this is just another place that has, I think, a lot of good resources.

1018
01:50:20,610 --> 01:50:30,929
And this was their sort of self plagiarism, you know, discussion where you can do like training modules and look through their materials.

1019
01:50:30,930 --> 01:50:38,940
And again, this I've kind of spent time on these sites sometimes when I run into like a plagiarism question or some other question or,

1020
01:50:39,990 --> 01:50:43,170
you know, if I'm just curious about how these things are.

1021
01:50:44,450 --> 01:50:47,770
You know, regulated or what advice to give.

1022
01:50:47,810 --> 01:50:56,150
Like often I haven't. I feel like maybe once I've given a student who plagiarized, I sent him to this,

1023
01:50:56,420 --> 01:51:05,300
given them this level of information, but also just because a research or a writing integrity site.

1024
01:51:05,570 --> 01:51:13,690
And they often sent students that way. So if you guys are like saying and there's I think they change the law this year

1025
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:20,299
now to say oh my links were bad but there's a it's like where the writing lab is

1026
01:51:20,300 --> 01:51:25,250
accessible and so they have some good guidelines about plagiarism and what it is

1027
01:51:25,250 --> 01:51:30,319
and what the meaning of it is if you get caught doing it and that kind of stuff.

1028
01:51:30,320 --> 01:51:36,530
So there's internal sites and then this is just like an example of the federal.

1029
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:48,660
Okay. Um, let's see. I just wanted to, like, highlight a few, uh, kind of this idea of, like, high profile sales.

1030
01:51:49,770 --> 01:51:52,799
And this is, again, this is the time one six story.

1031
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:56,370
So this was sort of his.

1032
01:51:57,650 --> 01:52:10,280
His research, you know, pitch. And the process here was that there were some notices of expression, of concern that were published.

1033
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:18,040
And those emanated from the kind of internal graduate students and staff and people who were involved in his research.

1034
01:52:18,590 --> 01:52:21,740
And then they ultimately retracted his articles.

1035
01:52:22,520 --> 01:52:25,550
You can still find them. There's like a big retracted.

1036
01:52:27,410 --> 01:52:38,050
But what's tricky is, like I said, in this research area, they're still find it like in the papers that build on this work.

1037
01:52:38,950 --> 01:52:43,320
And so if you just read kind of the more recent papers, you're like, Oh, that's cool.

1038
01:52:43,330 --> 01:52:50,950
And they're not necessarily going to click back on the Wansink articles to realize like, it's sort of that like foundation of sand or whatever.

1039
01:52:51,820 --> 01:52:56,590
So I think it's, it's, it's sort of an imperfect system in terms of tracking all of that.

1040
01:52:56,590 --> 01:53:06,460
But they did get retracted and then if it's, you know, more and then he was sort of along this line of,

1041
01:53:07,450 --> 01:53:12,090
you know, if it's a if it's like a public consumption,

1042
01:53:12,100 --> 01:53:23,290
public facing, you know, claim that's based on the research that's then faulty, then it will be more high profile of a fail than just like purely.

1043
01:53:27,370 --> 01:53:34,570
So just for this one, again, this is like having this over the summer.

1044
01:53:35,980 --> 01:53:38,680
And this is this Alzheimer's case where.

1045
01:53:40,230 --> 01:53:49,910
I think it's interesting because there's both like the whistleblower factor, like they went to somebody to interpret these,

1046
01:53:50,450 --> 01:54:00,050
you know, these images of amyloid and asked him to kind of weigh in scientifically, like, what do you think happened?

1047
01:54:01,190 --> 01:54:11,150
And so he was sort of the whistleblower. But then the person who originated the data manipulation was I mean, he was a postdoc.

1048
01:54:14,020 --> 01:54:21,180
And so I think that. This is this is interesting, I think, how they presented it in this article.

1049
01:54:21,310 --> 01:54:26,230
I'm not an Alzheimer's researcher, but since Scott and her husband is deeply in this field.

1050
01:54:26,350 --> 01:54:31,960
But he's also not like a nurse. He like I couldn't have looked at those images and been like, oh, well, that's wrong, you know?

1051
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:39,430
But I deeply appreciate how it really shaped the field because there were all these people who were like doing research

1052
01:54:39,940 --> 01:54:53,530
on other aspects of Alzheimer's brain damage and this really like diverted all of the resources and so much funding,

1053
01:54:53,530 --> 01:54:59,260
so much funding, like, you know, billions of dollars of funding to these.

1054
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:02,510
Plaques and tangles as a mechanism.

1055
01:55:04,190 --> 01:55:13,880
And so I think it was interesting that, like, it hadn't really gotten swept by the people who've sort of been checking it early on.

1056
01:55:16,760 --> 01:55:20,360
And I think it's just a good recent example.

1057
01:55:22,630 --> 01:55:26,900
So I think that, you know, again,

1058
01:55:26,900 --> 01:55:34,639
thinking about being in this very high stakes research space is kind of a little different maybe than some of the research that we're engaging in,

1059
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:40,100
because this sounds like the application of you could develop the ultimate script that works, you know.

1060
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:48,590
So I feel like there the pressures might be higher or like the culture of work in this for like drug discovery,

1061
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:53,720
like that's a pretty high level of intense pressure potentially.

1062
01:55:56,720 --> 01:56:00,200
I don't know if there are other observations from that.

1063
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:09,350
I thought it was interesting that he that the whistleblower only kind of came out in this like this science article with a lot of context around it,

1064
01:56:09,350 --> 01:56:17,220
like what my role was to check these things. And then he was paid for reviewing the data, too.

1065
01:56:17,240 --> 01:56:22,500
So I thought, that's an interesting. Potential conflicts too.

1066
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:32,630
Like it just felt like there's a lot of like going on this space and feels weird to come on something like that.

1067
01:56:33,040 --> 01:56:46,610
I keep hearing about. Amazingly, people would find out that it didn't work and that there isn't in place there to replace it totally.

1068
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:52,790
And there was another I think that was like earlier this year, but there was like a big, you know,

1069
01:56:52,790 --> 01:57:00,740
a few years ago there was a big trial of an Alzheimer's drug, but didn't really work as it was.

1070
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:04,579
The original hypothesis was like pre registered clinical trial.

1071
01:57:04,580 --> 01:57:08,270
They were like, we're going to test these two groups to see if it works and it didn't.

1072
01:57:09,050 --> 01:57:12,680
And then it's it's called like Argentina Mad or something.

1073
01:57:13,100 --> 01:57:17,900
Is this drug. It didn't really work in terms of their original clinical trial design,

1074
01:57:18,110 --> 01:57:24,710
but then they analyzed the data by group like I think it was either gender or race, maybe both.

1075
01:57:26,360 --> 01:57:29,390
And it did work like they basically found moderation.

1076
01:57:29,540 --> 01:57:32,900
So they found that it did work in this one group better.

1077
01:57:33,380 --> 01:57:44,300
And so based on that analysis, the FDA approved the drug because I think people are so desperate for anything in this Alzheimer's space.

1078
01:57:45,810 --> 01:57:52,290
So they approved this drug, which is like a really expensive drug with multiple thousands of dollars.

1079
01:57:54,090 --> 01:58:00,840
I think it's intravenous, too. Like, it's not it's not a pill, you know, it's not like something that's easy.

1080
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:08,259
And so that big finding combined with kind of this data manipulation,

1081
01:58:08,260 --> 01:58:13,800
that that was kind of like the basis for the bad science that led to that drug that didn't work.

1082
01:58:14,520 --> 01:58:21,030
I mean, the amount of money that that represents is just staggering and the amount of problem,

1083
01:58:21,030 --> 01:58:29,040
because it is a huge, huge growing issue that is really challenging.

1084
01:58:29,250 --> 01:58:33,900
And it's the pure science that is struggling to it didn't need this, you know.

1085
01:58:34,920 --> 01:58:40,790
And so I think that this is a really awful but good example of.

1086
01:58:41,960 --> 01:58:47,180
The kind of cost that that kind of data manipulation can have?

1087
01:58:48,170 --> 01:58:51,350
Absolutely. And this might take a while to catch up on.

1088
01:58:51,530 --> 01:58:59,390
Right. Of this fraud happened. I forget when these initial papers were published, but like years and years ago.

1089
01:59:03,950 --> 01:59:15,049
I can't recall six years, they said. So that's like about on target for like because not uptake of interventions slide so it takes

1090
01:59:15,050 --> 01:59:22,670
like about 17 years from like discovery to implementation which we always try to shorten that.

1091
01:59:23,480 --> 01:59:29,540
I guess either way, if it's based on good science, want to shorten that so we'd know sooner.

1092
01:59:29,540 --> 01:59:35,440
But that's kind of interesting that that was 16 years from like discovery of those not just, you know,

1093
01:59:35,630 --> 01:59:43,490
alteration of those slides to like the testing of this drug based on those slides found not to be effective.

1094
01:59:43,490 --> 01:59:49,020
So. It's kind of intense. Okay.

1095
01:59:49,030 --> 01:59:53,640
So some more on kind of what we can do about it.

1096
01:59:53,660 --> 01:59:58,680
And I think I've mentioned a few times this is what Open Science Foundation kind of grew

1097
01:59:58,680 --> 02:00:04,290
out of this replication crisis and certainly in psychology field but also in others.

1098
02:00:05,130 --> 02:00:10,110
And I think replication is a really important tool that's like why we care about replication

1099
02:00:10,110 --> 02:00:19,170
and why journals are claiming that they support publications that replicate studies.

1100
02:00:20,450 --> 02:00:27,420
It's still a little bit hard to get published, something that's sort of a pure like quote unquote, just a replication of another study.

1101
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:30,680
You have to have some sort of new aspect of it.

1102
02:00:31,490 --> 02:00:38,479
But replication is an important tool to help us identify fraud and misconduct as like really if things aren't replicated,

1103
02:00:38,480 --> 02:00:41,300
then we just don't know or if things aren't attempted to be replicated.

1104
02:00:41,900 --> 02:00:48,650
So this like silly green jellybeans thing is that they're basically saying like, oh, jellybeans, beans, acne, investigate.

1105
02:00:49,070 --> 02:00:52,870
And then they're like, we found no association. Oh, here's a certain color I know.

1106
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:59,720
Association between purple brown. The letter notes that I got from felt like, Oh my gosh, we found out association between green jellybeans and acne.

1107
02:01:00,140 --> 02:01:07,129
And like, that's what gets published. And so that's similar to like the Alzheimer's study of like, well,

1108
02:01:07,130 --> 02:01:12,950
it didn't work in the main two groups that we had like registered our trial and hypothesize that it would work.

1109
02:01:13,340 --> 02:01:15,020
So let's look at our subgroups.

1110
02:01:15,170 --> 02:01:23,059
And this is kind of like looking at the subgroups of jellybeans color, even though the mean thing doesn't make a difference.

1111
02:01:23,060 --> 02:01:31,070
And then here, of course, it gets picked up by the media. And that's like when the big story is that green jellybeans are linked to acne.

1112
02:01:31,970 --> 02:01:40,549
And so I think that data mining is that idea of you're like looking at every single color to see if you get a significant difference.

1113
02:01:40,550 --> 02:01:45,980
They also didn't like correct for the number of comparisons they did here because it probably wouldn't have been significant.

1114
02:01:48,420 --> 02:01:58,910
And the idea of being able to replicate something that's out there in the literature is really important in order to not only uncover,

1115
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:02,530
uncover fraud, but also figure out, you know, if it still works.

1116
02:02:02,550 --> 02:02:11,459
And I think Amy's point about our evidence based interventions, evidence based for this population, that is a form of replication.

1117
02:02:11,460 --> 02:02:19,500
Right? So like, all right, we have this evidence based intervention that works for, you know, nine year olds and works for preteens.

1118
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:23,340
It works for adolescents. It works for college students. Does it also work those population?

1119
02:02:23,340 --> 02:02:32,580
That is a form of replication, even though we're sort of changing the population of the age and then the context of the population for that.

1120
02:02:32,590 --> 02:02:40,020
And then so here's just a little bit on the replication crisis also.

1121
02:02:40,020 --> 02:02:45,719
So that Retraction Watch site is a place that, you know,

1122
02:02:45,720 --> 02:02:53,760
people who are really obsessed with this and a lot of people are will go and post studies that have been like not replicated or been retracted.

1123
02:02:54,450 --> 02:03:01,409
And so I would say, like, if you're in a research area in particular and it has a lot of this potential falsification,

1124
02:03:01,410 --> 02:03:03,390
that's a good site to sort of bookmark.

1125
02:03:04,350 --> 02:03:13,319
But really what we want to think about with all of our science, but to avoid temptations and likelihood of data fabrication,

1126
02:03:13,320 --> 02:03:22,889
we want to make sure we have adequate rigor to our studies, that they are reproducible, that we, you know, are really transparent in our methods.

1127
02:03:22,890 --> 02:03:26,219
And that's where that issue of why did we exclude a data point?

1128
02:03:26,220 --> 02:03:30,840
Why did we exclude those studies from our review? What's our search strategy like?

1129
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:35,040
Exactly. I think Kate Saylor made a really good point about that.

1130
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:40,769
She's like, I want to see exactly what you search so that if I plug it into my it's like the ultimate test of a method.

1131
02:03:40,770 --> 02:03:44,970
Like if I plug it into my browser, will I get the same results that you got?

1132
02:03:47,010 --> 02:03:53,549
And I think this is also it's like a way to be able to connect with other researchers

1133
02:03:53,550 --> 02:03:56,879
because if you're reading their papers and you're like not to do a fraud,

1134
02:03:56,880 --> 02:04:01,230
but like, oh, they didn't they didn't share how they got to this.

1135
02:04:02,400 --> 02:04:05,970
Let me email that person and say, Hey, I'm using this measure too.

1136
02:04:06,180 --> 02:04:09,540
But in my sample it's not replicating as it did in your sample.

1137
02:04:09,540 --> 02:04:13,200
Is there something else you did that wasn't in the description of the methods?

1138
02:04:14,460 --> 02:04:15,330
And that's like one of those.

1139
02:04:15,330 --> 02:04:22,920
And I it's videos kind of go through a scenario like that, but I think it's also an opportunity like if you are using a measure,

1140
02:04:23,280 --> 02:04:30,389
there's one I use a lot and I interact with a lot of people around like, you know, did you change the items?

1141
02:04:30,390 --> 02:04:34,410
Did you, you know, what was the reliability in the sample for your measure?

1142
02:04:34,410 --> 02:04:41,520
And so that's an opportunity to connect with people, open communication, preregistration analysis,

1143
02:04:41,520 --> 02:04:49,320
and that is required if you're doing a clinical trial and if anyone has you, well, you've done a clinical trial know.

1144
02:04:49,440 --> 02:04:56,309
So that website for clinical trials registration is a doozy.

1145
02:04:56,310 --> 02:04:58,049
It requires a lot of information.

1146
02:04:58,050 --> 02:05:07,830
And I think it's a really good example of like something that doesn't fit well for behavioral trials or something like that.

1147
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:11,819
It's really tight. Yes. Yes.

1148
02:05:11,820 --> 02:05:15,750
And so I think it is this a lot of these things exist.

1149
02:05:15,750 --> 02:05:18,840
Some of them don't fit well for some of the stuff that we do.

1150
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:22,230
But I think the principles are good and it's like we kind of have to think about.

1151
02:05:23,250 --> 02:05:28,440
And I think it comes up a lot with like community based research. Like not, you know, not all communities are the same.

1152
02:05:28,440 --> 02:05:32,450
So like you might not expect replication, but like why, why?

1153
02:05:32,550 --> 02:05:36,180
You know, can there are there reasons for this work here? Didn't work here.

1154
02:05:36,180 --> 02:05:45,300
What's going on, you know, leads to new research questions. And so all of this stuff really comes from that biomedical research.

1155
02:05:47,280 --> 02:05:56,790
Industrial complex. But, you know, for, I think, good reason, behavioral science is now incorporated,

1156
02:05:56,790 --> 02:06:00,780
but a lot of it is like a square peg in a round hole and it doesn't fit super well.

1157
02:06:01,680 --> 02:06:03,620
And did they do that?

1158
02:06:03,690 --> 02:06:12,479
They because there was a feeling it wasn't that long ago when they classified behavioral stuff as clinical trial stuff, which I think you're right.

1159
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:16,710
I think the intention is great. But then they just didn't address and. Yeah, yes.

1160
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:22,639
So there's. Yes, I do remember when they did that, but it was around like 2015.

1161
02:06:22,640 --> 02:06:25,290
2015. Okay. Yeah, it's new. It's new.

1162
02:06:25,290 --> 02:06:31,049
And I was involved in a Science of Behavior Change Research Group, part of the people who are really interested in this,

1163
02:06:31,050 --> 02:06:37,110
like digital mental health and kind of integrating, you know, behavioral science into our interventions.

1164
02:06:38,190 --> 02:06:41,849
And there are really passionate people who are working on that.

1165
02:06:41,850 --> 02:06:51,520
But like it's like a up the hill battle because there's so much that comes from what NIH funds anyway in the biomedical space.

1166
02:06:51,720 --> 02:06:54,960
So there's kind of like big behavioral research. This doesn't work.

1167
02:06:55,550 --> 02:06:59,190
And so I alternative. Yeah. Yeah, let me put it this way I think.

1168
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:03,000
Yeah, yeah, it's right exactly. Like I've gotten my clinical trials.

1169
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:06,899
Things bumped back so many times and they're like, What's your unit of measure?

1170
02:07:06,900 --> 02:07:15,720
And I'm like, It's a questionnaire, you know, various different questions that come, that are that are so clearly a poor fit for behavioral science.

1171
02:07:16,860 --> 02:07:22,490
So I agree and it's been a lot of growing pains and still is so fine.

1172
02:07:22,620 --> 02:07:27,209
I guess I wasn't that long ago. So, you know, if I understand a lot better now why it was so painful.

1173
02:07:27,210 --> 02:07:29,910
Yes. Yes, it is still, I would say, a work in progress.

1174
02:07:29,910 --> 02:07:35,129
And they really don't have I mean, there's been some benefits and we'll talk research ethics, too, in a whole nother session.

1175
02:07:35,130 --> 02:07:45,870
But, um, with some IAB things, they have lessened the, um, the common rule in IAB applications has made,

1176
02:07:45,870 --> 02:07:55,079
it has actually lessened the requirements on some types of research that are just like if your interviews might have been exempt and they may be not,

1177
02:07:55,080 --> 02:08:01,020
were not always exempt. So certain things have now become exempt from IAB review that weren't.

1178
02:08:01,110 --> 02:08:08,520
And that's a written response to behavioral scientists being like I'm just asking you know, a professional about like their job.

1179
02:08:09,240 --> 02:08:17,139
Yeah and so that I think is an example of like that that's the big them saying like, okay we understand that's different.

1180
02:08:17,140 --> 02:08:24,180
That's really my risk. It's adults, you know, kids usually I mean, there's some exempt things for kids, not usually.

1181
02:08:24,930 --> 02:08:29,760
Um, but yeah. So there's a lot, a lot of. Yeah.

1182
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:37,780
Flux system, but it's because of what behavioral scientific pushing back to say this is like not working

1183
02:08:37,780 --> 02:08:45,909
for us and I would say like the community based research is even more so like that.

1184
02:08:45,910 --> 02:08:49,150
It's really like the canvas driving to the houses example.

1185
02:08:49,990 --> 02:08:59,590
Um, thank goodness that wasn't our clinical trial, but like all of the reasons that you're, you know, losing track of families and,

1186
02:08:59,590 --> 02:09:07,260
or whatever it is in your clinical trial or like alterations to protocol were like, we pay them on a different schedule.

1187
02:09:07,570 --> 02:09:12,100
All that kind of stuff just makes and I understand because like people are trying to fill

1188
02:09:12,100 --> 02:09:18,969
out their forms and file the reports and but they are very if something doesn't fit,

1189
02:09:18,970 --> 02:09:23,860
it's really hard. Let's see.

1190
02:09:25,350 --> 02:09:28,900
We'll talk and have a little bit of conflict of interest with that name.

1191
02:09:29,650 --> 02:09:32,830
You got have you have you guys all seen those NIH training videos?

1192
02:09:33,790 --> 02:09:42,960
You know, I have. Let me see.

1193
02:09:43,620 --> 02:09:47,300
So let me just pull up. This is working. Sometimes it works.

1194
02:09:47,310 --> 02:09:53,190
Sometimes it doesn't. There's two sites.

1195
02:09:53,280 --> 02:09:57,540
So there's these these affiliate modules that you've seen with the, like, hockey actors.

1196
02:09:58,390 --> 02:10:00,840
They're, like, kind of silly. We can watch. We can watch one of them.

1197
02:10:01,890 --> 02:10:14,490
But I also wanted to point out, there's like so much information and training information that I think is good and.

1198
02:10:16,250 --> 02:10:19,890
Is it? There's a hole.

1199
02:10:21,450 --> 02:10:27,650
Okay, these are those modules. So that they kind of reorganize this every once in a while.

1200
02:10:27,660 --> 02:10:31,440
So it's a little funky. Here's the one about.

1201
02:10:38,410 --> 02:10:43,420
Okay. I think I might have put the on this one separately, but they're also like little scenarios.

1202
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:51,310
That are around authorship, like questions in a lab.

1203
02:10:52,630 --> 02:10:57,940
But I think let's look at. I think.

1204
02:10:58,000 --> 02:11:01,060
Let's look at we can just do this one.

1205
02:11:06,450 --> 02:11:12,180
Um. Actually, why don't we do this one? Because I feel like it has more interesting dynamics to talk about.

1206
02:11:12,210 --> 02:11:18,270
Okay, so these are all these are all, like, bio lab based examples.

1207
02:11:21,800 --> 02:11:26,120
And so we'll see. Like some of them don't totally apply to like the kinds of research designs we have.

1208
02:11:26,120 --> 02:12:00,220
But we'll just we'll just watch the. Just one thing.

1209
02:12:00,550 --> 02:12:03,780
So this is like they're trying to reproduce it. Good goal.

1210
02:12:06,160 --> 02:12:17,170
We'll see more from the guy in the background. And it's also if it's referencing a prior person in the lab who had, like, done this before.

1211
02:12:50,530 --> 02:12:54,490
I like that he has a rationale for the toss that out.

1212
02:12:54,850 --> 02:13:00,460
It's kind of presented in like a casual way and also the way that the pieces like try this different analysis.

1213
02:13:01,840 --> 02:13:05,139
It sounds like it's kind of like, oh, we'll try this. We're looking for these results.

1214
02:13:05,140 --> 02:13:10,030
You know, again, this is this last thing and statistical significance was the other thing I was going to point out.

1215
02:13:10,300 --> 02:13:17,230
I just can't get it to be statistically significant. So, again, these are a little hokey, but okay, let's.

1216
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:40,770
That's another dynamic that is like, you know, seniority, gender, race.

1217
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:43,930
Like it's all in there. They put it all in there. So to talk about.

1218
02:13:45,280 --> 02:14:34,589
All right. I'm going to say and this is like this feels like the most high pressure, like, again, biomedical example.

1219
02:14:34,590 --> 02:14:42,299
They're trying to replicate these results like, you know, so I always like to pause and say,

1220
02:14:42,300 --> 02:14:45,840
like, I hope none of us are having this experience and I would be surprised if we did.

1221
02:14:46,260 --> 02:14:51,930
But I saw it happen because it could happen. And I think, like, you know,

1222
02:14:51,930 --> 02:15:00,989
they very purposely set up all these videos and dynamics and this is the level of like replication and intensity in terms of the data manipulation,

1223
02:15:00,990 --> 02:15:08,430
part of stuff like we are often not looking at, but there are times when we're like trying to do,

1224
02:15:08,550 --> 02:15:13,590
trying to emulate like a eight to versus statistical code.

1225
02:15:13,590 --> 02:15:19,290
Like those are things that we could run into that would be against some of the like data perspective.

1226
02:15:19,980 --> 02:15:28,990
Um, hard to manage. I think that we could give some tips to this API and to see how it transpires.

1227
02:15:46,910 --> 02:15:51,270
I really hope nobody's mentor is ever acting that way.

1228
02:15:52,710 --> 02:15:56,580
And it's an example of what absolutely not to do.

1229
02:15:56,580 --> 02:16:05,250
And it's like shaming and status thing and lots of things, but it's a good example of what we're hoping not to ever see.

1230
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:23,230
And how does she look? I think she's a great actress. A little peer support.

1231
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:47,810
So he has a little bit of like maybe self doubt that he was kind of a jerk.

1232
02:16:48,200 --> 02:16:53,660
I don't know. But the lab notebook is a good, you know, good plug for the lab notebook.

1233
02:17:32,730 --> 02:17:40,480
And I think it's like a really interesting subtext of all dialog because there's so many dynamics just going on that we could just.

1234
02:17:51,470 --> 02:17:55,700
And also including parents. So that sex is biological variable.

1235
02:17:56,750 --> 02:18:03,590
That's something that we all needed to start writing about in our NIH grant proposals again, like maybe ten years ago now.

1236
02:18:03,950 --> 02:18:10,010
But it kind of came from this type of example where it's very clear and like an animal model, oh,

1237
02:18:10,040 --> 02:18:15,050
that's a variable that could really skew all the results and make them look quite different, like look like Robin's results.

1238
02:18:15,620 --> 02:18:22,189
And then in the human like grant writing literature, people were like, What is this?

1239
02:18:22,190 --> 02:18:24,890
Success is biological. Like, what? What's the.

1240
02:18:25,610 --> 02:18:31,309
Like, how do I conceptualize that that, like, human research and like bigger studies that aren't really concerned with,

1241
02:18:31,310 --> 02:18:39,320
like, gender differences and that kind of thing. So in the process of getting like this level of like, you know,

1242
02:18:39,500 --> 02:18:46,160
biological research data into human grant applications that were like community based interventions,

1243
02:18:46,850 --> 02:18:52,700
you kind of had to think about how do I consider sex as a biological variable in my community based intervention

1244
02:18:52,700 --> 02:18:56,059
that I don't think that's going to have anything to do with the gender of the people that I'm working with.

1245
02:18:56,060 --> 02:19:05,810
So but it was just like a growing pain in terms of like how to integrate that and just as another example of sort of that.

1246
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:54,239
And so that's about reproducibility. So I think, like, again, we had a shocking change of heart and we don't know, you know, what kind of led to this.

1247
02:19:54,240 --> 02:20:08,340
And that's bulkiness. But. Uh, you know, I appreciate that he has a change of heart, and I think that that process of having,

1248
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:15,180
like, API or one's advisor life hopefully again not this,

1249
02:20:15,180 --> 02:20:22,020
but like question one's interpretation or results or you leave a meeting feeling like Robin was feeling.

1250
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:28,709
I'm like, Oh my God, I'm going to failure, you know, like, you know, she had to go and like process that meeting,

1251
02:20:28,710 --> 02:20:36,030
you know, and then you have kind of the older male peer who's like kind of buddies with the guy, sort of helpful.

1252
02:20:36,510 --> 02:20:40,140
But there's a lot of just dynamics that are going on. It just is fun.

1253
02:20:40,170 --> 02:20:51,590
These three people that. I think it is important to kind of acknowledge because there's always a lot of dynamics going on and even in the house.

1254
02:20:54,010 --> 02:21:20,610
I think. Okay.

1255
02:21:25,750 --> 02:21:29,410
Variances. Okay.

1256
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:35,170
So like I think they kind of talk through like I think there's a lot of dynamics in

1257
02:21:35,170 --> 02:21:41,780
those videos and all of these little videos like kind of bring up different things.

1258
02:21:41,780 --> 02:21:52,749
They're all this biomedical examples, but I think they're helpful not only in, you know, the topics that they're trying out, but also just they do,

1259
02:21:52,750 --> 02:22:01,300
I think, very purposely bring in all these other dynamics that are relevant, even if we're not talking about like mice and rats and mice.

1260
02:22:02,910 --> 02:22:12,510
Um, I, the ones that I think I might have actually put them on a different route now that I think about it.

1261
02:22:12,520 --> 02:22:19,580
But there are these other training videos and again, this clearinghouse has so many.

1262
02:22:19,590 --> 02:22:23,219
So this is also like a good training for a start teaching resource.

1263
02:22:23,220 --> 02:22:33,150
If you guys are teaching like undergraduate research methods or research methods here, I mean, a GSI, there's a lot of info here.

1264
02:22:33,810 --> 02:22:41,860
Um. Any other comments or notes on the, you know, just that video.

1265
02:22:41,860 --> 02:22:45,760
And I don't know that people have watched any of the other ones before.

1266
02:22:47,790 --> 02:22:51,840
There's some around the publication, but the publication links are important.

1267
02:22:55,560 --> 02:22:59,290
The other video notices comments.

1268
02:23:02,390 --> 02:23:06,530
There's one with a female P.I. two that I kind of like.

1269
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:10,910
There's just some different dynamics across all of them.

1270
02:23:13,550 --> 02:23:17,480
Okay. Let me. All right.

1271
02:23:17,480 --> 02:23:22,790
So that's all of that is kind of about like the reproducibility of, you know,

1272
02:23:23,330 --> 02:23:30,110
rigor and responsible rigor and reproducibility and robust, which is what he defines there as well.

1273
02:23:31,610 --> 02:23:36,590
Let me move on and talk a little bit about conflict of interest, which is.

1274
02:23:37,570 --> 02:23:43,000
Kind of one of those motivators that could lead to data falsification, right?

1275
02:23:43,010 --> 02:23:47,450
So like the Brian Wansink example, the obesity prevention guy, like he wanted to sell his books.

1276
02:23:48,110 --> 02:23:54,110
He was like excited about having that huge platform to sell books as opposed to just write research articles.

1277
02:23:54,500 --> 02:24:00,860
And so that probably helped motivate him to go down the road of pressuring his graduate student to falsify his data.

1278
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:07,820
And I think this is a big issue in public health research, potentially,

1279
02:24:07,940 --> 02:24:11,780
speaking of like digital mental health in the home app and all of these things like

1280
02:24:11,780 --> 02:24:17,390
there's real interest in like what we need to do and people want to take it to scale.

1281
02:24:18,770 --> 02:24:26,870
People often create products and go through like the Tech Transfer Office to get their products out from the university.

1282
02:24:26,870 --> 02:24:31,939
So there's a whole process around that in terms of like intellectual property, who has it?

1283
02:24:31,940 --> 02:24:36,320
Is it the person's? Is it the university is like, how did the work originally emanate?

1284
02:24:36,830 --> 02:24:43,730
Is it right? You know, funded. So lots to consider in this sort of commercialization space.

1285
02:24:44,090 --> 02:24:49,729
Tim Caulfield is somebody who writes a lot about this and like the ethics of like, you know,

1286
02:24:49,730 --> 02:24:56,059
we want to get health behavior interventions that are effective out, like to the to the marketplace, so to speak.

1287
02:24:56,060 --> 02:25:05,180
But like who's making money on them? What's the you know, like you were saying, Amy, to like, what's the marketing of what are the claims?

1288
02:25:05,480 --> 02:25:09,469
You know? And I think that we all, you know, take our research really seriously.

1289
02:25:09,470 --> 02:25:16,280
And we don't want to have, like, false claims made about our research. So we want to be super confident that it's conducted ethically,

1290
02:25:17,630 --> 02:25:26,959
but then at the kind of like dissemination and like everybody totally understand or is like, oh my gosh, my piece might be disseminated.

1291
02:25:26,960 --> 02:25:34,340
And it's also a little bit like potentially scary because that could kind of go farther than like the research,

1292
02:25:34,460 --> 02:25:39,370
you know, actually showed or it could be applied to a new population and maybe that's fine.

1293
02:25:39,380 --> 02:25:41,630
Like maybe that should be tested in our population.

1294
02:25:41,630 --> 02:25:47,730
And the only way it can be tested in that population is to like get the app, you know, push the app out to a whole new population.

1295
02:25:47,770 --> 02:25:53,360
And you've thought through the potential harms benefits and you think that's an okay thing to do.

1296
02:25:54,380 --> 02:25:59,240
But there is a lot to kind of consider in this like commercialization space.

1297
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:03,469
And of course, and we have examples in our own department,

1298
02:26:03,470 --> 02:26:11,120
like the instructor has his own company and health media he had for a long time and he has a new one that's like forget the name of it,

1299
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:19,040
but it's around like his research findings. And so he's basically spun out this company and that's like half his position now.

1300
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:30,189
So. You know, he's I'm sure his conflict of interest forms are lengthy because he's got a whole business that connects to his research.

1301
02:26:30,190 --> 02:26:35,860
So like you can have a business of like, you know, knitting and that's unrelated and that's not a conflict of interest.

1302
02:26:37,570 --> 02:26:42,900
Okay. So here's again, definitions of conflict of interest.

1303
02:26:42,910 --> 02:26:52,330
So this is the set of conditions in which our professional judgment concerning a primary interest tends to be unduly influenced by secondary interest,

1304
02:26:53,050 --> 02:26:58,990
usually money, but it not always as money. It usually boils down to some sort of financial benefit.

1305
02:27:00,280 --> 02:27:03,759
The other thing to note that we should all know about conflict of interest

1306
02:27:03,760 --> 02:27:08,770
is that it just describes the conditions for potential conflict of interest.

1307
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:13,840
It's not about behaviors. And so that's different from the research misconduct.

1308
02:27:14,470 --> 02:27:17,590
Kind of definition, the research misconduct.

1309
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:22,870
There are sort of bad behaviors that people are doing for understandable reasons.

1310
02:27:23,530 --> 02:27:29,620
This is a condition that could lead to those behaviors, but it's not saying any of these behaviors have been engaged in.

1311
02:27:29,830 --> 02:27:36,340
It's not saying that I can't do this research if I have a financial interest in it.

1312
02:27:36,340 --> 02:27:41,200
It's just that it's really critical that I disclose my financial interest in this.

1313
02:27:42,310 --> 02:27:52,540
And so this is where we talk about like there's an actual conflict, like I have my own stock in this Alzheimer's drug.

1314
02:27:52,540 --> 02:27:57,339
And so if the results are favorable, then I am going to personally earn a lot of money.

1315
02:27:57,340 --> 02:28:06,700
And I'm an Alzheimer's researcher. So that situation happened and that was an actual conflict of interest.

1316
02:28:07,120 --> 02:28:11,950
And that person probably should have sold their stock before knowing about this clinical trial results.

1317
02:28:13,180 --> 02:28:20,950
There could be a perceived or a potential conflict of interest, even if, you know, it seems kind of remote.

1318
02:28:21,220 --> 02:28:26,650
The, you know, the best thing to do that the thing one has to do is disclose.

1319
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:30,129
And our system for doing that is called form.

1320
02:28:30,130 --> 02:28:35,830
And you'll get like that alert to check your and inform your conflict of interest.

1321
02:28:35,830 --> 02:28:43,270
And if you take on, you know, again, like at this career stage, people may or may not have conflicts of interest.

1322
02:28:43,270 --> 02:28:49,629
You know, you could be affiliated with a prior company or something that you work with that is also connected to your research.

1323
02:28:49,630 --> 02:28:51,340
And that could be a conflict of interest.

1324
02:28:52,210 --> 02:28:59,050
So it's always important to disclose when in doubt and they have people that you could email to ask through that system.

1325
02:29:00,040 --> 02:29:07,359
And then the other thing I like to put in here, too, is that it's important to think about like even just the agenda of the funders of our research,

1326
02:29:07,360 --> 02:29:17,139
because some foundations or private funders certainly do have an agenda that they're, you know, their foundation is about whatever it is.

1327
02:29:17,140 --> 02:29:23,970
And so that's what they want. Like, if your results counter that knowing that that's an okay to state to the funders.

1328
02:29:23,980 --> 02:29:29,050
Yeah I worked for a while and I felt like.

1329
02:29:30,330 --> 02:29:38,310
Yeah. Does anything? Saying something like he basically was working for Ohio State and another university.

1330
02:29:39,040 --> 02:29:50,320
But he had affiliations with. And that's a program that was used to basically take intellectual property rights to China to help the.

1331
02:29:51,870 --> 02:29:55,730
He's in prison now. Yeah, that's a big, big.

1332
02:29:56,910 --> 02:30:03,360
Yes. I feel like there and I don't know if I'm even thinking specifically of that case, but I feel like there have been a few.

1333
02:30:03,360 --> 02:30:07,560
They're like these talent programs. I forget what it's called.

1334
02:30:07,670 --> 02:30:12,840
It's it's so interesting that you say that because that in that informed system.

1335
02:30:12,840 --> 02:30:15,959
So any time where like on An or B or part of a grant application,

1336
02:30:15,960 --> 02:30:20,880
we have to go through and collect them and select whether we have conflict of interest.

1337
02:30:20,880 --> 02:30:28,030
And they ask, do you participate in. It's something like a foreign talent recruitment program or something.

1338
02:30:28,030 --> 02:30:35,340
And I feel like it came from these cases because it's new. It's like a new box to check this person's affiliation for the start.

1339
02:30:36,340 --> 02:30:43,840
Yeah. There is, but it's been definitely in the news and that there also is now I might even have a different side on it,

1340
02:30:43,840 --> 02:30:53,610
but that international collaboration. Disclosures are, I think, in response to those as well.

1341
02:30:53,610 --> 02:30:58,230
So those are like a new set of disclosures that one needs to make.

1342
02:30:58,290 --> 02:31:03,999
If, like, for example, I have a colleague in Canada who asked me to be a consultant on her grant and I'm like,

1343
02:31:04,000 --> 02:31:07,260
It sounds great, but now every single form I have to do,

1344
02:31:07,260 --> 02:31:11,579
I have to disclose that I have this relationship with Canada that relates to

1345
02:31:11,580 --> 02:31:15,390
my research because her research is funded through the Canadian government.

1346
02:31:15,510 --> 02:31:21,000
And so I'm like, it's just like an extra thing to have to remember to do.

1347
02:31:21,360 --> 02:31:25,110
And I was in that window of like they were changing a system.

1348
02:31:25,980 --> 02:31:31,590
I didn't really realize I had to do it yet. And then some of these grant got submitted and then they had to, you know,

1349
02:31:31,740 --> 02:31:40,830
hound me for like an updated other support page which everybody sort of the fear here for Grant's going to come through.

1350
02:31:40,830 --> 02:31:45,750
Everybody on the grant needs to put in another support page that shows all the other funding they have.

1351
02:31:46,530 --> 02:31:46,890
So anyway,

1352
02:31:47,100 --> 02:31:56,190
it's there's a lot of detail and what's awesome is that know them because they're such a big huge system has people to ask about all of that stuff.

1353
02:31:56,190 --> 02:32:03,480
So if you're like, this is the situation, do I just pose like I would say ask and they can do they can direct you.

1354
02:32:04,780 --> 02:32:19,019
Um, let's see, I think why this is important or can be important is that there are and again, this is like really tricky,

1355
02:32:19,020 --> 02:32:26,759
I think for especially public health and especially thinking about interventions that are like big picture systems,

1356
02:32:26,760 --> 02:32:33,270
wide structural type interventions like here is sort of the food industry and the nutrition industry.

1357
02:32:33,270 --> 02:32:41,520
So like really in order to make a difference in childhood obesity prevention, I would like work with soft drink companies to say let's,

1358
02:32:41,970 --> 02:32:47,220
you know, shrink your portion sizes or do something that you're that would have huge impact.

1359
02:32:47,640 --> 02:32:50,070
And in order to do that kind of huge intervention,

1360
02:32:50,070 --> 02:32:56,549
you have to establish relationships with with those companies who are like creating this big bad food environment.

1361
02:32:56,550 --> 02:33:00,840
And so it's a really messy area because.

1362
02:33:02,590 --> 02:33:07,209
If one is funded by, you know, in this case it's like food industry,

1363
02:33:07,210 --> 02:33:11,530
but could be a foundation that like there's one particular mental health research

1364
02:33:11,530 --> 02:33:16,420
foundation that's very committed to my biological explanations of mental health.

1365
02:33:17,590 --> 02:33:23,889
And so if you proposed to them like something that's much more sort of social explanations of mental health concerns,

1366
02:33:23,890 --> 02:33:27,700
they're very unlikely to fund you because that's just kind of not their interest area.

1367
02:33:29,200 --> 02:33:34,120
And there are legitimate you know, they have peer reviews and they're a good organization, a good foundation.

1368
02:33:34,120 --> 02:33:38,199
But they're just they're going to fund researchers who are looking at biology.

1369
02:33:38,200 --> 02:33:43,210
And so the researchers who are finding like, gosh, biology maybe doesn't have that much to do with this.

1370
02:33:44,740 --> 02:33:51,190
They are going to be not funded by the organization. So even at that level of like really good solid research,

1371
02:33:51,190 --> 02:33:55,600
like there's a potential kind of conflict of interest of what your findings are and what the funding sources.

1372
02:33:56,050 --> 02:34:03,790
And so then when you take it to this level of like people who are funded, that was that like the thought and the Coca-Cola side piece.

1373
02:34:03,790 --> 02:34:10,480
But this is that issue of just there are so many different ways to like.

1374
02:34:12,070 --> 02:34:22,200
But it's very insidious. Funding kind of considerations can creep into research findings, even if it's sort of not intentional.

1375
02:34:23,950 --> 02:34:29,229
And so that is why disclosure is so important. So you can sort of read all the research findings.

1376
02:34:29,230 --> 02:34:32,799
It's not that they're necessarily fabricated or fraud or misconduct,

1377
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:39,030
but there could have been a shaping of the research findings knowing who the funding source was.

1378
02:34:41,700 --> 02:34:48,750
And I think this is this kind of got a lot of press a few years ago around that, you know,

1379
02:34:49,860 --> 02:34:56,070
people who were paying for the study and sort of picking and picking up terms and this was like soda companies mostly.

1380
02:34:57,150 --> 02:35:00,629
But they're a soda company that they own, like water.

1381
02:35:00,630 --> 02:35:04,320
And, you know, there's lots of different products. It's not only soda.

1382
02:35:05,040 --> 02:35:07,890
And so there's a lot of studies that have kind of come out.

1383
02:35:09,250 --> 02:35:13,320
And some came out a few years ago that said, you know, you can drink some soda, it's not so bad.

1384
02:35:13,860 --> 02:35:21,569
And, you know, generally being a the obesity prevention business, like really kids to drink zero soda, it's never optimal.

1385
02:35:21,570 --> 02:35:27,930
And that was this kind of controversial thing because a lot of these studies

1386
02:35:28,560 --> 02:35:33,270
got funding through American Beverage Association and like Coke and Pepsi.

1387
02:35:35,630 --> 02:35:40,190
And they noted that they didn't have conflicts of interest that they found.

1388
02:35:42,520 --> 02:35:44,770
The reviews didn't have conflicts of interest,

1389
02:35:44,770 --> 02:35:54,300
found more of a positive relationship between sugary drink consumption and obesity risk than the ones with conflict of interest sort of like.

1390
02:35:54,310 --> 02:35:56,010
So it was inconclusive.

1391
02:35:56,020 --> 02:36:04,060
And so this is sort of being like was like a big reveal of like ways that conflicts of interests can actually play into results.

1392
02:36:06,490 --> 02:36:12,459
Okay. And I think that this is the key point, too, is that, like, we have to work with these big industries.

1393
02:36:12,460 --> 02:36:16,330
And so conflict of interest is sort of everywhere, depending on the nature of work that you do.

1394
02:36:17,980 --> 02:36:21,730
Okay. Similar story with like the meat industry.

1395
02:36:21,730 --> 02:36:30,610
Another story came out. So someone who had said, oh, these meat guidelines are like outdated meat is okay, red meat is okay.

1396
02:36:30,610 --> 02:36:33,370
And then that person had food industry ties purposely.

1397
02:36:33,370 --> 02:36:41,890
So it's not saying that that person was going in and like faking the data, but it was just the messaging that was around the study.

1398
02:36:42,550 --> 02:36:50,290
Okay, so here's like the really sort of complicated graph, but it's really helpful if you're trying to figure out like,

1399
02:36:50,530 --> 02:36:53,980
do I have conflict of interests when, you know, what do I disclose?

1400
02:36:54,940 --> 02:37:00,310
I'm sort of this is available on the website, but it basically just takes it takes it.

1401
02:37:02,550 --> 02:37:06,930
Takes it apart, takes it, takes you through all the different decision making stuff.

1402
02:37:06,930 --> 02:37:11,820
So here, like any given activity like this consulting with my colleague in Canada,

1403
02:37:12,690 --> 02:37:17,249
I'm not doing it as a part of my job, in which case I would have not had to disclose it.

1404
02:37:17,250 --> 02:37:20,860
But it is international, so that's automatically not part of my job.

1405
02:37:20,860 --> 02:37:24,120
I'm done. And then a company doing business with you then?

1406
02:37:24,480 --> 02:37:28,889
Yes. Then you should disclose if it's related to expertize.

1407
02:37:28,890 --> 02:37:34,950
If it's not related, like if it's related to my knitting expertize, which I don't have, then I don't need to disclose.

1408
02:37:34,950 --> 02:37:43,350
So like anything that I'm doing in my professional context that's not already part of my job is a disclosure basically.

1409
02:37:44,010 --> 02:37:47,640
But this can sort of show lots of different things that might come up.

1410
02:37:48,120 --> 02:37:54,750
So you can be volunteering, you can be paid. It doesn't need to be financial, but it could be volunteering.

1411
02:37:55,050 --> 02:38:00,720
Are you in a leadership role in the setting? Do you have ownership equity in like the company?

1412
02:38:00,720 --> 02:38:04,410
That's like the situation this is consulting.

1413
02:38:06,440 --> 02:38:11,839
Do you get paid to travel and speak at places?

1414
02:38:11,840 --> 02:38:15,110
And sometimes that's disclosed, sometimes it's not.

1415
02:38:17,930 --> 02:38:22,490
What else? Oh.

1416
02:38:22,520 --> 02:38:25,999
The other thing to note, sorry, is that it can't be. It can also be not you.

1417
02:38:26,000 --> 02:38:33,980
It can be your spouse or domestic partner or like brother who has who owns Coca-Cola and you don't obviously research.

1418
02:38:35,930 --> 02:38:39,740
Yeah. I was going to ask about where do personal relationships fall in?

1419
02:38:42,350 --> 02:38:50,479
So I would say still, it's like you're on the side of disclosure and if it's close because this happens,

1420
02:38:50,480 --> 02:38:52,940
you know, we can see a lot of situations where that could happen. Right?

1421
02:38:52,970 --> 02:39:00,070
Like you can know somebody in an industry and that gets you interested in this research area and then you do research on that industry.

1422
02:39:00,080 --> 02:39:02,120
So that would be a place to disclose.

1423
02:39:02,510 --> 02:39:10,549
I would say, like if somebody like works at I feel like this came up in the discussion at least one time and I'm not sure what the answer would be,

1424
02:39:10,550 --> 02:39:18,290
but like if somebody works at Ford and you're doing transportation research, I think that means a disclosure.

1425
02:39:19,970 --> 02:39:24,430
You know, I think it was in this class a few years ago,

1426
02:39:24,440 --> 02:39:33,379
we had this big discussion about it because it was like you'd have to in reality, that just feels like it's so far away.

1427
02:39:33,380 --> 02:39:41,840
But the perceived being like if a newspaper headline could be written about it saying like, you know,

1428
02:39:41,840 --> 02:39:48,830
transportation industry researcher finds, you know, car seats aren't that effective and her husband works at Ford.

1429
02:39:49,340 --> 02:39:54,440
Like that could be a newspaper headline that would like call that research into question.

1430
02:39:54,440 --> 02:39:58,080
And if it's disclosed that at least there's like this protection.

1431
02:39:58,140 --> 02:40:05,240
So it's like, you know, they're aware of, you know, if there is a conflict of interest, we have a plan to monitor it.

1432
02:40:06,970 --> 02:40:09,090
Does that? Yeah, kind of. I hope.

1433
02:40:10,730 --> 02:40:22,200
And so for me and I worked in the office initially, I know I'm not saying my friends, I still think oh, but I know everybody in our.

1434
02:40:23,600 --> 02:40:28,430
Apartments and things. They're all still with them, Grant. If I was to lie.

1435
02:40:28,460 --> 02:40:31,970
Oh, yeah, but they don't do the pool and they're not on.

1436
02:40:32,660 --> 02:40:37,530
That's a great thing, because they work with all the money and. Right.

1437
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:47,089
With that being. So it could for that light because for example and we'll talk about that stuff

1438
02:40:47,090 --> 02:40:52,639
to your viewing but in the room like imagine 40 more people in this room,

1439
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:58,670
everybody with their laptop and like seven grants to ten grants to review of, of a colleague.

1440
02:40:59,960 --> 02:41:05,750
If you have a personal relationship with the person whose grant was being reviewed, you need to get up and go out of the room.

1441
02:41:06,500 --> 02:41:12,950
And in that scientific review process, like I have actually asked my person, not program officer, but the person who read this,

1442
02:41:12,950 --> 02:41:20,520
the grant review session, like I think I said, like is, is like being on like a holiday card list.

1443
02:41:20,540 --> 02:41:26,329
Does that count as like a conflict? And she was like, you know, I think it was she was equivocal.

1444
02:41:26,330 --> 02:41:31,760
She was like, well, if you think they can you can review their science. Like how close of a friend I was like.

1445
02:41:32,300 --> 02:41:34,610
And then I felt like I should leave the room. So I have the room.

1446
02:41:35,540 --> 02:41:45,379
So if you do not disclose in that very specific context that you like and again this is perceived as well as actual.

1447
02:41:45,380 --> 02:41:49,520
So actual might be like, Oh, they're my best friend. I really want them to get this funding.

1448
02:41:49,520 --> 02:41:53,540
I'm going to like score their grant high. Like that is an actual conflict.

1449
02:41:53,580 --> 02:42:01,820
You can't do it totally unethical. Only through that perceived conflict is like you have is a big place.

1450
02:42:02,150 --> 02:42:06,860
There's someone over in like dentistry who's got a grant that has nothing to do.

1451
02:42:06,860 --> 02:42:09,229
I don't even know. I wouldn't know. But I passed on st.

1452
02:42:09,230 --> 02:42:15,770
I can't recognize their name but they are at the University of Michigan and I'm not there's in are I have to leave the room because it's

1453
02:42:15,770 --> 02:42:24,230
a conflict of interest with the idea that like maybe I would score their higher to get more glories university Michigan kind of thing.

1454
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:30,470
And so I think in that case if you're if you know someone in the grant office who could like at any

1455
02:42:30,470 --> 02:42:35,360
point make a decision that's like favorable unfavorable to something that you're involved with,

1456
02:42:35,810 --> 02:42:41,780
I think they would probably need to recuse themselves. I don't think you would, because then you become like the applicant.

1457
02:42:41,870 --> 02:42:47,750
Right. But for them, I think I'm sure there's a comparable process on that.

1458
02:42:48,890 --> 02:42:55,750
Kind of like decision. And but it's a gray area because they don't have control over the funds.

1459
02:42:55,940 --> 02:42:58,579
But they could, like, you know,

1460
02:42:58,580 --> 02:43:05,840
decide to put your grant proposal further up on the agenda at the council discussion where like money is more free flowing and they're like,

1461
02:43:05,840 --> 02:43:08,030
Oh, great, we have all these.

1462
02:43:08,030 --> 02:43:16,249
Like the way that that process works is that there's all these grants that are kind of like on the bubble maybe, and they're reviewed at council,

1463
02:43:16,250 --> 02:43:22,790
which is when the money decisions are made, the scientific decisions are a different review process at council.

1464
02:43:23,210 --> 02:43:28,850
Somebody could pluck a grant from the big list of grants that they're trying to decide whether to fund or not,

1465
02:43:29,330 --> 02:43:34,580
and that could be maybe influenced by that the program staff.

1466
02:43:35,420 --> 02:43:43,459
So that's not something I wouldn't have to. I don't think you would have to disclose that, but it's a good question.

1467
02:43:43,460 --> 02:43:52,610
Like if you apply to the NHLPA and you might have to like maybe write a cover letter to say,

1468
02:43:53,420 --> 02:43:57,860
I have work with these individuals in the past and I bet there's a guideline for it.

1469
02:43:57,920 --> 02:44:02,030
That's a great question. Yeah, I don't think that's come up a lot.

1470
02:44:03,710 --> 02:44:06,920
My mean, they end up staying and they get hired as.

1471
02:44:09,330 --> 02:44:11,840
They don't want. They're not the applicant.

1472
02:44:12,560 --> 02:44:21,510
I wonder, you know, Marcus is another graduate student who had also worked and I age I think he worked and I didn't.

1473
02:44:21,510 --> 02:44:29,129
K So he, I'm not sure if he's done that, but like if he applied for an F 31 or something I think might have to do for that same process.

1474
02:44:29,130 --> 02:44:32,250
So that might be a good person to talk to you about that.

1475
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:39,740
But if you if you wonder about whether to close it here, I would ask that and inform people for sure and they'll know.

1476
02:44:39,810 --> 02:44:46,310
That's a great question. And that is that kind of kind of falls in this like external entity.

1477
02:44:46,310 --> 02:44:49,430
Like, am I using my skills at my U of M position?

1478
02:44:49,670 --> 02:44:52,760
Like, yeah, yeah. That's going to be really broad.

1479
02:44:55,520 --> 02:44:58,909
So I just want to go through.

1480
02:44:58,910 --> 02:45:05,540
So this is handy. There's the I just want to click through quickly these other areas of conflict of interest.

1481
02:45:05,540 --> 02:45:11,440
So effort certification is kind of like what they were asking about, about that driving to the houses issue.

1482
02:45:11,450 --> 02:45:18,499
Like what are they doing with their time? Are they actually working on the grant proposal, you know, on the grants that they're slotted to work in?

1483
02:45:18,500 --> 02:45:23,190
So. I. I don't know.

1484
02:45:23,490 --> 02:45:27,720
So, Amy, as an employee of your family, you probably had to do effort certification.

1485
02:45:28,950 --> 02:45:33,179
And if you work on multiple projects, you go on.

1486
02:45:33,180 --> 02:45:38,790
It's like once a year, it's effort certification and it's like I'm, I work on, I have like a lot of different things.

1487
02:45:38,790 --> 02:45:42,240
I'm like, I'm 2% on this, I'm 4% on this one, 10% on this.

1488
02:45:42,630 --> 02:45:46,020
And that changes by the month. Right. So you've all had that experience.

1489
02:45:46,290 --> 02:45:53,490
Yeah, it is. And it's you know, they make it easy to say, yep, that sounds right if you click a button.

1490
02:45:54,180 --> 02:45:59,909
But they also have you answer these questions that are like, what is the role of effort certification?

1491
02:45:59,910 --> 02:46:04,320
Which I like, because it just remind you, it's like if my effort changes,

1492
02:46:04,770 --> 02:46:10,679
I need to actually change the distribution of my work days and I need to like alert the administrator.

1493
02:46:10,680 --> 02:46:17,850
So like if I get a do grab or if someone, some co-investigator gets a grant that I went to the Grants Avenue people here

1494
02:46:17,850 --> 02:46:23,100
and say I do grant that funded like as soon as I know and then they're like,

1495
02:46:23,100 --> 02:46:25,770
okay, because then that makes them have to redistribute effort.

1496
02:46:27,720 --> 02:46:36,209
And so this is certainly this is a very concrete way that we think about effort, certification and like a conflict of interest.

1497
02:46:36,210 --> 02:46:41,070
But it's also true that, like if there's one project that may be underfunded,

1498
02:46:41,070 --> 02:46:44,430
it's taken a little more time than we anticipated, which is every project.

1499
02:46:44,430 --> 02:46:45,600
But, you know,

1500
02:46:45,600 --> 02:46:55,259
if there's a main one and you're like allocating more time and energy and effort and resources to that project to the detriment of other projects,

1501
02:46:55,260 --> 02:47:03,540
like that's a problem of effort, certification, and your responsibility is to be accurate and to report when your effort changes.

1502
02:47:04,150 --> 02:47:11,480
Um, and I think we also all know, like there's never a week when you're spending 2% on this and 10% less than that.

1503
02:47:11,520 --> 02:47:15,540
It's like generally over time that reflects the distribution of my labor.

1504
02:47:16,950 --> 02:47:18,750
So that's the certification piece.

1505
02:47:19,320 --> 02:47:26,490
And again, like depending on your funding stream, you guys may or may not have to do that as a student, but just sort of conceptually.

1506
02:47:26,970 --> 02:47:34,530
And then this international piece, which is new and relatively new, so know what to disclose, you know, and I would say.

1507
02:47:36,280 --> 02:47:45,910
You know, knowing in the the Queens example of this investigator is important because, you know,

1508
02:47:46,510 --> 02:47:55,030
cultural variation and like what's acceptable and what's research misconduct and what's, you know, effort certification and what's plagiarism.

1509
02:47:55,030 --> 02:48:04,300
And lots of things come up around in this kind of cultural variation space and sort of knowing talking to people who are,

1510
02:48:04,810 --> 02:48:07,510
you know, internationally with the people that you might be, you know,

1511
02:48:07,510 --> 02:48:14,499
in the countries you may be working in and knowing sort of the protocols and what's expected and what's typical and figuring out like what

1512
02:48:14,500 --> 02:48:25,570
you're responsible for and sort of the your them are U.S. university side and what is sort of typical in population working in there's.

1513
02:48:27,030 --> 02:48:34,560
You know, again, talking to colleagues who did work in the country that are going to really important is okay.

1514
02:48:34,860 --> 02:48:41,159
And I think oh, and then just this idea of managing conflicts of interest so we disclose them

1515
02:48:41,160 --> 02:48:46,650
and then we have a plan for managing them and they're both very important.

1516
02:48:46,980 --> 02:48:52,170
And so in the long run, money conquers all through.

1517
02:48:52,170 --> 02:48:56,340
Like lots of things just boil down to money for somebody, maybe not the individual,

1518
02:48:57,810 --> 02:49:02,760
but this idea of first we disclose and then we recuse from decision making.

1519
02:49:02,760 --> 02:49:06,410
So that's what we were just talking about, a space divest.

1520
02:49:06,420 --> 02:49:11,159
So like if you're going to know the results of a clinical trial and you're buying stock in a company like

1521
02:49:11,160 --> 02:49:18,570
that's unethical and it's also illegal from like a stock buying federal finances management perspective,

1522
02:49:20,010 --> 02:49:25,379
modify your research plan. And that could include like we're going to post our hypotheses on open science.

1523
02:49:25,380 --> 02:49:29,670
We're going to, you know, publish the measures that we're using.

1524
02:49:29,670 --> 02:49:38,610
We're going to publish our analysis plan and make it more transparent or other changes you could be reporting to oversight bodies.

1525
02:49:39,390 --> 02:49:44,280
And those can vary like by type of study, but clinical trials is certainly one of those.

1526
02:49:45,660 --> 02:49:53,820
They also have people like there's a bioethics center here and they can do an ethics consultation and that's actually a large part of their life,

1527
02:49:54,300 --> 02:50:00,150
quote unquote business. So you have all role, but it's like their business with the med school.

1528
02:50:00,240 --> 02:50:04,740
And so they do a lot of ethics consultations and that's that center,

1529
02:50:04,740 --> 02:50:13,590
that Brian segment Fisher is part of and Scott actually also the social sciences and medicine.

1530
02:50:14,880 --> 02:50:26,880
So there that's that's a role that they take on here is the conflict of interest site for U of M and again like you'll be prompted to do these but

1531
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:35,610
if you're curious and you know you have something that's like your mom doesn't know about or may not know about that good to go and check out.

1532
02:50:37,470 --> 02:50:46,500
And then I would just say here, there's certainly financial conflicts of interests at the individual level.

1533
02:50:46,500 --> 02:50:52,870
So talk about consulting. Cancer study used nutrition as an example.

1534
02:50:52,870 --> 02:50:58,959
But cancer studies and like anything that really costs a lot of money to do, I don't know if you guys have this issue in the cancer work,

1535
02:50:58,960 --> 02:51:07,180
but like there's a lot that's funded by industry because a lot of the especially in the biomedical world,

1536
02:51:07,180 --> 02:51:14,140
there's these things are very expensive to conduct and industry is often behind testing, you know, drugs basically.

1537
02:51:14,820 --> 02:51:20,370
Gifts and travel to an individual conflict of interest. Institutional conflicts of interest.

1538
02:51:20,460 --> 02:51:24,270
This is also where we get into that commercialization space.

1539
02:51:24,360 --> 02:51:29,909
And so if you you know, guys are early in careers, but if you feel like, gosh,

1540
02:51:29,910 --> 02:51:38,070
I might be venturing into this space where there's potential for commercialization, then it's important to talk to the Office of Tech Transfer.

1541
02:51:38,130 --> 02:51:44,220
So like, for example, Marc Zimmerman with an institute with an intervention they had for a long time,

1542
02:51:45,360 --> 02:51:48,120
there were like a lot of discussions because a lot of people want to be

1543
02:51:48,120 --> 02:51:51,120
intervention because you published something in the sense of great intervention,

1544
02:51:51,120 --> 02:51:54,839
I want to do it and you're not really funded to do that dissemination.

1545
02:51:54,840 --> 02:51:57,479
So you're like, Well, okay, we'll come and train you.

1546
02:51:57,480 --> 02:52:03,120
And that training will take, you know, cost $3,000 and we'll have our people fly out and do the training.

1547
02:52:03,120 --> 02:52:10,950
And so you get into these things where you're then all of a sudden going, I don't know, am I a business like who owns this property?

1548
02:52:10,960 --> 02:52:14,670
So the Tech Transfer Office will help sort of sort of smooth these things out.

1549
02:52:15,870 --> 02:52:22,190
And it's important to do so at the beginning of the research and,

1550
02:52:22,260 --> 02:52:25,560
and think I'll just click these up here and then I think that's yeah, that's all right.

1551
02:52:26,490 --> 02:52:32,850
So other potential conflicts of interest so like professional so like are you in the position of hiring,

1552
02:52:32,850 --> 02:52:37,440
you know, your friends, little brother, you know, that kind of conflict of interest?

1553
02:52:38,700 --> 02:52:45,600
I think this is also important, this like ideological. What are our biases in what we're sort of choosing to study and and.

1554
02:52:46,310 --> 02:52:57,500
Center or prioritize in our research career isn't in research that's like that Brian Wansink example and then community community advocacy.

1555
02:52:57,500 --> 02:53:03,260
And I think we can discuss this more, but I think this can come up a lot in terms of community based research.

1556
02:53:03,260 --> 02:53:07,850
Like what does the community want to come out of your research? Like what did they want it to show?

1557
02:53:08,330 --> 02:53:16,219
Is that what your research is showing? Is there like a disconnect there and then how to kind of manage, you know,

1558
02:53:16,220 --> 02:53:24,140
community needs with what your kind of research is showing and how to interpret your research findings.

1559
02:53:24,140 --> 02:53:28,850
That's in a way that is not biased.

1560
02:53:31,060 --> 02:53:36,150
And you know, you may want to advocate for something, but maybe there's not a lot of evidence for it.

1561
02:53:36,160 --> 02:53:40,690
But the community still wants it and different scenarios coming up around that.

1562
02:53:42,700 --> 02:53:44,850
Okay. And we can talk more about that as well.

1563
02:53:45,060 --> 02:53:50,620
I think we have another session where you're talking about that community based research ethics, because I think that's important to talk about.

1564
02:53:50,680 --> 02:53:55,000
It's pretty cool. So sorry I went a few minutes over there, but.

1565
02:53:57,130 --> 02:54:04,750
That's it. That's like a lot of dense topic stuff, but cool.

1566
02:54:04,900 --> 02:54:12,400
Well, next time we'll do so, Clara, we'll do presentation and then actually let me just triple.

1567
02:54:15,210 --> 02:54:18,810
Our panel is going to come.

1568
02:54:19,830 --> 02:54:26,180
I think it works well to present first. And then they're coming out like.

1569
02:54:31,040 --> 02:54:37,490
It's either ten or 1015. But I think either way that should work her card present first and then for you guys if you.

1570
02:54:39,110 --> 02:54:42,080
I think for the panel 1015. I said 1015.

1571
02:54:43,070 --> 02:54:48,559
If you guys have and I know you've seen a lot of the students before anything, but if you guys have questions,

1572
02:54:48,560 --> 02:54:57,080
you know, things that you particularly want to delve into, I think that's helpful because they're happy to talk.

1573
02:54:58,790 --> 02:55:02,480
Two. But, you know, and he sort of guided.

1574
02:55:04,880 --> 02:55:09,980
Things that come up like delivering souvenirs and yeah.

1575
02:55:09,980 --> 02:55:20,780
So the people who are coming, I know, uh, some of the first or some of the, um, I can't remember if Kiana is going to come.

1576
02:55:21,180 --> 02:55:24,680
She might have had a conflict, but Esther's coming. Laura.

1577
02:55:26,030 --> 02:55:36,129
Akeelah. I reached out to West and West, reached out and said he'd be willing to come,

1578
02:55:36,130 --> 02:55:39,370
but they have not heard back from him and I have not heard back from Kiana.

1579
02:55:40,270 --> 02:55:45,219
I feel like maybe there's one other person. So a little bit of around people who are kind of closer to you.

1580
02:55:45,220 --> 02:55:52,540
And the training, which I think is good because some of the processes have changed a little bit like around the prelims.

1581
02:55:53,140 --> 02:56:06,700
Prelims are always good discussion GSC options courses that are good to take, like kind of how to navigate, you know, mentors or other.

1582
02:56:08,990 --> 02:56:14,420
Topics. I feel like some years we've talked about funding sources.

1583
02:56:17,620 --> 02:56:21,550
Also have notes. But, you know, whatever you guys feel like. Yes, I just.

1584
02:56:22,750 --> 02:56:29,140
About, I think is. Balance of, like, independent publishing.

1585
02:56:29,640 --> 02:56:34,590
What to do after prelim, which Kiana is after in this group.

1586
02:56:34,590 --> 02:56:40,470
But others are still before play. So. I think it's a good usually good discussion.

1587
02:56:44,010 --> 02:56:56,980
That'd be good. And if there's any upside, just if there's anything that you guys are particularly wanting to like delve more into as we go,

1588
02:56:57,970 --> 02:57:07,830
let me know, because I feel like it's kind of a good pause, not positive, but, you know, types about a lot of stuff.

1589
02:57:07,830 --> 02:57:12,000
There's a lot of stuff still to cover, but if there's something that's going on there, that's a real.

1590
02:57:21,020 --> 02:57:26,290
Who wants to think? There's always more.

1591
02:57:29,060 --> 02:57:32,170
I'm like. Know.

1592
02:57:40,020 --> 02:58:14,550
Well. This.

1593
02:58:18,080 --> 02:58:25,570
Oh. Council.

1594
02:58:33,910 --> 02:58:40,049
Oh, yeah. Did you? Oh. So we're stuck. Holy [INAUDIBLE] her up there.

1595
02:58:40,050 --> 02:58:45,330
Just like that's our nine year.

1596
02:58:48,410 --> 02:58:52,390
I think you better do something. Presentation.

1597
02:58:56,240 --> 02:58:56,410
That.
