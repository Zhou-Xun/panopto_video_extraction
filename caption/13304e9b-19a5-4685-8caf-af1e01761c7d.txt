1
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,070
One of my hobbies is to construct jigsaw puzzles.

2
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:21,700
Over the years, I've learned that if I have a picture as to what I'm trying to build, it is much easier to put that jigsaw puzzle together.

3
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:28,090
I think the same is true in epidemiology. In this particular video,

4
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,349
I'm going to talk to you about what types of data comes out of these longitudinal

5
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:36,790
studies and define the measures of associations that we use in these studies.

6
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,450
I'll also talk about one nuance for a randomized controlled trial about the importance to

7
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:49,010
analyze data using an intention to treat analysis as opposed to a per protocol analysis.

8
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:57,430
And I'll tell you what that means as we get into the live video. So as you probably recall from our previous videos and other coursework,

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:06,370
the randomized controlled trial and cohort designs both begin with individuals who have no disease of interest at the start of the study.

10
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:16,330
Investigators then either assign exposures such as what you do in an experimental RC design or they assess people's lived exposures.

11
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,670
In the observational cohort design.

12
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:27,610
Time then passes and the investigators observe whether or not people develop the outcome or not and classify them accordingly.

13
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,380
If the outcome being measured is a binary one, meaning do you have the disease or not?

14
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:43,530
Then the investigator can estimate the incidence proportion among the exposed and the unexposed and compare them on either

15
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:52,740
the relative or multiplicative scale using a risk ratio or the absolute or additive scale using a risk difference measure.

16
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:59,760
The investigator could also report this odd measure that you've seen before called the odds ratio,

17
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:04,200
which effectively reflects the odds of the disease among the exposed.

18
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:10,380
Divided by the odds of disease among the unexposed. And it simplifies the equation that you see here.

19
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:18,020
While this metric is honestly not preferred from a scientific standpoint because it always exaggerates the risk ratio,

20
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:22,460
you'll see that it's actually frequently used by the epidemiology literature.

21
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:31,430
Now the reason why is that logistic regression, which is what generates an odds ratio, has some very nice mathematical properties.

22
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:35,960
That's basically made it a favored statistical model by many people analyzing data.

23
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,690
Now these measures we just talked about of incidence,

24
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:46,950
proportion or risk or even odds are favored in a situation where you have a fixed or a closed cohort of individuals.

25
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:55,950
What that means is that all of the people in your study started at the same time together, and they're followed up over time.

26
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,100
And often they have very good data capture.

27
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:08,979
Measurements of risk or incidence proportion start to become far less reliable when an open cohort is used such that the population

28
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:16,570
is allowed to change over time based on some membership defining characteristic like being a current student in the online program.

29
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:22,990
Similarly, risk measures don't do very well when there are significant loss to follow up over time,

30
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:31,600
meaning people just stop coming back to be followed and investigators are unable to figure out whether or not they've developed the disease.

31
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:41,410
In both of these situations. The idea is that instead of counting people, you want to count the amount of person time that's happened under follow up.

32
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:42,879
Now, here,

33
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:50,950
I'm showing you what's supposed to be a graphical representation of the assembly of everybody's person time starting at the first time that they

34
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:59,290
were seen by the investigators until the point at which they were either lost to follow up the study ended or they developed the event of interest.

35
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,459
Now with this person time data,

36
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:11,490
we can now estimate the preferred measure when there's a lot of missing information or people are leaving the study and that's an incidence rates.

37
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,350
Here, I show you the equations again for incident rate ratios as estimated with a two by two table.

38
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:27,810
As with risk, we can estimate the relative measure of the incidence rate ratio, which is considered on the multiplicative scale,

39
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,350
or an absolute measure being the incidence rate difference which is estimated on the additive scale.

40
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:41,920
In practice, many epidemiology studies actually employ the kaplan-meier curves that you've

41
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,710
seen before in order to estimate cumulative survival or hazard functions.

42
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,760
These are then modeled with something called the Cox Proportional Hazards Model

43
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,490
in order to estimate hazard ratios between different groups of exposure.

44
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,310
Now, while I don't expect you to really know the details of the Cox proportional hazards model,

45
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:12,310
what I want you to understand is that conceptually it is comparing the hazards function among those who have exposure versus those who do not.

46
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,860
There's actually more information about this particular model in the book, if you're interested.

47
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,860
Now, the past several examples that I talked through were for binary outcomes,

48
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,230
but it's actually quite common for us to also evaluate continuous measures.

49
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:33,970
For example, you could imagine studies that collect data on blood pressure levels,

50
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:39,190
blood glucose levels, body mass indices, all different kinds of endpoints.

51
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:49,340
In fact, it also frequently happens in cohort studies that there's even continuous levels of the outcome as well as the exposure.

52
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:59,730
In these situations. What we do is we make comparison between the mean levels of the outcome, between different groups at some specified time period,

53
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:06,420
such as what's shown on the left or in the situation where we have repeated measures of an outcome.

54
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:13,740
We can even get much more fancy and look at how exposure might alter trajectories of the outcome over time.

55
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,100
Now, before we wrap up, I want to talk about one added nuance for the randomized controlled trial,

56
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:30,020
and that's an issue of noncompliance, although many individuals will stick with their assignment in a randomized controlled trial.

57
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,430
It's not uncommon for people who are assigned one exposure to stop that exposure or

58
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:41,650
those folks who don't have exposure might start taking an exposure if it's available.

59
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:50,140
Now, investigators really do their best to try and prevent this by blinding participants and doctors from knowing what treatment group they got to.

60
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,650
They don't tell them they mask the treatment by using placebos and do all kinds of tricks in that way.

61
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,040
Nonetheless, sometimes participants are still able to figure out what treatment they received.

62
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:11,800
In fact, I remember one example of a colleague in Mexico who was running a trial on fish oil and cardiovascular disease.

63
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,630
And what he told me is that even though they had blinded people to their treatment,

64
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:22,930
those who were on fish oil knew it because when they would burp, it would smell like fish.

65
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:30,400
Now, this is, of course, sort of a funny example, but you can also imagine that certain treatments might have more side effects.

66
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,780
And because of that, people might switch whether or not they're using their treatment.

67
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:44,620
Now, in either of these situations where people stop doing what you've assigned them to, investigators often wonder how to best analyze their data.

68
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,520
Do you analyze it based on what people were assigned to, or do you do it as they actually experience their life?

69
00:07:52,890 --> 00:08:01,530
Now, in spite of intuition telling us that we should analyze based on what people actually did using a per protocol style approach,

70
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:09,180
this method turns out to be fraught with issues because the groups that you're comparing are no longer likely to be exchangeable.

71
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,520
In effect, you're losing all of the randomization that you worked so hard to create.

72
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:24,240
In addition, it turns out that it's actually possible to introduce other biases like selection bias when you analyze data per protocol.

73
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,850
Here. I'm showing you a really nice example from Christopher McCoy,

74
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:33,559
who describes a situation where participants were randomized to either having a

75
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:40,120
surgical intervention at six weeks in Group A or no surgical intervention in Group B.

76
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:48,110
Now, looking at the two experiences of A and B, you can see that there's an equal number of people dying in both groups.

77
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:54,410
There were 15 who died before the end of week six and then another 15 who died within the year.

78
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:01,020
As a result, the true risk ratio comparing group A to Group B is one,

79
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,150
meaning that the experiences of people in Group A is identical to that in Group B.

80
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:16,710
Just as we see, however, if people die before their surgery can take place here, shown as the 15 individuals that leave both groups A and B,

81
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:22,590
you would have 15 individuals who are assigned to surgery but never receive their treatment.

82
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,739
As shown on the right.

83
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:34,070
If we analyze the data using a per protocol technique, it would actually wind up suggesting that Group A had a lower risk than Group B.

84
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,120
This, as we know, is an incorrect assumption.

85
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:47,080
As a result, it is always recommended to analyze your data from an randomized controlled trial based on the assigned treatment,

86
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:50,260
which is known as an intent to treat analysis.

87
00:09:51,010 --> 00:10:00,370
Even though it is likely true that doing so may bias your results towards no association since by people switching treatment groups,

88
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,760
you're going to wind up with your groups being more similar to each other.

89
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:14,110
Nonetheless, this is still considered to be preferable because it introduces less predictable bias that can happen with the per protocol approach.

90
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,909
So in summary, we saw that risk ratios,

91
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:27,489
risk differences and odds ratios can be estimated with a closed cohort and RC teams in open cohorts or other

92
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:33,850
longitudinal designs where we have people being lost to follow up can estimate incidence rate ratios,

93
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:36,910
incidence rate differences and hazard rate ratios.

94
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:46,180
In the rc t please remember that intent to treat is always the preferred analysis approach in order to minimize potential bias.
