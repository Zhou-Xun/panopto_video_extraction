1
00:00:00,901 --> 00:00:01,645
In this module,

2
00:00:01,645 --> 00:00:05,448
I'll be talking to you about how we
assess human exposures to contaminants.

3
00:00:05,448 --> 00:00:08,838
But before we dive into that, I just
want to sort of pose a question to you.

4
00:00:08,838 --> 00:00:12,358
So have you read recently in the media,
almost certainly you have,

5
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:13,978
about a particular community or

6
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:18,048
group of people who have an exposure
to a particular harmful contaminant?

7
00:00:18,048 --> 00:00:20,848
You might have wondered well,
how do we actually know

8
00:00:20,848 --> 00:00:24,998
that people in that community
have that particular exposure?

9
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:30,867
And the answer to that is the art and
science of exposure assessment.

10
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:35,076
So I'd like to walk you through our
general approach to exposure assessment.

11
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:38,972
The graph here illustrates the two
primary approaches that we have.

12
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,998
One is called direct methods, as you can
see, and the other is indirect methods.

13
00:00:42,998 --> 00:00:47,736
So direct methods are considered our gold
standard because they involve us going out

14
00:00:47,736 --> 00:00:49,536
to a community or a workplace and

15
00:00:49,536 --> 00:00:53,358
making measurements directly on
the people who have the exposure.

16
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:55,593
And we really have two
ways to go about this.

17
00:00:55,593 --> 00:00:59,160
One is called personal monitoring,
where we put an instrument or a device

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,528
on a person, and they wear it around and
it measures their actual environment.

19
00:01:03,528 --> 00:01:05,658
The second is what's called
biological monitoring,

20
00:01:05,658 --> 00:01:08,298
where we take a sample of a tissue or

21
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:13,518
other material from that person and
analyze the contaminant in that sample.

22
00:01:13,518 --> 00:01:15,578
Now, we can combine personal and

23
00:01:15,578 --> 00:01:18,818
biological monitoring to come up
with what we call a Dose model.

24
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:22,068
Again, basically the estimate
of how much of that exposure

25
00:01:22,068 --> 00:01:24,888
is actually making it into their body.

26
00:01:24,888 --> 00:01:26,208
So that's the gold standard.

27
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:28,808
Unfortunately, this approach is expensive,
and

28
00:01:28,808 --> 00:01:31,778
it's pretty invasive because
people have to participate.

29
00:01:31,778 --> 00:01:34,868
So we are often forced to
rely on the indirect methods

30
00:01:34,868 --> 00:01:36,768
on the right side of this graph.

31
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,418
This can involve not measuring people but
rather measuring areas or

32
00:01:40,418 --> 00:01:42,838
certain environments
where people spend time.

33
00:01:42,838 --> 00:01:47,166
And then, ideally, we can talk
to people and not measure them,

34
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:52,136
but we can get a sense from them of how
long they spend in particular areas or

35
00:01:52,136 --> 00:01:55,048
how often they do particular activities.

36
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:59,324
And we can combine those two pieces of
information to create an exposure model

37
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:03,336
and try to predict what people are exposed
to without ever making a direct

38
00:02:03,336 --> 00:02:06,278
measurement on anyone.

39
00:02:06,278 --> 00:02:07,166
So just to reiterate,

40
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:09,795
we've got a couple of different
types of data we've introduced.

41
00:02:09,795 --> 00:02:13,593
Personal measurements are measurements
made on or even inside a person and

42
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:17,978
that very much represents their own
personal individualized exposure.

43
00:02:17,978 --> 00:02:21,958
We also have area measurements that are
made near people that we're interested in.

44
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,758
And in this case,
the area can be of any size.

45
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:30,464
It could be a very small few square feet
of land or part of a room in a building.

46
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:33,280
Could be the building,
could be a neighborhood,

47
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,306
could be an entire city or
even a region or continent.

48
00:02:36,306 --> 00:02:40,171
Now, unfortunately, we actually can't get
either of those kinds of data in some

49
00:02:40,171 --> 00:02:44,128
circumstances, in which case we rely on
what I'll call surrogate information.

50
00:02:44,128 --> 00:02:47,638
This is other data points that we
can use to make some assumptions

51
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:50,978
about a person's probable exposure.

52
00:02:50,978 --> 00:02:54,888
So on this graph, I'm presenting what
I'll call the hierarchy of exposure data.

53
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:58,828
And here, I just want to convey the point
that different kinds of exposure data

54
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:00,968
are not all created equally.

55
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:04,030
So at the top of the hierarchy
of exposure data would be these

56
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,413
quantified personal measurements
I've already talked about.

57
00:03:07,413 --> 00:03:10,634
This is best because we're taking
a measurement directly on the person who's

58
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:13,028
actually experiencing the exposure.

59
00:03:13,028 --> 00:03:15,891
Sometimes we aren't able to do that.

60
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:19,010
In that case, we might try to get
into an area near that person, and

61
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,698
we make a measurement in that area.

62
00:03:20,698 --> 00:03:24,918
And we make an assumption that that's
representative of their personal exposure.

63
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:28,198
Sometimes we can't even make an area
measurement but maybe, for example,

64
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:29,118
we have an idea well,

65
00:03:29,118 --> 00:03:33,398
how much does that person drink of
the drinking water that's contaminated?

66
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:37,068
And we can make some inferences
about how exposed they are.

67
00:03:37,068 --> 00:03:41,158
Sometimes we may only know the distance
that a person is from a source of a hazard

68
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:43,718
or the duration that
they're exposed there.

69
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:48,141
Sometimes we may only know that they lived
in a certain area that's a given distance

70
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:51,437
from a source, or that they lived
there for a certain period.

71
00:03:51,437 --> 00:03:54,439
Sometimes we have even less useful data,
like well,

72
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:59,338
this person lived in a county that had
a hazardous source for part of their life.

73
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:01,753
So you can see, going back to
that first thing I mentioned,

74
00:04:01,753 --> 00:04:05,398
these quantified personal measurements
are really what we're aiming for.

75
00:04:05,398 --> 00:04:09,122
And as we go down the hierarchy,
these things are less and less useful and

76
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:10,475
less and less desirable.

77
00:04:10,475 --> 00:04:14,298
But sometimes they're all we have,
and we have to make the most of them.

78
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:17,478
So let me talk a little bit more
about personal exposure measurement

79
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:18,828
in terms of biomarkers.

80
00:04:18,828 --> 00:04:22,088
So these, again, are biological
measurements we make of a tissue or

81
00:04:22,088 --> 00:04:24,408
other sample from a person's body.

82
00:04:24,408 --> 00:04:28,188
So there's an illustration on the right
side here of a biomarker measurement that

83
00:04:28,188 --> 00:04:29,308
hopefully none of you have experienced.

84
00:04:29,308 --> 00:04:32,508
This is a person getting
a breathalyzer test.

85
00:04:32,508 --> 00:04:35,598
So we're sampling the air that
this person breathes out,

86
00:04:35,598 --> 00:04:38,178
our machine can use that
information to estimate

87
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:42,778
how much alcohol is actually in
the blood of the person taking the test.

88
00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:43,768
We can do other measurements.

89
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:47,726
We can look for something called carboxy
hemoglobin in your blood as a measure of

90
00:04:47,726 --> 00:04:50,278
how much carbon monoxide
you've been exposed to.

91
00:04:50,278 --> 00:04:54,068
We can take a urine sample and
look for different kinds of metals.

92
00:04:54,068 --> 00:04:58,258
We can look at different fractions of your
blood to look for heavy metals like lead,

93
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:02,178
or for things like flame retardants and
organochlorines.

94
00:05:02,178 --> 00:05:04,088
Those things are all pretty invasive.

95
00:05:04,088 --> 00:05:06,378
We can do what are called
non-invasive methods.

96
00:05:06,378 --> 00:05:10,498
It's possible for
us to effectively use an x-ray to measure

97
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:15,098
how much heavy metals have deposited in
your bones or your liver or your skin.

98
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,268
We could take clippings
of your toenails and

99
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:19,868
look at how much metal
is in your toenails.

100
00:05:19,868 --> 00:05:23,658
We could take measurements from your fat
pads which tend to be where pesticides

101
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:24,668
accumulate.

102
00:05:24,668 --> 00:05:27,078
And again,
we could look at your exhaled breath and

103
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:31,368
measure certain types of
volatile chemicals that way.

104
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:34,618
So you may be tempted to think well,
gosh, if we can measure this in people,

105
00:05:34,618 --> 00:05:38,188
why would I ever take a personal
measurement on a person?

106
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:40,798
Unfortunately, biomarkers
are a very powerful tool, but

107
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,718
they're one that we often overestimate.

108
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:47,528
So what this graph here shows you on
the y-axis is basically a relative

109
00:05:47,528 --> 00:05:53,170
concentration of a bunch of different
types of biomarkers that we could collect.

110
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:56,918
And on the x-axis at the bottom
is the time after your exposure

111
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:00,398
that those biomarkers actually represent.

112
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:03,448
So if we look at that top-most curve,
urinary metabolites,

113
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:06,758
what you can see there is those
things are present in your blood

114
00:06:06,758 --> 00:06:11,268
almost immediately after exposure,
but only out to about four days.

115
00:06:11,268 --> 00:06:14,398
On the other hand,
the very bottom curve, urinary adducts,

116
00:06:14,398 --> 00:06:18,408
shows you that if we measure those things
we might actually pick up something in

117
00:06:18,408 --> 00:06:23,518
your urine that you were exposed to
a thousand days or almost three years ago.

118
00:06:23,518 --> 00:06:26,408
So if we don't know much about
the biomarker we're using,

119
00:06:26,408 --> 00:06:31,088
we may be taking away the wrong
inference about your exposure.

120
00:06:31,088 --> 00:06:34,718
If we're measuring something that moves
very quickly out of your body and

121
00:06:34,718 --> 00:06:37,638
we're not doing in urine,
we may not be picking up the right signal.

122
00:06:37,638 --> 00:06:43,297
So biomarkers are powerful, but
they don't fix all of our problems.

123
00:06:43,297 --> 00:06:45,686
I mentioned personal
exposure measurement before.

124
00:06:45,686 --> 00:06:49,462
So you can see here in this image a worker
who's wearing what we call an active

125
00:06:49,462 --> 00:06:51,148
sampling device.

126
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:55,544
So this worker is wearing a pump on their
waist that's drawing air through what's

127
00:06:55,544 --> 00:06:56,893
called a sampling head.

128
00:06:56,893 --> 00:07:00,279
And that sampling head contains something
that's going to catch that air and

129
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:03,618
filter out whatever's in there,
chemicals, dust, etc.

130
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:06,808
We can then send that sampler off to
a laboratory who can tell us here's what

131
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:09,878
chemicals were in the air
that that worker breathed, or

132
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:13,398
here's how much dust they
breathed in over time.

133
00:07:13,398 --> 00:07:16,098
We can also use what are called direct
reading instruments where we don't have to

134
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:17,498
send anything to the lab.

135
00:07:17,498 --> 00:07:20,198
They'll tell us right
now the concentration of

136
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:23,888
certain types of chemicals or
how much dust is in the air.

137
00:07:23,888 --> 00:07:27,168
You may have even already used a direct
reading instrument without knowing it.

138
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:31,148
So if you've downloaded an app onto
your phone that measured noise,

139
00:07:31,148 --> 00:07:33,858
that's actually a direct reading
instrument that tells you what the noise

140
00:07:33,858 --> 00:07:35,900
level is around your person.

141
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,378
We have similar types of instruments for
radiation and vibration and

142
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:42,098
other physical hazards.

143
00:07:42,098 --> 00:07:44,548
Here's an example of area exposures.

144
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:48,648
So on the left, we're looking at a map
of noise levels in New York City.

145
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:52,668
Now, you may recognize there's some
stripes of very high noise levels

146
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:54,216
throughout the city here.

147
00:07:54,216 --> 00:07:58,799
Those represent the flight paths of planes
taking off from Newark and LaGuardia and

148
00:07:58,799 --> 00:07:59,658
JFK airports.

149
00:07:59,658 --> 00:08:01,848
So here's a way where we can say well,

150
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:04,918
if you live in a particular neighborhood,
this is probably how much

151
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,248
noise you're exposed to based
on some area measurements.

152
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:11,068
The map on the right is a map
of monitoring stations for

153
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:14,008
benzene in parts of Canada.

154
00:08:14,008 --> 00:08:15,958
So again,
if you live near one of these stations,

155
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,238
we're not going to know exactly
what your personal exposure is,

156
00:08:18,238 --> 00:08:23,798
but we can make some estimates based
on your nearest monitoring station.

157
00:08:23,798 --> 00:08:26,848
So to tie this all together,
why is exposure assessment so important?

158
00:08:26,848 --> 00:08:29,388
Well, it's the foundation
of environmental health.

159
00:08:29,388 --> 00:08:31,453
If we don't understand your exposures,

160
00:08:31,453 --> 00:08:34,997
we can't possibly connect your health
to the environment around you.

161
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:37,027
We can't understand the exposures.

162
00:08:37,027 --> 00:08:39,898
More importantly, we can't manage or
regulate hazards and

163
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:43,628
risks around you to make sure that you're
safe and that the public is healthy.

164
00:08:43,628 --> 00:08:47,759
And I would submit that if we do exposure
assessment wrong, we're going to end up

165
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,140
with the wrong exposure response, or dose
response curve, and that's going to make

166
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:56,998
us think that perhaps a chemical that's
quite bad for us isn't bad for us at all.

167
00:08:56,998 --> 00:09:00,338
So bad exposure assessment can
lead to incorrect conclusions.

168
00:09:00,338 --> 00:09:04,347
In fact, you may notice in the popular
press one day a study might come

169
00:09:04,347 --> 00:09:07,750
out that says this chemical
causes cancer in lab animals.

170
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:12,113
And the very next day another study comes
out that says this chemical is not bad for

171
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:13,138
humans.

172
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:14,638
What's the real story here?

173
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:18,625
Well, I would argue that we know a lot
more about the exposures those lab animals

174
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:22,913
had because we're actually administering
them to the animals under very controlled

175
00:09:22,913 --> 00:09:23,647
conditions.

176
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:28,224
And we have a lot more poor understanding
of exposures to people living in

177
00:09:28,224 --> 00:09:30,567
the real world.
