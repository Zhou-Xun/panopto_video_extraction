1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,770
In public health we do all
kinds of communications.

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:09,160
We do scientific communications to our
fellow scientist, we also do scientific

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:14,680
communications to the public, or to policy
makers who need to understand science.

4
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,540
We also do advocacy communications.

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,030
Situations where we want
people to be doing something,

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,638
maybe it's a grant proposal we want
the funding agency to give us money.

7
00:00:24,638 --> 00:00:29,240
Or we wanna reach out to the public
with a public service announcement and

8
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,730
convince them to take a particular action.

9
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:35,530
Or maybe it's the policy makers and
we want to give them a brief so

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,190
that they understand
the importance of a policy issue.

11
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,800
Then, of course,
there's also educational communications,

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,800
situations where we want you to understand
something you don't understand right now.

13
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,820
And there's always the interpersonal
communications with your team,

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:58,830
with your boss, with the people you
have to work with on a daily basis.

15
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,682
Each one of those
communications is different.

16
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:04,729
They have different audiences,
they have different goals,

17
00:01:04,729 --> 00:01:08,710
they often have different
modes of communication.

18
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,290
But at the core,
they're all the same, why?

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,270
Because in each one of those situations,
we have one point to make.

20
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:22,480
We want our communications to
change something in the world.

21
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,070
We want them to change somebody's beliefs,

22
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:28,980
somebody's knowledge,
maybe even their behavior.

23
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:35,980
This class is about making
you better at that task.

24
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:40,819
What we're gonna is we're gonna work
on making you better at using your

25
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:45,512
words to change the world in whatever
way you wanna change the world.

26
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:49,476
That's what the goal of this class is,
I hope you'll join me.
