1
00:00:05,981 --> 00:00:08,334
Our bodies are amazing.

2
00:00:08,334 --> 00:00:14,230
They can run and jump,
think, feel, eat, and sleep.

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,190
But to do all of this requires the
delivery of nutrients throughout our body

4
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,250
to let us do those actions.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:24,310
But also to dispose off waste,
repair damage tissues, and

6
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:27,040
replace old cells with new.

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,805
Within our body,
our cells work very hard and

8
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:34,410
amazingly intricate systems to
achieve these types of outcomes.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,080
We often think about our
overall body function or

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,880
maybe our system level function.

11
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,701
How well does our cardiovascular system
work or muscular skeletal system,

12
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:48,159
but we often overlook the cells
themselves have specific functions.

13
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:52,574
In this module, we're gonna review
the cellular functions that

14
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:56,990
are common to all cells including
transportation, ingestion,

15
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,499
secretion, respiration,
communication, and reproduction.

16
00:01:01,499 --> 00:01:05,979
Some cells have more specialized functions
such as waste removal, movement, and

17
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:07,090
conduction.

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,200
But we're not going to focus on all of
the variety of specialized functions but

19
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,520
just understand and know that other
cells can do more specialized things.

20
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,005
Our cells are protected
by the plasma membrane.

21
00:01:19,005 --> 00:01:22,291
And we've learned that the plasma
membrane is a gatekeeper for

22
00:01:22,291 --> 00:01:25,830
the cell against the outside environment.

23
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,320
Our cells have the ability
to move substances in and

24
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:32,200
out of that plasma membrane as needed.

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,594
And as those substances are moved in and
out of a cell,

26
00:01:35,594 --> 00:01:40,055
that process is known as something
called cellular transportation.

27
00:01:40,055 --> 00:01:43,608
So much like transportation
is the movement of people or

28
00:01:43,608 --> 00:01:48,146
goods across highways or sidewalks,
the movement of substances in and

29
00:01:48,146 --> 00:01:51,259
out of the cell is also
known as transportation.

30
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:56,222
Cellular transportation can
either be passive or active.

31
00:01:56,222 --> 00:02:01,956
Passive transportation occurs without
any energy requirement by the cell,

32
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:05,406
and it includes processes
such as diffusion.

33
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:11,180
Diffusion is where molecules move
automatically across the plasma membrane.

34
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:15,293
It might occur because of the movement
of molecules from an area of high

35
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:16,349
concentration.

36
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:21,071
So where there's a lot of that type of
molecule to an area of low concentration,

37
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:24,180
where there's not as much
of that type of molecule.

38
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,187
Another way that diffusion might work,

39
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:29,266
is as molecules move across
an electro-chemical gradient.

40
00:02:29,266 --> 00:02:34,900
So from something that's positively
charged to negatively charged for example.

41
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:39,440
Osmosis is a specialized type of
diffusion where water can move passively

42
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,760
across membranes.

43
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,750
Passive transport also includes
facilitated diffusion.

44
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:51,140
So facilitated diffusion is a special
type of passive transportation

45
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,630
because it requires
a transport protein for

46
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:56,770
the movement of those
molecules across membranes.

47
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,000
Either because of their shape or
their configuration,

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,202
those molecules can't move directly
themselves across the membrane.

49
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:07,217
And so
they require this transport protein or

50
00:03:07,217 --> 00:03:13,670
this partner to help them get in and
out of the cell.

51
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,890
Unlike passive transportation,

52
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:22,430
active transport requires energy by the
cell in the form of something called ATP.

53
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,520
And that ATP is used to
provide the energy or

54
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,780
the kick start needed to move
molecules across a membrane.

55
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:34,800
Active transport is required when
molecules are being moved against

56
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,910
a concentration or
an electro-chemical gradient.

57
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,990
And so it's something that's not natural
for those molecules to want to do.

58
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:47,670
But for reasons related to the cellular
function we do actually need to go across

59
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,207
that gradient, and we are able to do so
with the additional influx of energy.

60
00:03:53,207 --> 00:03:56,926
Another key cellular function
is something called ingestion.

61
00:03:56,926 --> 00:03:59,223
And we've heard the word ingestion,

62
00:03:59,223 --> 00:04:02,522
we ingest food all of the time and
things like that, but

63
00:04:02,522 --> 00:04:07,910
cellular ingestion is when we pull in
large substances into the cell themselves.

64
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,525
So we're not talking about
smaller molecules that

65
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:13,627
happen with cellular transportation,
but these are larger

66
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:17,791
molecules that come into the cell through
a specific process called ingestion.

67
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,990
Where the cell really engulfs
that molecule and pulls it in.

68
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:26,952
A specific type of ingestion that we like
to talk about related to health is calls

69
00:04:26,952 --> 00:04:27,998
phagocytosis.

70
00:04:27,998 --> 00:04:31,573
And this occurs when these large
particles are ingested and

71
00:04:31,573 --> 00:04:35,870
the cell releases something
called free oxygen radicals.

72
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,280
Free oxygen radicals
are important to our health and

73
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,200
function because they may induce an
inflammatory response that can either be

74
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,020
beneficial to destroying whatever
that pathogen might be, but

75
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,225
they might also be detrimental because
that inflammation can cause tissue damage.

76
00:04:51,225 --> 00:04:56,128
But cellular ingestion is an important
function of cells as they work to engulf

77
00:04:56,128 --> 00:05:00,826
and destroy the cellular waste or
other damaged parts of cell components.

78
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:05,367
But it's also really important related to
our health and well-being because cellular

79
00:05:05,367 --> 00:05:10,380
ingestion is the way that we engulf
micro-organism invaders, such as bacteria.

80
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,230
We can also ingest particles
like environmental pollutants or

81
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,507
larger particles that might come in and
make one ill.

82
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:22,314
So ingestion is really a critical way in
which our cells work on our behalf to work

83
00:05:22,314 --> 00:05:26,940
to keep us healthy through some of
the things that we can't even see.

84
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:31,220
And they do this through the initiation
of immune responses and inflammatory

85
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:38,000
responses to destroy those pathogens or
other particles that might make us ill.

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,570
One of the main functions of our cells is
to produce cellular products based upon

87
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,830
the genetic code inside of
the nucleus of the cell.

88
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,400
So, we've learned that the nucleus is
really that control center of the cell,

89
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,890
it houses all of our DNA, and

90
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:57,320
that DNA is the code that can translate
into what our cell needs to make.

91
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,878
And so these products then are made by the
cell, but to be effective for our body,

92
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:04,170
they must actually move out of the cell.

93
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,705
And so a big role that the cell has is
figuring out how to get that cellular

94
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:13,270
product out of the cell, and
this process is called secretion.

95
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,543
And so we talked about an example where
beta cells of the pancreas can produce

96
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:22,104
something called insulin that is helpful
for getting glucose moved into cells.

97
00:06:22,104 --> 00:06:26,677
And to make that insulin within the cell,
it needs to be moved out of the cell to be

98
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:32,010
used by our body, and that is done
through a process called secretion.

99
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:36,742
Cellular respiration includes all of
the metabolic processes that a cell

100
00:06:36,742 --> 00:06:41,488
undergoes to convert nutrients that
we take in from our diet into energy.

101
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,947
We can't just use that sandwich
that we ate automatically for

102
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:46,552
lunch in the form of energy.

103
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:51,549
So our body converts those nutrients
in that sandwich into the energy that

104
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:55,916
we need, and that energy is in
the form of something called ATP.

105
00:06:55,916 --> 00:07:00,728
We also have the ability of our cells
to dispose of cellular waste products,

106
00:07:00,728 --> 00:07:04,937
including things like carbon dioxide,
and water, and heat, and

107
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:07,663
this is all done by cellular respiration.

108
00:07:07,663 --> 00:07:10,360
Cellular respiration can
be one of two forms.

109
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,550
It can either be anaerobic,
meaning without oxygen.

110
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,420
So oxygen is not needed for

111
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:20,120
anaerobic cellular respiration,
or aerobic meaning with oxygen.

112
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,511
So for cellular aerobic respiration,
oxygen is needed.

113
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:29,108
The anaerobic cellular respiration
process is called glycolysis.

114
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:32,512
And glycolysis is when
our body is able to break

115
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:36,570
down glucose in the form
of two ATP molecules.

116
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,536
It doesn't sound like a whole lot, and

117
00:07:38,536 --> 00:07:43,320
glycolysis actually is quite insufficient
to support the energy needs of our body.

118
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,220
And so really the ability of our body to
undergo aerobic respiration processes

119
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:53,190
are really critical to being able to
utilize our nutrients effectively.

120
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,057
So through something called
the citric acid cycle,

121
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:58,021
it's also called the Krebs cycle.

122
00:07:58,021 --> 00:08:03,375
Our body is able to undergo cellular
respiration through aerobic mechanisms and

123
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:07,626
we're able to produce an additional
34 ATP molecules through

124
00:08:07,626 --> 00:08:09,530
this aerobic respiration.

125
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:14,427
And so you can see here that aerobic
respiration is a much more efficient means

126
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,774
of creating energy within the cell.

127
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:21,156
Cell-to-cell communication is critical for
our health and function.

128
00:08:21,156 --> 00:08:25,233
You can imagine that if our body
undergoes an insult of an injury,

129
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:30,202
or an invader of a micro organism, those
cells that are really close to that area

130
00:08:30,202 --> 00:08:35,097
of invasion or injury want to be able to
scream really loud and tell ourselves,

131
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,900
hey, we have this invader.

132
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:41,490
We need to act and mount an attack,
or heal that wound.

133
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,572
And so
cellular communication is the function of

134
00:08:44,572 --> 00:08:48,942
cells that enable that communication
between cells to do just that.

135
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:53,475
Cellular communication relies on
a couple of functions of the cell.

136
00:08:53,475 --> 00:08:57,715
One is to use things on
cells called ligands.

137
00:08:57,715 --> 00:09:00,426
And ligands are these
signaling molecules and

138
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:05,140
they're able to bind to something on
another cell called the receptor.

139
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,967
And so when a ligand binds to a receptor,

140
00:09:07,967 --> 00:09:11,800
it's able to then send that
message from cell to cell.

141
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:15,925
And so really to be able to
enable cellular communication,

142
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:20,719
we need to look at this relationship
between ligands and receptors.

143
00:09:20,719 --> 00:09:25,611
Of course, you can imagine if you've
ever been a child playing the telephone

144
00:09:25,611 --> 00:09:29,760
game with two of these soda cans or
tin cans with a tube in between.

145
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,140
The longer that tube is makes it
more difficult to hear that message.

146
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:38,995
And so really, we want ligands bound
to receptors very tightly to be able to

147
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,905
most effectively transmit that message.

148
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:43,837
And how tightly those ligands and

149
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:47,427
receptors are bound is called
the binding affinity of those.

150
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:52,474
And so we want a high binding
affinity because that allows our cell

151
00:09:52,474 --> 00:09:57,630
to cell communication to be more
efficient in its communication.

152
00:09:57,630 --> 00:10:01,607
The final function about cells that
we'll talk about is reproduction.

153
00:10:01,607 --> 00:10:06,038
Cellular reproduction is so
important because not only does cellular

154
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,545
reproduction help with growth and
development and repair of tissues,

155
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:15,650
but also with the replacement of old
tissues or old cells with new cells.

156
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,540
And there's a really fun statistic
that I've heard about bone for

157
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,480
example that I'd like to share.

158
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,800
So bone is always undergoing remodeling,
which is just that,

159
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,700
the replacement of old bone
cells with new bone cells.

160
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,925
And then it's estimated
that over your life,

161
00:10:29,925 --> 00:10:33,983
every 20 years you replace
your skeleton with a new one.

162
00:10:33,983 --> 00:10:38,124
And so this is this process
of our cells replacing

163
00:10:38,124 --> 00:10:43,150
themselves with new cells
that are more fresh.

164
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:46,894
So with respect to reproduction, we're
not gonna go into all the details related

165
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:50,258
to cellular reproduction, but
there's two words I'd like to highlight

166
00:10:50,258 --> 00:10:53,479
that are really important when we're
looking at our overall health.

167
00:10:53,479 --> 00:10:55,796
One is proliferation.

168
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:59,920
Cellular proliferation is
an increase in the number of cells.

169
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,963
And we sometimes think of
proliferation as kind of

170
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:07,754
a scary word because we associate it
with cancer, with tumor proliferation.

171
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:09,938
But just to determine
the word specifically,

172
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:12,403
it's just about an increase
in the number of cells.

173
00:11:12,403 --> 00:11:16,908
And so while we clearly don't want an
increase in cancerous cells throughout our

174
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:20,962
body, there are times when we do want
an increase in the number of cells.

175
00:11:20,962 --> 00:11:26,018
And the increase in the number of cells
allows our body to grow and develop but

176
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:30,837
also to increase our capacity in certain
ways that might be important for

177
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:32,577
our overall physiology.

178
00:11:32,577 --> 00:11:35,455
Another word I'd like to
highlight is differentiation.

179
00:11:35,455 --> 00:11:40,015
And so, differentiation is when one
cell type is able to conform and

180
00:11:40,015 --> 00:11:44,578
change in a way that makes it into
a different or specific cell type.

181
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:49,096
And that differentiation of cell
then helps with that cell undergoing

182
00:11:49,096 --> 00:11:53,420
changes that make it able to
perform a specific function.

183
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:58,030
And so differentiation is the way in which
certain cells might become cardiac cells,

184
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,850
or skeletal cells, or nervous cells, and

185
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:04,630
each of those cell types then
have a very specific function.

186
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,517
And so
when we look at cellular reproduction,

187
00:12:07,517 --> 00:12:11,366
cells can either proliferate,
they can differentiate, and

188
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:16,472
by those processes that they undergo, is
the way that our body is able to reproduce

189
00:12:16,472 --> 00:12:20,987
at the cellular level and that
reproduction then helps with our growth,

190
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:25,004
our development, and
our management of new and healthy cells.

191
00:12:25,004 --> 00:12:27,962
So in this session,
we've talked about the functions of cells.

192
00:12:27,962 --> 00:12:32,409
The ways in which our cells can
undergo different functional

193
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:34,763
processes to help keep us safe,

194
00:12:34,763 --> 00:12:40,170
they keep invaders out of our body
through processes like phagocytosis,

195
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:45,575
or they might call up other helper cells
to be able to attack that invader,

196
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:49,707
and they can also help with our growth and
development.

197
00:12:49,707 --> 00:12:54,885
And so there's a lot of things that our
cells do at the cellular level, which then

198
00:12:54,885 --> 00:13:00,445
understanding how those functions scale up
to be really important to our physiology,

199
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:06,152
is important in understanding when
things can go wrong with our physiology.
