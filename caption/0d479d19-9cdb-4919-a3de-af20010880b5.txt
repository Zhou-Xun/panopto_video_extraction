1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:06,140
Recording here for. Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:10,100
Happy Friday. How how's everybody doing this week?

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,660
Things going on. So few. Still a few people.

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:19,220
The Greece. The conference in Greece is still going on right now or something.

5
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:25,879
Okay. Oh, yeah. So. So people are. Yeah. Because I've had a few people told me they were going and now they're back.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:30,350
So. Who went across them or how many of you?

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:35,709
Yeah. How was it? Oh, I didn't know the way.

8
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,020
I mean, different person, but it's been fun. Okay.

9
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:43,490
But, yeah. Was it. Did you get to do anything same?

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:50,690
No. No. And then I was just the I just.

11
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:54,650
I was nice.

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,780
All right. Well, welcome back. So for today's class, this is pretty laid back.

13
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:12,080
I mean, it's always a fairly laid back class. But today I just want to I've dedicated the class time to practicing elevator pitches.

14
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:23,390
And so today's class, we will do the elevator pitch activity with we'll get in some groups and work with our peers on that.

15
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,760
And then if we have some time at the end, we can discuss another case study or two.

16
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:46,730
Regarding group. I'm sorry. If we have some time, we can discuss another case study or two with regard to scientific communication.

17
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:55,790
So for the elevator pitch, how this is going to work is we'll break into small groups and I'll have you count off numbers in a minute.

18
00:01:56,180 --> 00:02:02,719
Or, you know, it might be easier just to if people want to sell form groups meeting, that's a little bit easier.

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:11,810
So you don't have to like get up and all move around the room and then what you'll do is each person will take a turn to present to you.

20
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:19,610
I'll give you an elevator pitch to the people in your group, and then the listeners should fill out the form after each presentation.

21
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:28,010
And I have the form and I'll show you that in just a moment, and it's also on canvas and then share your feedback.

22
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:37,270
So any or all of you who evaluate the speaker, if you want to share a few critiques and some rationale behind those,

23
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,530
would be some areas that you thought went really well.

24
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:46,800
Maybe some areas they could work on, and then we'll repeat it or repeat it a couple of times just to see if you want.

25
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:50,390
You can try and improve on it a little bit based on the feedback from your peers.

26
00:02:52,040 --> 00:03:00,530
And and then again, if we have some time at the end of class, we'll have some discussion around some other scientific communication topics.

27
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:07,459
I should have had to move that later. I thought they had.

28
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:11,330
Oh, okay. I thought I had the rubric in here, but I guess not.

29
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,850
So let me bring that up really quickly.

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:26,600
So, you know, this is meant to be a really, really a brief and informal description of your research or career interests.

31
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:34,910
And you if you Google, you know, elevator pitch, you'll see that they call it a presentation or a speech.

32
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:42,110
And it really I think that makes it seem very like it should be very rehearsed and almost

33
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,270
some of them even come across as a little bit fake when if you look at some of the videos,

34
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,660
just the way they are very, very rehearsed in a lot of cases,

35
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:58,520
it's because they're giving the presentation as part of a competition or something for, you know, a scientific communication thing.

36
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:08,480
And that's all fine. But I think the I just want to take today as an opportunity to get you to practice communicating in an informal setting,

37
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:12,140
talking about your science, talking about your career interests.

38
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,540
This is something, again, that you'll do a million times throughout the course of your career.

39
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:25,189
And the more you can home, the more comfortable you can get speaking in every type of situation and the more comfortable you can get.

40
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:29,960
Talking about your research and why it's important in or your or your career interest, your practice,

41
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,990
whatever practice applied practice you're working on, then I think that that's going to be really beneficial.

42
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:42,290
So I put together a rubric just to give us a little bit of structure for today.

43
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,860
The themes typically include an introduction, of course.

44
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,420
Describe your area of study or applied practice or research.

45
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:58,610
Talk about the problem. What is the gap in knowledge that you're trying to fill?

46
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,920
Why does it matter? Why should we care about it? Why is your research impactful?

47
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:09,680
And then talk about the benefits of fixing the problem? How the results of the study can benefit human health.

48
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:16,050
Does anybody have any questions? I don't know how many. If you've had a chance to look at this.

49
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,290
I know I got it up late and I apologize. Everything with me is last minute.

50
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,540
So if you've had a chance to look at it, does anybody have any questions or comments about it?

51
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:40,240
Yeah. Questions. So looking at the review, the first one says avoiding the use of killing in how are we doing this assignment at least?

52
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:48,100
Are we assuming that we're speaking with other people in our field and how basic needs to be simplified?

53
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:57,220
Yeah, that's a really good question. And I think if you want when you go to give your presentation or your or your pitch, you can say,

54
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:04,990
I'm assuming that you are all people in my field or I'm assuming your people at my Thanksgiving dinner table or whatever.

55
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:13,750
I think that that's fine because I do think that you will tailor this a little bit depending on who you're talking to.

56
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,620
So, yeah, that's a really good point. Any other questions?

57
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:29,960
Yeah. So I wrote one down just to briefly give you an example of what?

58
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:37,940
Have you had any. How many of you have had to give one of these at a or and describing some sort of situation?

59
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:47,830
So a few people. So, yeah, if I'm running into somebody at a conference, I might say, you know, hello, my name is Lori Swoboda.

60
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,690
I'm a faculty member in the School of Public Health.

61
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:57,530
And my research is focused on understanding how developmental chemical exposures affect heart health.

62
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,500
And that can and I'm interested in how those chemicals affect health across the life course.

63
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,690
So in early childhood, how does that change in adulthood and what about old age?

64
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:17,600
And we know that chemicals such as lead, phthalates, arsenic and other types of chemicals are associated with cardiovascular diseases.

65
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:25,580
That a molecular level we really don't understand how that why that is and how that differs between males and females.

66
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:32,060
And so my work is focused on understanding how these chemicals cause disease through modification of the epigenome.

67
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:39,080
And you can think of the epigenome as sort of the software on a computer where the software you have the hardware,

68
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:44,090
which is your genetic sequence, the sequence of your DNA, and then you have the software on top of that.

69
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:53,090
And epigenome literally means on top of the DNA, and the software tells the genes how high to be express,

70
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,530
when to be expressed, you know, so high, low on, off.

71
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:04,549
And so I want to understand how these chemicals affect the epigenome with an aim of understanding,

72
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:09,770
getting a better understanding of how these chemicals cause disease so that we can develop better therapies,

73
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:17,660
as well as by looking at how the chemicals, at what stages of life people are most sensitive to these chemicals.

74
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:25,220
We can better design policy policies to address mitigating some of these exposures.

75
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:35,840
So you can see, you know, I stumble when I when I talk about this too, and you almost kind of do a little bit, you know, unless you've rehearsed it.

76
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,780
And then if you rehearse, it may sound a little bit too rehearsed.

77
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:48,320
So again, it's it's not something to, you know, overthinking get stressed out about, but it's just learning how to, you know, communicate.

78
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:54,220
Your ideas to people. So I'll go ahead and have everybody.

79
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:00,370
If you want to do groups of three or four and I'll have everybody just kind of self-assemble

80
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:05,140
into groups and unfortunately this room is not really conducive to sitting like,

81
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:09,610
you know, in a group because of these tables, but just do the best you can.

82
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:21,130
And does anybody have any questions or need any and everybody has the the rubric can download it on Hulu.

83
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:26,800
So all they're having is yeah. Regarding the actually is there a place you want us to fill it out or just.

84
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,190
Mm hmm. Yeah. That was the only thing. Yeah.

85
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,940
I didn't leave lines for it, did I? Yeah. Sorry about that.

86
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,610
I think if you just want to like, you know,

87
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:42,400
go into these boxes and type or write handwrite notes or however you want to do it, it doesn't need to be turned in.

88
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:45,969
Oh, so yeah, there's no yeah, no it doesn't need to be turned in.

89
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:49,510
It's just, just for your own notes so that you can help each other out.

90
00:09:49,510 --> 00:10:07,600
Okay, cool. Yeah. Yep. Yeah, but they really do.

91
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:19,450
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

92
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:37,100
Sorry. I did it because I guess you don't have to wear this stuff.

93
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,640
I'm just going to go for, like.

94
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,620
Sounds good.

95
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,950
Yeah. Okay. I would like to provide an album.

96
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:19,510
I have a lot of time to look for more opportunities.

97
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:24,490
You know, like I said, you know?

98
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:53,210
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. I mean, that's, you know, that's not the appeal of a lot of, needless to say, something that came out of that.

99
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:11,650
However, you know, they want to give it back, you know, so maybe just by using it for you to understand, you know,

100
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:33,770
for people who've been studying combined, all of us wanted to get started on that, but they really had other ideas about it.

101
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,900
So yeah, I think some of that stuff influencing.

102
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:48,510
We're all kind of balancing our monthly budget to.

103
00:12:51,400 --> 00:13:10,960
I think we need more than half a year long delay.

104
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:37,100
And I don't think I could tell you that there's a group of prisoners.

105
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:43,220
Right. Yes.

106
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:57,910
Well, I think you guys just give me. I feel like you're one of the things you think about as.

107
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:09,310
Safe to say that I.

108
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,860
No, I don't think you have to say that.

109
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:29,180
Well, I like I said. Yeah, but they're not telling us that.

110
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:36,810
I have never been more adventurous about.

111
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,430
Not. It's.

112
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,300
So I kind of. I don't back my.

113
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:08,170
So I was trying to learn how to a good.

114
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:13,090
For that matter.

115
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:20,690
Your mother didn't try to make any this.

116
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:28,460
It's kind of like your own house. So I think I.

117
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:45,690
We're not going to make. Yeah, exactly right.

118
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:54,510
Yeah, definitely. You know, there are definitely not a lot of.

119
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:04,470
All of those through the.

120
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:15,730
I heard you like. Yes. I mean, I.

121
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:34,719
I want to show you one more example of the president having a little fun around 19 eight because he was not doing anything.

122
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:49,870
That I think is that there was a lot of to let you know, especially after nine over 11.

123
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:58,620
Later on. I have found that I.

124
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:13,630
If you want to find something like this.

125
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:17,100
I was like, oh, sorry.

126
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:30,120
Yahoo! Has a little. And I think you're also whole thing.

127
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:39,030
I feel like I know you're not going to go out all right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

128
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:52,670
I just don't think they're going to like that.

129
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,690
I think it's really.

130
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:07,900
I'm your father. I want you to learn everything from.

131
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:12,930
You're perfect. Yeah. Yeah.

132
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:37,600
I'm going to have to explain what you look like in terms of like it's going to be like one of those if I get hold of it.

133
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,560
If it's. I don't know. Yes. Like, I think that's a good way. Yeah.

134
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:54,350
Because I think that when I started to be like, oh, what am I doing?

135
00:18:54,560 --> 00:19:13,220
Nothing like that. I'm not going to talk about people, what I want to do, because that is what I think going to do.

136
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:23,630
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think I think, you know, I.

137
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:43,410
So I guess you could say the whole thing is going to drain his blood vampire.

138
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:58,890
I got it done because I had. Right now, and I.

139
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:13,930
I can assure you that I will protect your employees.

140
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:29,620
Everything had to be connected to the Clintons are different.

141
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:36,930
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

142
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,670
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

143
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,520
I know some people.

144
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:58,150
And I still enjoy my salary as an employee in a partnership that was created with one.

145
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,160
He was a very, very, very nice person.

146
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,330
And I know he really was. So you're looking at it.

147
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:30,420
Know, looking at the. The hard way right now is I don't really see it as though exposure is.

148
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,890
You're telling me like that? Yeah.

149
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:45,830
Yeah, exactly. I think you're funny, but by the end of the.

150
00:21:49,440 --> 00:22:00,800
We're not really. That's all.

151
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:22,520
What I have been getting is something that I really had no idea about when I was 28 years old.

152
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:33,419
To read to the research in case don't know how much I had read, I still see them.

153
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:42,960
And when you write this number, I was very surprised in South Carolina like.

154
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:56,000
They can maintain some of the women's.

155
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:08,520
We are looking at this contamination that. How do you know what look like?

156
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,290
And now maybe it's not that bad.

157
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:35,090
I heard. Ahead is that the government still has to express what is in there and they're not as any other.

158
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:54,120
Yeah, well, I think we're starting to see that.

159
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:10,450
I don't know what you mean by that.

160
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:18,180
I'm sorry. I'm not. Crazy.

161
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:29,010
Yeah. Let's see if. I feel embarrassed that I started my.

162
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:42,990
Like I said, I want to give this to you every morning and I want you to write for my daughters.

163
00:24:43,480 --> 00:25:11,260
I have 20,000 copies of the Built by the Crown and they will be able to participate in so much because

164
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:24,910
I am the only person you have to preserve the fundamental difference in the lives of your friends.

165
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:31,110
And that is why I like the way you.

166
00:25:36,690 --> 00:26:01,260
I have a gun. And I really wanted want to believe that is friends.

167
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:09,560
And that's what I do. I know I was never raised with it.

168
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:15,550
Y you know, I have never seen anything like it before.

169
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:27,120
You like that? You know, Jennifer, your family say, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

170
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:36,230
And I have one. I was I was about that he.

171
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:49,630
I said, Yeah, yeah, I like.

172
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,950
Yeah. Scenes.

173
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:01,560
The parents of one of them was arrested last year.

174
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:11,730
Also, I have to say, I think they started I think that is what is right.

175
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:19,910
That is what they and they have. Nathan.

176
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:25,920
Okay, good. Yeah. Thanks for having me.

177
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:35,490
And also, considering the fact that I.

178
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:46,270
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

179
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:50,840
There's a little bit more on that.

180
00:27:51,840 --> 00:28:00,910
Yeah. I don't think there's any there and I think, I think that might be a very good thing.

181
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:20,860
I think, I think it was about how you distinguish between what it is that and I think I think it's important.

182
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:25,360
Yeah. Yeah, I think I, I was like, how do you get that out?

183
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:38,360
You said it was. But it's not something that I don't know.

184
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:52,180
But I think I think the bigger picture I think the other.

185
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:13,030
I know that you are right there.

186
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:22,570
I don't. He said.

187
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:27,290
I was quite right.

188
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,410
I was really hoping.

189
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:57,840
It's probably too small, you know, I think you know, I think that and I think when you said you went to yesterday, I like to know you to get a.

190
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,670
With respect to any restoration to the program.

191
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:13,870
I will say that, like I said, I have a player that I didn't like that this was one to happen.

192
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:27,870
So, yeah, I think it's wonderful that we'll come back as a group in about seven more minutes.

193
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:36,110
Okay. Looks like you guys know you might be one.

194
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,890
I can't think of anything I. I'm ready.

195
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:53,170
Yeah. You could ask me if I the for you at some point.

196
00:30:54,340 --> 00:31:00,540
Or is that the best thing to do?

197
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:07,120
I don't want to talk about.

198
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:12,880
Because I fear that I would never fall for.

199
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,420
I need to know.

200
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:44,620
For many people right now, confidence is the person that I know that I really feel like I can make everything okay.

201
00:31:45,670 --> 00:32:02,590
I love to have a story to tell. And beyond that, is there anything I can do after I read that I don't remember if I feel like how I am.

202
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:08,680
Maybe I should go that far.

203
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:20,880
I want to go on a refresher, but this time I think it's because meets the eye.

204
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:28,420
Yeah. At least I think that will become, I don't know, I guess push her to all the people, you know.

205
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:35,800
Who did you have to me? A show from a.

206
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:56,260
Why do you focus on that? Something that matters? I think in the work that I do and a private company,

207
00:32:56,830 --> 00:33:14,860
I don't think because they have to make way for the fact that they have no reason to be on social media or whatever.

208
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:20,520
I can do that. I know that I'm not required to.

209
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:27,250
Or sometimes. Some of these may not come to me, but I never knew.

210
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,750
I didn't know that. What is the possible? Yeah.

211
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,990
They have to be here in Germany. Over here. So I repeat myself.

212
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:47,610
So fantasizing. My first half, I knew that I will be working.

213
00:33:47,820 --> 00:34:00,940
But now I think because it been beneficial to the actress, I guess I was inspired to do something like that.

214
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:06,660
And I can just tell you, it's like you're in.

215
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:20,090
And. So you have to realize how your plans are going to play out.

216
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:30,630
You now have an impact on your. I'm always in these and I don't feel like this.

217
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:43,590
I don't really know how I feel right now.

218
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

219
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:52,900
And. You like? Yeah.

220
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:57,270
I just want to thank you for everything.

221
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,710
I want to talk about has that respect, that way of thinking.

222
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:16,890
And I also want to say, you know, I don't want to call people as much as they were doing what used to be the case,

223
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,150
because think there's I don't think God is going to think about that.

224
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:30,620
Yeah, maybe there's a couple more minutes and then we'll all join back because it's not like sometimes it's like.

225
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:40,220
So you could use some chemicals or something like that.

226
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:46,590
I mean, I think this is not very good.

227
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:56,760
So you have to move on it instead of just the bottom line.

228
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:02,960
You know, and can at that, you know what you get inside, you know?

229
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:18,220
You know how? Nobody is going to be the number one priority for these places.

230
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:38,860
I think that the reason I sense the reasons behind us and we have to run the place to people to see what they're doing.

231
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:44,650
Because I think that that of.

232
00:36:51,100 --> 00:37:03,040
What are you doing? I know you're not suffering from any regrets about everything that happened.

233
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:13,040
I felt you. You literally just realized that, like my philosophy in life.

234
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,890
I mean, how many people are still working? Does anybody see the consistency?

235
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,000
It sounds like most people are done, like, one day.

236
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:27,730
Okay. Right around here, there's two.

237
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:34,300
So I'll go ahead and give this the few minutes left from from from class.

238
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:39,670
So. Just a couple of questions.

239
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:51,370
How. What aspect of so do any of you find doing these things to be difficult talking and these sorts of talking about your science in a way that is.

240
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:57,130
Yeah. So what what about it? Did you find to be the most difficult part?

241
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:04,560
I think organizing is not really something I forgot.

242
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:11,310
So like I said earlier, for organization and stuff.

243
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:20,610
Yeah. Yeah, you saw it. Like, even because I knew that I was going to kind of give a semi formal.

244
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,270
That's not formal. But I wanted to say something and not stumble and sound like an idiot today.

245
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:28,200
So I wrote some things down because I do the same thing.

246
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:34,750
I will find myself like, Oh, I should have mentioned this to make it clearer what I just said.

247
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:43,170
So jumping around is normal, and the more practice you get doing these things, the easier, the easier it gets.

248
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:51,900
Any. Anybody else? I'm only trying not to look for the, like, trust in yourself to say what you need to say.

249
00:38:51,930 --> 00:39:00,120
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And it's almost like you have to practice saying it out loud and not have the script

250
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:05,040
in front of you because it's almost like it'll lock you in to a certain sequence.

251
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,430
And then if you deviate from that sequence, you get sort of flustered.

252
00:39:08,970 --> 00:39:13,710
So yeah, I think explaining why it matters is actually really hard.

253
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:19,870
This is obviously so important, right? Oh, yeah.

254
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,530
Yeah, I like it. It's great.

255
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,160
So you don't care? Absolutely.

256
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:36,540
Now, we all have these these blind spots for regarding what we know and that everybody else should already have the same background that we do.

257
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:41,310
And also what we like is obviously, this is cool and interesting.

258
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:46,799
And and they talk about these types of. I talk about what I do with my family and my husband.

259
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:54,900
And you can see sometimes their eyes glaze over because I'll just start rambling and nerding out about something I found in the lab or,

260
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,990
you know, or something I've read. And they're just like, okay.

261
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:07,820
Whereas, you know, then they are changing the subject on me and or my husband, who's a patent attorney at a corporation.

262
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:14,009
We [INAUDIBLE] start rambling about a safety issue that the that they're having with their brake pads or something.

263
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:19,560
And we'll start going into legal mumbo jumbo and I'm just like, I don't care.

264
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:22,080
Like, you need to explain to me why this is important.

265
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:28,980
It's like, well, you know, these brakes that they they don't function and people crash and die and, you know, so.

266
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:35,700
So, yeah, I agree that that's another thing that's can be tough for anybody else.

267
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:44,240
We rely so much on lingo and it's so difficult to bring that down to the audience level.

268
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,730
It is it's so easy to talk like how we talk in, like, lab meetings, like you and I.

269
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,660
Yeah. Make no sense, you know, but.

270
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:58,140
But having to, like, break that down, like, three levels and being able to do, like, tell people exactly what you mean.

271
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:03,510
Yeah. Or I don't know how to. It's hard to explain differentiation to people.

272
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:07,830
Right. Right. Yeah. Yeah.

273
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:09,950
Any other any other things.

274
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,240
Also, just having this kind of scheduled activity creates this kind of rigorous structure around giving a casual talk about what you do.

275
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,740
Mm hmm. And so we're not able to just put it out there.

276
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,840
I can have a casual, serendipitous talk about what I do.

277
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,320
Yeah. Would be more free flowing without any pressure.

278
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:30,620
Right. Yeah. I realize even.

279
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:37,760
Even like this, the situation where you're in groups with your peers is still a little bit awkward because you're like, oh, I have to.

280
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:43,909
You know, you have it's like as an assignment rather than just sort of a natural organic interaction.

281
00:41:43,910 --> 00:41:51,410
But it does at least in my in my experience, like it, it does help me to force myself to go through it.

282
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:58,549
And even if in this situation, it feels kind of awkward when you get an outside of here and you have to talk about your

283
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:04,820
science in a job interview or with a potential collaborator at a conference or with some,

284
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:10,680
you know, some person that you really admire. And you're kind of you kind of feel a little bit intimidated by them.

285
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,920
Then hopefully, having gone through this in practice, a little bit will help you in that situation.

286
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:19,250
But I agree is it's a little bit awkward for sure.

287
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:26,600
Anybody else have any other comments? I think going into enough detail, but not going into too much detail.

288
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:34,010
One tiny aspect of the research, because I love the site talking so much about like one little thing.

289
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,990
Yeah. And then the rest of it is kind of like. Yeah.

290
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:40,379
Yeah. And that's true.

291
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:47,580
Whether it's this type of situation where you're just in an interaction with a couple of friends or peers or you're at a conference,

292
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:51,900
or if you're giving a a more formal scientific presentation,

293
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:56,040
you kind of you have to you'll get a feel for, you know,

294
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,689
what cards you can kind of hold your chest a little bit versus how much you how

295
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,040
much detail you need to give to people for them to understand your message.

296
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:10,900
And so so yeah, that's an ongoing struggle that even, you know,

297
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:16,140
the most seasoned scientists will deal with when they're putting together presentations.

298
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:23,850
Um, and so throughout your career, you will be talking to your peers, whoever they are, to get their feedback on a,

299
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:29,940
on a presentation or write up or something that you're doing because that never really goes away.

300
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:38,580
So yeah. And the other. Well, did anybody find any any part of it to be easy?

301
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:45,540
Tomoko shaking her head. No, we're not.

302
00:43:45,570 --> 00:43:53,460
Yeah. I think some things that make it easier are thinking about what you want to say in terms of a set of checks.

303
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,200
So, like, what's my main focus?

304
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:03,810
Like of my work or of my lab's work? Why would it matter to the person in front of me?

305
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:07,980
And what's one take away? Mm hmm.

306
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:14,940
And, like, if I answer those three questions in my head while I'm talking, then I've said enough to get somebody to remember what I'm working on.

307
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,729
Yeah. So I try to think of it more as, like an outline than memorizing something,

308
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:27,290
because it's really hard to be malleable when you have a text that you've memorized.

309
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:32,570
Like there's a lot of times where I talk about my work and I don't mention epigenetics at all.

310
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:39,930
And I had the pleasant interaction actually yesterday of somebody saying somebody who's a CS like environmental policy person saying,

311
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,510
Oh, so you have two genetics. Mm hmm.

312
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:49,690
And it was amazing because it meant that, like, that person got to surprise me with their knowledge, and it was more about, like, the ideas.

313
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:54,690
So I think what always keeps it easier for me is like focusing on ideas, even in a technical setting,

314
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:01,660
like making sure that it's because if people want to know more about the technical stuff, they will ask them to ask you that.

315
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,360
And so, yeah, I feel like, like the checkmarks.

316
00:45:08,370 --> 00:45:17,280
And then the second thing is watching the other person's body language, because as soon as the glaze over starts, you got to either cut it.

317
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:20,549
Yeah. Or, of course. Correct. Pretty quick. So.

318
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:25,830
Yeah, yeah. I kind of I don't know. I feel like that's been a nice, like, learning experience.

319
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:29,970
And I just had a had a very, a lot of opportunities at the conference I was at.

320
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:36,510
So yeah, I'll be a bit more refined. I mean, one time talking with one person, I even said, actually, wait, let me start over.

321
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:39,540
I have a good mix and you're not getting it right now.

322
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:43,830
And so I did. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, that's okay.

323
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:50,280
And I think that kind of honesty is like refreshing and people appreciate that,

324
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,430
you know, that you're that you're real and you're not rehearsed and fake.

325
00:45:53,550 --> 00:46:00,000
So and I love the idea of just having some bullet points in your head and kind of kind of hitting those.

326
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:06,240
And, you know, and it's nobody is going like you said, if somebody wants to know more, they're going to ask you.

327
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:15,360
And sometimes it is better to just maybe like hold some things back and just, you know, give a little a couple of little tidbits and see if they,

328
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:19,500
you know, want to ask you some questions and then you can kind of talk in a little more detail.

329
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:25,250
So, yeah. Anybody else have some tips that work particularly well for them?

330
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:35,170
Cool. All right. Well, what kind of upcoming events do people have?

331
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:43,090
Anybody have something coming up where they can where they'll get to talk about their science with people and maybe some team?

332
00:46:43,330 --> 00:46:46,390
Yeah. Abstracts. Yes.

333
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:54,580
I should be the one up here like advocating for that because. Yeah, we just had a meeting where we're like, oh yeah, we have like this for posters.

334
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:58,540
Oh, really? I mean, everybody submits at the last minute. This is what always happens.

335
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:09,100
But yeah, that's a fun, informal setting to talk about science if you are a toxicology person or environmental health, and it's really good food.

336
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:17,420
So like, if you just want to come here, get some good food and listen to a few talks and, you know, I mean, I'll just admit that right now,

337
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:23,620
but not only is it an excellent networking and science opportunity, but yeah,

338
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:31,090
it's just it's I'm happy to be that we are back to having in-person meetings, so I'm really excited about it.

339
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:35,680
Yeah, that's coming up in a couple of weeks. Yeah.

340
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,089
No class that day. And you're the are you the president? I am the president elect.

341
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:43,690
Oh. So next year, I'll be a full blown president.

342
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:51,700
Yeah. So I'll be tag teaming the introductions and all of that with the current president through.

343
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,910
Yeah. Yeah. All right.

344
00:47:55,150 --> 00:48:02,559
Well, we are at 1250, so have a wonderful rest of the day and a great weekend.

345
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:09,400
And I will see you all next week. And a few people next week are lightning topics and we have a few people signed up, so.

346
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:15,010
Yeah. All right. So.

347
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:38,010
It was nice to actually kind of do that, you know?

348
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:51,140
Yeah. I think I'm going to have to do it.

349
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:08,270
Yeah. I mean, I was like, I don't know that faster or anything like that.

350
00:49:08,670 --> 00:49:14,850
I think it's not.

351
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:37,610
Days later. Thank you. You're back here. Why do you want to go into the dark like that?

352
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,810
I know that you have a lot of to do.

353
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:53,730
Yeah. Sizable, but I think what I was like.
