00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,120
Hi, everyone. My name is Minal Patel and I'm a faculty member at the University of Michigan School of Public Health and the Department of Health,

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,200
Behavior and Health Education. I teach a course in public health on racial and ethnic disparities in health care.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:23,550
My research program is primarily situated in health care delivery, so this topic is really near and dear to my heart.

4
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:28,620
Reducing racial and ethnic health disparities is really core to the mission of public health.

5
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,830
The health care delivery system contributes to these disparities and really unique and complex ways.

6
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:40,260
The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically unveiled that racial and ethnic health care disparities

7
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:46,680
continue to thrive, and we have really not done enough to change this system towards equity.

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:53,400
I'd like to give you a snapshot of this field, including some key drivers of disparities. In the first segment,

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,150
I will talk broadly about the evidence around racial and ethnic disparities in health care.

10
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:06,110
In the second segment, I will introduce you to access to care and what that means in the US health care system.

11
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:15,990
And in the last segment, examples will be provided around critical issues in diagnosis and treatment that contribute to disparities.

12
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:23,080
In the first segment, I will illustrate the evidence around racial and ethnic disparities in health care.

13
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,940
The study on racial and ethnic disparities in health care was commissioned by the Congress and

14
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:35,200
culminated into a seminal 2002 report by the Institute of Medicine titled Unequal Treatment.

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,230
It's one of the first comprehensive forms of evidence pointing to the fact that the quality of care received by

16
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:48,850
racial and ethnic minorities in this country is generally lower than what is provided to the majority population.

17
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:54,390
The study explicitly told us that there is no evidence that any significant portion of health

18
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:01,750
care for health care professionals in the United States harbors overtly prejudiced attitudes.

19
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:02,320
However,

20
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:11,920
the study does say that our society still reflects attitudes and behaviors that can be fairly called discriminatory. At the time of the report,

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,270
the existence of these disparities was largely unrecognized,

22
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:26,480
and the report started a larger movement of awareness and efforts to intervene on factors driving differential care.

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,090
When it comes to race and disease, there are some key facts that are important to recognize in order to truly

24
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:38,410
understand factors that result in disparities within the health care setting.

25
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:44,410
First, there is very little genetic variation occurring between racially defined groups,

26
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:51,430
and there are not clear genetic boundaries between populations. We have known this for at least 50 years,

27
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,190
and these conclusions have not changed.

28
00:02:54,190 --> 00:03:03,150
So to say that some racial groups bear a disproportionate burden of disease due to their genetics would be an inaccurate statement.

29
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:10,500
Race is largely socially constructed. It is a human invented social classification system.

30
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:19,470
David Roediger, a professor of history, was quoted saying, "That the world got along without race for the overwhelming majority of its history.

31
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:29,880
The US has never been without it." DNA tests can't measure race. Siblings with the same parents can claim different races.

32
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:39,050
And historically, the way we legally define different races has changed on more than a handful of occasions.

33
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:47,360
Race does get under the skin and impacts our biology, categorizing race does have biological consequences.

34
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,910
There are well-defined differences between racially defined groups for a range of biological outcomes,

35
00:03:52,910 --> 00:04:00,110
such as cardiovascular outcomes, cancer, birth outcomes and diabetes, etc.

36
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:08,960
Race gets under the skin by the lived experience of discrimination, unequal treatment largely supported by social and political structures.

37
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:17,390
And these stress inducing social inequalities can translate to adverse health outcomes.

38
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,980
There is a large body of evidence from the broader public health literature that explains

39
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,420
how social and political determinants of health impact disparities in health we

40
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,700
see across racial and ethnic groups in the US. When it comes to health care

41
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:37,340
and examining the evidence on drivers of disparities within the health care context,

42
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:41,660
the evidence from the Unequal Treatment Report points to the fact that differential

43
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:49,140
care and differential access largely drive disparities seen in health care.

44
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,850
In this next segment, I'd like to dive a little more deeply into access to care.

45
00:04:53,850 --> 00:05:04,840
I will explain what is access to care in the evolution of the health insurance system in the US.
