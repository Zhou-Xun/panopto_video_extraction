00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:12,690
Hello. Welcome to module six. Today I'm going to be talking about emerging viruses and a couple of key principles in terms of where viruses come from,

2
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,310
when they emerge and and how we how we follow that information.

3
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:37,250
So I'm going to start with my by showing discovery curves for the number of human viruses that have been discovered over time.

4
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:51,140
And as you can see, that there have been, you know, from 1900 to 2005, the number of species of viruses steadily ticked upward.

5
00:00:51,440 --> 00:01:00,320
And as new new methods of culturing viruses and growing viruses developed in the 1930s, and then afterwards,

6
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:03,889
there were sort of inflection points that increased the number of viruses that

7
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:09,290
were being discovered over time with the number of species going up over time.

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:17,150
Then we also have the number of virus families that are identified and that viruses are grouped in also increasing over time.

9
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:26,180
Now this graph is ending around 2005, which is about the time that molecular discovery of viruses really took off and really exploded.

10
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:32,690
The number of viruses that we we knew of. And that's something that we're going to talk about a little bit later in this lecture.

11
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:45,340
So we are sorry. In 2013, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation published this review describing the five deadliest outbreaks and pandemics in history.

12
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:52,959
Notice that three of those outbreaks were from viruses, so including the Spanish flu,

13
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:00,760
which was H1N1, including HIV AIDS and including the and antonine plague or smallpox.

14
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,250
And each of these viruses, after emergence, caused millions of deaths.

15
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:15,580
And it observations like this that have really identified viral emerge and specifically more than bacterial emerge,

16
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,830
emergence as a main focus of pandemic prevention going forward.

17
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:31,210
And, you know, the jury is still out in terms of where COVID 19 is going to fall, fall on this scale when we adjust for population size.

18
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,900
So when a virus emerges, in order for that to happen, it requires really essentially two things.

19
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:49,210
One, it requires that contact occurs between a reservoir population that contains the virus and susceptible hosts.

20
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:55,300
So really, from this perspective, what we're thinking about is in who is the virus emerging?

21
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,220
Is a is a new virus actually involved in being created?

22
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,170
Or is this a virus where it had previously been circulating in, for instance,

23
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,900
usually an animal reservoir and is now emerging and a new type of susceptible host.

24
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:18,340
Sometimes we think of viral emergence as a virus that is has been circulating in one area

25
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:24,249
of the world and then has been emerging and moving into a new area of world of the world.

26
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:28,270
And I think Zika virus is a is a potential example of that.

27
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:35,620
Think about this. I think the the recent movement around the world of pox viruses is another way.

28
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:40,210
We sort of think about the ideas of emergence versus endemic city,

29
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:46,540
particularly endemic city in areas where there isn't maybe as good surveillance or response.

30
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:55,030
The second thing that we think about when we're talking about emergence of virus is whether the virus,

31
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:00,159
as it's moving towards the susceptible host population, does it have access to susceptible?

32
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,590
And permissive cells are thinking about this as appropriate tropism.

33
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:15,280
So at the end of the lecture, I'm going to talk about avian influenza to talk about an example about how access to susceptible and permissive

34
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:23,559
cells has so far limited the broad scale human to human transmission of avian influenza viruses that have emerged.

35
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,700
But we do see a pathway forward for avian influenza to emerge to a broader transmission.

36
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:37,450
If changes in permissive, permissive cells were to happen in the human population or the virus were to change

37
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,320
in terms of what permissive cells in the human population are able to access.

38
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:53,979
So really it's about the infected host and the susceptible hosts and whether those populations have contact and also whether once that contact occurs,

39
00:04:53,980 --> 00:05:03,150
the susceptible posts truly have the permissive cells that would permit both infection of those cells, but then replication in transmission forward.

40
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:13,720
Some of the key principles in viral emergence are this first one that emerging or reemerging pathogens are most likely to be zoonotic.

41
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:20,380
Secondly, RNA viruses account for a third of all emerging and reemerging infections.

42
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:26,680
This is because RNA viruses are much more susceptible to change in evolution,

43
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:33,880
and they respond much more quickly to environmental or host pressure that that may cause change,

44
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:47,020
that that higher level of variability allows for more versions of the virus to evolve and for a greater chance for one of those to meet the two

45
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:52,660
conditions that we said earlier that they're able to attach to permissible

46
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,400
susceptible cell and susceptible host when they encounter the new population.

47
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,170
Emerging pathogens often have a broad host range.

48
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,549
So what this means is that emerging virus has the ability to access and make use of cells of a number of different hosts,

49
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,270
not just the hosts that they originally began in.

50
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,700
So this article I'm going to post this article for you to look at in more detail as well.

51
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:29,110
But this article in Science from 2017 walks through the classic zoonotic emergence to human to human transmission chain.

52
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,290
So we start with an animal reservoir here.

53
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:42,700
The example we've got mice and pigs and bats is the animal reservoir shown here that has circulation of of viruses that are zoonotic infections.

54
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,030
So these are infections circulating in the animal reservoir.

55
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,840
If those and those animal reservoir infections are able to infect a human,

56
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,990
then you're going to have a number of early cases that are caused by these infections.

57
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:03,850
These infections will then lead to clinical disease.

58
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:14,230
If you follow this arrow straight down, you may also see a clinical disease here of people that are kind of requiring medical care.

59
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:20,829
But you're also going to have a proportion of the population fall into this unseen immunity here,

60
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:27,220
where you're going to have some people that have have protection already inherent,

61
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:33,340
particularly if the pathogen is closely related to a disease that has already impacted that part.

62
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,530
Population or there's cross-reactivity between existing antibodies and the infecting pathogen.

63
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,020
As the generation time continues,

64
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,509
you've got generation times between subsequent kind of layers of cases that eventually you

65
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:56,320
will have cases that you'll have a mix of detected and undetected cases in the population.

66
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:03,490
As the as the emergence grows, you're going to have case fatality ratio.

67
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:07,090
So you will have some people that die from the infection and leave the population,

68
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:11,499
and you'll have continued foreign transmission superspreading events.

69
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,590
This is something that we see in SARS-CoV-2,

70
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:24,160
but we saw very clearly with mirrors and other coronaviruses prior to it, that these superspreading events,

71
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,140
as they move forward,

72
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:39,460
can have a amplifying effect in the emergence and will create a mix of asymptomatic disease mortality and and severe disease and mild disease as well.

73
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:49,010
And down here is sort of, you know, after human transmission, when you've got widespread human to human transmission happening at that point,

74
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,650
that's when we start to launch biological sampling campaigns and starting to defend,

75
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:06,200
identify and define things like the dynamic changes in different populations and case rates and seroprevalence all come into play.

76
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:23,590
So the pathogen pyramid is another way to think about what it would take at a very biologic level for an emerging virus to move into epidemic spread.

77
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:30,370
And so what we call this very bottom level here.

78
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:40,240
So the level first, the virus that has emerged and encountered a new host population is going to create a number of different exposures.

79
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,150
Sometimes we call this viral chatter.

80
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:51,219
And the viral chatter is is the the many different versions of new viruses that are having the opportunity to emerge,

81
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,930
even though very few actually do.

82
00:09:53,890 --> 00:10:02,469
So you have an exposure happening to the general population, and then some of those viruses will get blocked shown here by these red bars,

83
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:08,590
and some of those viruses will go on to cause infection in the initial set of hosts that encounter them.

84
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:13,480
Now, not all infections will lead to transmissible virus.

85
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:19,690
So many of these, if you notice, a lot of these arrows that come to the infection stage, then get blocked.

86
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:25,390
So some proportion of those infections will end with that host and not transmit any further.

87
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:35,020
But some proportion of the infections will produce transmissible virus that then moves to initial initial host to host transmission.

88
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,380
Or here we're going to specifically think about human to human transmission.

89
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:44,780
However, sporadic human to human transmission is not enough to create an epidemic.

90
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,860
So you have an initial sporadic human to human transmission,

91
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:56,470
but you have another level of success that's required for the virus to cause an epidemic, and that is sustained human to human transmission.

92
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:04,540
So you have human to human transmission that continues over multiple generations and continues to spread beyond that.

93
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:16,210
And so it's not just whether a a virus has the the sequence and the intensity and the receptor usage to cause an initial infection,

94
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:22,210
it has to have the permissive situation in the host to be able to achieve all of these levels,

95
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:30,700
have infection produced transmissible virus that then can travel to another host and as in take

96
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:36,730
advantage of a viable transmission route and then have sustained human to human transmission.

97
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:43,060
So there are many, many viruses that come onto the scene and are detected by surveillance.

98
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,150
There are very few that actually go on to cause epidemic spread.

99
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:56,110
Oftentimes that I'm going to point out a few websites where where a lot of these, you know, early virus reports are posted.

100
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:01,930
And a lot of times you see a lot of conversation and focus on this level two infection.

101
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:13,780
So, you know, for instance, a an identification of a person who has some sort of infection that is not detected by any of our current platforms.

102
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:19,839
We don't know what they have and they've had a very severe infection. The next question you always need to ask you with those reports is,

103
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,900
has there been human to human transmission and has that human to human transmission been sustained?

104
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:38,409
So going back to the Metcalf and Leffler review article that I will post the ways

105
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:43,690
you can sort of think about this is the emergency process as you have pre emergency.

106
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:53,050
So a virus, once a virus that has pandemic potential, it has evolved in the reservoir population.

107
00:12:53,290 --> 00:13:02,589
You actually may have multiple pre emergence events where you've caused an initial while where exposure might be caused

108
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:08,770
but infection doesn't happen or you cause infection that doesn't result in sustained human to human transmission.

109
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,949
So sometimes what we actually see is several attempted but interrupted and

110
00:13:14,950 --> 00:13:19,450
ultimately unsuccessful emergence events before you have something really take off.

111
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:27,310
Then you have this short term post emergence period where you've got exponential growth,

112
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:32,980
and then at that point you move into these medium and long term periods.

113
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:41,230
And as we're all sort of familiar with, with epi curves at this point and and that that medium and long term period,

114
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,230
from our experience in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,

115
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:50,710
these curves are then dictated by control measures, immune,

116
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:57,310
immune kind of the accumulation of immunity, but then also the persistence of that immune immunity.

117
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:11,560
Things like seasonality of the pathogen or other things that may that may put forth more transmission and a higher incidence rate of the pathogen.

118
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:20,650
Now, one thing to keep in mind is that notice how this pre emergence was in the beginning is really an

119
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:26,469
impact of the fact that you have lots of copies of this virus circulating in a zoonotic reservoir.

120
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:37,150
And as united population over here, if you do not eliminate this population to the left,

121
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:44,080
if you have a continuance of this reservoir, if this virus is still circulating in a zoonotic population,

122
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:53,800
no matter what you do on the right hand side of the scale, you will have to have a way of maintaining population immunity against that virus.

123
00:14:54,760 --> 00:15:02,230
If you were to, for instance, put into place a vaccination campaign that gets you down to very little transmission,

124
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:12,070
you can't take away that vaccination campaign so long as there is an animal reservoir that is able to restart a pre emergence process.

125
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:19,570
So is only the accumulated immunity that is stopping the pre emergence from continuing to spur more epidemics.

126
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:28,260
So here are some of the factors that promote viral emergence. So if mentioned, broad host range is important.

127
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:33,440
So rabies is a good example of a virus that can infect many different types of animals.

128
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:40,649
And so it's very easy for rabies to enter a new a new population because it can move

129
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:44,580
from one animal to a to another very easily or one type of host to one of the rabies.

130
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:49,470
Like we see a lot of viral emergence happening from changes in human behavior.

131
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:58,019
So this includes things like urbanization, agriculture and the movement of susceptible or infected populations.

132
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:06,930
And we talk a bit more about historical movements, but we also have seen a lot of emerging viruses.

133
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,530
Rift Valley Fever is a good example linked to changes in either urbanization or

134
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:20,040
climate driven changes in agricultural practices that involves then moving either

135
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:25,920
livestock flocks or people into new areas that then puts them into contact with

136
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,820
zoonotic reservoirs that those people hadn't originally been into contact with.

137
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:42,270
Climate and environmental factors change change both the movement of human populations, but also changes vector distribution.

138
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:48,240
And this is particularly important as we sort of think about mosquito borne diseases and other vector borne diseases.

139
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,569
And then, of course, we can have viral evolution.

140
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:59,940
Viruses that are in animal reservoirs can change in a way that make them more amenable to infecting a human host population.

141
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:08,009
Now, often emergence is going to be due to multiple factors and multiple in unique combinations of these factors.

142
00:17:08,010 --> 00:17:08,729
For each virus.

143
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:20,670
There isn't one path to viral emergence, and here you can see an example of many different viruses and a lot of the factors that played into that.

144
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:29,129
So for instance, for dengue virus, we're talking about things like urban population density plus increased open water storage.

145
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:39,570
And so, you know, the classic example is used tires being disposed and disposed in and of collecting water,

146
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:45,630
which then breeds mosquitoes and then can lead to increases in risk of dengue virus.

147
00:17:46,650 --> 00:18:00,150
You can think about saw that the arena of everyday family for the type of virus in the middle here and

148
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:06,720
we see changes in agricultural techniques that are bringing humans into increased contact with rodents.

149
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,620
And so we have more problem problems with the emergence of that virus there.

150
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:20,640
And we're going to talk about this in number three virus as well, and how climate change had an impact on mice,

151
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:27,180
which then changed the patterns of human contact, which then led to increased emergence.

152
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,270
So let's look specifically about what I mean by breadth of host range.

153
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:43,570
So viruses with broad host ranges are viruses that can use cell receptors that are highly conserved across species.

154
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:51,399
And so on the x axis here, it shows the degree to which receptors are conserved.

155
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:55,000
And on the y axis of the number of species that use these receptors.

156
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:07,270
And as you see this clustering here, you have a lot of viruses that use highly conserved regions or highly conserved receptors,

157
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:14,410
and those are the viruses that tend to be more successful as they're jumping between host species.

158
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,620
And here is an example of the increased movement of people using a historical example of yellow fever.

159
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:29,550
This is from the CDC. His history timeline for yellow fever.

160
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,209
We think we look first at 3000 B.C. is where yellow fever evolved in Africa and outbreaks were likely small,

161
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,000
but they were limited due to population density.

162
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:48,920
Beginning in the 1600s is when we start seeing evidence of outbreaks in Guadeloupe and Yucatan and in the 1600s.

163
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,950
We also see outbreaks on the U.S. eastern coast, including New York, Boston and Charleston.

164
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:59,760
Now, I put this example here to make it clear that when we talk about the increased movement of people,

165
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:07,470
that the unspoken truth here is that it intersects with enslaved peoples and the movement of enslaved people.

166
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:19,080
And as we think about, you know, I think that it's very easy to think about movement, movement of people leading to viral emergence,

167
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:26,729
being linked to things like air travel or business travel or or industries and come and commercial.

168
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:33,120
But there is a long history in the U.S. and in other places of emergence of infectious diseases,

169
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:42,030
emergence of viruses happening because of involuntary travel or either enslavement or colonization of different areas.

170
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:48,180
So you see here the spread of yellow fever to these different areas here.

171
00:20:48,180 --> 00:21:00,150
A lot of we see seaports, having seaports in Europe being featured highly in different outbreak patterns by the late 1700s.

172
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,870
Yellow fever was a huge problem in the United States.

173
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:13,320
So from August 1st to November 9th, yellow fever actually killed 10% of the population of the city of Philadelphia in the 1800s.

174
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:19,890
Here you see over 26,000 cases in New Orleans in the 1800s.

175
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,489
The actually the first attempt at building the Panama Canal attempted by the French government,

176
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,630
failed due to so many yellow fever fatalities, they couldn't finish building the canal.

177
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:39,030
By 1898, we have more U.S. soldiers died of yellow fever than in battle in the Spanish-American War.

178
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:50,910
And then by 1900, we have the introduction of sanitation and mosquito removal programs that came into place to start to control yellow fever.

179
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:59,250
And I didn't bring this picture for this slide here, but, you know, yellow fever when yellow fever entered a town,

180
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,120
there are many stories of a lot of people picking up and moving to the next

181
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:08,040
town over and just taking all of their stuff and leaving the town completely.

182
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:18,350
Once yellow fever entered. So let's switch to looking at the impact of vector distribution.

183
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:26,810
So this is the this is an example of the U.S. mosquito range.

184
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:34,940
This is a map from 2017 oh two that sort of shows the range of different mosquitoes.

185
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:41,270
Now, as climate changes, this is going to change as well.

186
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:50,780
And and you see, there's sort of a gradation here in terms of the gray being very unlikely and then the darker colors being very likely.

187
00:22:51,260 --> 00:23:00,799
So with a vector borne virus. A You are only going to have transmission in areas where the vector is able to.

188
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,800
In this case, the misty mosquito is able to live and reproduce.

189
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:09,590
So this is not just about the the virus has viability in a host population,

190
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:15,260
but you actually need to be thinking about the mosquito or the vectors viability in that area as well.

191
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:25,670
Now, different vector borne viruses use different types of mosquitoes preferentially as vectors.

192
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:32,870
And so we have to pay really close attention to vector range as as part of our infectious disease surveillance.

193
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,210
So we'll look at this more when we talk about some of our other vector viruses.

194
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:48,510
So an example of vector vector distribution matters is the for Watson is the Four Corners outbreak.

195
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:54,750
So in 1993, Four Corners area of New Mexico had an extended drought,

196
00:23:55,170 --> 00:24:00,450
and that extended drought then was followed by a much higher than average rainfall.

197
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:04,380
So it was a very dry spell and then a very wet spell.

198
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:12,780
And what this did is created in the in the natural areas and created created a huge

199
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,520
increase in the amount of pinon nuts that were being produced by the trees in those areas.

200
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,640
So it went from very, you know, kind of a drought opinion,

201
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:36,629
not to a huge influx of communities because that happened the deer mouse population clustered around those areas with all of the nuts.

202
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,160
And because of the plentiful food,

203
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:45,780
you had more actually reproduction of the deer mice and you had an explosion of the number of derisive around that area.

204
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:52,350
Deer mice were are able to carry hantavirus.

205
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,430
Now hantavirus is endemic in deer mice. It's also asymptomatic in deer.

206
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:06,390
So it doesn't kill the mice. So the maser able to carry and transmit it without any sort of clinical or health effects to the mice.

207
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:13,440
When they shed the virus, they shut it in droppings and it's very stable at that point.

208
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:26,250
And so this big increase in deer mice led to that, a big increase in hantavirus contamination as part of droppings.

209
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:34,380
And then and then people coming into contact with hantavirus either through contact in those areas.

210
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:41,640
In the areas environmentally. Hantavirus causes a sudden onset of a pulmonary syndrome.

211
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:47,550
It can lead to shortness of breath, fluid in lungs, and then the initial outbreak.

212
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,730
When the response began, there was a 50% mortality rate for people that were coming into contact with it.

213
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,050
So I've posted here two websites to take a look at.

214
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:06,190
One is health babb dot org. My favorite is pyramid mail dot org.

215
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:14,750
Pyramid mail is the website that they they send out everything.

216
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:20,920
I mean, they publish all reports of potential emerging viruses or concerning clusters.

217
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:27,219
And it will flood your email inbox. But it has a lot of information,

218
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:31,629
interesting information that comes out of my mail in terms of what new detections

219
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:35,980
are happening and or new kind of clusters of disease that are unidentified.

220
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:42,760
All right. So I'm going to specifically talk about you have already introduced the idea of influenza.

221
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:48,909
And emergency influenza is one of the most common examples that we use when we talk about emergence.

222
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:56,920
Because of the way that the segmented genome works, it has very stark and fast emergence events.

223
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:03,790
So I'm going to talk about that and then we're going to get into some more emergence examples in class next week.

224
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:16,510
So here is a schematic not to get exact scale as noted by the legend, but a history of influenza pandemics that have happened over time.

225
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:22,900
So these are pandemics of new strains that happen above and beyond the seasonal influenza activity that we get from year to year.

226
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:31,839
Now, by way of introduction, influenza is or the mix of virus, it's as an envelope,

227
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:41,140
it's an RNA virus and it has segmented genome and it is transmitted mostly through closer range coughing and sneezing events.

228
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:47,110
But influenza infection occurs most efficiently when the virus reaches the lower respiratory tract.

229
00:27:47,410 --> 00:27:53,530
And we're going to talk about the importance of distinguishing between the upper and lower respiratory tract towards the end of this example.

230
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:59,530
So the influenza virus here is a cartoon of what the structure looks like.

231
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:09,790
The kind of of note the surface proteins of influenza virus include hemagglutinin and a neuraminidase.

232
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:16,599
And a there's also a an enchanted channel protein that's on the surface, but receives much less attention.

233
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:26,979
Mostly, we focus on the hemagglutinin and the nerve endings. Those two proteins on the surface are the the predominant antigenic target.

234
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:35,310
So hemagglutinin tends to be what our body spends most of the energy recognizing and creating memory too.

235
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:39,790
But neuraminidase is also recognized by our adaptive immune system.

236
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:47,469
The W how the W.H.O. or the World Health Organization names the viruses.

237
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:54,760
As such, you've got the type, you have the geographic source, you have some sort of isolate number here of isolation,

238
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,030
and then a combination of the hemagglutinin type and intermittent type.

239
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:02,920
So that's how we get influenza names like H3N2, H1N1.

240
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,580
Influenza Type B does not occur as subtypes, but there are lineages.

241
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:14,740
So we do have some genetic groupings with influenza B, but no official subtypes.

242
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:29,229
So antigenic drift or another way to think about this is you can have two degrees of change and these are artificial tend to be

243
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:37,600
rather kind of artificial definitions in most viruses that a drift is a minor change or is a modest change in influenza virus,

244
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,100
and a shift is a major change.

245
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:47,920
However, with influenza, there's actually a very clean operational difference of what antigenic drift is and what antigenic shift is.

246
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:56,740
So antigenic drift involves within the segments of our RNA involves a change in a single segment,

247
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:01,540
in a particular segment with a limited number of mutations in that segment.

248
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:08,860
And so this is the in that segment is then just impacting just that protein that that segment encodes.

249
00:30:09,490 --> 00:30:18,610
This is the type of change that we see from year to year that necessitates the change of the influenza vaccine.

250
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:26,140
They are changes that can cause the virus to totally evade vaccine or previous infection protection in the population.

251
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:33,610
But they are fundamentally changes that are limited to a segment of the genome.

252
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:42,120
Now. Edit Antigenic shift is a more profound and large change.

253
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:52,200
This is something where you're going to have a huge variation in the hemagglutinin or medidas a reassortment of genomic material.

254
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,939
And this is when we've got segments coming from multiple precursor viruses to make

255
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:01,530
a new combination that has not been seen by the host population in the past.

256
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:12,810
So we have only seen this in the past happen with influenza type A, and when this happens, it creates a new virus with a novel antigenic profile.

257
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:20,520
Now, some of the classic pathways that have been proposed for this is that you've got, for instance,

258
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:28,360
in this example, aquatic birds in this center transmitting directly to fowl and to pigs.

259
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:38,070
Potentially, we've actually seen transmission from aquatic birds to horses and to marine marine animals.

260
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:47,790
But you have this transmission that happens through these intermediate hosts, these intermediate host.

261
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:55,619
There's some sort of shift event that happens either here or with these intermediate hosts,

262
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:59,010
both from the viruses, from the birds and the viruses from humans.

263
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,390
That leads to the emergence of something that is able to infect humans.

264
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:18,280
What this looks like is if you've got this green virus here, that's a human virus and you have a blue virus here, that's the bird virus in here.

265
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,229
Notice that the antibodies,

266
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:28,870
the great antibodies here that are being produced by the host are blocking the ability of this green virus to attach to the receptors right here.

267
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:36,820
But by changing this segment in the green virus and replacing one of these green segments with a blue segment right here,

268
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:44,500
the surface proteins that attach to the to the cell, the receptors on the cell surface proteins change to blue receptors.

269
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,290
The antibodies no longer recognize them, and the virus then can attach to the cell.

270
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:55,520
And so this is how reassortment happens. And this would be an antigenic shift of that.

271
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,710
So this is what leads to sort of a major emergence, a major pandemic event.

272
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:09,100
So to drill down on this idea of the rich original mixing vessel theory of pandemic influenza,

273
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:12,580
you really have to be thinking about what's happening at the receptor level.

274
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:23,080
So in humans, humans human influenza infections use a sialic acid that's linked to a galactose by an Alpha two six linkage.

275
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:31,600
So this is how the receptor is, what it's comprised of in humans, in birds.

276
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,860
Birds use a sialic acid that's linked to galactose by an alpha two three linkage.

277
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:43,480
Because of this change, a human virus does not get recognized by an avian receptor,

278
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:50,770
and an avian virus should not, under this kind of original theory, get recognized by a human receptor.

279
00:33:52,420 --> 00:34:03,130
So. How how we're you know, so that doesn't explain how avian viruses were leading to emergence events in humans.

280
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,900
And the the mixing vessel theory is that it requires a pig.

281
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:13,750
So pigs have both Alpha two, three and Alpha two six receptors.

282
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:22,020
And so by the ability and they have these receptors in the same cells by the ability to intake both of these viruses,

283
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:30,249
it allows for the reassortment events for an entirely new combined human plus avian virus to

284
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:35,680
emerge that would have the ability to use an Alpha two six receptor and go back and infect.

285
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:41,020
Now, as in all things virology. The real story is more complicated.

286
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:48,489
So we've actually seen in a lot of these avian flu emergence events that we hear about,

287
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:53,140
for instance, this H5N1 event that this paper is describing right here.

288
00:34:53,470 --> 00:35:00,640
We actually hear about avian viruses replicating in humans without having to go through an intermediate host.

289
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:09,550
And here is why. If you look at this picture right here, this is showing nasal mucosa as well,

290
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:16,150
sinuses, bronchus, particularly alveoli, different areas of the respiratory tract.

291
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:22,840
The green colors in here are showing what is a traditional human receptor.

292
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:30,370
What I recently just told you that humans only have, which is a sialic, a alpha two six receptor.

293
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:37,180
Now things that are tagged in red are an alpha two three receptor.

294
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:41,709
Now you should be saying, hold on, wait a minute.

295
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,350
You didn't tell me that humans can have those receptors, too.

296
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:49,990
You just told me that humans don't have those receptors. And that's what was originally believed for a really long time.

297
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:56,440
Turns out that humans do have those receptors, but they are not really located.

298
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:03,760
They're not present in the nasal mucosa of the sinuses, the upper respiratory tract there.

299
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:08,560
They are available deep in the lower respiratory tract.

300
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:19,600
So if a human comes into contact with an avian virus that's using Alpha two three receptor, they can get infected with that avian influenza virus.

301
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:24,960
But in order for that to happen, that avian influenza virus needs to make it deep in the blood,

302
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:30,700
into the lungs in order to find a cell to attach to and replicate from there.

303
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:37,600
Now, the question is if the only cells that can participate in replication happen deep in that lung.

304
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:47,500
Is it possible for the virus in that one host to make enough virus that is enough and have

305
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,360
versions of that virus so that it is then can be released and transmitted to the next host.

306
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,540
If the only cells that are then releasing that virus are only deep in the respiratory

307
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,890
tract and not further up in the respiratory tract where we usually release viruses from.

308
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:14,140
And so this explains why you may often see if you've got a lot of avian influenza happening, you often can see in humans, humans get infected.

309
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,120
They're very, very severe infection because they have no prior immunity to protect them.

310
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:25,090
This combination of hemagglutinin or neuraminidase is different than anything that their body has seen before,

311
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:32,620
but it doesn't lead to sustained human to human transmission because it's deep in the lungs in a place where that can't really happen further.

312
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:48,909
So here is. So here's sort of the roadmap for how an avian virus here with our friendly red bird here could could change and go to a

313
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:56,680
place where you've got sustained human to human transmission and do so without needing an intermediate host or a pig.

314
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:58,180
Right here is a mixing vessel.

315
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:06,220
So if you are if you're currently an avian influenza virus, do not listen to this, because this is the plan for how it would work.

316
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:18,760
You have an avian virus within it with an alpha two three receptor that infects a human deep in the lungs by accessing an alpha two,

317
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:22,750
three or a cell with an alpha two three receptor deep in the human lungs.

318
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:26,390
Now, from there, transmission is going to be stopped.

319
00:38:26,410 --> 00:38:33,610
This person is going to get severely ill, but transmission is not going to continue to this person because there's not enough virus

320
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:38,290
to release from deep in the lungs and then transmit out the upper respiratory tract.

321
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:48,610
However, if this happens with such replication that you've got the evolution here,

322
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:58,840
that you basically have a mutation that allows for very efficient replication and very high levels of virus to to kind of reach out of the body.

323
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:03,940
But then if you also have two mutations that allows for a change in receptor,

324
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:10,780
if any versions of those virus then are able to use an Alpha two six receptor,

325
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:20,259
that will then lead to replication in the upper respiratory tract and efficient replication that will allow this

326
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:28,030
person to then be infectious and transmit the virus to another person through their upper respiratory tract.

327
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:33,069
And so this is the concern when we look at avian viruses and try to discern

328
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,520
their pandemic potential and whether that that will that route will happen.

329
00:39:38,590 --> 00:39:43,840
So these are the number of times that a reassortment event has happened.

330
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:49,720
And you've we've had major influenza pandemics. 1918 was due to the H1N1 strain.

331
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:57,980
And then we've got H two and two that was seen in 1957, as I explained in Dr. Garcia's presentation.

332
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,130
H1N1 went away when H two and two came along. That went away when H3N2 came along.

333
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:10,840
And then in 1977, we have the beginning of close circulation of H3N2 and H1N1.

334
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,130
And then we had a new emergent strain happening in 2009.

335
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:24,040
All right. The source of these viruses are they?

336
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:33,270
They vary, but they mostly are a combination of mutations and reassortment of segments based in avian viruses.

337
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:40,110
And all of these led to great big impacts in terms of U.S. deaths.

338
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:47,340
And here are a few pictures from the 1918 pandemic.

339
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:51,120
It looks kind of familiar to some situations we've been in recently.

340
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,799
And I think it's always I like to remind people,

341
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:01,440
if we sort of try to think historically about emerging viruses and pandemics compared to what we're going through now,

342
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:11,550
I'd like to remind people of that in the the we call it the 1918 pandemic, but it actually went for years and it actually had multiple waves.

343
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:17,190
And although, you know, it's very different from COVID in that it actually,

344
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:22,860
for the most part went away between the waves or to the best of our knowledge.

345
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:28,559
And but we had multiple waves happen with resurgence cause the last resurgence

346
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,340
corresponding and being kind of initiated with return from troops from overseas.

347
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:46,720
And you know, as we sort of think about pandemics and the structure of pandemics over time, you have to remember the impact of vaccines to these.

348
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,760
The 1918 pandemic went the way that it did because there was no vaccine available.

349
00:41:52,660 --> 00:42:03,250
By the time the next pandemic happened. There was the development of the vaccine developed at U of M by Thomas Francis Jr and Jonas Salk,

350
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:10,690
who was at U of M at the time, and it was first approved for military use and then expanded to civilian use.

351
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:17,950
Interestingly enough, the original studies of those vaccines were conducted in military personnel and college students.

352
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:24,130
So by 1957, there was the first influenza pandemic with the vaccine, and it had a very different outcome.

353
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:30,970
This vaccine production happened in a four month timeline to the 1957 strain,

354
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:36,370
and it's estimated that a million deaths in the U.S. would have occurred.

355
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:41,080
But only 7000, 70,000 happened because of the rapid deployment of the vaccine.

356
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:53,739
So there is in current times continued very careful attention to avian influenza and thinking about both exposures to avian influenza,

357
00:42:53,740 --> 00:43:01,209
but also thinking about big avian influenza events within the avian population itself.

358
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:06,310
And so we will oftentimes hear about chicken calls that happen.

359
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:13,480
Here's a picture on the left here of a mass chicken call. If you've got a lot of avian influenza happening in the bird populations in an area,

360
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:18,729
we most recently had some avian influenza come to the United States.

361
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:22,330
And so we saw things like zoos closing their penguin,

362
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:30,280
their penguin exhibit and other ways of trying to limit the the infection of

363
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,590
different types of birds and then limit the exposure of people to those birds.

364
00:43:38,310 --> 00:43:50,130
So examples of emerging influenza strains that are currently very on the table is continuing to watch H7N9 patterns first started in poultry in China.

365
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,399
So we've seen cases in other parts of Asia,

366
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:01,070
and we've seen some resistance patterns to the current treatments we use for influenza, H3N2 variant or H3N2.

367
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:12,930
We also call this swine. H3N2 is a really interesting virus where it's it's developed the ability to have swine to human transmission.

368
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:18,630
It tends to be it's in the reservoir would be in swine.

369
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,100
And it's really taken a hold in agricultural swine.

370
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:30,000
And we see them at agricultural fairs, at state and county fairs, at forage events.

371
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:37,590
You will occasionally get emergences of swine H3N2, infecting people that were attending those events.

372
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:46,560
And particularly, we see this particularly linked to like kids and like older kids.

373
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:51,719
And in teens that are working, these events will will have cases of these viruses.

374
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,610
So that's something we tend to watch in the summer,

375
00:44:53,850 --> 00:45:00,660
which is pretty interesting because we don't often have flu transmission in the summer, but we do have these periodic emergencies of H3N2.

376
00:45:03,790 --> 00:45:17,110
So for the workshop, for this module, you're going to be looking at some transmission and emergence data around in an emergent avian influenza strain.

377
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:26,950
Now, around this time, there was a lot of interest in trying to understand where at the animal, what we call the animal human interface.

378
00:45:26,950 --> 00:45:37,239
This emergence was happening and a lot of evidence that it was happening in wet markets where people either working

379
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:45,940
in the wet markets or buying food at the wet markets were really high risk of becoming infected here on this.

380
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:54,099
And I'm going to post the slides so you can get this link from the slides is an example or it's a video of what's called a deep feathering machine.

381
00:45:54,100 --> 00:46:00,010
And feathering machines are are used in markets to so that somebody can pick

382
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,860
a chicken and have it be feathered there on the spot so that they can leave.

383
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:12,790
And there is evidence from the process that the feathering machine uses that then

384
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:16,720
creates an aerosolization of any virus that that chicken may have been infected with,

385
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:18,490
that then people can breathe in.

386
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:27,760
And perhaps that combination of the know aerosolization of that virus, such high quantities and then being close enough to breathe it in,

387
00:46:27,970 --> 00:46:34,299
allows for that deep, long exposure that would have to happen for somebody to get infected with an avian influenza virus.

388
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:40,250
So it is it is not for all not all students.

389
00:46:40,250 --> 00:46:46,420
And I've had some students in the past have found the video to be a bit squeamish about putting it here on the link.

390
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,050
And you can make the choice on whether you'd like to watch it.

391
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:53,409
And with that, I'm going to close this lecture.

392
00:46:53,410 --> 00:47:02,890
And the next step is to get to work on the workshop with the Avian Influenza Emergence Paper.
