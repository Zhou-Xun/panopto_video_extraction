1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:05,040
I mean, you think. Okay.

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:13,469
Hello, everybody. I hope these two will run in any minute now.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:21,690
Probably so last week of lecture would be hello.

4
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,080
So I did review your like my recording of the logic.

5
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:36,990
I am. Okay, great. I did review your more your introductions in more detail outline so you can see the comments in canvas.

6
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:45,329
Just a reminder that your last quiz will be due Sunday, but you should be able to take that now.

7
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,560
There's all the content that's on it is already been covered in class.

8
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:56,160
Last ones where seven points and then after that, just your final paper, which is due finals week.

9
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:07,020
Yes. So today we're going to try to wrap things up a little bit and talk about research, practice, advocacy and education.

10
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:17,849
We'll dissect the benefits of having mandates and policies for infectious diseases, and then we'll have a little class debate at the end.

11
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:22,470
How many of you have done a class debate before? Nobody.

12
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:26,100
All you have was it in Dr. Divine? Just class? No.

13
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,570
Robbins. Dr. Robbins class. Okay.

14
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,270
All right. Well, don't worry.

15
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:44,130
I'll I'll kind of talk about the structure of how this will go at that at during it, because you'll have time to prep as well.

16
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,400
Any questions before I get started? Okay.

17
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,710
So enhancing practice, research, education and advocacy.

18
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:04,200
So just to highlight for practice, a lot of you ended up interviewing practitioners for your third homework.

19
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:13,410
So one of the main challenges they have is it's important to get the information out there of what is actually working and lessons learned.

20
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:22,950
But oftentimes practitioners don't necessarily have like the need or motivation or part of their job to actually like publish their findings.

21
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,910
So a lot of this just goes like entirely unknown.

22
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:36,210
For example, if you go to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services website and look specifically under their communicable disease reports,

23
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:47,640
there's very few data reports actually in there just because they have so many other priorities in terms of publishing that are not publishing.

24
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,730
Right. So that's the absolutely last thing on their mind.

25
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:57,030
But because of that, there's often these best practices where they're actually like these boots on the ground.

26
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:00,209
People are not like people like us who just like researchers.

27
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,270
I mean, like just sit in our office all day or we like talk to them. Right.

28
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:11,579
But it's not quite the same for those in infectious disease medicine, though, versus public health practitioners.

29
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:19,260
It's definitely more common for those in infectious disease medicine to publish or disseminate their findings into practice,

30
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,410
partially because they are incentivized to do this, but because it's part of their clinical practice as well.

31
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,700
So in terms of research, we've talked about this a little bit throughout the class.

32
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,000
We need to have a better body of evidence on health disparities and inequality related to infectious diseases,

33
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:47,549
so enhanced data collection and surveillance of vulnerable populations and then research on the connections between environmental justice,

34
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:50,490
social justice, racism and infectious disease.

35
00:03:50,940 --> 00:04:00,450
So when I was creating the content for this course and curating all the materials compared to the online class, you didn't get as is that answer?

36
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,260
No, you're just stretching. Is that okay?

37
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,060
All right. Because I can't go like this. All right.

38
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:13,920
So compared to the online class, you didn't receive nearly as many readings as they did just because the course is a different format.

39
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:26,310
But realistically, I tried to give you mostly exclusively readings from scholars of color, and even that was super, very difficult to find.

40
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:36,059
And more so since the pandemic, more scholars of color are publishing on things about environmental justice, social justice,

41
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,810
racism, and its connections to like infectious disease outbreaks and then emergency response in particular.

42
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,470
But there's still very little out there.

43
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,930
And then one thing that I noticed in particular that I pay attention to,

44
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:59,850
just because I work a lot with Asian-American populations, is that oftentimes were excluded from reporting on.

45
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:07,660
Minority data. So The New York Times, a couple of times during early in the pandemic, published surveillance data of,

46
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:14,740
you know, COVID incidence, hospitalization and mortality rates among minorities.

47
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:22,540
But they only compared whites, black and Hispanic and Latinos and then didn't even mention Asian Americans at all.

48
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:28,960
But that's usually because we, like I mentioned previously and lecture, we just get aggregated together as a large group.

49
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:35,650
So this data collection, surveillance of vulnerable populations like even we talked about last week,

50
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:40,209
where Native Americans and Indigenous communities don't want to share their

51
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:44,260
data with the state health department just because there's a lack of trust,

52
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:50,049
what they do with that information. So this is problematic.

53
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,090
So my future, you know,

54
00:05:52,090 --> 00:06:02,140
epi people who are going to be out there in the field definitely advocating for this if possible in your work and then with research.

55
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:09,160
COVID 19 did lead to an explosion of research in coronaviruses like we've talked about before.

56
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:15,070
You know, people who never did infectious disease research all of a sudden are getting into it now.

57
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:19,390
Pros and cons. There was a lot of stuff coming out rapidly,

58
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:31,360
but you also had a lot of what we call like sloppy science or sloppy research being published in these really impactful journals like The Lancet.

59
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,950
So retractions means that something went, you know, it got through peer review, it got published.

60
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:43,749
And now they have to go back and say, like, oopsie daisy, actually, all of this was wrong.

61
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,840
Please ignore this. But this is exactly the same kind of thing that happened with the Andrew Wakefield

62
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,850
MMR autism vaccine study that was published in The Lancet and retracted.

63
00:06:55,210 --> 00:07:04,150
So still happening to this day. They published hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without macrolide for treatment of COVID 19,

64
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:11,650
a multinational registry analysis essentially saying that this horse medication was effective.

65
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:20,049
Yes. PAGE Does it happen like often we're like redacted after the fact or is it like once in a room, like it's a big deal, something's taken.

66
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,780
But I would say that it's not uncommon.

67
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:34,510
But generally, you know, on a non-covid topic, you might see that for like one every like 100 or something like that.

68
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:41,139
But with COVID, we saw it happening a lot more just because it was a novel pathogen.

69
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:44,440
So, you know, information was emerging about it.

70
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:51,040
And the more we found out, the more we were like, okay, maybe what we discussed or hypothesized before wasn't correct.

71
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:59,620
You had people publishing on it that aren't necessarily familiar with anything to do with virology or pathogenicity,

72
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,220
and then like industrial hygiene, anything to that effect.

73
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:13,120
Or sometimes papers are retracted when they find out people steal other people's work, which is not uncommon at all.

74
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,120
It's very common. And there's one university I won't name them,

75
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,429
but they're they're very big school of public health and they're known for like if you go if they see you at

76
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,530
a conference and you have a poster where you're showing your work that hasn't been published in a paper yet,

77
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,050
they will 100% take that idea and then work on it and publish it before you.

78
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:43,419
So it's pretty car, it's pretty common, or sometimes it's out of like really like an accidental mistake.

79
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:46,870
Right? So just say, for example, when you do a systematic review,

80
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,359
you're supposed to technically registered in this database because systematic reviews take a year to do so.

81
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,479
People know, like, okay, I can't start doing the same systematic review on the same topic because some of these are already working on this.

82
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,840
Or if you're working on a large secondary analysis with a dataset like I'm working right now with the Eisenberg Depression Center,

83
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:11,120
you register that so people know, like, this is my research question, but a lot of times people don't go through those formal processes.

84
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,899
So it's like, Oh shoot, we published on the same thing and like one person did it before another.

85
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,580
So it kind of seems like plagiarism,

86
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:28,390
but this in particular was just like a hot button topic that got published and somehow made it through peer review.

87
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:35,950
So the hydro hydroxychloroquine they remember like this was it's actually like a horse treatment medication.

88
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:42,399
But they were saying that it could potentially treat COVID symptoms and then this picked up traction.

89
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,720
And then you had people like President Trump, for example, talking about it.

90
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,990
Joe Rogan, if you all know Joe Rogan,

91
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:59,800
he got COVID and then took this and like basically like everything under the kitchen sink to, like, solve or to recover from.

92
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:05,520
Hold it. And then the second paper published in the Journal of American Medicine Medical Association,

93
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:15,480
was experimental assessment of carbon dioxide content in inhaled air with or without face masks in healthy children, a randomized clinical trial.

94
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:27,060
This was the study that said that children could essentially get carbon dioxide poisoning from wearing masks.

95
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,130
And this was published in JAMA.

96
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:39,810
And based on, like what we know about like aerosol dynamics and how masks and respirators work, that is absolutely not the case.

97
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:46,080
So I am surprised that this was published in JAMA, but these papers were retracted at the end of the day.

98
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:56,160
So themes that to look forward see that are in desperate need of in this area disease specific research and patterns.

99
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,730
Emerging infectious diseases and genomics, immunology and vaccines.

100
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:09,180
A lot of translational research, which means research that can research findings that can be used by the average

101
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:14,009
practitioner or the average person can like take your paper and understand it,

102
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,130
which is the kind of research I aim to do.

103
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:22,650
I know a lot of researchers do research that is mostly read by other researchers, which, you know, to each their own.

104
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,430
But I think translational research is especially necessary.

105
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:34,670
Informatics and databases, efficacy and cost benefit, safe food and water beyond identifying the issues.

106
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:39,989
So for the last couple of decades in this country, we've gotten to the point where it's like,

107
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:43,590
okay, we've identified where there is safe food and water,

108
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:50,670
but we haven't necessarily addressed infrastructure issues like we've talked about before with Flint or like Benton Harbor, for example,

109
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:58,260
and then health promotion and communications around infectious disease response for education,

110
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,190
like we talked about before, instilling infectious disease education,

111
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:12,840
K-through-12 workplaces, and just getting these basic, very fundamental public health principles instilled with people in an early age.

112
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,370
And then advocacy in particular, like we've all discussed before,

113
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,469
these are just summarizing points, holistic approaches rather than Band-Aid approaches,

114
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:31,590
trying to think about infectious disease and emergency response from a proactive, rather, rather than reactive stance.

115
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:42,320
Um, and then thinking about the multilevel interventions as well, I mean, she's not coming.

116
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,930
Okay. All right.

117
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:54,019
So. So pros and cons of infectious disease mandates and policies like.

118
00:12:54,020 --> 00:13:02,570
Except we're having a debate after this. So just to get us all on the same page about what these different terms mean.

119
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:11,479
So a law is a system of rules in which a country or community recognizes as regulating actions of its members,

120
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,870
which may enforce the imposition of penalties.

121
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:20,960
Right. So, you know, generally most states, for example, have laws on speeding.

122
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:29,860
Right. Well, when you're on the road, a regulation is a rule or directive made that's maintained by an authority.

123
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:37,400
So a lot of the workplace health and safety things that we have are regulations and those are upheld by OSHA.

124
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,390
A mandate is an official order or commission to do something.

125
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:48,980
So these are an order from like most powerful, enforceable to like the least.

126
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:56,840
A policy is, of course, a principle of action adopted or proposed by a government, party, policy, business or individual.

127
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:02,209
Sometimes they're upheld. Sometimes they're not upheld. There isn't necessarily a consequence if you don't.

128
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:02,660
Right.

129
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:12,560
And then a recommendation or guideline is a suggestion or proposal as the best course of action, especially when put forth by an authoritative body.

130
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:23,210
So the benefits of having mandates, of course, are very generally protecting the health of individuals, community and the greater public.

131
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,260
And generally, policies and mandates are based on data.

132
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:34,430
For example, we might drive them from injury rates, illness rates, fatality rates, disease incidence, prevalence and known harms.

133
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:38,060
So take for example, something like.

134
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,330
Oh, I think that's.

135
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:57,420
Think, for example, like what we know about carbon dioxide, kind of going back to that previous example that we had about masking in children.

136
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:04,650
So in any given time, there are direct reading instruments where we could derive what is the exact

137
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:09,210
concentration of carbon dioxide in parts per million in this room right now?

138
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:19,770
And it's generally recommended that you stay below a threshold of 1000 parts per million of carbon dioxide, because after you get above that amount,

139
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:28,380
people start to get like really fatigued and foggy brained and there's like these short term neurological effects, right?

140
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:37,590
But for the most part, the more people you have in the room, the more people are exhaling, the more carbon dioxide that you actually have.

141
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:42,989
But there's not necessarily anybody going around and enforcing that in crowded spaces.

142
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:46,889
Right. Like some people complain about things like sick building syndrome.

143
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:49,470
That might be one of the things that they monitor for.

144
00:15:50,460 --> 00:16:00,060
And you can try to get more air exchanges or ventilation, but there's not necessarily any like penalty if a place has a high level of carbon dioxide.

145
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:08,129
So, you know, take for example, like this classroom right now, we probably have a decent level of carbon dioxide.

146
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:17,700
Most of your masks work, but we're pretty spaced out. Whereas if you go somewhere crowded, for example, like a club, probably really high CO2 levels.

147
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:25,170
Some benefits of vaccines, for example, like we've talked about.

148
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:33,990
So since 1988, more than 500,000 deaths have been prevented from polio and then death.

149
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:41,430
Tetanus vaccine to pre pre tetanus vaccine is now 470 versus 30 per year.

150
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,790
So in this study by Liu and Webby Community Use of face mask and COVID 19,

151
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:53,339
evidence from a natural experiment of states met state mandates in the United States.

152
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:53,969
Essentially,

153
00:16:53,970 --> 00:17:02,430
the natural experiment is just letting the states do what they want to do and then kind of seeing what happened and then analyzing that data.

154
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:10,469
So they looked at mask mandates in 15 states and Washington, D.C. to compare state vs mask orders and COVID cases.

155
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:18,330
And the implementation of mask mandates potentially averted more than 200,000 COVID 19 cases.

156
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:25,140
And as we're seeing, I don't know if you saw, but as of yesterday, the CDC is starting to recommend masks again.

157
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:31,650
They all see that. Yeah, they did. Yeah, they're wild crowd here.

158
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:37,980
So they're like, oh, my gosh, influenza A which we are talking about zero RSV.

159
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,600
And then COVID is taking up again now in Los Angeles and New York.

160
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:50,850
So they're like, Oh, shoot, you know how that thing we knew about health masks, arrest, aerosols, that's still true.

161
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,240
But you should just go ahead and go back to wearing those,

162
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,950
even though you haven't been wearing those essentially for like months and months and months.

163
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,310
So I would say,

164
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:10,500
like folks like us who have generally not stopped wearing them ever will continue to do so by getting people back on the wagon again is I think,

165
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:23,400
going to be very, very challenging. Now, challenge is about these kinds of mandates is most people don't like being told what to do.

166
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:36,780
So we've heard tons of arguments about how masking or public health orders in particular takes away people's perceived behavioral control,

167
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,899
which is their capacity and autonomy.

168
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:47,970
So capacity is their ability to do something, and autonomy is the belief that you have power and control about what you're doing.

169
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:55,530
And again, this perception of policies and mandates being an infringement on your personal liberties, religious beliefs and civil rights.

170
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:03,989
So the more time that passes, like with COVID and the occurrence of X decreases,

171
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:09,300
like with COVID, it hasn't necessarily decreased, but it's slowly fading from the public mind.

172
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:22,530
People forget the utility of a policy mandate or regulation, and there's also this perception of risk and the tendency toward risky behavior.

173
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:32,040
So what people perceive as actual risk, what I perceive as bias may be actually very different than what Lexi perceives as actual risk.

174
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:42,120
This is all on an individual basis, and there's also individual and cultural differences in terms of the level of acceptance for risk.

175
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,600
So I think some of you are your commentaries in particular will focus on other cultures.

176
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,820
As are other countries and in terms of like how much they're willing to put their health at risk.

177
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:03,030
But you know what the challenge is for those who are anti mandates, there's a lack of value placed on prevention.

178
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:12,090
There's usually an insufficient evidence base, much mismatched timelines about when people make their decisions versus information coming out.

179
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:22,950
The power of vested interests. So we're talking about like capitalism, lobbyists, big corporations and then researchers generally making regulations,

180
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:30,840
policies and mandates that are isolated from the policy process, which is why it's great that some of you are getting dual degrees.

181
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:38,010
So, okay, today's activity, which will take up like a good chunk of our time, how this will work,

182
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:43,740
I've split you up into two teams and fortunately you have an uneven number today.

183
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,250
But the topic is going to be the polio vaccine.

184
00:20:50,460 --> 00:21:02,700
All right. So we're going to split. One group is going to be pro polio vaccine mandate and one group is going to be anti polio vaccine mandate.

185
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,760
We're going to flip a coin to see who gets who, which. Okay.

186
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,589
So I used to do debates when I was in high school.

187
00:21:10,590 --> 00:21:17,640
I was part of the Health Occupational Science Academy and we went to the national championships.

188
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,700
But how this would actually work is they you go into a room,

189
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:28,440
they give you a topic and what stance you have to take, and you gave about half an hour to do research on it.

190
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:36,480
So when your team is presenting your argument, I know each of you have more than three people,

191
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,210
but pick three people who will be speaking on behalf of your entire team.

192
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:49,620
Okay? And what you want to do is make sure that, number one, you have an opening statement that, you know,

193
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:57,090
briefly summarizes your position and then the other team will have a chance to have their opening statement.

194
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:05,850
And then what you're preparing with your group is the opening statement, key facts that you want to support your argument, not just opinions.

195
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:11,850
So this is a time when we're going to go digging and you can write these things down to reference to you when you're debating.

196
00:22:11,850 --> 00:22:19,860
The other team is like, well, you know, like 500,000 lives have been saved since the polio vaccine, blah, blah, blah, you know.

197
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,069
So we want to have them supported by facts.

198
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:30,060
So you usually want to queue up like a few key points based on what you predict the other team will say to you,

199
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:33,900
and then you're going to prepare a closing statement.

200
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:39,360
Okay. Does this is this clear to everybody what we're doing?

201
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:50,130
Okay. So, okay, how how will I pick who gets to flip the coin?

202
00:22:53,450 --> 00:23:02,770
Okay. Should I do a trivia question and whoever gets it right.

203
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,640
Okay. Who whose album is dropping this Friday?

204
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,070
Nobody knows. Okay. It says okay.

205
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:21,460
Okay. I'm looking very much forward to this.

206
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:28,100
Do you want to do heads or tails? And.

207
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:34,820
Okay. It's tails.

208
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:43,010
Okay. So, team two. Do you want pro mandate or anti mandate?

209
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:51,070
Confer among yourselves very quickly. You got to come back here.

210
00:23:51,170 --> 00:24:00,440
Okay. Pro. Okay, so team two, you are pro and team one.

211
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:09,920
You're in tie. All right, so I would go ahead and regroup amongst yourselves again,

212
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:16,400
pick the three people to represent the arguments your team work on your closing statements,

213
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:21,649
your key points that you plan to throw at the other team, and then your closing statement.

214
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:25,430
And then I'll check in with y'all when you are ready.

215
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,270
And then we will have a debate about this. Sound good?

216
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:33,994
Okay, go. Yes.

217
00:24:36,421 --> 00:24:40,151
That's it. Then I can have it.

218
00:24:40,491 --> 00:24:43,771
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think he wants to.

219
00:24:48,201 --> 00:24:54,651
Thank you. I'm running on section 30 and something over.

220
00:25:04,381 --> 00:25:09,861
With an interest in coming up with the candidates and jumping.

221
00:25:15,801 --> 00:25:34,241
The number three is encountered. Children are getting more doses now, which is something that I haven't.

222
00:25:35,591 --> 00:25:41,601
So this is another. It was a potential piece of information.

223
00:25:53,841 --> 00:25:57,251
All right. One minute. Oh. One more minute.

224
00:25:57,371 --> 00:26:49,521
One more minute. Which is really speculation.

225
00:27:00,211 --> 00:27:08,821
Okay. Let's give us time to actually debate what y'all have been discussing.

226
00:27:10,001 --> 00:27:22,021
Okay. Thank you. I know we're in, like, our little circles, but maybe we can, like, turn towards each other.

227
00:27:23,581 --> 00:27:32,281
You don't have to stand. I won't make you stand. So we are talking about polio vaccine mandates in Pakistan.

228
00:27:32,911 --> 00:27:37,541
Now we have t one pro mandates.

229
00:27:37,921 --> 00:27:42,211
We have team two into a mandate.

230
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:47,161
Okay, team one. Let's hear your opening statement.

231
00:27:51,451 --> 00:28:02,051
Yeah, everybody. So to start off with a very strong but quite strong opening statement.

232
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:13,621
Time is one of the two countries, including Afghanistan, where a wild polio type, polio virus type one transmission has never been interrupted.

233
00:28:14,141 --> 00:28:17,491
And that is obviously something a very serious concern.

234
00:28:17,911 --> 00:28:26,370
And it's important to note that Pakistan's inability to get rid of the polio vaccine puts overall international

235
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:39,481
eradication at risk despite neighboring countries like India and having had very successful polio eradication campaigns.

236
00:28:40,501 --> 00:28:50,731
Pakistan, unfortunately, has not been able to do the same, despite of multiple efforts from the Global Direct Eradication Initiative.

237
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:56,461
Just why we think mandates would help achieve global eradication.

238
00:28:57,001 --> 00:29:03,841
We're also talking in the point of view of a country that is essentially a breeding ground

239
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:12,221
for these viruses because of its lack of proper infrastructure and poor water and sand,

240
00:29:12,451 --> 00:29:26,851
water and sanitation, which is why essentially we think a mandate in polio vaccines would help would definitely help eradicate this deadly disease.

241
00:29:27,361 --> 00:29:33,601
Thank you. Team to your opening statement.

242
00:29:36,921 --> 00:29:44,601
If you want to work with me. So we just want to be clear that we are not against eradicating polio.

243
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:51,481
We recognize that Pakistan is one of the countries, one of the two countries in the world where polio is still endemic.

244
00:29:51,501 --> 00:29:51,860
However,

245
00:29:51,861 --> 00:30:05,871
we are against a vaccine mandate because as of today it has not been effective in eradicating polio in Pakistan as well as geopolitical interests

246
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:18,201
in the country have created with the US's use of our hepatitis program to increase or to use for geopolitical interests like terrorist activity.

247
00:30:18,411 --> 00:30:21,530
It's increased vaccine hesitancy in the country.

248
00:30:21,531 --> 00:30:27,561
We are also seeing lower rates of vaccination in rural areas, which is where most of the population live.

249
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:35,600
And so for this reason, we would propose an alternative which is investing in infrastructure that allows for clean

250
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:43,431
water and people to have better hygiene practices in order to eradicate or eradicate polio.

251
00:30:46,371 --> 00:30:50,751
Okay. Do either of you have another point to launch with the other team?

252
00:30:53,411 --> 00:30:59,231
Yes. So Pakistan's efforts were almost successful.

253
00:30:59,261 --> 00:31:05,560
They got down to one case before there was an increase in cases after COVID 19.

254
00:31:05,561 --> 00:31:12,551
So COVID distracted and took away the efforts that were put towards eradicating polio.

255
00:31:14,921 --> 00:31:22,751
Do you have anything to say to that? Yeah. I'm currently in Pakistan about about 3.5%.

256
00:31:25,811 --> 00:31:34,960
About 3.3% said they were. 10% of the GDP expenditure goes to health care infrastructure or health expenditure,

257
00:31:34,961 --> 00:31:38,741
which is less than the average for low and middle income countries in the world.

258
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:45,191
And there are other diseases such as heart disease, cancer and lower respiratory infections,

259
00:31:45,521 --> 00:31:53,981
which is a higher leading cause of death or requires or has a higher disease burden in the country.

260
00:31:53,981 --> 00:31:57,071
And so it makes sense that expenditure would go to these other issues,

261
00:31:57,071 --> 00:32:03,911
which is why we would say, rather than investing using health expenditure dollars on polio,

262
00:32:03,911 --> 00:32:10,841
we would recommend going there out of sanitation, which means from expenditure from other parts of the GDP to address transmission.

263
00:32:15,421 --> 00:32:27,481
So if we mandated, we would mandate the oral vaccine because it does not require health professionals or sterile syringes.

264
00:32:27,901 --> 00:32:34,981
So it would be easy to administer in mass vaccination and that would take the burden off

265
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:39,241
health care workers since they wouldn't need to be the ones to administer the vaccine.

266
00:32:40,171 --> 00:32:43,561
How many things say about the oral vaccine? Okay.

267
00:32:46,171 --> 00:32:51,401
So while oral vaccine is. Generally effective in.

268
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:56,630
Mean their indication efforts to polio.

269
00:32:56,631 --> 00:33:04,460
It's only going to be sufficient if over 80% of the population is vaccinated,

270
00:33:04,461 --> 00:33:15,351
which is the CDC's estimate of or like portion of the population needs to be vaccinated to reach herd immunity.

271
00:33:16,971 --> 00:33:22,481
A significant issue is that while urban areas in Pakistan.

272
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:36,601
Rich in this. Vaccination rates in the majority of Pakistan resides within rural areas where vaccination rates about 43%.

273
00:33:37,111 --> 00:33:47,911
And a significant issue of the oral vaccine is that it is a live attenuated virus and excreted on and on.

274
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:54,841
And if it's excreted in order to proliferate and wastewater, it's able to mutate.

275
00:33:55,671 --> 00:34:00,681
Result in the vaccine derived from the virus which causes of.

276
00:34:04,081 --> 00:34:08,461
In itself is causing more cases of polio.

277
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:13,081
The oral version of the pill also requires refrigeration,

278
00:34:13,171 --> 00:34:22,830
which means that these rural communities will need to have access to electricity refrigeration systems as well

279
00:34:22,831 --> 00:34:28,591
as global supply chain or supply chain issues of being able to reach the communities in the first place.

280
00:34:29,341 --> 00:34:35,851
Is it or one oral dose? Do we know three oral doses and it has to be typed.

281
00:34:36,571 --> 00:34:46,921
Okay. You'll have anything to say to that. You have another point.

282
00:34:46,921 --> 00:35:05,980
You went to lunch at them. What? So I think it was really touched upon following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2 to 1.

283
00:35:05,981 --> 00:35:15,071
Pakistan's increasing interest in the instability, particularly with regards to the.

284
00:35:17,761 --> 00:35:26,071
And these issues can come over one another, not only to result in political instability, but.

285
00:35:27,431 --> 00:35:32,601
Well, that's kind of interesting. Significant issues with inflation.

286
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:38,521
So while in theory the mass vaccination campaign.

287
00:35:40,611 --> 00:35:46,901
Looks like a very effective means to eradicate polio and really only be effective

288
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:52,461
if the region are currently going through the issues that it's faced with.

289
00:35:57,441 --> 00:35:58,911
Counterpoints from this group.

290
00:36:00,531 --> 00:36:07,371
I'm curious as to where these investments and the money for the investments in infrastructure for water and sanitation would come from.

291
00:36:08,271 --> 00:36:16,071
Pakistan is really striving to improve its ranking as it has, like the source expanding infrastructure in the entire world or in the region.

292
00:36:17,211 --> 00:36:22,610
In the region. And while there have been government investments, a lot of it has been in highways and power,

293
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:27,331
infrastructure and transportation to lead to better economic outcomes.

294
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:37,101
So I'm curious as to why the focus on water and sanitation with infrastructure money as opposed to highways, electricity and transportation.

295
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:46,741
It's those key points. They're kind of coupled as well when we see these like economic developments, real sea rent and infectious disease go down.

296
00:36:46,741 --> 00:36:50,641
So that's important. Key point. Also, bring it to the audience.

297
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:57,361
Mm hmm. Yeah. I have an idea where you would propose this money to come from.

298
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:04,351
If we aren't funding the mandate, we could divert those funds towards infrastructure as well.

299
00:37:05,101 --> 00:37:13,711
We also want to point out that this wouldn't just eradicate or reduce transmission of polio,

300
00:37:13,711 --> 00:37:21,651
but also other fecal oral diseases such as cholera, which is very endemic in Pakistan as well.

301
00:37:21,661 --> 00:37:26,161
So it's a way of addressing multiple diseases instead of just one, which would happen.

302
00:37:29,031 --> 00:37:38,901
Mm hmm. Does anyone have a dying point or fact that they want to say to the other group before we get to the closing argument?

303
00:37:44,971 --> 00:37:57,971
Okay. Why don't you close? Overall, polio is back in that category 27 of this year.

304
00:37:58,001 --> 00:38:03,551
Pakistan claims to be polio free for one year. Then April, an outbreak occurred affecting 11 people.

305
00:38:04,091 --> 00:38:10,221
One case is identified by a surveillance system might mean 1000 to 3000 polio infections in the community.

306
00:38:10,631 --> 00:38:23,111
Overall, we feel the need to continue to put efforts towards eradicating polio in Pakistan with mandate.

307
00:38:23,231 --> 00:38:32,620
Overall, we don't. Um. Overall, the the challenges of public health delivery due to the negative socio economic conditions and

308
00:38:32,621 --> 00:38:38,951
difficulty in geography need to be addressed and with education as well as widespread distribution.

309
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:49,610
We also feel that facilitating COVID 19 and facilitating eradication efforts and registration campaigns

310
00:38:49,611 --> 00:38:56,681
will only help the region to improve as well as help the infectious disease outcomes in that area.

311
00:38:57,521 --> 00:39:05,831
Thank you. Team to close it. We agree that polio is endemic in Pakistan and needs to be addressed.

312
00:39:05,831 --> 00:39:14,230
Have reason to believe that vaccines or vaccine mandate would be the most successful for these reasons for this are supply chain issues.

313
00:39:14,231 --> 00:39:20,531
The need for the vaccine to be refrigerated and not having an infrastructure currently with electricity.

314
00:39:20,921 --> 00:39:24,871
The high prevalence of under vaccination in rural areas,

315
00:39:24,881 --> 00:39:31,931
the fact that there need to be three doses of the oral vaccine in order for there to be a complete cycle,

316
00:39:32,861 --> 00:39:40,690
makes us feel that investing in infrastructure for one water and sanitary issues helps us to address the transmission

317
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:47,770
of polio as well as other people oral diseases that can be transmitted and allow the health infrastructure,

318
00:39:47,771 --> 00:39:53,441
which is already limited to focus on diseases that have a high burden in Pakistan.

319
00:39:54,431 --> 00:40:03,221
Great. Thank you. Both teams just took a very different turn and I thought this had a very different outcome than I thought it would.

320
00:40:03,521 --> 00:40:08,051
But because we chose Pakistan rather than the United States, obviously different arguments.

321
00:40:08,051 --> 00:40:14,531
But I would say I was surprised that there weren't any religious arguments brought into it potentially.

322
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:23,081
So now, regardless of which team you are on, then let's do a show of hands.

323
00:40:23,081 --> 00:40:27,251
If we based on the arguments again, it doesn't matter which team run.

324
00:40:27,521 --> 00:40:30,821
If you're 14 one stands or if you're from team two stance.

325
00:40:30,821 --> 00:40:36,811
Okay, team one stands. Raise your hand to the point.

326
00:40:37,181 --> 00:40:40,691
Yeah, your team like 91, team two stands.

327
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:46,531
I. Yeah, I. Mm hmm.

328
00:40:48,201 --> 00:40:52,801
Very interesting. How was this exercise? You should take a policy class.

329
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:56,901
Yeah. Why? What was this? A challenging exercise for you?

330
00:40:57,861 --> 00:41:03,171
For me? No, that's because this is what I really like to do.

331
00:41:03,171 --> 00:41:08,211
I generally try and choose the side I don't agree with and then figure out how they would spin the facts.

332
00:41:08,481 --> 00:41:12,211
Okay. Because then I know how to counter them if I'm ever on that.

333
00:41:12,651 --> 00:41:18,261
How about team one? Like the 25 year is kind of stressful.

334
00:41:19,011 --> 00:41:26,381
I like. Yeah. That's generally how long they give you the would would you do you see.

335
00:41:26,391 --> 00:41:29,901
Would you see you see the other team side. Okay.

336
00:41:31,611 --> 00:41:37,531
Worries and say yeah I just think it's hard to talk about mandates and laws in a country where you have no idea about their like,

337
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:43,911
governance structure and how we have so much time to become fluent in Pakistan.

338
00:41:45,381 --> 00:41:51,201
Yeah, and it's Page. If you had more time, what would you have looked up?

339
00:41:51,621 --> 00:41:55,161
So like we were talking about like the funding and I really feel that mandate

340
00:41:55,161 --> 00:41:59,121
because that means the country would give more funding to accomplish that.

341
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:04,850
So we, we didn't know like something specific and like also like the provinces,

342
00:42:04,851 --> 00:42:09,681
I wasn't sure like how Pakistan was like set up in terms of like their previous previous efforts.

343
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:15,361
Was it like province by province? And that's why they weren't successful from like a country wide thing because that's.

344
00:42:17,281 --> 00:42:21,541
It was a lot of the efforts were led by the Red Crescent.

345
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:27,841
A Red Cross equivalent over there, but then also the ministries of health and then like mutual aid.

346
00:42:28,111 --> 00:42:35,850
I am surprised that neither team brought up that these like community health

347
00:42:35,851 --> 00:42:40,561
workers essentially administering the polio vaccines were getting murdered,

348
00:42:41,671 --> 00:42:44,341
but for another time.

349
00:42:46,051 --> 00:42:55,770
But I mean, overall, I just wanted you all to stimulate to stimulate your thinking in terms of like crafting an argument from either side,

350
00:42:55,771 --> 00:43:02,451
but also potentially seeing a different perspective. So with that, we'll stop there for today.

351
00:43:02,461 --> 00:43:10,681
Just a reminder, again, the quizzes do. I made an announcement just now that your you can get up to ten bonus points on your

352
00:43:10,681 --> 00:43:17,431
participation for filling out your course evaluation and uploading that for the whole course.

353
00:43:17,431 --> 00:43:25,801
There's 50 points for participation so you can recruit recoup 20% of that just from filling out your course evaluation.

354
00:43:26,311 --> 00:43:31,771
And then, yes, that's all. And then Kane, please fill out that employment form for me.

355
00:43:33,181 --> 00:43:33,841
Did you get that?
