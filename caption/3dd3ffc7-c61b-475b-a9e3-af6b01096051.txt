1
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:39,800
Okay. Let's go ahead and get started. Good morning.

2
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,410
Good morning. Good morning. Can folks in the back hear me?

3
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,220
Okay, so, Mike. Good. Good morning, everyone.

4
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:59,379
Welcome to Public Health 382. I know some of you last semester when I lectured with Professor Cleary, but I'm Professor Neblett or Dr. Neblett.

5
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:04,780
Whatever you prefer. And I'll be your instructor for Public Health 382 this semester.

6
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:12,220
I use him his pronouns. And I'm really looking forward to working with you all this semester.

7
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,980
Uh, this is actually my third time teaching this course,

8
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,890
but the first time that the first day of class is actually in person, which is kind of strange.

9
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:27,909
Last year we were all McCarron and we weren't sure what we were doing.

10
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:33,040
And the first two weeks were, you know, remote.

11
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,420
And we ended up doing this hybrid sort of thing. Now we're in a different place.

12
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,580
We're starting in person. So I'm really excited about that. I love the energy of in-person.

13
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,930
We'll see what health has in store for us this semester as we move through.

14
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,420
But we will be starting out face to face. So welcome to the course.

15
00:01:52,660 --> 00:02:03,149
Really excited to have you all here. By the end of the semester, you will be well accustomed to seeing an agenda slide at the beginning of class,

16
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:06,630
which kind of walks you through what you should expect for the day.

17
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,000
So today we're going to do a little bit of housekeeping and introductions.

18
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,419
We'll do an exercise called Population Health Determinants and brainstorm where I'd like to hear a little

19
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,700
bit from you about what you're thinking about the course and what you want to study this semester.

20
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,310
We'll spend most of the time on the course syllabus.

21
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:34,230
I'm not going to read it word for word, but I do want to kind of go through a couple of things that I think are important,

22
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:40,380
give you an idea about the content of the course, and so we'll do quite a bit there.

23
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,040
This next time we're empty is a formation I want you to get used to seeing.

24
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:51,270
It will always tell you what is due for the next class period.

25
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,840
Okay. As I'll show you a little bit later, you can also find this on canvas under the modules.

26
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:03,990
It's set up by date and it will also show you what the assignments are for the next period.

27
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,170
Because I haven't published the canvas site yet, I'm not going to go into these details here.

28
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:16,710
But we will come back to this slide and I'll talk a little bit about what you should do for Monday.

29
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,200
Okay. All right.

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,710
So today's objectives are pretty straightforward.

31
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:30,370
What I want to do is kind of set and establish the tone for this class and the classroom environment.

32
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:39,190
I want to talk a little bit about who you'll be working with, introduce the teaching team this semester.

33
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,530
So we'll do that in just a short bit here.

34
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:48,400
And then, as I mentioned, already providing an introduction, an overview of the course and what you should expect.

35
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:52,570
We're not going to get into any lecturing or formal content today.

36
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,560
We'll begin with that on Monday. Okay.

37
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:05,920
So housekeeping should be pretty quick. Is there anyone in the class right now who is not formally registered?

38
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:15,800
Okay. Looks like everyone is registered. Once I publish the site, which I'll do in just a short moment, you should be able to access it.

39
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:21,260
If you have any difficulties or if there are any registration issues,

40
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:29,270
please see me after class or any of the teaching team and we just want to make sure that folks can access canvas.

41
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:34,580
And sometimes if you're not registered, it's hard to do that. So. Okay, so that's housekeeping check.

42
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,920
All right. Let's do some introductions.

43
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:45,890
I'll tell you a little bit about who I am professionally and a little personal, and then invite the teaching team to do the same.

44
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:53,480
So, Enrique Neblett, I am a professor of health, behavior and health education here at the School of Public Health.

45
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,230
And this is my fourth year here at Michigan as a faculty member.

46
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:01,490
I also did my Ph.D. here in the early 2000.

47
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:12,950
So Go Blue. I was at USC two unlikely schools, too, if you know the history, the basketball history.

48
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:21,679
But I was at USC for 11 years before I came here to Michigan in 2019, and it's been kind of weird,

49
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,489
I have to tell you, because since I came in 2019, there's not been like a normal year.

50
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:35,300
The pandemic happened at the end of the first year and then we were home 20, 20, 21 was kind of this weird hybrid thing.

51
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,480
And so this is my fourth year here, but I have not yet had a normal year, if you will.

52
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:51,980
But here we are. My research interests are broadly, as you'll hear throughout the semester in the area of racism and health.

53
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,700
We're going to be talking quite a bit about that this semester.

54
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:06,740
As a social determinants of health, I'm particularly interested in African-American or black American children, youth, adolescents, young adults.

55
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:15,530
And a lot of the work that my group has done focuses on race related experiences and mental health.

56
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:21,800
So my Ph.D. is actually in clinical psychology when I was here in the early 2000.

57
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:30,890
And so you're going to get a heavy dose more than you might in other classes in mental health in this course,

58
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:38,750
which I think is great because a lot of times in our public health classes, our mental health kind of gets pushed to the side.

59
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,870
And if you've been paying attention for the last couple of years,

60
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,629
you certainly recognize that mental health is something that a lot of people are talking

61
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:52,580
about and paying a lot more attention to than we were even three or four years ago.

62
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:58,700
So that will be an element that I'll bring to the class pictures here.

63
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:04,040
That's me in 1996 at graduation, just wanted to, you know, try to relate to you guys a little bit.

64
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,920
And there are some other pictures. This is a recent picture of my lab group.

65
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:14,690
I show this picture because I love students.

66
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:21,770
I love teaching, I love mentoring. It's the part of the work that I enjoy the most in the work that I do.

67
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:27,290
And hopefully you'll feel that. Just hear me say it throughout the semester,

68
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:35,180
but I want to strongly encourage you to visit me during office hours, get to know me throughout the semester.

69
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,600
However, I can support you all, even in this class and beyond letters of recommendation,

70
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,929
etc. I want to be able to do that, and the easiest way that I can do that is getting to know you.

71
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:54,380
So I'm going to be making an effort this semester to mill around a little bit before class starts.

72
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:59,690
If you're not in the mood to talk to doctor, you can just say, just let me know that.

73
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:08,210
No biggie, I won't take it personally, but I will be making an attempt to just kind of get to know you all in different ways throughout the semester,

74
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,950
in part because I really that's part of the job I enjoyed the most.

75
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,630
A couple of personal things in case there's some points of connection.

76
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:25,400
I grew up in New Jersey, East Orange. It's a predominantly African-American suburb of Newark, New Jersey, Essex County.

77
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:31,340
I'm a girl, dad. I've got two girls. These pictures are a bit outdated, but they're so cute.

78
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:37,549
I had to include them. I think they're cute. The my daughters are now in middle and high school.

79
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,840
So as you can tell, these pictures are outdated.

80
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,040
But I've got two, two girls. Big, avid football fan.

81
00:08:46,700 --> 00:09:00,330
Uh. The break was a bit difficult in that regard, but I, I played in middle and high school, so I've always been a fan of the sport.

82
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:07,049
Play piano. I'm a musician. Played. Trained classically since I was six.

83
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:17,340
Actually. So left to play in my spare time. I love lakes and beaches and anything water related, and I also love to eat sweets.

84
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:26,040
So you may see me eating cupcakes at 11:00 in the morning or something that I shouldn't be eating because I love sweets.

85
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:35,790
And so that's just a little bit about me. Again, I want to encourage opportunities to get to know you all personally.

86
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,940
We're going to show you a survey a little bit later on.

87
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,349
We'll be asking you for some personal things as you feel comfortable sharing.

88
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:50,370
I know folks have different levels of comfort there, but I hope that I will get to know you all as well throughout the semester.

89
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:58,260
All right. I mentioned there's a teaching team, so I'm the lead instructor, but there are three graduate student instructors for this course.

90
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:02,370
One is unable to be here with us today due to a family emergency,

91
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:07,980
but two of them are here and I'd like to invite them to come down and introduce themselves.

92
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:17,190
So welcome to Sheila and Aaron. And they're going to tell you a little bit about who they are and whatever they feel comfortable sharing.

93
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:25,260
And we've got the let me see you can I don't know if these are working, but I'd give that when I try.

94
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:31,480
You go first. Are you sure? So my name is dealer Raj.

95
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:37,150
I am a doctoral student in the Department of Health, Behavior and Health Education here at Michigan.

96
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,919
I have too many degrees that I don't know what to do with some time.

97
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,079
So I have a master's of divinity from Princeton Theological Seminary, which sounds really crazy,

98
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:52,400
but is more about religious studies and understanding how religion works in people's lives.

99
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,090
And then also a master's of public health here from Michigan and a MPA from the Ford School.

100
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:02,350
Most of my research is around spirituality and religion.

101
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:13,780
And let's see what else fun facts about me. So my whole family is from Michigan, my parents, etc. all live around here and we are all bird people.

102
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,910
So if you do office hours with me, at some point in time you may see my cockatoo join me.

103
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,960
If you're in Public Health 200 with me, at some point you might have seen my cockatoo on my shoulder.

104
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:29,380
I also have chickens and peacocks and great many other birds, but I also have two cats because they clearly go together.

105
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:34,870
Beyond that, I also love just playing board games and spending time with people that I care about and love.

106
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,920
And I look forward to meeting all of you if you haven't already in a different class.

107
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:45,890
And thanks for being here. Awesome. There's a lot in that thought.

108
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,600
Good morning, everybody. My name is Aaron Neal. My pronouns. Are he him?

109
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:54,400
Um, yes. So I am a doctoral candidate in the clinical psychology program.

110
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,560
Dr. Enrique Neblett is my research advisor. Yeah.

111
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:06,250
Really excited to be here working with you all. And some public health and teaching and public off of you are some personal effects.

112
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:09,340
So I am from North Carolina originally Wilmington, North Carolina.

113
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:13,780
So by the beach I went to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University,

114
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,480
which is a historically black college in Greensboro, North Carolina.

115
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:22,480
I then got my masters in Neuroscience and Education at Teachers College, Columbia University.

116
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,860
Yeah, I have a dog. His name is Tupac.

117
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:34,540
While he makes guest appearance via Barking.

118
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:41,500
If you ever come to my office hours on Zoom so there's a chance you might hear him in the background for fun.

119
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,430
These are do concerts. So if you see me at a concert, please say hi.

120
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,050
I'm. If not, I would like, scold you. Yeah.

121
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,890
And then also I do a lot of baking and cooking.

122
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:58,840
So you have recipes to swap. Would be happy open to those things.

123
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:06,100
Yeah, I think that's it. If you have questions, come back to office hours, virtual and or in person.

124
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:12,580
I'm going to do like a hybrid option so you can drop in via zoom or drop in in my office, which is in East Hall on the other side of campus.

125
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:20,750
Yeah, that's it. Awesome. Thank you, Aaron. We have one more GSA, as I mentioned, who's not here.

126
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:29,300
This is Jackie O. Jackie's a MPH student, and she will introduce herself when she's here on Monday.

127
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:35,750
She's coming back later today. Uh, this is my partner, uh, Dr. Nicole down here.

128
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:40,880
I forgot to mention her. She's actually a faculty member in the psychology department.

129
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,310
For those of you, if anyone's interested in language and literacy, you want to take a psych class.

130
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:50,540
Dr. Gardner Neblett is in psychology department.

131
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:54,380
Okay, so that's a little bit about us, our team.

132
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:01,000
Even though I am the lead instructor, you're going to hear from the GSA the semester.

133
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:05,780
They'll also be giving guest lectures as well in their areas of expertise.

134
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:10,970
And so hopefully it just won't be you hearing from me for the entire semester.

135
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:18,410
Okay. So this is my 15th year as a faculty member.

136
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:30,559
And one of the common things that I do on the first day of class, a little idiosyncratic, is I don't post to the syllabus or campus.

137
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,890
I see some heads shaking, so I guess people don't like that.

138
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,840
So no one's ever complained about it too much.

139
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,880
People usually let me slip with it.

140
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:50,690
The reason I do that is because I kind of like to see what people think the course is actually going to be about and what they're

141
00:14:50,690 --> 00:15:01,620
expecting to study during the semester lets me get a little bit of an idea of what you think you're signing up for and what you know.

142
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:09,350
Sometimes I make adjustments based on things that I hear, so the tasks for now and then I will post the syllabus in just a second.

143
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:17,000
We're going to do a little bit of a popcorn style. I just want to know answers to either or both of these questions.

144
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:29,420
What comes to mind when you think about population health determinants and disparities and or what do you expect we're going to cover this semester?

145
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,900
Okay, so we're just a toss or pass the mikes around.

146
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:38,240
You will get used quickly before you give a response.

147
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:44,780
You will disrupt the flow a little bit. Please say your name. So as an example, my name is Enrique.

148
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:54,330
One word that comes to mind is. Racism or something else.

149
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:58,870
You and we'll just do this for a couple rounds and see what what folks are talking about.

150
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,790
So don't be shy. One word is fine and we'll see.

151
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:08,110
So words that come to mind. Okay. We have a taker here.

152
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,359
Oh, I was. Hi. My name is Nia.

153
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:18,190
I was going to actually answer the second one, but for like we're going to talk about mental health disparities just because you mentioned it earlier.

154
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:27,010
Okay. So mental health disparities. And when you think about mental health disparities, tell me a little bit more about what you mean by disparities.

155
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:33,100
And I just think of like access and resources that are available for people to seek help such as therapy.

156
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,300
Okay. Disparities in access. Great. Let's keep it going. Thank you.

157
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,740
And someone else. Don't be shy. Let up and we've got another.

158
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:47,280
Yep. Hi. My name is Camille. And one word that comes to mind is built environment.

159
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:52,120
Built environment. Okay, so you think we're going to be talking about the built environment?

160
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:57,040
Any examples of when you say built environment or things you're particularly interested in?

161
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,219
When I think about build environment, I think about like access to greenspace.

162
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,970
So if people have walkable paths or if they're somewhere they can ride a bike or things like that.

163
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:15,670
Okay. Green space. Great. Thank you. I think I saw a go ahead.

164
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,090
Whoever has the. Hi, I'm Adler.

165
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:24,429
The first thing I thought about was also kind of related to that, but it was social determinants of health,

166
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:30,219
maybe such as genetics or socioeconomic status or interactions with the environment,

167
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:38,560
whether it be the resources you have around you or the way in which certain pollutants affect your health or things such as that.

168
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:43,380
Okay. Thank you. Who's next on Mike?

169
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:50,549
Hi. My name is Libby, and I think of money not only in terms of how people can access care and the financial means that they have,

170
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:56,550
but also in where money is going to research and the medical facilities that may be in a community.

171
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:01,680
Okay. Thank you, Libby. So where is the money going? Where the resources going?

172
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:05,550
And presumably will be. There's some disparities there. Who else?

173
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,940
Hi, my name is Farrah. And what I think of is access to health care and then also access to healthy food options.

174
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:16,140
Okay, healthy food. We're going to talk about that.

175
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,230
So access again coming up. Healthy food options.

176
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,940
Thank you for that. Others. Yes. I see your hand over here.

177
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,210
While we're waiting. Anyone over here? Get my steps in the day.

178
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,680
Okay. Bear with us for a second. You've got to much.

179
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:43,700
So, hi, my name is Rachel. And when I think about population health determinants and disparities, I think of a historical context.

180
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:57,170
Okay, so like, if somebody has like a distrust in a certain health care system or if they have, people are more prone to certain diseases.

181
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:02,510
Okay. I'd say a little bit more people more prone to certain diseases.

182
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:07,460
Tell me a little bit more about what you so like in a or an example.

183
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,920
Like I know there's like a wheel and it's like the risk factors for certain

184
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,190
people are like different and like what's modifiable and what's non modifiable.

185
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:23,960
So in the non modifiable like some people have a family history of like diabetes

186
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,170
or like cardiovascular disease which could be linked to race or ethnicity.

187
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:42,800
Okay, great. Thank you. So race, ethnicity, you started out talking a little bit about what sounded to me like sort of mistrust, cultural mistrust.

188
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:47,560
Good. I see a hand here. And you had the go ahead.

189
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:54,560
Yeah. So I'm Caitlin and I guess like words that kind of come to mind are kind of similar to that where it's a lack of understanding,

190
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:59,750
where like people don't really understand beyond their own personal communities maybe.

191
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,220
And it makes it hard to like battle inequity between populations.

192
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:08,340
Okay, lack of understanding. When can you give an example?

193
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,810
When you say lack of understanding what an example might be of that?

194
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,260
Yeah.

195
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:20,749
So from like my personal background identify as Asian and I feel like I may not fully empathize or understand what someone who may identify as black,

196
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:26,720
for example, is going through. And that kind of imbalance in my understanding of what's going on in their respective

197
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:33,230
contexts makes it hard for me to fully understand how to help them in the best way possible.

198
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,000
Okay, good. So cultural understanding being a contributing factor?

199
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:41,200
Yes, please. We have someone in the back after you're done. Hello.

200
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:48,020
My name is Alex. I feel like what I think about population health, performance and disparities is something that comes to mind as education.

201
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:57,620
Good education disparities. The different types of opportunities that we have in the public school system definitely goes is a big factor,

202
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:06,080
not only social determinants of health, but what opportunities can children receive to better their life post after post post-graduation?

203
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:13,820
Okay, great. Thank you for that. We'll definitely be talking about education next month in just a few weeks in the back, please.

204
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:21,799
My name is Ashley and one topic that I think of is the health insurance system, especially here in the United States,

205
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:28,960
are we don't have a universal health care system and the differences and our public and private systems.

206
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:34,040
Okay. Health insurance. Good. Will definitely be talking about that.

207
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,169
That is relevant to some of the issues of access. Good.

208
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,370
Any others that we haven't heard yet, folks want to add to this?

209
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:47,200
Yes. A little here, please. Sorry to.

210
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,010
Hello. My name is Donny and I was thinking as well.

211
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:58,459
Cultural norms and stereotypes, people with different backgrounds will be more prone to do things compared to others.

212
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,490
Maybe. Okay. Stereotypes.

213
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:04,750
Cultural norms. Uh.

214
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:12,690
Any Donny, any examples come to mind? So I think, for example, like my family's from Bosnia.

215
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:19,320
And so things that we may consider within our sphere of normal regards to health may be different than someone else.

216
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,620
So, for example, for us, we're like we're known to be pretty stubborn people.

217
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:28,140
So going to the doctor may be the last thing we want to do versus other people who may their first instinct may be, go to the doctor.

218
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,610
Okay, great. Okay. That's a good example. All right.

219
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:36,700
One or two more. We have someone in the next. Sorry.

220
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:46,950
My name is Amelia. And one topic that I think that we might cover is maternal mortality and the like disparities,

221
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,280
particularly among, like racial groups like black Americans in particular.

222
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:59,850
Okay. Thank you. So maternal mortality and racial disparities, I think, in the area of maternal deaths.

223
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:04,889
I certainly. You mentioned that. Yes, please. My name is Brianna.

224
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:10,530
And I think we'll talk about how racism kind of correlates to each of these topics.

225
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:17,100
Okay. So Brianna's saying racism, which I don't think probably won't surprise anyone given what I study.

226
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,140
We might talk about that this semester,

227
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:27,180
but one of the reasons we'll talk about it is because it undergirds a lot of thinking about social determinants of health,

228
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:31,170
structural determinants of health, etc., as we'll see in the next few weeks.

229
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,819
These are great. Any others before transition?

230
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:39,300
Yes. That is going to be good, I can tell.

231
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,880
Dr. Neville I was going to suggest disability OC disability.

232
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:50,820
Thank you for that, Aaron. I come back and ask you in a second what you mean by that.

233
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,080
Hi. Wish I was also going to say disability. Oh, I'm sorry.

234
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,500
I don't have anything else to add. Well, tell me what you mean by disability.

235
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:06,510
I was thinking, like, all tech. Well, I guess that's a whole other issue, too.

236
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:13,020
Is kind of like invisible disabilities, because I think a lot of times the connotation with disability is like physical.

237
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,130
But there's also a lot of disabilities that aren't physical or are,

238
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:21,990
are aren't necessarily like visible as physical disabilities, like autism, for example.

239
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:30,540
Not always visible, but it still is a disability. And there's a lot of disparities in health outcomes seen with those types of disabilities as well.

240
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,410
Okay, good. Thank you for that. Aaron, anything you want to add?

241
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:40,680
No, I think you put it perfectly. Maybe one thing I think of disability as an outcome,

242
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:47,430
but it's because of some of the determinants of health are some of the choices that we've made at a structural level that we've created,

243
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:56,069
like these mass disabling events or that folks that were having like increases in disability and also

244
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:00,030
thinking about accessibility in like how we create societies of thinking about built environment,

245
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:06,840
thinking about how we socialize people and how they interact and engage with people who experience disability.

246
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:15,750
OC Other stuff. So structural factors, we've been talking a lot about structures and how they contribute to disparities or social determinants.

247
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,520
Think about accessibility. Good. All right.

248
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:24,240
I think this is good. Anything you want to add? Okay.

249
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:34,050
All right. So fantastic. This is a type of thing we'll do from time to time in terms of what we're going to study this semester.

250
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,220
Many of these things here are on the syllabus.

251
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,030
There are still a couple of topics which I'm always glad about that nobody mentioned that we're also going to study.

252
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:48,690
So one that just comes to mind, for example, is thinking about police violence.

253
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:58,230
We're going to read a book this semester, Enforcers the Guardians, which is about ending police violence.

254
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,340
So got a public health primer to ending police violence.

255
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,730
So we'll talk about that throughout the semester.

256
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:16,500
We had a couple of guest lectures last year where folks were thinking about technology and AI as a social determinant of health,

257
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:26,219
access to the Internet, etc. I have asked that particular speakers defending their dissertation this semester and can't return,

258
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:33,270
but has suggested a guest speaker who's going to come and spend some time with us, probably in March or April.

259
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:38,400
So that's another topic that we'll get to as well.

260
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,110
Okay. So great introduction. Let's.

261
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:47,830
Keep it moving here and talk about the syllabus.

262
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:53,530
All right. So we go ahead and publish the site.

263
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:03,320
But I did it. Is it all right? This is 22.

264
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,230
We want 23. Me one second here.

265
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:22,160
Okay. Let's go and use that. Okay.

266
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:28,170
So. Should be available now.

267
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:35,440
What I'm going to do for the next couple of minutes is spend some time on the syllabus.

268
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:39,120
I'm not going to read everything verbatim, but a couple of things I want to highlight.

269
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:48,649
And then we'll see where we're at after that. So this is our for the course introduction, the ways you can reach me by email.

270
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:57,960
I'll try to respond within 24 hours. I was one social media handle for as long as it last is there and then office hours.

271
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,270
So a quick announcement. Office hours this week will be by appointment.

272
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:06,780
So if you. There's only two days left, I guess.

273
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,680
But if you'd like to meet with any of us, please just send us an email.

274
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:19,139
You'll learn shortly that you're kind of assigned to a GSI by your last name, but you can meet with anyone at any time.

275
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:29,400
So I generally encourage folks to try and meet with your instructor, one of us, at least once during the semester.

276
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:36,300
We will do this. Let me show you. Here can be one second.

277
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:42,100
Okay. Da da da da da.

278
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:53,740
Here we are. Once things get going in the way we did this last year is that you can schedule an appointment right through the canvass website.

279
00:28:55,180 --> 00:29:02,709
Starting next week. Okay. So we'll have all of the GSA hours kind of linked to Google Calendar and we generally

280
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,940
set these up in ten minute blocks and this worked very well last semester.

281
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:13,599
So it's low stakes. You shouldn't feel like you have to, you know, come and spend an hour with us or anything like that if you want to.

282
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,980
Great. If you want more than 10 minutes, you'd signed up for multiple spots.

283
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:25,600
You're probably familiar this with this from other classes, but I'll show you on Monday how to do that again.

284
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:31,690
Encouraged folks, if you want to meet with us or whatever reason quickly this week, just shoot us an email.

285
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:42,550
All right. All right. So that's that the GSA is in the process of giving me they're determining what their hour will be.

286
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:45,429
We all will be available by appointment.

287
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:51,850
So if the hours don't work for you, you hopefully across four people, there should be someone that works for you.

288
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:58,660
But we are always available by appointment if a time that we have office hours doesn't work for you.

289
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:04,720
So there should not be any issues in terms of availability or access to the instructional team.

290
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,259
Okay. I'm going to skip over some of this.

291
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:17,510
One of the assignments for Monday is to carefully read through the syllabus because I'm not going to go through it verbatim today.

292
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:27,440
All right. Course description. So all of the things that you all started talking about here are right on track.

293
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:34,190
People often think about this course as the social determinants of health course.

294
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:39,050
Okay. Sometimes people come into this course thinking, gosh, I took 200.

295
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,430
What else could there possibly be to know about social determinants of health?

296
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,750
Some of you may be actually thinking that without fail,

297
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:53,239
the overwhelming majority by the end of the semester report that they actually

298
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,380
added a lot more to their understanding of social determinants of health.

299
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:04,459
And so while you've had some introduction to what the social determinants of health are in this class,

300
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,050
we want to add some layers of complexity to it, some nuance.

301
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:19,800
How does the intersection of different socio demographic variables like race, gender identity, how do those things shape the built environment?

302
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:23,240
How do those things the access to care, etc.?

303
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:32,660
Okay, so while some of the basic topics may be familiar, our goal in this class is to add on another level of understanding,

304
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,980
to sort of take you to the next level beyond the surface.

305
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:46,280
By the end of the semester, my hope is that you will feel confident in talking about social determinants of health

306
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:52,160
and the different all of the cultural factors that shape determinants of health.

307
00:31:52,490 --> 00:32:01,220
But not just broadly. I want you to be able to speak to them at the level of what are the cultural factors that shape food insecurity,

308
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:06,120
what are the factors that influence access to health care and so on and so forth.

309
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:16,430
So again, building on what you already know, maybe sort of familiarity with what the basic concepts are and adding a level of complexity.

310
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,210
So really think about as the first paragraph says here,

311
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:28,580
what are the social and environmental factors that impact diseases, susceptibility and vulnerability across populations?

312
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:34,670
When you read it this weekend or before Monday, there are some specific learning goals to pay attention to.

313
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,790
Again, I'm not going to go through those because I don't think that's helpful, but definitely check this out before Monday.

314
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:45,340
Okay. Let's talk about course format. Monday.

315
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:53,800
Wednesday. 80 minutes. And by 20 past noon lecture someone I tend to be interactive.

316
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,310
So a lot of the type of activity we did a short while ago,

317
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,740
I'm not going to lecture you for 80 minutes and we'll probably do a more kind of conversational.

318
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:11,740
We'll be in-person occasionally we will if circumstances I'm out of town or our guest speaker,

319
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:19,870
I have a lot of guest lecturers are out of town and we will have a remote session, but the overwhelming majority of classes will be in-person.

320
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:25,810
We will do break out activities in class. There's a fair amount of group work.

321
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:32,490
Sometimes we'll do that here in this room. Sometimes we have overflow rooms where groups may go.

322
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:41,650
Next Wednesday, for example, we're doing an exercise where I may invite folks to go to another space, but we'll largely use this space.

323
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,330
It's not very group friendly, but it actually worked out, has worked fine.

324
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:53,950
Last year we were able to make it work pretty well. So that will be what what we're doing there.

325
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:00,520
Class recordings a worried about that I'm going to attempt to record the class meetings whenever possible.

326
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:05,829
I encourage you to attend class whenever possible.

327
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:13,570
You're going to learn more that way. But if there's a circumstance where you know something comes up, you're ill or you can't make it to class,

328
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:22,120
you'll just need to contact one of us and we will make the recording available to you.

329
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,919
In fact, I may post them on the website a meeting with the teaching team after class,

330
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:32,620
and we'll decide how we're going to handle that, whether we'll just put it on the site or it's by request.

331
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,979
So stay tuned on that cameras. I'm not going to focus on.

332
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:42,490
That's more kind of when there's a remote meeting. All right. Of course, materials, three books for the course.

333
00:34:43,390 --> 00:34:50,290
Don't panic. All of the books are available by download through the university library.

334
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:55,420
So these are two of the books, the Social Determinants of Mental Health.

335
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:59,350
And I already mentioned from enforcers to guardians.

336
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:10,720
If you prefer a hard copy, you can certainly use your preferred provider to request either of these books.

337
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:15,309
But all of the reading that you need is on the canvas website.

338
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:21,880
So, for example, in the third book that I don't have, you're supposed to read chapter one for Monday.

339
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:26,529
That link is already on the on the website under the modules.

340
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:31,390
So there is no need to purchase any book for this course.

341
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,460
Textbooks are very expensive.

342
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:42,310
If you do want to do that and you prefer to have a hard copy, you have the titles of the books here and you're certainly welcome to do so.

343
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:52,160
Okay. All right. Let's talk a little bit about the course requirements and here I'll get a little bit more detail.

344
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,590
But again, I'm not going to be read verbatim. Regular attendance and participation strongly encouraged.

345
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:05,380
Of course, evaluation is going to be based on a couple of things that I'm going to talk about in a second.

346
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:10,990
It used to be that we graded participation maybe the first time I taught this.

347
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:17,500
With the pandemic and all those sorts of things and best practices, it's no longer,

348
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:23,170
in my view, a good idea to grade students on class participation for a number of reasons.

349
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:29,650
So we won't do that here. Our expectation is that you come and you engage on as much as possible.

350
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:35,070
What we did do last year is throughout the semester we use the format.

351
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:43,540
When you make a comment, say who you are. The GSEs do kind of kind of track who is making comments in class.

352
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:51,340
And the way that we use that is at the end of the semester, if you're in a borderline situation, we will.

353
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:55,300
And you've been someone who's been really, you know, sort of present in participation.

354
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:59,709
We will kind of bump your grade up or give you the benefit of the doubt.

355
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:05,550
If you have a rough exam or something like that, we'll try to use it to help you out in that respect.

356
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:12,190
Okay, so that's the way we do it. There are lots of different ways to participate.

357
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,780
One of the things not on my slides is that I'm an introvert by nature.

358
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:23,260
When I was an undergrad, I was in the back of the room. Never would ever speak in a class of this size.

359
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,650
So some of you feel very comfortable doing that.

360
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:31,719
Others of you may not. There are lots of different ways that we track participation.

361
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:36,140
So come to office hours, send us an email with a question.

362
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:42,489
Let us know what you're thinking about. We're going to be discussing at our meeting this afternoon possibly having a class

363
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:48,910
online forum where you can anonymously ask questions and things of that nature.

364
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:52,840
There will be lots of opportunities to participate.

365
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:56,230
So even if you don't speak in class, that's okay.

366
00:37:56,260 --> 00:38:04,030
You may feel comfortable speaking in a smaller group, etc. but I want to encourage you to find whatever ways you feel most comfortable with.

367
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,380
Okay. So that's some general notes on attendance and participation.

368
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:14,940
If you are going to be away for an extended period, please inform me or your assigns.

369
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:22,570
Yes, I. All right. There are a number of different assignments for this class.

370
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:27,760
All of the details or introduction to the details are here.

371
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:32,100
But I don't want to overwhelm you with a bunch of details.

372
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,230
So what I'm going to do, instead of reading this verbatim,

373
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:45,700
is I'm going to just give you in my own words what each task is or assignment without looking at the notes here.

374
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:48,910
So group journal in my own words.

375
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:55,930
First, five or six weeks of the class, you are already been randomly assigned to a group through canvas.

376
00:38:56,590 --> 00:39:04,930
On Wednesday morning you will have to share kind of a brief response to what has happened in the past week.

377
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:08,229
Okay, so I don't know how many words it is. It's there.

378
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:14,320
But the idea is you write something posted to your group, do by 11:00 on Wednesday morning,

379
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:24,550
and then by Friday night at midnight, you are expected to respond to one or two people in your group.

380
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:29,470
Okay. That constitutes a weekly journal.

381
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:34,899
Okay. This is just to get you some discussion around what folks are thinking about,

382
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:40,420
what they're hearing in class, and an opportunity for you to learn from your peers.

383
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:48,549
Okay. I always am nervous that folks are going to hate the journals or think it's like busy work or something, and that has never happened.

384
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:55,860
People really enjoy and take this quite seriously and so that's what will happen.

385
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:02,380
We only do it for the first half of the semester. We drop one of the courses, sometimes of courses, one of the grades,

386
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:07,090
because sometimes it takes people a little bit of time to figure out how to do this.

387
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:10,530
As you'll hear me say, it's not just summarizing.

388
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:19,540
Oh, you know, Professor Neblett said blah, blah, blah, but we really want to see your thoughts and thinking about what we are talking about in class.

389
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:24,010
Okay. We want to see you relate it to your personal experience.

390
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:30,850
And these are very short responses. So we're not talking about a very long idea, but that's the group journal.

391
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,530
Okay. Again, details, more details coming.

392
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:42,729
All right. Next assignment is something we call a glossary.

393
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:48,790
Okay? Most people everyone knows what a glossary is. You are going to create your own glossary.

394
00:40:49,690 --> 00:41:01,899
You are going to pick 4 to 6, I should say 3 to 6 terms that you want to get to know a little bit better, that you want to study.

395
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:08,320
Maybe it's something you've always wondered about but you're not sure about, and you're going to create your own glossary.

396
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:16,150
Imagine that there's someone who doesn't know what a term is and you want to explain it to them again,

397
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:22,510
related to population health disparities, and you're going to create a glossary of the terms.

398
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:29,560
Okay, this exercise is meant to give people an opportunity to bring in some innovation and creativity.

399
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:38,500
So if you want, you can just kind of do text definitions related personally, and we'll talk about it.

400
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:42,219
But folks have had a lot of fun with this exercise.

401
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:51,549
Some folks have done cartoons, some folks have done drawings to do their their glossary assignment.

402
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,240
I try to pull and these will be posted later.

403
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:00,069
Some examples here. People that gave me permission.

404
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:06,420
So you can see I started out with kind of one that's just text.

405
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,649
Okay, so and it starts out basic.

406
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:15,550
There are some things unemployment, underemployment, rates related, stress, etc. That's sort of the traditional way you could do it.

407
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:26,770
And as we scroll down a little bit, you'll see this student here drew a graphic to sort of illustrate their understanding of food deserts.

408
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:30,290
Okay. We'll keep scrolling down a little bit more.

409
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:33,510
Someone used a PowerPoint slide from lecture.

410
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:43,840
We'll see that very soon here. And someone drew a time line thinking about social determinants of health in history, so on and so forth.

411
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:53,380
So you see a lot of drawings here, some true internalized racism, a kind of graphic comic.

412
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:59,440
You get the idea here. It's meant to be kind of have a little bit of fun with it.

413
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:07,299
Okay. Some people this assignment, there's usually like a some people like love this assignment and then other people are like,

414
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,010
I want you to tell me what to do.

415
00:43:09,010 --> 00:43:17,110
And if you like to know exactly what to do, this assignment presents a little bit of a challenge because I want you to kind of,

416
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:22,450
you know, free form, be artistic if that's you, etc.

417
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:28,660
Okay. By the way, if this isn't new and you're not into drawing, you can still do well on the assignment.

418
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:35,170
So don't panic. I'll scroll through this just to see if there are any other examples that jump out.

419
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:44,850
Some pictures here. Someone needs Uber to illustrate transportation disparities.

420
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,910
What else? See? See. Lots of colors here.

421
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:54,350
Someone underemployment came up with their own graphic here.

422
00:43:55,580 --> 00:44:03,110
Anyway, you get the point and these will all be posted eventually. But I just wanted you to get an idea of what the glossary assignment is about.

423
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:06,620
Oh, SNAP. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

424
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:12,340
Okay. So that's the glossary going back to the syllabus here.

425
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,080
The midterm, I'm not a big fan of exams.

426
00:44:16,170 --> 00:44:20,190
So 15%, you can see it's not a large part of the grade.

427
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:26,700
The last two years we've done this through canvas and we'll see what we do this year.

428
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:35,159
It may be in person, it may not be, but it just kind of tests the application of the material over the first half of the course.

429
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:44,190
It's right before spring break, the Wednesday before spring break. Fair warning in case we do do it remotely.

430
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:51,830
Last year, folks, the exam was available on Wednesday and folks had until the Friday night to submit it.

431
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,630
So if you're planning to go away for spring break and it is remote, you may want to prepare accordingly.

432
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:07,020
I have not done my due diligence this year in terms of coordinating with your other classes to see when the exam schedule is when you have exams.

433
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:12,060
Last year, the midterm fell right around the time of another exam.

434
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,270
And so I. I made an adjustment, so I'll check in on that.

435
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:22,710
But you should know that there's an exam coming, a small exam in in February.

436
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:26,870
Okay. Reaction papers.

437
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,980
Got two reaction papers. One is a response to the book.

438
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:39,910
So I'm going to ask you to write two pages about your reaction to the book and what you think about it.

439
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:44,150
Why some people really enjoy this book.

440
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:52,530
Some people don't like it. The assignment is designed for you to react until you have that reaction to it.

441
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,640
Some people think the authors fell way short of their goals.

442
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:01,940
I might be in that camp, but I still think it's a good book for some.

443
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:11,820
Some thought so. The assignment will ask you to, you know, kind of bring in class discussion with your own thoughts about the book.

444
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:18,870
Two pages. Pretty, pretty straightforward. The other reaction paper will be do on the last day of class.

445
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:24,940
It's actually a reaction paper in quotes because it's actually going to be another journal assignment.

446
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:33,430
You're just going to submit it through a canvas and you write about 200 words about your reaction to the course.

447
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,480
What have you learned? What? How has your thinking changed?

448
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:38,610
What are things you're still wondering about?

449
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:45,630
Obviously, there's only so much you can do in 200 words, but it's just a very quick kind of reflection on the semester,

450
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:51,150
so it will not approach to pages by any stretch of the imagination.

451
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:57,600
I do find that many people tend to write more than the bare minimum for that last assignment

452
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,970
because they are excited about what they've learned and want to talk about the course.

453
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,410
Okay. All right. So that's that. And then there's one more thing left.

454
00:47:08,850 --> 00:47:17,459
Have you spoken to folks in the senior cohort? You know that there is a interaction group project assignment for this course.

455
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:25,170
So your same group journal journal group that you've been randomly assigned to and will be responding to,

456
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:31,079
you're going to work over the course of the semester on a group project together in which you

457
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:39,569
produce a product that's redundant on something related to social determinants of health.

458
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:45,270
So early on in the semester, you're all going to get together and think about what you'd like to do,

459
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:56,790
and we're going to produce a class website with all of the projects that sort of summarize the different things that people are talking about.

460
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,250
Hey, now I tried. I'm.

461
00:48:04,180 --> 00:48:08,620
Let me see here, I think. If I go under modules.

462
00:48:08,620 --> 00:48:11,920
Let's see if this works. Oh, it's already up.

463
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:15,639
So here's the website for Monday.

464
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:19,630
I told you to sort of skim this. The link is posted on canvas.

465
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:30,250
These are the projects from last year. So just to give you an idea of some of the different things that people looked at.

466
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,880
Residential segregation, gender affirming care.

467
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:42,820
Some one of the groups created an Instagram account where they focused on vaccines, so on and so forth.

468
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:49,210
Common Topics. A lot of people love. The food insecurity topic is popular among college students.

469
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:57,370
We had some around mental health and so on and so forth, and I'll just randomly pick a couple of these so you can see.

470
00:49:00,270 --> 00:49:09,690
What people did. There's a written component that goes with the residential segregation, gender affirming care and help determinants.

471
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:14,820
Okay, so they had this link here. Here's this group.

472
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:18,720
Notice they have tabs. So this is a well research project.

473
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:28,320
It is a semester long project. This group focused on gender affirming care and they sort of focused on these different topics here.

474
00:49:28,350 --> 00:49:34,890
Okay. If we go back here and trying to find one, that's the Instagram account.

475
00:49:36,230 --> 00:49:42,200
Uh, these folks did like a Presley presentation focusing on gun violence.

476
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:50,910
Mental health here. Infographics is another common thing that people did as part of their final project.

477
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:59,650
And I'll show you a couple more here. This group actually did a podcast that was another common approach.

478
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:10,079
There were probably about a third of them were podcasts, where they did episodes focusing on different aspects of their topic, so on and so forth.

479
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:18,360
You can look through these. Over the weekend, some folks interviewed people, professors, people in the community.

480
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:27,630
Some people did photo voice projects where they took pictures of their topic and used a methodology known as photo voice.

481
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:31,560
But the emphasis here is really on creativity.

482
00:50:32,340 --> 00:50:36,090
And folks come up with some really amazing, as you will see, products.

483
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:41,640
So by the end of the semester, that's what you will produce, will collated on a website,

484
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:49,710
and then we'll share the website with the local community and invite people to engage with with the projects.

485
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:58,930
Okay. A. And I lost my place here.

486
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:05,500
All right, so that's that. Let me pause here again.

487
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:13,690
More details forthcoming on each of the assignments. One of the things you can do, I believe, on the published website under the assignments.

488
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:20,440
All of the assignments for the semester are available there so you can start looking through them.

489
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:26,710
The description of the glossary assignment, the description of the final project, it's all there.

490
00:51:27,790 --> 00:51:37,390
You will have a group project proposal, do and march where you kind of share with the teaching team what your group is thinking about.

491
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:45,290
And we'll give you some feedback and say, great, or maybe not, you know, in terms of your idea.

492
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:45,830
Okay.

493
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:54,150
The other thing I'll mention is there will be some class time to work on the group project and we'll have a couple of class periods where we'd say,

494
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,510
Go work on your group project.

495
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:05,710
Uh, there's actually one extra class this semester than there was in previous years, so we'll probably use that for you to work on your projects.

496
00:52:06,670 --> 00:52:10,750
But it's not the type of thing where you'll be able to get it all done in class.

497
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:17,230
Um, you will likely spend a fair amount of time on this outside of class.

498
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:25,720
All right. Let me pause there. Any questions on the assignments?

499
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:33,100
Hopefully seeing some of the examples. Helps you, but what questions do you have on the assignments and the assessments?

500
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:44,710
Seeing some knows anyone. Okay.

501
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:48,580
I imagine you will have more as the semester progresses.

502
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:55,300
We will introduce each of these as we go through the semester at the appropriate time with more detail.

503
00:52:55,690 --> 00:53:02,530
But again, for those of you, I had some very ambitious students last year who wanted to start working on their glossary right away.

504
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:08,470
The the assignment is available in the description on the page.

505
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:17,010
Okay. A couple of other things I want to mention. Again, I'm not going to read verbatim GSA.

506
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:24,540
As I mentioned here, you'll see you have a contact GSA by your last name here.

507
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,480
As I said earlier, you don't have to contact that person. You're welcome to meet with me.

508
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:34,020
I will say that last year and this is expected,

509
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:40,860
a lot of folks came to my office hours and didn't come to the GSA office hours unless they needed something.

510
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:47,240
But I want to strongly encourage you to meet to use the office hours.

511
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:52,230
It's a good way. These are really great people, really knowledgeable, fine, as you heard earlier.

512
00:53:53,040 --> 00:54:02,879
So don't hesitate to use them as a resource. When I do write letters of recommendation and we will often kind of cosign the letters,

513
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:10,080
and if you've been working with a particular GSA, we'll ask them for their input on working with you over the course of the semester.

514
00:54:10,110 --> 00:54:19,920
So again, just a gentle nudge to encourage you to meet with your GSA grade appeals is straightforward and not going to spend time on that.

515
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:25,950
Two points to highlight for due dates and late assignments. We try to be pretty reasonable.

516
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,700
If you have a documented excuse, you're good.

517
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:39,570
Where it gets trickier is if you give an excuse and you can't actually show documentation and there's no way I know if that's really true or not.

518
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:48,900
Then we get into a little bit of a gray area. So in general, five points a day taken off if things are late.

519
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:52,410
Canvas, as you know, will mark something if it comes in after the deadline.

520
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:58,710
But in general, this is not a problem. Most folks are on timely with their working assignments.

521
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:03,330
We do as it says. One thing I do want to highlight. Stuff comes up.

522
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:10,499
If you have something come up over the course of the semester, we do permit one kind of delay.

523
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:16,640
No questions asked sort of thing, no documentation needed. But you can't do it like the day of or the night before.

524
00:55:16,650 --> 00:55:19,930
I think I'd say a week on the syllabus.

525
00:55:20,970 --> 00:55:29,100
We are a little flexible on that, but don't come to us the day before or on the day of unless there's an emergency.

526
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:34,230
But a couple of days in advance, three or four days. We'll try to work with you.

527
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:39,840
Okay. I want to spend some time on classroom environment.

528
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:46,200
We're going to be talking about, as you heard from some of the things people mentioned earlier,

529
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:56,220
a lot of topics that can be difficult and messy to talk about and topics with which people have a lot of different opinions on.

530
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:06,090
You all have had the privilege of being in class together before, so you may already know some of the proclivities of your classmates.

531
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:21,960
I do not know them yet. I want this class to be an environment where all views and perspectives are welcome and where folks can share unpopular views.

532
00:56:23,490 --> 00:56:31,889
I am not trying to advance, despite what some people might argue, any type of agenda or anything like that.

533
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:38,250
And in fact, I welcome dissenting or opposing views.

534
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:47,010
So if you disagree with something that I or one of your classmates says or you have a different perspective on it, I'd like to hear about it.

535
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:50,800
And I'd like to encourage you to share that with the class.

536
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:55,290
It's actually more interesting when we have disagreement than when everyone agrees.

537
00:56:55,290 --> 00:57:04,200
So feel free. Again, my only stipulation is that it's done in a respectful way.

538
00:57:04,470 --> 00:57:11,610
We can agree to disagree. Again, some of these topics, you're not going to agree with what I'm saying,

539
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:17,790
even though I try to stick to research and facts, you may have a different view and that's okay.

540
00:57:17,990 --> 00:57:27,210
Okay. So I want to be very clear about that. We want it to be a space that we can be authentic and honest about the questions we have.

541
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:32,430
You know, earlier it was mentioned well, I know about my group. I don't know about other groups.

542
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:38,760
So I want to learn more about that, that this is the space where that sort of thing can happen.

543
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:45,930
I again read the specifics. We want to be inclusive.

544
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:49,530
We want this to be a safe and brave space.

545
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:59,090
There are a couple of multicultural ground rules that are linked on the syllabus that I'd like you to take a look at for Monday.

546
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:06,630
And then, you know, if there are issues that come up in your groups in terms of not feeling comfortable.

547
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:08,730
Last year we had a situation in one of the.

548
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:17,680
Groups where one of the students felt a little uncomfortable with something that another group member said, We will try to work that out.

549
00:58:18,010 --> 00:58:29,230
There are formal mechanisms to report, as you know, the School of Public Health, incidents of discrimination, sexual harassment, so on and so forth.

550
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,640
And those are available here on the website for reporting.

551
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:43,180
But in general, if you're kind of feeling uncomfortable and not sure how to navigate something and that's why the GSA is in the teaching team,

552
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:48,070
including myself, are here to help kind of figure that out. So don't hesitate to let us know.

553
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,459
Again, we want this to be a space where you're not sitting,

554
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:57,850
feeling uncomfortable through the semester, but that you feel comfortable in your your group having.

555
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:06,320
All right. I have a land acknowledgment statement here that I like to read.

556
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:14,560
So. The University of Michigan was founded to the Treaty of Fort Miggs in 1817.

557
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:24,330
And the initial neither the three fighters confederacy of the Ojibway, Odawa and Potawatomi, along with their neighbors the Seneca,

558
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:31,500
Delaware, Shawnee and Wyandotte Nations, and ceded portions of their land so that their children could be educated.

559
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:35,670
And through these words of acknowledgment, their ancestral,

560
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:43,200
traditional and contemporary ties to this land and the founding of the university are renewed and affirmed.

561
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:53,340
I mention this here. If you do some searching, you may already know this land acknowledgment statements have become somewhat controversial.

562
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:59,040
Okay. There's some people who think they're great idea. Other people think they are kind of superficial and performative.

563
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:02,850
And we need to be doing a lot more than putting a paragraph on the syllabus.

564
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:11,040
I feel it's really important to put it on the syllabus for a couple of reasons, but one of them is,

565
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:18,930
as we go through this semester, we really are going to be thinking somebody mentioned historical context.

566
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:25,440
There's no way you can understand social determinants of health, structural determinants of health,

567
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:34,769
without taking a moment to reflect on historical contributions and the history which often has been kind of left out of the record,

568
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:46,349
educational record. And so as a point of reflection, if you are unfamiliar with sort of what land acknowledgment statements are,

569
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:55,230
I encourage you in your own time to do a quick Google and learn a little bit about the history and to recognize that,

570
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:59,639
you know, we're here and we're learning and we have this space.

571
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:07,350
But this is from folks who see that the land to us and would not be possible without that happening.

572
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:13,950
So one example, again, thinking historically through all the topics we're going to cover this semester,

573
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:21,750
how does the historical record contribute to existing structural inequities that exist?

574
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:29,400
Okay, a few more things. Academic integrity. I'm not going to read this verbatim.

575
01:01:30,030 --> 01:01:37,980
Unfortunately, we did have an instance last year on the glossary assignment where someone plagiarized

576
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:45,930
and we are checking for these things and this particular situation it was.

577
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:55,460
Quite obvious that the person after reading these for 15 years or being a professor, you can kind of tell.

578
01:01:56,420 --> 01:02:03,590
So please don't do that. And if that does come up, we'll deal with it on a case by case basis.

579
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:06,620
But it seems almost silly to have to say it.

580
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:16,010
I strongly want to encourage you to uphold principles of academic integrity so we don't end up in difficult situations throughout the course.

581
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:21,650
All right. A couple of more resources here. Writing lab, if you want to schedule an appointment.

582
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:30,650
I've received many accommodation letters from many of you will be acknowledging those the teaching team in the next couple of days.

583
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,580
If there are things that you would like us to know, please.

584
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:40,190
We have a survey we're going to have you fill out for Monday. Let us know.

585
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:45,380
But we want to make sure that everyone is able to be successful in this course.

586
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:50,000
And so whatever we can do to make that possible, please let us know.

587
01:02:52,050 --> 01:02:55,310
Student Wellness, a couple of more resources and food insecurity.

588
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:05,160
Mental health, as I mentioned, really important has really become an issue over the last or more of an issue of the last couple of years,

589
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,660
particularly during the pandemic.

590
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:17,250
Some of us, even supposedly post-pandemic, are really still having a hard time and struggling, as we've learned recently.

591
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:26,910
Even people that appear fine and appear to be quite happy can still be dealing with things that are very challenging in terms of their mental health.

592
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:31,050
So as someone who takes mental health very seriously,

593
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:36,870
I want to encourage you that if you are having difficulties or struggling with your mental health,

594
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:42,749
you should feel free to approach me or the resources. You don't have to tell me any details,

595
01:03:42,750 --> 01:03:52,860
but I'm happy to point you to appropriate resources so that you can get the support that you need again to be successful in this course.

596
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:56,250
Food insecurity is another issue.

597
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:06,750
Many people are surprised when we do the food insecurity unit to find out that this is a actually important and prevalent problem on college campuses.

598
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:15,300
So many of you may already be familiar with the maze and blue cupboard, but if you're not, there are some resources there.

599
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:25,980
We'll talk more about it throughout the semester. If there are individuals who are, you know, don't have proper food or nutrition.

600
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,530
Happy to support however we can.

601
01:04:29,550 --> 01:04:42,320
I recently went to a faculty exercise that was focused on the experience of undocumented students at the University of Michigan.

602
01:04:42,990 --> 01:04:54,330
Some of you have seen the CRT players, which is a acting troupe that goes around and does different skits on issues of significance.

603
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:02,820
And they did a skit on the experience of undocumented students and what it's like being an undocumented student at Michigan.

604
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:08,969
I don't know if there are any students in our class who are undocumented,

605
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:17,490
but I want to acknowledge that if you are undocumented, you should feel safe and comfortable.

606
01:05:17,490 --> 01:05:22,840
And so approached me about any concerns that you have. We were trained in a number of resources.

607
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:33,300
I'm actually going to revise the syllabus to add some of them so that folks can take advantage of those resources as well.

608
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:38,700
Again, we really want everyone in our classroom environment to be successful,

609
01:05:39,390 --> 01:05:44,520
and there are different challenges that different students contend with that we don't always think about.

610
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:47,520
So I want to name that.

611
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:54,780
Okay. Here is the actual tentative course schedule.

612
01:05:54,810 --> 01:06:03,570
Okay. So you will see as we go through the semester, the syllabus will be revised numerous times because we'll make adjustments.

613
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:11,880
I will add things, subtract things, and I will always post it as an announcement and let you know what's been changed on the new version.

614
01:06:12,750 --> 01:06:16,410
But these are some of the things that we're going to talk about this semester.

615
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:20,340
It started out in the beginning of the semester. Kind of basic.

616
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:24,570
What is the population health review for many people?

617
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:31,960
Wonder, disparities, etc. And then we'll spend some time thinking about racism and discrimination.

618
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:39,150
Professor McCreary will be back with us. As you can see later this month, I'm to talk about her work on Down to Justice.

619
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:49,410
And then after that foundational work, we're going to get into some of the kind of specific topics within social determinants of health.

620
01:06:49,470 --> 01:06:53,879
Okay. This course is organized around healthy people 2030.

621
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:57,390
So they have that. If you haven't seen it, it's probably in your other classes.

622
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:04,799
Social determinants of health. Five buckets. And the course is roughly organized in those five buckets.

623
01:07:04,800 --> 01:07:10,140
So we spend some time thinking about sort of the economic factors in the beginning,

624
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:18,270
and then we move on to other things built environment, social and community context later on in the semester.

625
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:23,850
Educational access is also part of that, so this is how the course is organized.

626
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:33,540
We have a number of guest speakers who will come in to mix things up a little bit because you all will probably get tired of me after a while,

627
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:40,620
but I try to keep it mixed up so that we have different perspectives and different vantage points throughout the semester.

628
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:47,669
As I mentioned earlier, you'll also hear from the GSA is at some point in the semester last year,

629
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:53,700
we kind of had April as the month where the GSA is kind of, you know, gave their lectures.

630
01:07:53,930 --> 01:07:57,540
It was really, really a lot of fun, actually. So stay tuned on that.

631
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:08,959
Okay. This schedule, as I hear back from more speakers be revised.

632
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:12,580
So stay tuned on that. All right.

633
01:08:12,580 --> 01:08:17,380
Let's go back to our slides. Just a couple more things here before we wrap up.

634
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:26,430
A couple guiding principles that I think about as we orient towards the course.

635
01:08:26,790 --> 01:08:30,120
We try and make this. Okay.

636
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:34,680
So some things are going to go really well. Every class is different.

637
01:08:34,710 --> 01:08:37,930
You're going to have things you like, things you don't.

638
01:08:37,950 --> 01:08:45,569
I'm really open to feedback. I will solicit feedback. I'm actually going to create an opportunity for you to submit anonymous feedback

639
01:08:45,570 --> 01:08:50,190
throughout the semester if things aren't going well or there's something not going right.

640
01:08:51,020 --> 01:08:56,640
I'm really open to changing. So we're going to be flexible with one another.

641
01:08:57,390 --> 01:09:01,170
The other thing I want to mention, principal two, is co learning.

642
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:09,179
So in many of classes, the way that it's done is the teacher has all of the knowledge,

643
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:13,800
the instructor has all of the knowledge and imparts it to the students.

644
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:21,110
I use a somewhat different model, so my responsibility is to come in and lead the topics.

645
01:09:21,570 --> 01:09:26,549
But I want this to be an environment where we are learning from each other and where we're

646
01:09:26,550 --> 01:09:37,050
learning from the GSA is last year we were doing a unit on suicide and somebody said,

647
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:43,379
Oh, you know, when the folks committed suicide, blah, blah, blah. And a student raised their hand and she said, actually, you know,

648
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:51,120
I have done a lot of work in the area of suicide and the preferred terminology is death by suicide.

649
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:58,640
And she kind of explained why committed suicide is not the preferred language.

650
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,770
Okay? This is a really great opportunity.

651
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:10,100
Other folks learn from that experience. But the reason I mention it is that I want you all to feel empowered in this class.

652
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:17,339
You all have experience and knowledge that you bring to the class that other people may not know from your cultural experience,

653
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:21,840
your background, or whatever. There are lots of things I don't know.

654
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:25,379
This class is very focused on the US experience.

655
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:33,060
There may be experiences that extend beyond the US and we want this to be an environment where we learn from each

656
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:42,030
other and expand our knowledge so we each have a part to play and the experience of learning is richer when we have,

657
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:50,909
in this case, 112 plus the size, plus me teachers co learning than just me, you know, kind of spouting off knowledge.

658
01:10:50,910 --> 01:10:54,629
So cold learning, grace, humility.

659
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:57,690
I think our and inclusion are pretty straightforward.

660
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:03,540
We will make mistakes. People may say things, things may not be clear.

661
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:05,340
We're all doing the best that we can.

662
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:14,280
And so I ask you, in the same way that I will extend grace to you all and to extend grace to me, the teaching team, uh,

663
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:24,930
to come into this course with a perspective of humility, with an open appetite, a learning, realizing that you may not know all the answers.

664
01:11:24,930 --> 01:11:29,820
I certainly don't. There may be times when you ask me questions I don't know the answer to,

665
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:37,589
and someone else in the class may be able to answer them, or I may seek out information to help get answers to that.

666
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:44,940
So these are some of my guiding principles that I like to embody as we go through the semester.

667
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:51,510
Okay. Almost lasting next to last night here, the agenda revisited.

668
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:58,130
So we've gotten through all of our tests now. I wanted to revisit this next time at length.

669
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:06,300
So, again, as I mention, the slide will always tell you on the first agenda slide what you should do for the next class.

670
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:13,350
For Monday, I'm asking you to read Population Health Chapter one.

671
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:21,810
Last year we read the whole chapter, but when I was looking at it last night, I thought, this is really more detail than they need.

672
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:23,620
And so I've revised it.

673
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:33,150
I'm asking you to read pages 1 to 12 carefully, and then those of you who want to do a deeper dive into some of the specific lingo,

674
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:38,710
you can skim pages 12 to 19, but I'm not going to be going over that in class.

675
01:12:38,730 --> 01:12:44,760
Okay. There is a article linked here.

676
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:51,310
The encountered people of color are dying at much higher rates related to COVID that we're going to be talking about on Monday.

677
01:12:51,330 --> 01:12:57,390
So I'd like you to take a look at that, review the guidelines for the Journal.

678
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:03,570
Group Journal assignment. This is under the Assignments tab.

679
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:07,320
Your first journal will be due on Wednesday.

680
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:15,090
So in that first journal, you're really only going to have Mondays lecture to comment on.

681
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:22,440
Although I also want to encourage you, I'm sure you're having reactions as you're sitting here thinking about the semester,

682
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:29,420
what you're looking forward to or not looking forward to. So I want to invite you and your general response that's due next Wednesday to

683
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:33,049
also reflect on any thoughts you have today about what you're excited about,

684
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:41,990
etc. Okay. So drawing on today's class and Monday, your first journal will be due on Wednesday.

685
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:47,240
And so the very detailed guidelines telling you exactly what to do are on.

686
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:51,350
Actually, let me point out exactly where it is. So there's no.

687
01:13:52,450 --> 01:14:01,000
Confusing. Under the assignments tab, what I'd like you to read is the group journal assignment overview.

688
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:06,620
It tells you exactly what. Is expected.

689
01:14:06,790 --> 01:14:14,410
Okay. And we'll touch base on this on Monday. If you have any questions, you should let us know.

690
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:20,120
I encourage people to have a look around healthy people.

691
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:29,990
2030 Some of you may have already done this. The social determinants of health model that I mentioned before, this is what organizes the course.

692
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:37,500
Just to orient you for getting ready for the semester, some of you actually, or not, some of you.

693
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:42,870
Last year, people in their first journal commented on things they found interesting on the website.

694
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:46,810
So take a look through that. And.

695
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:52,760
One last important thing here, actually.

696
01:14:55,370 --> 01:15:00,280
Three, but let me two I've already mentioned. So review the syllabus and no questions.

697
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:08,720
You should go through it and read it carefully. Here's a link for the projects if you want to start looking at what people did, I link that.

698
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:17,090
And then the last thing before we end up here is a student survey that I'm asking you to complete.

699
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:29,810
By. Monday. So if we go to the module here, you will see for January 9th, all the things I just mentioned are here.

700
01:15:31,880 --> 01:15:35,510
There's chapter one, there's the reading.

701
01:15:36,230 --> 01:15:40,700
Here are some things for you to browse. And then the student survey.

702
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:47,730
Okay, that's not good. Um, we'll check on you on that.

703
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:56,040
There's a student survey that has some information, questions, just kind of getting to know you, whatever you feel comfortable to share.

704
01:15:58,070 --> 01:16:03,350
It will help us as we meet with you throughout the semester. Okay, so we'll make sure that link is working.

705
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:07,730
And finally.

706
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:13,920
I'd like to just pause here. Everyone take a deep breath.

707
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:19,740
Are there any questions? Burning questions before.

708
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:30,630
We go. And this is somewhat unusual.

709
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:35,080
I never had a class with no questions on the syllabus or the class.

710
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:43,030
You may just be overwhelmed with the information, but I'm really looking forward to working with you all this semester.

711
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:52,810
Again, I'm really committed to positive experience and success for each of you, so have a great afternoon.

712
01:16:52,810 --> 01:16:57,250
Welcome to Winter 23 and we'll see you soon.

713
01:16:58,090 --> 01:17:07,200
Have a good day. You know.

714
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:36,750
I don't. Yeah, but family separation is basically what that looks like for boring people face to face.

715
01:17:40,130 --> 01:17:50,000
Even though they put in place a very different situation, that has not been an explicit told so.

716
01:17:51,860 --> 01:18:01,610
If you look at it that way, I think it is great.

717
01:18:05,540 --> 01:18:16,710
So the answer is immediately. Something that I regret.

718
01:18:19,020 --> 01:18:23,150
Yes, yes, yes, yes. So what?

719
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:30,630
I'm going to have to prepare that officer later in the day, the Reverend Sharpton.

720
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:35,550
All right. Thank you much.

721
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:41,340
All right. Certainly. I'm probably going to raise with you.

722
01:18:41,760 --> 01:18:46,720
Okay. I'm Anthony Brooks.

723
01:18:46,740 --> 01:18:54,080
I'm. Not really. Are the others worse?

724
01:18:55,100 --> 01:19:02,820
Are we going to remind Congress and my party of federalism that part of the reason that I also do the.

725
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:16,760
The. Just link each individual chapter with the textbook, the one we're reading on Monday, for example, we don't read most of the book.

726
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:22,520
It's like select chapters and then you go through the chapters. You know, a couple of pages here.

727
01:19:22,540 --> 01:19:27,100
A couple of pages. So. That's the answer to that.

728
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:30,490
We will read we will read this entire thing.

729
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:33,970
Yes. Okay. So now I'm planning on buying it so I can. Yes.

730
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:38,300
Yes. To the social determinants of mental health.

731
01:19:38,350 --> 01:19:41,770
This one, we read a fair amount.

732
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,910
I don't know if you're going to find this one. It's more like a text.

733
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:48,790
Yeah, so I'll be fine. Okay. On camera third.

734
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:53,350
And that's the one word. Yeah, that's another textbook. That's the really big one.

735
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,530
Do you have any kinds of accommodations? No, I really do.
