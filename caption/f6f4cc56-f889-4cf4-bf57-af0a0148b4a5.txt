1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:26,850
You know, I don't, you know, know what's going on now where somebody is trying to figure out what's they knew everything.

2
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:39,150
I mean, the about event, even though I wasn't like Bill, you know.

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:48,210
So I always say, oh, that was your life, you know?

4
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:58,840
Well, I know we have, like, an unofficial official visit, you know, and I still make the list.

5
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:06,440
And I would be surprised if you gather together to hear the.

6
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,140
Yeah. Nobody there.

7
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:13,500
So I don't know. That's good. I think, you know,

8
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:27,130
I realized I was tour when you went into the woods and it was September and I thought it was going to be one of those where I couldn't.

9
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:39,800
And is it? There is context.

10
00:01:40,510 --> 00:02:03,030
Not what you think. It was just, you know, you got to ask me to help you out here, but I got a guy going to like me.

11
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:11,010
All these. I know.

12
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:26,400
I feel like I have to make the announcement tomorrow.

13
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,329
So Wednesday will have you up against lecture.

14
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:36,850
Amanda. Alex, go back to the hospital infection control.

15
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,640
And again, I won't be here Wednesday because it's only before.

16
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:55,419
You know what else. I think that the homework, too, will be delayed a little bit when we release it and when to do.

17
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:08,910
Because I had to shift the outbreak investigation lectures and a couple of weeks ago when they when I guess punched me so hard.

18
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,550
So I was going to really it was going to be released Wednesday, but it was Thanksgiving.

19
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,530
And those next three homeworks will be a little different.

20
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:31,600
They're going to focus on a manuscript and you'll be answering questions based on reading the manuscript.

21
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:39,550
And so this is the second, third of our course.

22
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:53,290
And we're going to be dealing with different ways to measure and assess infectious disease in the context of outbreaks,

23
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,610
in the context of surveillance.

24
00:03:55,210 --> 00:04:02,380
Today we're talking about study design, and we'll talk about model transmission models in this second, third of the course also.

25
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,820
So today is on study design.

26
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:19,960
I can say stop. If there's any question that anybody has about the course, the exam and the homework is determined.

27
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:37,290
So. We're going to talk mostly about some unique study design in the context and unique features of infectious disease transmission.

28
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,229
We've talked a little bit about this already,

29
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:46,950
but we're going to go over in more detail the concepts that an indirect direct effects distinguish between herd immunity.

30
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:56,600
And I'll introduce another term herd protection and look at multiple interdependent pathways and we'll talk.

31
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:02,720
And so all of these concepts, impacts can impact study, design and talk about.

32
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:11,969
And then I'm just going to mention briefly, there's just a couple of slides on test negative control design and I'm bringing

33
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:18,420
it up because it's a way in which people have used for influenza and likely

34
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:26,249
to be starting to use for COVID 19 to assess vaccine effectiveness ongoing in

35
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:30,629
an observational study instead of rather than a randomized controlled study.

36
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:40,110
So they use randomized control studies to look at the effectiveness and actually go through the licensing of vaccines.

37
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:48,570
But they often are using observational studies, especially for influenza, which is a new vaccine every year.

38
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:55,350
So they want to measure and assess the effectiveness of the vaccine for each and each year.

39
00:05:55,350 --> 00:06:05,640
So case negative, case test, negative control design is the method that most people use to assess vaccine effectiveness.

40
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:16,459
So dependent happenings is is a concept that was developed actually in the early 1900s

41
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:23,150
by Sir Ronald Ross when he was studying mosquito trap and mosquito borne transmission,

42
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:27,270
specifically malaria. And he was very interested in transmission.

43
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:37,820
And I think he appreciated then that though that risk was dependent on the prevalence in the community.

44
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:50,120
And Halloran has took this and in the early nineties took this threat dependent happenings and developed these concepts of indirect,

45
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,480
indirect effect and actually total and overall effect, which we'll talk about in this course.

46
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:05,870
So as we mentioned before, you know that for all infectious diseases where transmission occurs from house to post,

47
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,060
we have what's called dependent happenings.

48
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:21,200
And we can codify this with in this equation, which is which is really the basis of all transmission modeling.

49
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:26,629
Where in this case is the incidence and P is the prevalence of the incidence.

50
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:33,380
The risk of new cases is in this equation dependent on the prevalence in the community.

51
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:40,790
So again, that's not true with non infectious diseases, but it is true for infectious diseases and.

52
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:48,830
The, the, the parameters that allow you to calculate incidence based on prevalence.

53
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:55,100
And we've talked about this before is the contact rate of potential infectious sources.

54
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:04,640
So and we've talked about the different ways in which we can think about a contact rate through the contact rate of two individuals.

55
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,680
If it's a directly transmitted disease,

56
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:14,390
mosquitoes biting rate of mosquitoes would be another contact rate for vector borne diseases and ingestion for waterborne.

57
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:23,210
And then we have this transmission probability, which is how we characterize infectivity.

58
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:34,700
So in this way, we often use data to represent the transmission rate, which is which incorporates the contact rate,

59
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:46,550
but then others actually explicitly take out the and bring out the contact rate as it's supposed to turn the tide as data.

60
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:56,000
And so this really codifies this notion of dependent happenings that surround virus first talked about in the early 1900s.

61
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:06,379
And then that's in contrast with what he called independent happenings, and that would be all of our noninfectious diseases.

62
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,430
So exposure to chemicals and air pollution and such.

63
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,430
But also in the context of infectious diseases,

64
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:24,770
we could categorize all our pathogens where humans are dead and hosts such as rabies and Lyme disease, tetanus as also independent happening.

65
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:33,380
There's no transmission occurring or transmission or those diseases are happening in non-humans.

66
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:47,889
So what comes out of this dependent happenings concept is this idea that there are direct effects and there are indirect effects,

67
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:52,030
and that's what Halloran developed in the early nineties.

68
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,200
And we've talked about this before Direct Effects.

69
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:00,959
These are protective effects from the person that's receiving the intervention.

70
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,640
So they the individuals getting an effect directly from that intervention.

71
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:13,580
So the person that receives the vaccine is protected and that protection is direct effects are the direct effects.

72
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,580
And then the indirect effect is this population level phenomenon.

73
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:28,680
So that the fact that as you start vaccinating more and more people, you're actually reducing the transmission in the community.

74
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,580
And therefore everybody is receiving indirect effects. Those that are vaccinated and those that are not vaccinated.

75
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:49,880
So what we're going to talk about a lot in our talk about next is how we can measure direct and indirect effects in our study designs.

76
00:10:52,140 --> 00:11:00,120
And we can also measure what we call total effects and overall effects, which is a combination of the direct and indirect effects.

77
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:07,889
That is, the impact of an intervention is not going to be just about direct effects and indirect effects.

78
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:15,510
It's actually the combination and total and overall or different ways to combine the direct and indirect effects.

79
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:26,590
So we're going to go through each one of these four effects that Halloran developed.

80
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:34,720
And first, we'll go over them here quickly, and then we'll go, and then we'll go over them again,

81
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,210
looking at equations that allow us to measure these different effects.

82
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:46,840
So again, the direct effect is one that's received by the individual with the intervention,

83
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:51,129
and we measure it by the difference between the outcome at the individual with

84
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:56,050
the intervention and what outcome would have happened without the intervention,

85
00:11:56,050 --> 00:12:01,600
all else being equal. So we think of this and you've probably heard about the counterfactual.

86
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,830
So the idea that if we could turn back the clock to mean, you know,

87
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,329
the difference between an individual that got the vaccine and then we turn back the

88
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:15,550
clock and we don't give the vaccine that the difference in risk is the direct effect.

89
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:23,370
And often we compare. We try and we compare groups within a population to get at the direct effects.

90
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:32,079
So this is happening and we can measure a direct effect in looking at a single population,

91
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,490
comparing those that received the intervention and those received in action.

92
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,920
And our assumption is that everything is equal about those two groups,

93
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:54,700
except for one got the intervention and one did so the indirect effect since it's this population level phenomena.

94
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:02,389
We can't measure it in a single population. And so we need to compare populations.

95
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:08,430
So here we're looking at the difference between the outcome in an individual not receiving the intervention.

96
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:15,030
In a population where the intervention is implemented and compare with an individual

97
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:19,140
that didn't receive the intervention where there is no intervention program.

98
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,780
So you have to look at two different populations, one with the intervention, one without.

99
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:29,790
And you compare individuals that didn't receive the intervention in both those.

100
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,530
So it's confirmed that the total population.

101
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,980
The total effect is just as is a combination of the direct and indirect effects.

102
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:51,560
Felt by an individual receiving the intervention, said the person receiving intervention since the intervention is never perfect.

103
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:57,180
That person can receive the direct effects and benefits of the intervention,

104
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,300
but they also receive the indirect effects that there's less transmission happening in the population.

105
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:10,709
So here we're looking at the difference between the outcome across two different populations.

106
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:14,880
Again, a population where we have the intervention and don't have the intervention.

107
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:22,500
And now we we see the difference being the outcome in an individual receiving the intervention in a population with

108
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:29,160
the intervention program and the outcome in individual without the intervention in a population with no intervention.

109
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:40,060
So that person that receives the vaccine in the intervention community is seeing both indirect and direct effects.

110
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:46,770
And the person that's not receiving intervention in the other community is not receiving either direct or indirect effect.

111
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:56,469
So now we're getting at the total effects. And the last onset is overall effects,

112
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:04,270
which is actually what really happened instead is now we're looking at a population where some get the vaccine and some don't.

113
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:13,240
And we look at the average effect in that population where the intervention is applied and compare it to a population where there's no intervention.

114
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:26,100
So that's the overall effects where. We're both assuming that the intervention is not perfect so the poor person receives direct and indirect effects.

115
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:30,870
We're also assuming that not everyone gets the intervention in an intervention community.

116
00:15:31,690 --> 00:15:35,519
And so if we average the effect of those that get it and don't get it,

117
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:41,220
and compared to a community that doesn't have the intervention, we get the overall effects.

118
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,280
So that was a lot. And we're going to go over each one of these one more time by looking,

119
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:56,540
but we're going to look at them in the context of an equation and these diagrams.

120
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,439
So let's go back to the direct effect. We talked about the direct effect that we can measure.

121
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,300
The direct effect in a single population is population.

122
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,470
These are the groups of people that are receiving the intervention are experts.

123
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:18,150
This is the risk associated with those that people that are not receiving the intervention.

124
00:16:18,630 --> 00:16:21,900
And by comparing these two groups, we get at the direct effects.

125
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,920
So we look at the percent reduction here.

126
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:33,450
So the risk of those not receiving the intervention minus those receiving the intervention is as the risk difference.

127
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:43,690
And then divide by the risk of not receiving the intervention gives us 2% reduction in risk due to the intervention.

128
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,120
This is probably what you've seen before. And but what's important.

129
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:53,740
So I mentioned this. The assumption here again, for this to be valid,

130
00:16:55,090 --> 00:17:01,030
the assumption is everything about the population that received the intervention and

131
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:06,190
the population that didn't receive the mention should be equal equal age distribution,

132
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:17,770
equal disease, comorbidities, anything that might put an individual at high risk, higher risk or lower risk.

133
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,149
Those things are assumed to be equal across these populations.

134
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:28,720
And the only thing that's different is. One population receives the intervention and what does it do?

135
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:36,570
The important thing here is that the standard RC design that you learned in 600, for instance,

136
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:46,260
really is only measuring the direct effects because that's exactly what this is the typical type of

137
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,720
randomized controlled trial design in which you would measure the effectiveness of an intervention.

138
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,620
And in fact, it's measuring the direct effects to noninfectious disease.

139
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:01,860
The direct effects is everything because there is no indirect effects.

140
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:09,240
If the indirect effects are small, then this test design will be appropriate.

141
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:14,820
But if the indirect are appreciable, then you need a different design.

142
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:20,550
And so here we see a cross population comparison.

143
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:26,219
So we have population, we have people that received the intervention, those that didn't.

144
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,990
And then we have a population, B, R,

145
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:37,230
C represents the risk associated with those that did not receive the intervention and there was no intervention applied in that community.

146
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,990
So the assumption is these two populations are separated and are not interacting with each other.

147
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:51,510
And so then the indirect effects is basically the looking at the risk difference of those that did not receive the

148
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:57,370
intervention in this in population B compared with those that did not receive the intervention in population.

149
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,200
Again. All else to populations are equal in all ways except the intervention.

150
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:13,240
And so, again, this is captured. These indirect effects are captured through this cross population.

151
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:19,450
Comparison is the only way that you're going to be able to capture these indirect effects.

152
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:28,970
So. Next we can talk about measuring the total effects.

153
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:37,670
And so here, what we're going to do is we're going to have our same population, A and B, but instead of comparing.

154
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:45,270
The group that didn't receive the intervention in population. We're going to actually compare the group that did receive the intervention.

155
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:53,490
So we got the risk of no intervention in Population B or anything compared to

156
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,960
the population that did receive the intervention in the population they died.

157
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:07,230
But I itemized the risk in population B gives us the total effect.

158
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,620
So basically it's because these this group.

159
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:17,530
He is receiving direct effects and indirect effects, and that's why we met.

160
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:26,410
In that way, we're getting the total effect effect, the indirect, indirect effect of this intervention.

161
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:40,580
We assume that the indirect effects associated with though those that didn't receive

162
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:46,150
the intervention in population A and in those in population B are the same.

163
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,210
That's another assumption that we have for this to be valid.

164
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,090
And so the last major here is overall effects.

165
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:02,000
And again, so here we are comparing population as a whole.

166
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,950
So we kind of we've got but you know,

167
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:15,319
so that we don't have perfect coverage or perfect intervention if we compare population as a whole with population.

168
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:20,629
B So again, the risk difference of those that didn't receive a population that didn't receive

169
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,890
the intervention comparing to a population that did receive the intervention.

170
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:31,670
So the overall effects takes into account both the fact that the intervention is not perfect,

171
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:35,090
so that people receiving the intervention are getting indirect,

172
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:42,980
indirect effects, and that the coverage is not complete, that we have some people in population that don't get the intervention.

173
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:48,710
And so they're looking at the overall effects, but the same kind of same assumptions.

174
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:58,050
So let's look at this in a context of a cholera vaccine.

175
00:21:58,070 --> 00:22:11,450
So there is a cholera intervention trial done in Bangladesh late in the 1980s, and it is more or less of a traditional intervention randomized trial.

176
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:17,389
The idea there was that they were actually comparing two different types of

177
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:24,860
vaccines A B subunit killed wholesale vaccine and then a killed wholesale vaccine.

178
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:29,750
They wanted to compare those two to see which one was more effective.

179
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,430
And so they had three arms to this intervention trial.

180
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:41,810
One received one of the vaccines, one another received the other vaccine, and one was a placebo.

181
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,210
So and so they enrolled kids. They had one year follow up.

182
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:59,150
And because it was a traditional design, individuals were randomized at the individual level to one of these three arms.

183
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:11,960
And so what they found was that there is a perfect protective efficacy for these two vaccines for 62 and 53%.

184
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:21,560
Using a traditional design, which meant that all they were doing was measuring the direct that they were looking at seeing this.

185
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:30,840
As one community and people with even within a household or memory,

186
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,739
which is a collection of household some could have received and some might not

187
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,890
have received the vaccine because it was randomized at the individual level.

188
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:53,160
So in 2000, five people went in and and re analyzed this trial to look at and measure the indirect effects.

189
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:59,800
And they were able to do that because individuals lived in housing clusters called bars.

190
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:02,850
So in bars are just a collection of households.

191
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:11,040
So randomization still occurred at the individual level. The idea was considering each body as a different population unit.

192
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:22,800
And so within each bakery there is a percent coverage of vaccine coverage ranging from 0 to 2 that are low.

193
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,620
I am not sure there was anything like that. 0% coverage to fairly high coverage.

194
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:38,210
And so within each group that is so group parties were grouped into percent coverage categories.

195
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:46,360
So within each group they could estimate the direct effects comparing a vaccine group with the same group.

196
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:51,760
And by comparing across groups, they could measure the indirect effects.

197
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,149
So these bars were 6423 bars that they were analyzing,

198
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:05,950
and each party had on average a median number of 17 individuals comprised of a number of households.

199
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:13,620
So. The idea here again was to measure the direct effects.

200
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:25,090
We're measuring the. Baris had had all similar vaccine coverages and they were they were classified as population eight.

201
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:32,350
And then we've got a population B where there was either no under intervention.

202
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,420
And you'll see in this case just. There was minimal coverage.

203
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:46,650
So there seems there wasn't a case, there wasn't enough bodies where there was nobody vaccinated,

204
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,940
that the assumption in that population was actually wasn't no intervention, but a little intervention.

205
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,700
So this is a table of the results. And so see, so each.

206
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:09,530
So we have categories of coverage. Less than 28% coverage, vaccine coverage, all the way up to greater than 51% coverage.

207
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:19,320
And so within any of these categories, by comparing the vaccine and the placebo group, we can get at the direct effect.

208
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:23,790
And we see except for this one category which was anomaly,

209
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:33,329
you basically increasing coverage didn't really change appreciably the direct effect which was that which

210
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:42,540
makes sense that the direct effect was independent of how many people had the vaccine in each country.

211
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:48,870
Because a direct effect is about the individual level effect, not not the population level effect.

212
00:26:51,280 --> 00:27:00,850
But the indirect effect is one in which you compare and in this case, compare those.

213
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,460
Communities, libraries that had high coverage.

214
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,110
In this case, it was defined as greater than 51%.

215
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:15,490
But those that had low coverage, which was defined as less than 28% and this a this was our reference group.

216
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,560
Ideally it would be zero coverage, but for practical reasons, this again,

217
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:26,890
this study wasn't designed to measure the indirect effects reanalyzed so we we don't have that zero coverage

218
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:38,170
but here this .79 is the effect of comparing this high coverage group with the low coverage group.

219
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:44,530
And you can see that as each one of these is comparing with the reference,

220
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:50,290
the low coverage group, that the indirect effect is increasing as coverage is increasing.

221
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:57,879
So we can see we can measure the indirect effects in this, even though in this reanalysis,

222
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:03,040
even though the design of the study wasn't designed to measure the indirect

223
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:08,890
effects because of these barriers that were somewhat isolated from other bodies,

224
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:14,109
we're able to see the indirect effect and we're able to see how it if it increases,

225
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:19,419
as we would expect with increasing coverage and that we've got an appreciable indirect

226
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:26,440
effect happening with even with coverage is greater than 51% and for cholera here.

227
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:33,500
So that this is a you know, again, a nice example,

228
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:41,000
empirical example of how the indirect effects and direct effects can work for a vaccine intervention, in this case, cholera.

229
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:54,420
So. Herd immunity occurs when people are biologically protected from being infectious

230
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:58,860
because they have a vaccine and that as long as that vaccine is working,

231
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:04,830
they're protected. And so this herd immunity has been shown empirically to be.

232
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:12,020
True and operating in a number of cases, not just industry analysis.

233
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,020
And so this is a pretty established concept,

234
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:25,680
but this idea that we can get this kind of protection for other interventions besides vaccines and we'll see like bednets sanitation,

235
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:30,830
even chemotherapy is less of an established concept.

236
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:39,470
That is we've heard of with vaccines. We talk about what threshold do we need to risk to achieve herd immunity.

237
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:47,360
We don't talk about that very often in the context of other interventions like bed nets and.

238
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,589
Sanitation. But nonetheless,

239
00:29:50,590 --> 00:30:04,480
there is that the concept is still there and the concept is still important and is you don't have to intervene on everybody for people to.

240
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:12,340
For the community as a whole to feel the effects and the benefits. And so we're going to look at this in a little bit more detail graphically.

241
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:23,710
And so this this slide here, it kind of just empirically shows the how of herd immunity works.

242
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:31,719
What we've been talking about quite a bit. And so you basically have blue these blue people are susceptible.

243
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:39,100
We got one infectious person. If we start vaccinating people, we get this direct.

244
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:46,240
You know, everybody's vaccine is directly protected. But this susceptible person that's way out here is less likely to contact is

245
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:52,270
infectious person and therefore not vaccinated but is indirectly protected.

246
00:30:54,050 --> 00:31:00,860
So this is a herd immunity concept that we've been talking about quite a bit, being class in prior lectures as well as here.

247
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:08,209
But now we're going to go through some examples of how this works in for other interventions.

248
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:12,980
So in this case, we're talking about chemotherapy interventions for home of infections.

249
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:20,510
This was done mass treatment of deworming to treat intestinal elements in Kenyan schools.

250
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:28,290
And this was conducted by McHale and Kramer in 2004.

251
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:36,450
Heiko Kramer, actually, for this kind of work, won the Nobel Prize in economics, I think it was last year.

252
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:50,490
So these ideas and these concepts that he developed were important and theoretically in the advancement of economics and economics

253
00:31:50,490 --> 00:32:01,220
actually have taken the randomized trial as a quarter piece in which they try to understand how how behavior protection works.

254
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:04,350
So here we have the same thing. We've got susceptibles.

255
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:08,130
We've got an infectious person. In this case, it's a helmet infection.

256
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:18,110
So an infected person contaminates the environment. So we've got to we're starting to treat people.

257
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:25,460
And that means that those people are that even those households are resulting in a cleaner environment.

258
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:39,110
And so this individual here is now protected by the fact that they're they live in proximity to other people that were actually treated,

259
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:41,810
and therefore, they're living in a cleaner environment,

260
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:50,930
even if they themselves are actually infectious and potentially get infectious and are contributing to this contamination.

261
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,360
So we're calling this type of infection herd protection.

262
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:09,380
And suppose there isn't herd immunity. There's no there's a bias in this case that protection is biologic but is not long lasting.

263
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:16,020
That is, you're treating. The individual, but they can get reinfected immediately.

264
00:33:16,710 --> 00:33:18,290
So is that kind of a good rule of thumb?

265
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:25,110
Think about it as like herd protection comes from tertiary interventions versus immunities like our primary interventions.

266
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:32,660
I think that's putting a little bit too much. Hierarchy on interventions.

267
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:36,830
I mean, vaccines are pretty powerful interventions, but they have their limitations.

268
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:44,390
And I don't know if I would always suggest that it's that all the other interventions are secondary to vaccines and.

269
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:57,210
Because without the. And because some I guess part of that reason is vaccines like cholera vaccines are just not that effective.

270
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,300
And so to think about is the primary intervention in cholera.

271
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:06,290
Probably is not a good way to think about it. You know, in malaria, they're there.

272
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,760
They've got these vaccines, again, very problematic.

273
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:22,340
So might be able to think you might that might work for viruses, but not less and less so for other pathogens like bacteria and so or protozoa.

274
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:34,249
But more to say that. Conceptually, I don't think there really is is not a difference.

275
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:39,110
I mean, the whole way in which herd immunity works is lowering transmission.

276
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,670
And if we can lower transmission without an intervention, you're still getting those indirect effects.

277
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,660
So bed nets, same thing.

278
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:58,259
So we got susceptibles. We've got an infectious infect infectious individuals.

279
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:03,090
We bed net different people we got.

280
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:08,730
And so those people we're using bed nets are directly protected, at least as long as they're using the bed nets.

281
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:17,770
And when they're in bed. But Susceptibles that aren't using bednets are have indirect protection.

282
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:28,690
And so and this has been shown over and over again where it's even in cluster randomized trials,

283
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:35,420
if a group of households have bed nets and a group of households don't.

284
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:41,080
Those households that are closest to those households that receive that nets actually have reduced risk.

285
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:48,370
And so what's happening is in this case, mosquitoes are being diverted.

286
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:55,590
From because they're there. They're speaking and they host.

287
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:04,280
Into a household that has bednets. They basically can't bite anybody and they need to divert and find somebody else.

288
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:09,160
And that diversion, that is a delay.

289
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:11,420
And since mosquitoes don't live that long,

290
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:18,770
any kind of delays like that can actually impact their ability to transmit because they need to bite once they get infected.

291
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:25,110
They need to and they get their blood mail.

292
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:33,480
They need to make sure they lay their eggs. And so maybe a week before they're ready to do it again or even two weeks.

293
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:37,230
And they have the blood feed a second time to make a transmission occur.

294
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:44,520
So if any kind of diversion like this decreases the chances that a mosquito will successfully transmit.

295
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:54,720
Also that some bed nets are impregnated with insecticides, so mosquito will actually add their host to kill.

296
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:00,140
So that's another way in which these bed nets provide indirect effects.

297
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:06,769
But. Studies that use bednets that don't have this insecticide also show the indirect

298
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:10,739
protection fluids that there's there's multiple things going on mechanistically,

299
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:15,680
too. In order for this indirect protection to occur with respect to bed nets.

300
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:25,950
And so this is just a summary of the different studies that have looked at bed nets in this case.

301
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:34,379
These are all insecticide treated bed nets. And this list I mean, this all in helminths, this is another example.

302
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:39,930
We we talked about antibiotics and trachoma work very similarly to and then so on helmets.

303
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:54,360
Is that a treatment that treats the infection household mosquito larvae removal and and in dengue another example of the ability to have

304
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:03,930
you get herd protection cholera vaccines we talked about in natural immunity and measles is akin to vaccinate in vaccine mechanism.

305
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:12,240
So quite a bit of empirical evidence to show that there is measurable indirect effects that occur.

306
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:17,760
And that's that's what we are aiming for in these kinds of interventions.

307
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:28,180
And so. Want to spend a little bit of time here just focusing more more specifically on sanitation.

308
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:38,080
That's the area that I'm more involved in and also an area that's, again, like I said, less appreciated with respect to its ability to.

309
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:46,120
Provide indirect effects, but is a sample in which most of the benefits of sanitation are through indirect effects.

310
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:53,050
That is, you're just preventing the contamination from going into the environment.

311
00:38:53,620 --> 00:39:03,180
And so it's different than. Other interventions like protecting an individual, you're actually trying to protect the environment through sanitation.

312
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:11,400
So if we've got an improved sanitation, this, you know, schematically depicts how there is contamination.

313
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,120
There's contamination of this from this household to the environment.

314
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:24,179
If you've got some maybe low quality latrines as opposed to, you know, the dreams,

315
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:30,840
the contamination is less get high quality of the trains and there's ideally no contamination in the environment.

316
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:42,300
So if we can look at this schematically through and empirically, theoretically through a model structure where we can explore how we have.

317
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:49,700
People with no sanitation and, you know, contributing to the environment quite a bit.

318
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:58,610
And those with better sanitation might contribute contamination a lot less shown by a thinner line here.

319
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:07,670
And everybody is exposed to this environment through their just living in the communities.

320
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:15,500
And so if you run these simulations where you look at different kind of simulated interventions,

321
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:24,319
one saying going from no no sanitation facilities to lower quality from low quality to high quality,

322
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:32,660
we can look at the ways in which indirect effects are realized through reducing community

323
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:38,000
contamination and direct effects are realized through reducing household contamination.

324
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:43,040
And we can go directly from open defecation, high quality toilets.

325
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:51,050
And so these are just simulated results that a graduate student of mine did a while ago,

326
00:40:51,530 --> 00:41:00,530
showing that when you going from open defecation to low quality latrines, most of your benefits are indirect.

327
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:14,180
That is, you're indirectly lowering the transmission in the community by by having less contamination into the community.

328
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,920
And therefore, you've got these indirect effects have very little direct effects.

329
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:26,690
As you move into higher quality latrines, you're seeing this indirect effect.

330
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,919
But now you're seeing the green is the direct effects, the purple is the indirect tobacco.

331
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:35,540
So as and I should say that the x axis is increasing coverage.

332
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:46,070
In the community, in this case, high quality toilets verses in this in this graph would be low quality latrines.

333
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:52,790
And so as you increase coverage, just like we saw in the vaccine example, as you increase coverage,

334
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:59,740
your indirect effects should be increasing, whereas your direct effects are independent of how much coverage there are.

335
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:04,190
But we see that as if we go from low quality to high quality of latrines.

336
00:42:04,550 --> 00:42:10,760
We're increasing our we've got, you know, a perfect protective efficacy at 20%.

337
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,870
In this case where it's which is closer to 0% in this case.

338
00:42:17,770 --> 00:42:23,620
And then if you go from open defecation, that is no sanitation to high quality latrines.

339
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:31,540
We see some direct effects here and we see increasing indirect effects as you increase coverage.

340
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:41,130
And so who benefits from improved sanitation?

341
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:45,060
Again, the user of the household contamination or is reduced.

342
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:50,460
Community, the neighbors at the community, communities that produced.

343
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:57,900
And the idea here is we don't need 100% coverage to actually get these indirect effects.

344
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,740
And again, the traditional designs can't measure that we're protecting.

345
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:14,940
So here's an empirical study that was done in Ecuador by our group, basically looking at stunting as the outcome as opposed to diarrheal disease.

346
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:18,450
And looking at two different kinds of exposure, household level.

347
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:23,070
Do you have a bedroom, an improved latrine, or don't you? And a neighborhood level.

348
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:32,490
What's the proportion of improved latrines that are occurring within like in this case, a 500 meter radius of a given household?

349
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:41,820
And this is the average range from less than 40% to 100% in these different neighborhoods.

350
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:48,210
And we can basically see here that.

351
00:43:49,670 --> 00:44:02,390
This neighborhood affects sanitation coverage within 500 meters, has a much higher protective effect, 21 compared to whether or not you have it.

352
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:10,930
The trainer improves sanitation, which has a protective effect 2.70 and not not significant.

353
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:16,970
So this kind of shows graphically we've got the direct effect.

354
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:24,920
Whether or not you have the protection that you get by your household gets by having an improved latrine,

355
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:34,220
the indirect effect much stronger its protection based on the fact that your neighbors have.

356
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:43,500
Improved latrines. And this is you know, and so the key thing here is that the total effect.

357
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:46,950
Is dominated by the indirect effect.

358
00:44:48,210 --> 00:45:04,560
And again, through tradition, if you if you have a traditional design of measuring the effect of the protective effect of other sanitation,

359
00:45:05,010 --> 00:45:11,910
you would underestimate the protection because you wouldn't be measuring this indirect effect would only be measuring this threat to.

360
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:24,469
So before I get to the next question, I have a methodology question like so you were measuring the outcome based off

361
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:30,050
of like sickness in relation to the variable of this outcome was stunting.

362
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:32,300
Stunting. Yeah, that's right. Yeah.

363
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:41,420
And so you were so you were going household to household and also getting data of the children and the adults there.

364
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:44,480
Okay. Did you do it like the longitudinal?

365
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:49,790
Yeah, we were able to see it over time. So we saw the growth pattern.

366
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:51,079
In fact, I didn't. I presented it.

367
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:57,979
But we can actually show that the stunting occurs early on and then there's some catch up that happens, which is kind of common.

368
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,549
But then overall, they're still they wind up stunted at two years old,

369
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:06,200
which is really that's the that's the vulnerable time, the first two years of life.

370
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:10,430
We did that in Madagascar. Yes. Stunting was like really big.

371
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:15,080
Did you? Well, and the big question I have, because they know how difficult it is to get this data.

372
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:19,370
Did you work in collaboration with like the local clinics or did you go household to house or.

373
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,670
We have a large scale study there. So we have a field staff that goes.

374
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:27,470
Okay. Yeah. So we go in. This is a household level study.

375
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:35,420
Okay. We're measuring kids periodically, so not so much clinical data, but like going house to house.

376
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:42,620
Yeah. So we have a field staff project, nurses project staff field that are that are doing the commentary,

377
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:48,980
measuring child's height and weight and then also conducting surveys.

378
00:46:48,980 --> 00:47:02,230
And we collect all the exposure data. So I'm going to go little quickly over this so that we can get to the discussion.

379
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:10,650
But this is basically, again, similar type of model diagram that I showed you before this fact that, you know,

380
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:15,709
the interesting thing about inherent pathogens is you've got multiple pathways of transmission through having

381
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:26,510
talked about this water hygiene household between household transmission within household transmission.

382
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:35,120
Lots of studies, the empirical evidence showing this interdependency and the importance of the fact that you can see it in cohort studies,

383
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:44,209
meta analysis of randomized trials and in cross-sectional studies that you don't see the benefits of water,

384
00:47:44,210 --> 00:47:54,830
for instance, until you improve sanitation. And and this modeling study shows that results from a theoretical predict package the

385
00:47:54,830 --> 00:48:00,590
same thing this graph shows on the Y axis how much community transmission there is,

386
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:07,219
X-axis, how much household transmission there is, blue means the interventions are not working well.

387
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:10,310
It's not reducing the disease. Read.

388
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:17,850
The intervention is reducing the c cc that a water intervention to this is a water

389
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:24,150
quality intervention is helpful only when community and household transmission is low.

390
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,760
That is, if you've got too much transmission happening, people are going to get sick.

391
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:34,560
They don't get sick from the water. They'll get sick through other transmission pathways.

392
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:39,690
So you've got to deal with other transmission pathways first. For a water intervention is effective.

393
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:43,200
So that's what those previous studies are showing. That's what this model is.

394
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:55,860
You can look. So these are just two slides. I wanted to go over this just to give a sense of what case.

395
00:48:55,950 --> 00:49:06,300
I guess this is shifting gears into this other control design or case control design in which we can measure vaccine effectiveness.

396
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:15,210
We bring people into anybody who's coming into the clinic is for a respiratory disease that they have an influenza like illness or illness.

397
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:20,080
They can be enrolled. And then they're tested their cases.

398
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:24,190
If the test is positive, they're controls. If the test is negative.

399
00:49:24,850 --> 00:49:30,600
This is a nice schematic showing this. So we've got Centinela patients coming to the hospital.

400
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:35,139
We select a subgroup of those. Some test positive.

401
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:42,220
Some test negative. And the vaccine effectiveness is measured by this.

402
00:49:44,470 --> 00:49:54,160
That's odds ratio. So basically we get vaccination history, age and gender and co-morbidities from then.

403
00:49:54,190 --> 00:50:01,750
The outcome is whether or not they test positive or negative. The exposure is what is their vaccine status and then we can get an odds ratio.

404
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:16,180
So it's a nice way to an early low cost way to actually measure the vaccine effectiveness of something like influenza,

405
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:22,329
which is an important thing because again, the vaccine effectiveness of influenza is going to change from year to year because

406
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:28,780
the type of vaccine that is an important design and you'll see this literature a lot.

407
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:40,550
There are some, you know, strengths about this and some practical limitations here that I like you read.

408
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:50,180
And there's some references to these studies right here, the solid paper that you can get more detail on.

409
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:55,460
I just wanted to expose you to the fact that this study design exists, and it's an important study.

410
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:05,790
So we had a little bit of time for the discussion.

411
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:13,140
There are four topics. Four questions.

412
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:18,960
So much to measure the indirect effects intervention trials often randomized at the cluster level.

413
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:31,610
So that's why we talked about a vaccine study that looked at the indirect effects of the randomization at the at the individual level.

414
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:39,900
But the design to our design is that you randomize up in cluster level where you're comparing populations with without intervention.

415
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:43,140
So the first question is, what's the practical implications of that in mind?

416
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:51,000
It's a different kind of study design and might get in these vaccine randomized trials that we've seen for COVID.

417
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:56,960
What if we achieve herd immunity from COVID 19 by improving vaccine coverage?

418
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,660
Well, why would that likely not result in eradication?

419
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:05,979
We've talked about this a little bit prior to this lecture.

420
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:09,020
We applied herd protection concept to sanitation intervention.

421
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:15,850
Apply this concept to water and hygiene and talk about how these interventions are similar or different to sanitation.

422
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:23,620
And the last is the transmission of SDI is often due to a small group,

423
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:28,810
individuals that are high risk of spreading disease so that there are small group,

424
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:35,620
small, high risk groups that actually spread and are responsible for most transmission.

425
00:52:37,510 --> 00:52:43,030
The question is how might a random recruitment of participants in a study result in a biased finding,

426
00:52:43,390 --> 00:52:47,980
and what type of intervention would implement to eliminate STIs with this property?

427
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:50,340
Mr. President.

428
00:52:54,450 --> 00:53:34,720
So we'll give our 15 or so minutes to go through these questions in your small group in respect to the parts of the country that you know,

429
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:43,600
where you can see things or something.

430
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:50,870
Oh, oh, yeah.

431
00:53:50,880 --> 00:54:22,260
No worries. I'm sure you don't have to do that, because a lot of times I don't want to confirm that.

432
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:40,110
I mean, obviously, you have that information.

433
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:53,820
You know, I was trying to figure out what kind of course, every time.

434
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:59,100
So it's the site of the choice of that. Yeah.

435
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:13,150
Be like other times, not every time she says, oh, they have their hours long, you know.

436
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:19,410
But I decided I didn't like. I want to go to the apartment anyway.

437
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:28,660
Plus, I was making out of work and stuff like that. Oh, yeah.

438
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:43,110
Sounds great. Between clusters, I'm going to be assured that all the two things that you're going to hear bias.

439
00:55:43,200 --> 00:56:00,090
That sounds like the difference in relation to more like you said something that I think so.

440
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:18,080
Oh yeah. What are like I think I was right about that right away.

441
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:28,760
But it was I don't know. I guess it also depends on the distribution.

442
00:56:28,770 --> 00:56:33,360
Yes. There's nothing about no basis in your life.

443
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:43,740
That's true of spaced out conversation that goes with somebody.

444
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:50,220
You got married just a couple of years.

445
00:56:55,800 --> 00:57:06,720
I mean, like she's lost like a ton of fields to go to relinquish recipes, reputation, I think.

446
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:17,210
So that you're more, I don't know, like really get embarrassed or my concerns about it.

447
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:23,940
So even if I read that, that's how many places I could use one place.

448
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:38,280
Yeah. Unless already would offer. You know, like you would have to make sure that both clusters are destroyed similarly.

449
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:48,400
So it's like you would have to kind of recognized, oh, you're going to actually introduce bias has said that.

450
00:57:50,580 --> 00:58:21,660
Oh. Your really amazing eliminations brings going out with friends that are going to be, you know, start over.

451
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:28,540
So what if we go on iTunes now?

452
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:40,530
I think we've got a good amount of time to get along. There's still the enjoyment level I think I would have to eradicate.

453
00:58:42,070 --> 00:58:45,820
So yeah, they should be complete.

454
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:54,530
I think it would be like five.

455
00:58:54,910 --> 00:59:04,090
Well, there are still about 30 at so far this year.

456
00:59:06,430 --> 00:59:11,670
Oh yeah. Yeah. It sounds like nothing has been done.

457
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:15,310
I think every infected multiple times, even if you have immunity. Yeah, that's true.

458
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:22,760
Intentions are pretty good. We could have a pretty easy COVID to regret.

459
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:52,030
Hygiene is crucial for you. So I guess the question here is like this whole amble aspect of too sick to vaccinate doesn't have to change.

460
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:55,060
Herd immunity is just so sporadic.

461
00:59:55,760 --> 01:00:05,350
And guess I mean, yeah, I'm not sure about that either.

462
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:12,120
Yeah, because it's up for our community. Like the first six months where I was actually.

463
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:18,450
Yes. Essentially what I see as reduce, you know,

464
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:35,380
seem like they're not just the same products that you know but I don't think it's like much know secretary of state until next year.

465
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:43,480
Yeah, that's true. I actually say that is not even call yet.

466
01:00:43,960 --> 01:01:01,540
But this is what's interesting is that it's more like 150 types.

467
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:11,350
I guess it encompasses the eating more, I guess with injuries and higher use of humans.

468
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:26,110
You know, we don't have the research things like I can jump on able to be studied even when the

469
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:31,770
difference is actually 2017 shows that yeah intervention but hygiene is much more.

470
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:50,780
I know what I was thinking, but I think that was so I guess for you is concentrating on the residents.

471
01:01:51,010 --> 01:02:02,330
I mean, they're not anymore. But if you say something new, something has happened to virus.

472
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:14,259
Oh, I see. Okay. Yeah. So you like serious needs to be like water.

473
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:23,560
I think it was similar in a way. I mean, I just try to do so.

474
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:30,819
And it's not like the body is a person that can be able to.

475
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:39,850
You feel like you're not on stage now. So this is happening at this point.

476
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:51,150
Yeah. So I mean, it is probably no longer having more like that's.

477
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:54,930
I'm thinking it's like it'd be more systemic then.

478
01:02:55,120 --> 01:03:02,019
But why is it also I mean, if you also think about like boiling water even, you know,

479
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:11,200
it's about the duration of the water treatment or things like that are really for some degree.

480
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:32,830
I was going to ask my question about finding reservoirs because I was just thinking that it's more direct nature to the size of the reservoir.

481
01:03:33,290 --> 01:03:37,090
I think that it's only quicker way to cope with it.

482
01:03:38,100 --> 01:04:01,830
Like how do you know when you you it but so you've experienced reservoir and it's like you get high.

483
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:13,110
This sparked her interest in West London.

484
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:20,250
What is it that your doctor, for example, that you wash your hands, were in poor health because we're concerned about it?

485
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,380
Like how many years in the business before he started growing out?

486
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:27,750
There could be something directly like this.

487
01:04:29,690 --> 01:04:36,330
Well, I thought I was going to need to make a quick release.

488
01:04:36,480 --> 01:04:47,190
I'm not sure what the prognosis is there.

489
01:04:47,190 --> 01:05:02,190
And I'm like, we're not going to go on same sex education or education.

490
01:05:04,710 --> 01:05:08,430
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, it's okay.

491
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:14,580
It's like I get a lot of times and I'm like, I'm gonna do what I do.

492
01:05:17,010 --> 01:05:27,600
Yeah, the first one doesn't make sense. I was really trying to get back to this or I heard some of what happens to black families.

493
01:05:29,890 --> 01:05:33,600
I think it's time to turn to the concentration camps.

494
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:41,820
I don't know. So. I just don't think the balance of power is happy with that.

495
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,709
Yeah, she. I like another piece where.

496
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:54,200
It's great. So I'll look forward to something more because we do that anyway.

497
01:05:54,270 --> 01:06:03,100
Nice place, but I. And like the type of you that we've seen.

498
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:42,140
Think that's about it just being honest about the fact that I can be multitasking, having sexual habits.

499
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:46,340
Second, I think so.

500
01:06:46,490 --> 01:06:53,150
Yeah. Yeah, I think I think yeah.

501
01:06:54,510 --> 01:07:24,140
The same, you know, like basically everything I do from like, I don't know, like she's still like, yeah, like the U.S. is even doing something else.

502
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:49,380
I swear to God, it's so heavily reliant and it has to be like at first, thanks to the fact that I was working for the U.S.

503
01:07:51,710 --> 01:07:56,690
Yeah, I actually think that's right.

504
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:03,090
Oh, yeah. Well, this sort of thing.

505
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:12,110
Yeah. Well, actually, it's interesting.

506
01:08:12,110 --> 01:08:16,040
I saw my first semester before.

507
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:20,299
Okay, let's say that I think that reporting out.

508
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:24,880
Let me start with group one on question.

509
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:38,520
So we said that it'd be hard to get the groups. Describe it like there's going to be like inter-group interaction.

510
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:44,249
So like you're, you're randomizing on a community level instead of on like an individual level.

511
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:51,630
And so you're going to there's going to be bias in that sense. But what kind of bias it would be like?

512
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,030
I. I don't know. I'm sorry. What's this?

513
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:09,660
I mean, you're your. I think that just that this question is that you randomize an individual level you got to make sure.

514
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:19,030
And everything is equal about. People in one group or the other group meaning age distribution and all this kind of thing.

515
01:09:19,050 --> 01:09:24,010
So you knew, you randomize and that's why you've got lots of people in these studies, right?

516
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:27,760
So the same thing has happened at the community level, right?

517
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:33,080
The Western logistic problem with the challenge there.

518
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:39,740
How do you let your clusters might have life differences between the clusters you just have?

519
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:43,130
Yeah. You have to find communities that are identical.

520
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:47,420
Yeah. There's not that many communities out there. You're going to you're just.

521
01:09:47,840 --> 01:09:55,640
You're going to be limited to being able to guarantee everything is equal in those communities except for the intervention.

522
01:09:56,240 --> 01:10:00,170
It's hard enough with an individual, at least individually, can say, well, age is important,

523
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:05,720
community is important, but the community, there's so much community that is much more complicated.

524
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:15,649
So that's yeah, that's the main kind of practical limitation of the cluster level is that that assumption,

525
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:24,890
which is kind of the gold standard of randomized trials, kind of often not hard to satisfy.

526
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:45,879
So the second question of the group to. We talked about how this vaccine only confers partial immunity and not complete immunity.

527
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:52,570
And so that's already kind of an issue in giving or leading to eradication.

528
01:10:52,570 --> 01:10:57,370
And then also it's an RNA virus which mutates rapidly.

529
01:10:57,940 --> 01:11:02,470
Right. Right. That's going to be a fundamental issue.

530
01:11:03,190 --> 01:11:13,720
So we talk about herd immunity. In theory as this idea that are not first in line and easy to go away.

531
01:11:14,530 --> 01:11:17,890
But in reality and are not is.

532
01:11:20,290 --> 01:11:25,990
You know, associated with a given strain. And that strain may not exist anymore at some point.

533
01:11:27,850 --> 01:11:31,620
So. Yeah.

534
01:11:31,670 --> 01:11:38,810
So eradication is not something that we're even thinking about or talking about for something like Kobani.

535
01:11:39,470 --> 01:11:46,010
Even though herd immunity will still give us. Protection at the community level.

536
01:11:46,550 --> 01:11:55,160
And that's probably the most important thing for people to think about, is that indirect effects as opposed to it just kind of disappearing.

537
01:11:55,970 --> 01:12:03,930
It's been. So.

538
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:20,179
Question three. Good thing. It's something that we kind of discussed was like, well, you know, direct versus indirect.

539
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:26,030
But also, like, it is interesting to think about what is the difference between hygiene, hygiene versus sanitation.

540
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:31,240
And I guess, like one of the things that I kind of considered myself like through the work that I've done is like

541
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:35,870
how sanitation is more like on a community level versus like hygiene is something you do personally,

542
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:43,400
either for yourself or for your immediate family. So like, you know, when you do projects related to open defecation,

543
01:12:43,400 --> 01:12:49,190
that's like a sanitation issue versus like when you're doing projects related to like hand washing, that's like a hygiene issue.

544
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:57,290
And what's interesting is when you consider and also one of the reasons why I think water projects are some of the

545
01:12:57,290 --> 01:13:02,779
most difficult projects to work on is like you have a lot of complexities where you see a lot of overlap between

546
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:10,189
direct and indirect within all of that and how to like compartmentalize and categorize all of that within that can

547
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:15,890
be really complex and difficult on top of the fact that you might be dealing with like already entrenched like,

548
01:13:16,730 --> 01:13:20,840
like local government systems, national government systems,

549
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:27,589
and then also just behavioral systems that people are just used to going over to the creek and pooping and then going home.

550
01:13:27,590 --> 01:13:31,480
And how do you get people to change their behavior with that? That's what they're used to.

551
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:35,290
That can be really difficult. Yeah. So I mean.

552
01:13:35,290 --> 01:13:39,520
Yeah. Okay. For interventions that are imposed.

553
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:46,909
By someone else onto a community is can be very challenging because it's not necessarily

554
01:13:46,910 --> 01:13:52,340
appropriate in intervention for that community or that they had something in Madagascar.

555
01:13:52,580 --> 01:13:59,090
I never participated in this, but they called it [INAUDIBLE] shaming where they would go into it virtually.

556
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:12,320
That is a thing that happens. Shaming is a is of an intervention, which seems very backwards in how public health wants to engage with communities.

557
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:15,860
And that is a thing that's happening.

558
01:14:19,420 --> 01:14:24,760
Trying to change norms. Yeah. And they think that that's one way to change norms by this negative.

559
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:31,010
Dissociation to an activity. And so what?

560
01:14:34,290 --> 01:14:38,099
So how do how do they different in the context of indirect indirect effects, let's say.

561
01:14:38,100 --> 01:14:39,720
Lourdes, thank you.

562
01:14:40,180 --> 01:14:47,890
Well, I think like you could see definitely like if you got a population to stop open defecation that would like a lot of like drugs,

563
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:55,830
you know, a domino effect of water systems are going to be contaminated.

564
01:14:56,130 --> 01:15:04,320
Usually this feed into wells or pubs or the water that you use for cooking and cleaning, which would be indirect, you know,

565
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:12,030
like some of some of the more direct effects which also kind of goes into a mix between personal hygiene versus sanitation.

566
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,119
Some of the projects we worked on do depending on the interventions that you're working with.

567
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:24,179
It's like some people might already institute like chlorinated water at home versus like not chlorinated at all or boiling it.

568
01:15:24,180 --> 01:15:26,930
But then you have issues with like increased fluoride and stuff like that too,

569
01:15:26,940 --> 01:15:32,819
which also happens with it works against your teeth, but which were issues that we dealt with.

570
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:35,990
So, but. Yeah.

571
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,000
So there's just a lot of mixture between those two things.

572
01:15:39,060 --> 01:15:42,840
I think another thing like with like hygiene interventions with like handwashing,

573
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:47,460
you could argue that potentially there's like direct, but there's also some indirect,

574
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:51,090
especially if you're talking about a family unit, like you're protective,

575
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:56,160
you're offering indirect results to your children that they're eating more sanitary food as a result.

576
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:01,620
Okay. And so and in water and with hygiene.

577
01:16:01,900 --> 01:16:06,479
You as an individual are doing something. Yeah. And that doing something.

578
01:16:06,480 --> 01:16:09,150
If you're washing your hands, you're protecting yourself.

579
01:16:09,150 --> 01:16:16,350
You're less likely to touch your mouth, nose, eyes, whatever that will result in an infection.

580
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:25,300
But then the indirect effects. Which I think you mentioned is basically the idea, just like we've been talking about that.

581
01:16:25,690 --> 01:16:29,290
If enough people are washing their hands that people are drinking.

582
01:16:31,440 --> 01:16:35,840
Uncontaminated water infection transmission in the community is lower.

583
01:16:36,210 --> 01:16:42,250
So even if you aren't washing your hands, there's less contamination of contaminated high.

584
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:54,390
So there is that indirect effect. But then poor sanitation, like what is and I, I alluded to a little bit, but what is a direct effect of sanitation?

585
01:16:54,640 --> 01:17:00,700
Like, how would you even think of. There's not real.

586
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:05,540
I mean, really, it's all about indirect effects in a way in which it's supposed to operate,

587
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:09,440
is supposed to prevent the material from entering the environment.

588
01:17:09,800 --> 01:17:13,180
You could argue, and I think I do argue in the slides that.

589
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:21,760
You know, a guy just going into a latrine that's not improved, you might get infected.

590
01:17:22,330 --> 01:17:29,680
That is just not sanitary latrine. And so that might be having an improved latrine minimizes that.

591
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:37,360
So that's a direct effect. You could you can I think you could argue that's a direct effect as opposed to the community effect.

592
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:43,509
But the power of sanitation is really about minimizing contamination of the whole community.

593
01:17:43,510 --> 01:17:48,160
And therefore, it's really not all about indirect effects, not about direct effects,

594
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:55,059
which then talks about here means that we need to be aware of that when we're measuring.

595
01:17:55,060 --> 01:18:03,640
And so even in this huge wash intervention that was funded by Gates at the level a $20 million.

596
01:18:06,130 --> 01:18:14,290
They didn't. They had compounds that were had interventions right next to compounds that didn't have interventions.

597
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:20,649
And so you can imagine that. And you didn't have light coverage.

598
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:29,410
So therefore, you there was no indirect there was an appreciable amount of indirect effects, possibly because coverage was very low.

599
01:18:30,820 --> 01:18:37,479
And therefore, I would argue that the Senate really didn't and they didn't see strong benefits.

600
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:45,790
And therefore. But the reason is likely because the design of the intervention as opposed to whether or not sanitation can reduce the disease.

601
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:55,630
So even in this huge $20 million study, they didn't really appreciate the power of indirect effects when they were designing that intervention,

602
01:18:56,950 --> 01:19:06,279
that intervention in that randomized trial. I think it's important to distinguish probably wasn't as big of a deal for, again,

603
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:12,319
water and handedness and hygiene because there's more indirect effects you can benefit.

604
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:17,890
And so, one, get those benefits regardless of the coverage.

605
01:19:17,950 --> 01:19:21,670
As we saw, direct effects are independent of coverage.

606
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:25,240
The indirect benefits increased with increasing coverage.

607
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:32,110
Last question for.

608
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:49,780
So one thing that we've talked about is that random recruitment can be members of a small population and kind of missing those key spreaders.

609
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:57,639
And also, like depends on the geographic location of where you're doing those randomized recruitment of participants.

610
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:58,899
Because in more urban areas, you.
