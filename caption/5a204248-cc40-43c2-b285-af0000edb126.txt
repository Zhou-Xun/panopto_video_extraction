1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:10,590
I knew he was missing a teacher.

2
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:58,680
So I'm people in this country I used to like, you know, I don't think this morning is it just me or is it cold?

3
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:10,290
And it's always nice to hear what what there is to enjoy in winter.

4
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:21,380
We are in our last week of classes and it's number 12 here and it's going to be one more quiz.

5
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:30,600
And again, we'll have 13 total quizzes to drop three of your lowest scores and you can have your grade based on your ten best scores.

6
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,500
So with that, let's go over quiz number 12.

7
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:45,120
And the first question was, where do the two major goals of lifestyle intervention for the prevention of diabetes?

8
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:55,420
And there were two correct answers in this particular question to reduce weight by 7% and to increase physical activity to 150 minutes per week.

9
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:04,280
I think everybody got that one correct. The next question was increasing diet quality alone.

10
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:08,630
There were no other goals for this particular intervention.

11
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:13,340
By following the dietary guidelines for Americans versus the typical American

12
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,080
diet resulted in much of the following in middle aged women with obesity.

13
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:24,140
The answer was a decreased or systolic blood pressure by about six millimeters of mercury,

14
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:28,370
but it didn't have any significant effects on the other things that are listed here.

15
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,280
But you got that one correct. So last question.

16
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:43,780
Studies on insulin sensitivity with and without weight loss have demonstrated that if there was one correct answer for this.

17
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,820
Insulin sensitivity significantly increases with weight loss regardless of exercise.

18
00:02:50,830 --> 00:03:01,750
And there were some there was I received a question about this, this and there are two we have two correct answers and two to discuss this.

19
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:07,540
I'm providing you with that slide that we used in lecture last week.

20
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,770
Okay. So far, what's work?

21
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:20,470
Looking at insulin sensitivity in the first example here is with weight, with diet,

22
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,950
with only weight loss, with just weight loss, we're seeing an improvement in insulin sensitivity.

23
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:41,710
Next example, next treatment for lost weight loss, less exercise training, and we see an increase before and after.

24
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:50,050
But when we add exercise to the weight loss regimen, there's no difference between these two terms in insulin sensitivity.

25
00:03:53,650 --> 00:04:04,690
Besides GFR, it was this kind of work done, similar studies looking at insulin sensitivity before and after training.

26
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:12,610
And in this particular example, we're looking at just the effect of exercise here without weight loss.

27
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:23,920
And when we look at the pre training in yellow and post training in blue, there's not a difference, a significant difference in insulin sensitivity.

28
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:30,970
And one more study was done with the lab.

29
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:38,500
In this particular example, there's more details provided in the remote training program.

30
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:48,070
That level of intensity was about 50% of the maximum oxygen uptake, 40 minute sections, six six days per week.

31
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:59,110
And there was no weight loss in this. So here's before training and here's after training and there's no improvement in insulin sensitivity.

32
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:06,970
It's one sensitivity was done in this particular study three days after the last bout of exercise.

33
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:13,360
And when you combine physical activity, this training regiment.

34
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,850
With with a 10% weight loss. That's when you see an increase in insulin sensitivity.

35
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,920
Now, acutely, within hours after you perform that exercise, there is a modest increase in insulin sensitivity,

36
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:31,970
but that declines very rapidly within within several hours.

37
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,820
Okay. All right.

38
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:43,670
Any questions about that one? One where some people did not answer yes.

39
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,500
Should this list as it should be, it took a while. Have to take a lot of muscle.

40
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:55,760
Muscle to form muscle only. Mostly muscle, but muscle, liver and adipose tissue to some extent.

41
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,850
Okay. All right.

42
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,720
So pharmacologic treatments for obesity.

43
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:15,090
This is a presentation that I've modified that was previously given by Amy Rothberg, who is over in the medical center.

44
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:22,640
She runs the Weight Loss Clinic, which employs some of our graduates from this program.

45
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,400
And let's I'm going to walk through this literally.

46
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:41,470
This is a topic of that interesting, controversial, and it's something that is in the news nowadays.

47
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,170
There's a lot of interest in drugs to treat obesity.

48
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:51,950
And we will walk through this. And you had as part of your reading assignment that the news that came out this summer about this

49
00:06:51,950 --> 00:07:00,580
new drug that was going to revolutionize all of these recommendations for this particular job.

50
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:10,620
Is it approved yet? But it's cut. It's getting closer. So for learning objectives, explain who qualifies for weight loss medication.

51
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:22,440
Identify the different classes of drugs. Identify the multiple choice question used for weight loss or an either mechanism of action.

52
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:30,920
And then describe the effectiveness and limitations of pharmacological interventions for weight loss.

53
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:49,020
So those are the three learning objectives for today. So this particular table describes the complications associated with obesity and

54
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:55,889
percent weight loss required for therapeutic benefit and so for diabetes prevention.

55
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:01,980
We talked about we talked about the diabetes prevention program studies that were done here in the U.S.,

56
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:16,140
in Finland and India, also of 3 to 10% will give you a significant therapeutic benefit of hypertension.

57
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:21,299
You need a little bit more work with weight loss by two and perhaps 15% in some

58
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:28,050
instances to see if there was a significant therapeutic benefit for dyslipidemia,

59
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:45,390
3 to 15%. And there's hemoglobin A1 C or to significantly lower this is the goal for weight loss would be a 3 to 15%.

60
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,739
For old again with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

61
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,180
There's no FDA approved medication specifically for this condition.

62
00:08:56,630 --> 00:09:01,900
So the underlying conditions are addressed, one of which is weight loss.

63
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:06,710
So if somebody achieves a 10% weight loss, it can improve liver function.

64
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:18,590
And then for pain associated with osteoarthritis and I guess obstructive sleep apnea would fall into this category,

65
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:28,940
whereas if you achieve a 5 to 10% weight loss or you would significantly improve symptoms associated with these conditions.

66
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,850
And then finally, for polycystic ovarian syndrome or infertility,

67
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:45,680
a weight loss of 5 to 15% optimal would be more than 10% to significantly have a therapeutic benefit in this particular circumstance.

68
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:55,549
Yes, I just want to clarify. So this is this weight loss request and this is I'm saying just for me,

69
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:04,750
if the patient is and has obesity, because all of this can occur with some reason.

70
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,180
Yes. Yes. Okay.

71
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:27,090
Yeah. So in terms of where we put the part of the times in which the different interventions are recommended,

72
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:34,410
the first of which is lifestyle with weight loss and increasing physical activity.

73
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:41,890
But you should know, this is kind of like the the foundation for everything else.

74
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:47,190
In other words, you can't expect to have a successful weight loss intervention without it.

75
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:53,970
That would include with pharmacotherapy. In regard to today's lecture.

76
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:59,940
You can't just give somebody one of these drugs that's used to treat use as a treatment for

77
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,990
weight loss and expect there to be a significant benefit without lifestyle intervention.

78
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:11,130
So it doesn't work by itself. The same would be true for bariatric surgery, which we'll talk about on Wednesday.

79
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:18,510
Without this lifestyle change, you would not expect to see a significant benefit either.

80
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:29,850
So it's something that has to be used for all of these treatments, and it's integral to all of these weight loss.

81
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:40,069
To talk about this multi-component lifestyle intervention, if needs to be intensive with frequent one on one visits,

82
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:44,790
serve with an individual health care, professional or group.

83
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:53,460
And now the recommendation is that you want to have at least 16 visits during this initial phase.

84
00:11:53,670 --> 00:12:02,880
It needs to be extensive. It needs to have follow up for a longer period of time, a long period of time greater than or equal to two years.

85
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:14,430
It needs to be multi-component, reduce caloric intake, increase dietary fiber, increasing the quality of the food that someone would consume.

86
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:27,300
It would adhere to the recommendations for physical activity, which we discussed last time in 150 minutes per week of moderate physical activity.

87
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:42,360
In terms of the goal here, moderate weight loss, 5 to 7% initially, and to maintain 3 to 4% over the long haul for four years afterward.

88
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,760
And this has been demonstrated to be effective in the diabetes prevention program.

89
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
And I would look ahead studies that we talked about earlier.

90
00:12:52,800 --> 00:13:00,150
So as we start to talk about drugs that are used to produce weight loss,

91
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:08,340
we need to realize that there are a number of medications that people are put on for various reasons that contribute to weight gain.

92
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:16,020
So there are for example, there are certain types of drugs that people take for type two diabetes,

93
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:24,540
such as insulin, sulfonylureas and the Vaso limiting diet.

94
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:29,430
All of these drugs can actually cause a significant increase in body weight.

95
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:37,320
They control diabetes. But over the course of an extended period of use, they can increase one's body weight as well.

96
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:45,630
There are also a number of drugs that are used to treat hypertension that can increase body weight as well.

97
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,290
So briefly mentioned the different types of antihypertensive, drugs, beta blockers,

98
00:13:52,440 --> 00:14:01,100
calcium channel blockers are generic receptor blockers, live diuretics and size II diuretics.

99
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:05,880
All of these can have extended use can lead to significant weight gain.

100
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,690
There are classes of antihistamines that are non sedating.

101
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:20,190
These are, if used for an extended period of time, can also lead to a significant weight gain.

102
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:30,960
And then if someone has been treated for, let's say, chronic pain and they're on milligram doses of glucocorticoids,

103
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:41,820
this can also lead to significant weight as can oral contraceptive pills containing just your own.

104
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:52,329
Can also lead to significant weight gain. There are some anticonvulsant drugs that can do this, as well as some psychoactive medications.

105
00:14:52,330 --> 00:15:04,180
So some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRI AIS can contribute to weight gain and some atypical antipsychotic drugs can do this as well.

106
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:12,459
So if you if a physician notices that their patient has an increased body weight over an extended period of time,

107
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:18,070
after they start a particular medication, they may adjust their medications to address this issue.

108
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:35,290
So the whole idea in terms of the mechanisms to reduce somebody's body weight, if they qualify for this particular intervention,

109
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:49,900
is to make people feel full when their stomach perhaps is half empty, and other words to make you feel full when you have eaten less food.

110
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:58,600
And in this instance, you would be not over consuming, which could be leading to someone's positive energy balance.

111
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:08,799
Having said that, people who are on these medications are encouraged to eat a nutritionally dense

112
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,810
diet in terms of it being complete for their micronutrient requirements.

113
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:21,910
But the caloric density would be reduced, and it's reduced because you don't feel like eating more than you normally would.

114
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:35,130
So the mechanism of action for all of these drugs that neurotransmitters.

115
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:44,310
So they walk. They can work mostly through those types of mechanisms, I should say first.

116
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,250
But there are some drugs that have different actions.

117
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:59,610
So the drug, the lipid lipase blocker, is an example of a drug that can reduce macronutrient intake.

118
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,320
And I'll go over this in more detail. This is a drug called I Ally.

119
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:12,900
It's our list that essentially blocks the light based enzymes that break down lipids in your gut so you don't absorb them.

120
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:21,870
And this is a mechanism of action. There are other classes of drugs within this mechanism.

121
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:31,350
The drugs that block carbohydrate uptake, they're not prescribed very often, but they're available.

122
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:40,050
Other types of drugs can affect energy expenditure by increasing thermogenesis.

123
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:45,930
And these drugs would increase metabolism. So you're dissipating more energy.

124
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:50,849
And this is kind of like exercising.

125
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:57,320
You're increasing somebody's metabolic energy output.

126
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:03,420
And this is a way to expend energy so that your net caloric balance starts to decline.

127
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:08,280
That met caloric balance is reduced by increasing energy expenditure.

128
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:22,670
There are drugs that can affect that metabolism and storage so they can affect fat synthesis and breakdown.

129
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,860
And this can be affected by certain types of drugs.

130
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:34,909
And I'll give you an example of this in a moment. And then there are a number of drugs,

131
00:18:34,910 --> 00:18:40,819
and this is pretty much the target now for therapeutic intervention for a number of different drugs that are in clinical trials.

132
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:46,730
And some that have been approved is to affect the sensation of satiety, essentially.

133
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:52,870
So give them a drug that makes them feel fuller and the mechanism of action.

134
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,000
This drug is working within the centers in the brain that control appetite and satiety.

135
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:07,850
So in this particular table in this, you've got neurotransmitters that increase food intake.

136
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:12,550
We've discussed some of these and neurotransmitters that decrease food intake.

137
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:21,080
And the idea here is to provide some targets or I should say drugs that target these pathways,

138
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:29,390
either blocking ones that increase appetite or enhancing ones that decrease appetite.

139
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:45,040
So this is a list of all of the different drugs now that can be prescribed by people who have obesity to reduce their body weight.

140
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:53,800
The phentermine is a drug that has been approved for a very long time, since 1959.

141
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:57,730
And it is essentially a stimulant.

142
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:06,459
And it's at one time had been the number one drug that was prescribed to treat people with obesity.

143
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,050
And there's a number of limitations with this particular drug that I'll mention here in a minute.

144
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:19,270
The next drug that is approved and is still available for the treatment of obesity is this Orlistat.

145
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:26,440
Its trade name is Ally. At one time it was by prescription only.

146
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:32,290
But now you can buy this at a lower dosage, at an drugstore or a grocery store.

147
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:40,549
And this one has been approved since 1999. Now I haven't listed the drugs that were discontinued,

148
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:47,450
but there were a number of for various reasons because they often produce side effects

149
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:52,820
that were significantly problematic and subsequently removed from the marketplace.

150
00:20:52,940 --> 00:21:00,880
So everything you see here is currently approved. So center mean and topiramate.

151
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,700
You know, our stance for extended release is a combination of two different drugs.

152
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:10,989
The phentermine, it's the same powerful mimetic.

153
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:22,960
It's the one that increases energy expenditure. It's combined with topiramate, which is thought to be a gas receptor modulator.

154
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:35,680
This one is approved in 2012. Here's another combination drug naltrexone, extended release and the appropriate extended release.

155
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,590
This has two mechanisms of action.

156
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:51,370
It operates as a dopamine or noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, and it the naltrexone is the opiate new opioid receptor antagonist.

157
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:57,370
So it's having two mechanisms of activation.

158
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:13,389
This one has been available since 2014, glued, tied three milligrams, dosed once weekly through an injection.

159
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,500
And then there was a pill form where you would take it twice daily.

160
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:27,070
This one's mechanism of action is the GLP one receptor, so it's a GLP one receptor agonist.

161
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:38,769
It was approved in December of 2014, and you might see different variations of this particular drug used in different circumstances.

162
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:44,830
So GLP one receptor agonists have been used to treat people who have diabetes.

163
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:51,100
And for that application, let's see the drug have a different name.

164
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:59,020
If it's appears in a different dosage or a different form, such as in a pill or an injection, it might also have a different trade name as well.

165
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:05,860
And then yeah. So just to clarify for the guilty one receptor agonists,

166
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:13,329
have they been they've been approved for use in both types, like both for type vs and weight loss.

167
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:21,670
Okay. Yes. Yeah. Just recently. So we'll talk about that here in a minute.

168
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:27,070
But you see commercials for all the time now, right, which is approved for treatment of diabetes,

169
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:38,889
specifically about how it's being that the work around this going that now Semaglutide is the the GOP

170
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:48,790
one agonist that was approved just in the summer of 2021 for the treatment of sleep specifically.

171
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:55,540
So it's a different kind of a preparation that's the same molecule,

172
00:23:56,130 --> 00:24:01,510
but the dosage might be a little bit different and they're given different names because of that.

173
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:13,200
So in terms of the drugs that work by affecting appetite and satiety,

174
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:21,510
we talked in the beginning of the semester about at different centers of the brain that affect appetite and satiety.

175
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,540
So here's the in this particular diagram,

176
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:42,300
you have the see neurons or the neurons which are intermingled together and the mechanism of action here is affected by different types of drugs.

177
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,950
So here's that for me. This is the same path of mimetic drug.

178
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,410
It's going to act in the center as well.

179
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:58,740
You also have Naltrexone, which is something you're opioid receptors antagonist that's affecting this as well.

180
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:02,450
And this receptor is expressed throughout other centers in the brain.

181
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:14,220
It's just in this diagram, it's just shown here. So remember, the new opioid pathway was important in terms of its effect on the hedonic system.

182
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:25,620
Right. So if you block that receptor that on a drive to consume food based on its pleasurable characteristics, that goes away.

183
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:35,520
Here's Semaglutide and liraglutide inhibiting the are I should say I'm sorry,

184
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:47,490
activating the GLP one receptor agonist so that activates the receptor and in that way centrally it reduces appetite.

185
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,430
It also works peripherally as well.

186
00:25:51,210 --> 00:26:04,500
So we talked about how GLP one axis and increase and increases insulin release and it inhibits gastric emptying so it makes you feel fuller.

187
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:20,370
However, the peripheral effects of the G.O.P. one agonist can also cause constipation and GI upset associated with that part of the mechanism as well.

188
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:26,610
So we'll talk about the side effects here in a bit more as we go through this.

189
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:38,670
So here's the serotonin neurons now that can inhibit appetite through its projections that reach

190
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:45,930
the pumps in the acute nucleus of the hypothalamus having its inhibitory effect on appetite.

191
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:55,800
So let's move over here. We're looking at higher centers of the brain and this is where topiramate and

192
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:06,240
ibuprofen work one by perhaps through the amino acid enhancing its effects.

193
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:15,060
And then appropriate is a dopamine neuro epinephrine uptake inhibitor, re uptake inhibitor.

194
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:22,410
So work on higher centers of the brain and it's through this action that it reduces.

195
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,110
Okay. So let's talk about now all indications for weight loss medication.

196
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:46,440
So if you have someone who seeks treatment for weight loss and they are initially put on a behavioral intensive lifestyle

197
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:54,150
modification program and they aren't able to achieve those goals of weight loss within a six month period of time.

198
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,770
They may consider pharmacologic therapy for weight loss.

199
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,830
So this is kind of the first thing that has to be demonstrated.

200
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:09,770
Okay. So who qualifies for you to be prescribed these drugs?

201
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:14,870
So these are the indications for use.

202
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:29,210
And this is based on clinical trial data. People have to have a BMI of 30 or more or they have a BMI of 27 with a comorbid condition.

203
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:39,230
They have to understand is that drug therapy is adjunctive to lifestyle intervention.

204
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:46,160
And again, it's the lifestyle intervention that's the foundation for any kind of weight loss program.

205
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:56,870
People who start drug therapy need to understand that there are actually medications for weight loss.

206
00:28:56,870 --> 00:29:05,209
And to be realistic, that the clinical indication here is for Americans it goes to 7%.

207
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:13,550
We're trying to achieve a level that improves symptoms or conditions that would prevent diabetes,

208
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:24,610
that would treat people who have comorbid conditions such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, insomnia, status.

209
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:33,110
That's the goal of the therapy. It's not a therapy that you would give somebody because they their sole purpose is to change their appearance.

210
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:37,490
And this has become problematic most recently.

211
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,050
We'll talk about that in a minute.

212
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:53,000
People who are prescribed these drugs should demonstrate a commitment to change their lifestyle in order to undergo this type of therapy.

213
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:02,180
And without that, if if you have someone who thinks that they can just take this medication without doing anything else,

214
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:06,980
they're not going to be successful at achieving the goals, their goals.

215
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:18,470
And as I mentioned here, the lifestyle modification has to be in place and they have to comply with the use of the

216
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:23,840
medication because there can be some significant side effects associated with misuse.

217
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,110
The other thing that needs to be done in this is a prescreening.

218
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:42,920
So you want to prescreen individuals for psychiatric conditions that would not be well under the umbrella of treatment in this in this scenario.

219
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:47,660
So people who have eating disorders would not be prescribed a weight loss drug.

220
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:56,450
So there needs to be an extensive psychiatric evaluation of these individuals before they're prescribed these treatments.

221
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:02,049
So again,

222
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:16,420
the goal here with lifestyle treatments is to achieve this 7 to 10% initial weight loss at one year and then to continue the drug for the duration.

223
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:26,050
So once you're on these drugs to treat, to lose weight and to maintain that weight loss, you're on them for the duration.

224
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Okay. It's not a quick fix.

225
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:33,819
Once you go off the meds, people's appetite comes back and they gain the weight.

226
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:44,670
Right back to what the BMI kit was taken earlier in the semester.

227
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:48,400
Lots of differences for different populations.

228
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:53,410
So is this all across the board or in Asian populations?

229
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:57,430
We're used to traveling alone? That's a really good question.

230
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,200
I don't know the way this is written.

231
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:05,350
It was from a physician who practices here.

232
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:13,130
And you would think that there would be more details about different different populations.

233
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:22,480
I don't have that information. That's a really good question. I mean, our lifestyle changes.

234
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:27,910
How is that determined? Because obviously one tribe might try again.

235
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:39,910
Absolutely. So there's been a lot of questions about that expectation, especially with people who undergo bariatric surgery.

236
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,450
And how do you demonstrate that, first of all,

237
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:55,000
and how do you draw the line between who qualifies and who doesn't qualify based on that with an intensive lifestyle modification program?

238
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:01,660
That was something that follows the guidelines, or was it something that they tried on their own with just advice?

239
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,490
That's a really good question, too.

240
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:18,610
So as you can see now, there's there's some vagueness in terms of these criteria for which somebody would qualify for this medication.

241
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:23,110
And the decision is made between the physician and the patient.

242
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:32,319
They decide if they want to try this. But the foundation, again, is lifestyle modification.

243
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,040
And without that, it's not known how this is going to work. Okay.

244
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:49,449
So the other thing that needs to be evaluated is how well the program is working or the drug is working along with lifestyle modifications,

245
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:56,950
and this needs to be continually evaluated. So there would be a follow up after somebody is prescribed on a regular basis to

246
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:01,990
determine how well it's working and whether or not the side effects are tolerable.

247
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,009
So this is this is really important.

248
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:15,940
If they're experiencing side effects that are significantly problematic, that the drug would be discontinued.

249
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:32,680
So there is a certain amount of stigma attached to medication for this particular purpose.

250
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:47,620
The other issue in terms of the durability of the effects is there are some classes of psychoactive drugs that are over many years.

251
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:53,380
So, for example, there are some drugs over a 5 to 10 period of usage.

252
00:34:53,380 --> 00:35:03,940
They lose their effectiveness. And as a consequence, some of these drugs may not last over a space of several years.

253
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:14,620
So people need to monitor their or their lifestyle activities.

254
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:21,970
Their physician's office will monitor their body weight over this period of time and determine whether or not the drugs are still working.

255
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,640
And if they're not, they may be prescribed something else.

256
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:36,160
But again, the lifestyle modification must be in place for the duration in order for any of these drugs to work.

257
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:46,390
Okay. So one of the drugs that's now available over the counter is Orlistat.

258
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,670
This is the drug that was approved in 1999.

259
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:59,240
It's prescribed now at a dose of 100 and.

260
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:08,030
20 milligrams of the over-the-counter over-the-counter dosage is 60 milligrams and produces some moderate, modest weight loss.

261
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:18,140
And we'll show you more details about what I mean about that. And this works through the mechanism of affecting fat absorption.

262
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:23,300
So instead of absorbing it from your diet, you excrete them.

263
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:30,110
And there's also the potential for somebody to lack sufficient fat soluble vitamins on this drug.

264
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:42,410
It's a risk, and people might be encouraged to increase their fat soluble intake by through their diet to prevent this from happening.

265
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:51,800
But with this one, this one, there's a number of significant side effects beyond that that are really, really limiting.

266
00:36:53,230 --> 00:37:06,020
So it's the prescription meds. The 120 milligrams is expensive, but the side effects are what really prevents people from continuing using this drill.

267
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:15,790
So here's the diagram here where the food and the fats are broken down to three fatty acids.

268
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,660
Close your eyes and they're absorbed in the gut.

269
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:25,270
But what Orlistat does is it activates the arms like faces.

270
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:30,420
So you're unable to hydrolyzed fat or 30% less.

271
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:37,390
And as a consequence, you excrete more fat and you lose weight through that mechanism.

272
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:44,350
Now, what happens to the lipid when it goes into your large intestine?

273
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,070
Well, it can produce all kinds of problems with, you know, leakage,

274
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:59,650
with unpleasant sensations in your gut, with diarrhea and everything that goes along with that.

275
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:06,790
As a consequence of having more lipid in your kitchen as it passes through your gastrointestinal tract,

276
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:13,830
and it probably disrupts your microbiota as well because there's more looking that you sort of part of this.

277
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:23,720
There have been a number of clinical trials in this particular trial and dose trial.

278
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:30,140
It was a long term study over four years and it was a double blind study.

279
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:40,040
The prospective study that had a lot of patients, over 3000 patients, and they were given Orlistat that that 120 milligrams dosage versus placebo.

280
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,060
And this was given three times a day.

281
00:38:43,940 --> 00:39:01,730
They at baseline two participants had a BMI of 30 and so 80% of them had a BMI of 30 or more, and then 21% of them had impaired glucose tolerance.

282
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:11,960
And the primary endpoint in the Zahn Dose trial was to look at the incidence of diabetes and change in body weight.

283
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:20,870
However, a trial looking at whether or not this intervention would prevent the development of type two diabetes.

284
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:37,640
So here are the results. Here is on the x axis going all the way up to 208 weeks and on the Y axis, cumulative incidence of diabetes and percent.

285
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:46,339
And you have here the different lines correspond to different groups of patients with and without impaired

286
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:57,079
glucose tolerance and with placebo or are lost at the line here at the very top of the graph showing you

287
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:11,360
placebo plus lifestyle in people with impaired because tolerance we get an incident diabetes rate of around

288
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:20,270
30% with the same group of individuals with or less that lifestyle who have this impaired glucose tolerance.

289
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,310
We get a 45% reduction in incident diabetes.

290
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:34,420
Look at people who don't have impaired glucose tolerance but are at risk at developing type two diabetes.

291
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:39,510
We see, again, people with lifestyle intervention.

292
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,680
We have to protect people's tolerance. The value is here.

293
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:56,710
It's a little bit less than 10%. And then when we look at those individuals who are given Orlistat, there's a 37.3% reduction in it's in the diabetes.

294
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:04,760
So in terms of the amount of weight loss that people experienced over this period of time, it was about 5.8%.

295
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:11,490
So this is four years, 5.8% or I'm sorry, 5.8 kilograms.

296
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:16,530
In the placebo group, there was a three kilogram weight loss during the Santos trial.

297
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:23,519
So this is again a drug that is self-limiting because of the side effects,

298
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,700
the GI side effects associated with so many people can't continue using this drug.

299
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:35,040
The long time ago when I first started teaching this class,

300
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:46,290
Chuck Branch was a endocrinology and we talked just this portion of the lecture and he would tell this interesting story.

301
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:51,540
When he was a physician in Chicago, he had a patient who was a bus driver,

302
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:59,970
and the bus driver had wanted to lose weight and have based on this type of data,

303
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:06,750
he wanted to prevent our data or have a better way of treating his glucose tolerance.

304
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:09,960
And so he was prescribed this drug.

305
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:20,130
So the bus driver, remember, they're sitting for a long time A they have brakes at certain time points, but they're they're always on the job.

306
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:25,920
You give them. Orlistat, what do you think happens? Yeah.

307
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,790
So you've got a bathroom. You got to go to the bathroom a lot more. Exactly.

308
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:33,900
It made this patient so mad he wanted to beat up the physician.

309
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:37,770
I mean, it was to that extent, the side effects were that problematic.

310
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:46,440
So this is a self-limiting drug in terms of treating weight loss for a weight loss medication.

311
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,500
Yes. What about this kind of drug for people?

312
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:55,260
We did the bath tub analogy, people with a smaller bathtub, but then they might not necessarily need weight loss.

313
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,440
But the fact that it would.

314
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:02,580
It would. So you're absorbing less less fat, right?

315
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:09,330
So you're absorbing fewer calories. So it would be shutting off the tap water going into the tub.

316
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:17,380
That's kind of the analogy. Yeah. Okay.

317
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:28,990
The next one, the drug that has been approved since 1959, is a parcel mimetic and it's sold under the trade name and it packs.

318
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,430
It's a stimulant. It's an appetite suppressant.

319
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:42,969
There are some drugs that are similar to this that are sold over the counter, and you can buy these at health food stores.

320
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:53,020
And even in grocery stores nowadays, they pretty much stimulate they prevent calorie intake through this stimulant effect.

321
00:43:54,370 --> 00:44:07,150
They can increase your metabolism through this mechanism, but it also increases your heart rate and blood pressure and so on.

322
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,690
So it's a stimulant, so it's a controlled substance.

323
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:21,070
So the physician that prescribes this medication has to have a license to prescribe this type of a class of drugs,

324
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:31,540
these types of controlled substances. So once you go on these types of drugs, 5 to 15% weight loss within weeks,

325
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:41,080
but it's limited because it's only approved for a short period of time because of the side effects associated with it.

326
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,670
So three months is the duration in which this drug can be prescribed.

327
00:44:48,050 --> 00:44:54,590
It used to be the number one drug prescribed for weight loss.

328
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:58,790
That has changed a lot now with the introduction of these new drugs.

329
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:11,350
So if this is a stimulant, it has a problem in regard to reading addiction.

330
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:22,460
So there's a dependency risk. It can raise your blood pressure and your heart rate and impair sleep and it can affect glycemic control.

331
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,340
So these are all reasons as to why the use of this drug is limited in terms of

332
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:32,800
who gets it and the time at which you are taking this particular medication.

333
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:41,320
So tolerance is variable and some physicians still prescribe this medication.

334
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:48,100
Perhaps in the future, we'll see very, very little of this being used for weight loss.

335
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:57,190
So there were a limited number of randomized controlled trials with this particular drug.

336
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:05,620
And in this particular type of drug, it's it can be used for a short period of time.

337
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:12,460
So within these RC TS that the duration of which they're following weight loss was 24 weeks.

338
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,690
The dosage based on the results.

339
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,020
You had about a 3.6 kg more lost and then are mean.

340
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:26,860
There's no data on side effects.

341
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:36,310
There's not going to be any long term data on these types of drug studies because it's not approved for going out beyond three months.

342
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:43,540
Additionally, it is associated with this.

343
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:50,920
So about about a 3.6 kg more weight loss with this particular drug.

344
00:46:55,330 --> 00:47:02,560
Now, this is an interesting drug in that it wasn't initially designed for weight loss.

345
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:09,730
So pure makes a drug that let's say novel anti epileptic drug.

346
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:19,810
So patients who had epilepsy were prescribed this drug to reduce the epileptic events that they had.

347
00:47:20,650 --> 00:47:25,210
People who are taking this anti-seizure medication were at the recent wake,

348
00:47:25,990 --> 00:47:32,950
and it was based on these observations that they started to use this drug as a weight loss medication.

349
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,820
So the mechanisms as to how it produces weight loss aren't completely understood.

350
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:44,530
They know that it can block voltage and its sodium channels.

351
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:56,890
They know that it can augment gamma aminobutyric acid activity and activate and enhance the activation of GABA a receptors.

352
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:02,920
And then there are some other mechanisms that are listed here that are attributed to the effects of topiramate.

353
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:07,580
Why it has this anti appetite effect.

354
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:20,170
Here's a graph showing you a number of different trials looking at topiramate versus placebo after six months.

355
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:26,680
And this is the main difference in percent of weight loss shown here.

356
00:48:27,370 --> 00:48:35,500
And here's the open diagram or the open diamond here. This is the individual studies now that were included in this data.

357
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:50,930
So Benjamin and Topiramate have been combined in one particular drug and drug companies do this all the

358
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:56,000
time where they have one drug that's somewhat effective and another drug that's also somewhat effective.

359
00:48:56,390 --> 00:49:06,080
When you combine the two, they're more effective. And because it's new in that you have two different things put together that creates a new drug,

360
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:12,470
you can patent that drug and receive significant revenues from this new drug.

361
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:18,500
It's actually composed of two old drugs, epidemics and topiramate.

362
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:23,050
And the trade name here is semi.

363
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:33,620
It produces moderate weight loss to 7 to 8% because it the drug has entra meaning it's you need

364
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:40,250
to have a license to administer controlled substances such as this type of drug to patients.

365
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:45,830
There's a lower dose of phentermine that's used in this application.

366
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:51,860
So a lot of the side effects that you might experience from head trauma and alone

367
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:57,499
are reduced because there's a lower dose because you have another drug added to it.

368
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:04,430
And that's the topiramate. However, this looks pretty good in terms of moderately weight loss.

369
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:13,790
This one, there's mandatory recommendations in terms of birth control for women, for childbearing status.

370
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:21,799
So in other words, if women are women are taking this or people who are planning to get pregnant, I should say,

371
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:31,820
are taking this, they need to have proof that they are using two forms of contraception to prevent pregnancy.

372
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:38,030
It is because during pregnancy that there's a high risk of cleft palate.

373
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:43,730
So for people who are trying to get pregnant, they would not be prescribed this drug.

374
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:58,180
So let's look at the effectiveness of this particular drug.

375
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:11,620
Here we have two different trials in the trial and the Concord trial, and we're looking at the mean percent change in body weight.

376
00:51:12,010 --> 00:51:22,030
And then also the proportion of patients who had a 5% loss in body weight during these trial sessions or one year time period.

377
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:39,340
So in the Sydney we have a 67% of patients after one year of being on the drug reaching this goal, 5% or more versus placebo.

378
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:45,400
In her trial, they used two different doses of the drug.

379
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:55,420
And here we have a 62 and a 70% plus number of patients achieving this 5% weight loss goal versus placebo.

380
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:01,630
And then in this particular column, you see the mean percent change in body weight.

381
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:07,710
So 10.9% versus the placebo, 1.6 and then 7.8.

382
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:19,870
9.8 versus the placebo 1.2. And looking at the change that occurs over time, you see in red here,

383
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:29,560
the placebo and in blue here that the treatment, the drug I'm showing you that we get this weight loss that occurs.

384
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:37,330
And with that, you also get an improvement in a reduction in hemoglobin compared to the placebo.

385
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,780
It's also important to include data from people who drop out of this.

386
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:50,559
So with these drugs and with other drugs as well, drop out because of many different reasons.

387
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,070
And one of which is they can't tolerate the drug.

388
00:52:55,180 --> 00:53:03,920
So they take people out of the trial and they record the last particular data point either.

389
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:08,230
In this case, it would be weight or hemoglobin C and they might carry that forward.

390
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:15,400
So that would be the intention to treat group. So with the intention to treat group here, the values 2.7,

391
00:53:15,410 --> 00:53:25,840
9.4 for weight in terms of percent loss and then for hemoglobin C 1.2, 1.6, which is identical to what we saw.

392
00:53:27,010 --> 00:53:33,820
So when you're looking at these studies or any kind of studies where there is an intervention in a randomized controlled trial,

393
00:53:34,390 --> 00:53:42,940
you look for information on the intent to treat group in terms of where did they think shopping and perhaps why did they drop out of the study?

394
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:54,310
Yes. The population that also needed to take contraceptives with this medication, was there any less success rate?

395
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:58,899
Because you might be taking it as good question.

396
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:04,330
I don't have don't know the details to answer that question, but that is certainly a relevant question.

397
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:17,260
So for a long time, the types are the number of drugs that were available were fairly limited.

398
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:24,970
And then the CLP one agonist came into play.

399
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:35,110
And one of the first of which was this like a glue tied in this case the trade name is extend up on this particular drug.

400
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:45,860
That said, it's an injection. Remember, the GLP one is a treatment, increases the release of insulin.

401
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:52,900
It slows down gastric emptying. And it has this effect on inhibiting appetite, essentially.

402
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:00,040
So it creates more satiety.

403
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:06,580
So you're have a tendency to be done with a meal sooner and consume fewer calories.

404
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:14,950
It has other reasons for its prescription and its use,

405
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:22,900
and that's to lower people's blood glucose and those who have impaired glucose tolerance and type two diabetes mellitus.

406
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:30,760
So there are other names for this drug because that was one of the earlier additions of this type of a drug.

407
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:40,180
And depending on the application, whether you're taking tablets in the form of these types of drugs or you're taking injections,

408
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,890
but it's essentially the same thing as GLP one agonist.

409
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:58,930
So this particular drug sent out was administered three milligrams in terms of its daily dosing,

410
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:04,390
subcutaneous daily dosing, and it was has been shown to be very effective.

411
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:11,380
So here's a study published in 2017 in The Lancet, three years earlier,

412
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:19,410
a good time versus placebo for type two diabetes, risk reduction in weight management, individuals with prediabetes.

413
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:33,730
So this is a randomized double blind control. And in this particular group you have the placebo group and then you have the lines broken,

414
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:39,470
the graph broken down in terms of normal glycemia and people with prediabetes.

415
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:45,740
So the dashed lines are people on tied for a placebo.

416
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,870
I'm sure the blue lines are people on their good side and the placebo group, which is great.

417
00:56:51,770 --> 00:57:00,800
And then that's the uninterrupted line for the dash line regiment corresponds to less severe are people with pre-diabetes.

418
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:05,540
And as you can see, it didn't matter which condition that they had.

419
00:57:05,870 --> 00:57:10,730
The lines fall on top of one another in terms of change in body weight percentage.

420
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:20,770
So for people who dropped out of the study, this is the they included the data here.

421
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:23,900
This is the last observation carried forward.

422
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,940
So this would represent everybody,

423
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:33,980
even people who dropped out of the study and this last data point that they have just a little bit higher compared to the others.

424
00:57:37,670 --> 00:57:49,550
So here you have 2% of patients who who had lost at least 5%, 10% or 15% of their weight baseline.

425
00:57:50,000 --> 00:58:02,450
So people have lost 5%, 63%, 31% have lost 10% and 14% who lost at least 50% on this particular medication.

426
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:14,390
So the next one I'm going to talk about is this drug called Contrave.

427
00:58:15,110 --> 00:58:24,530
And it's another combination drug. It's the Propionate extended release and Naltrexone extended release.

428
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:32,060
So it's a combination of these two different drugs sold out into the training country.

429
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:42,920
It acts centrally by controlling cravings so that appropriate to remember it's the drug that affects

430
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:52,250
the uptake of epinephrine and below the mean and the naltrexone blocks a new opioid receptor.

431
00:58:53,540 --> 00:59:07,399
So you are affecting these pleasant characteristics of foods, so they're not so appealing and you're also so you're reducing appetite in that way.

432
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:11,450
Who doesn't look as appealing as it once did when you're on this particular job?

433
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:18,110
This particular drug can be very effective for people who have an eating disorder.

434
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:26,900
So this one is prescribed in that particular group of individuals in terms of weight loss.

435
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:38,240
It produces a moderate, honest weight loss. And for people who are taking drugs to control pain.

436
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:45,650
So this would be opioid analgesics or people who consume alcohol.

437
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:49,100
You would not want to prescribe this drug for these individuals.

438
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:55,100
So if you're on pain meds that work through the opioid receptor, you're blocking the opioid receptors.

439
00:59:55,100 --> 01:00:00,020
This isn't going to be a good treatment. So people who might have osteoarthritis,

440
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:06,770
who might be prescribed a drug to control the pain in that particular instance would not be prescribed this drug.

441
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:13,370
How well does it work? Well, here's the data.

442
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:21,530
So this is contrails plus behavior modification or behavior modification alone in terms of weight change from baseline.

443
01:00:22,640 --> 01:00:31,190
So we see here with just behavior modification about seven kilograms of weight loss.

444
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:36,320
This is the intention to treat group. We're only seeing about 5% in this application.

445
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:49,790
So 7% from baseline here. When we look at the people who are on the behavioral therapy plus the drug, we're getting greater weight loss.

446
01:00:50,540 --> 01:00:55,310
So the weight reduction from baseline here was more than 10%.

447
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:07,010
But let's look here at the intention to treat data here, 8.1% representing an 11% decline in body weight from baseline.

448
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:11,060
We should note that down here,

449
01:01:11,510 --> 01:01:24,710
it says 42% of the people in the control group discontinued the study and placebo group had a lot of people discontinuing the study.

450
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,690
So there's a lot of people who dropped out of this study for various reasons.

451
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:40,670
So in terms of using prescribing this drug, there's going to be a lot of issues related to their side effects that would prohibit the use.

452
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:47,050
Yeah. I miss the part you said about binge eating.

453
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:54,010
Yeah, you said not for binge eating disorder or it can help with people who have binge eating disorder.

454
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:59,140
All right. So this one would potentially be described prescribed to someone with an eating disorder.

455
01:01:59,740 --> 01:02:08,010
Yes. With binge eating disorder. All right.

456
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:13,830
So like many things, there's this off label prescriptions business.

457
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:24,179
So people may have a condition and diabetes or they might be at a very high risk or they might be pre-diabetic

458
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:33,509
and their physician may prescribe them a medication and saying that the purpose perhaps is for diabetes,

459
01:02:33,510 --> 01:02:36,900
but they know they're going to see weight loss with the drug.

460
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:40,680
So this is the off label use of a particular drug.

461
01:02:42,570 --> 01:02:48,570
So these are drugs that are approved, etc., that are approved for diabetes treatment, but not for weight loss.

462
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:57,330
And the first of which is conformance. So metformin is very inexpensive, very effective in reducing fasting,

463
01:02:57,990 --> 01:03:05,219
glucose and hemoglobin, and its mechanisms of action is not very well understood.

464
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:11,760
We know that it reduces hepatic glucose output and there are.

465
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:17,140
Side effects that are well known. It's a fairly well tolerated drug.

466
01:03:17,410 --> 01:03:23,230
And if you do have side effects, there are strategies to reduce them.

467
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:36,430
It is very low cost. And in some instances, I've heard you talk about some pharmacies that prescribe this market that give this to patients for free.

468
01:03:36,670 --> 01:03:44,860
It's that inexpensive. I think the cost but you gave this lecture was maybe $25 a month in the prescription.

469
01:03:45,190 --> 01:03:52,900
So it's very inexpensive, it's very effective. And a lot of people who are on this drug can experience a modest weight loss of 1 to 2%.

470
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:04,250
There's another class of drugs that's used to treat diabetes, and this is the sodium glucose cotransporter inhibitors.

471
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:11,280
Here you have four different drugs for different peoples here.

472
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:20,280
We have this little kind of three sigma jardiance and so Stelle Glatt tro.

473
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:27,540
And these are different types. These are trade names for different types of drugs to treat the same thing.

474
01:04:27,540 --> 01:04:31,139
So that essentially what they do is they inhibit the sodium,

475
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:38,790
glucose transport two mechanism in the kidneys, and you essentially are not reabsorbed in glucose.

476
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:49,080
So you pick it out and it is effective in controlling blood glucose use for people who have type two diabetes,

477
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:57,910
perhaps alone or in combination with other drugs. And people who are on this particular medication can lose 3% of their weight from baseline.

478
01:04:58,390 --> 01:05:00,900
You know, these are relatively new.

479
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:09,550
There are complications with this particular drug, as there are with many different drugs that increase in urinary tract infections.

480
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:17,940
So if you're putting out more glucose, you provide more substrate for the microbiota that inhabits your urinary tract.

481
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:25,920
That's a side effect of these types of drugs. Okay.

482
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:36,930
Now let's get to the drugs that are you've heard a lot of in the news about you have received lots of attention.

483
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:41,880
And this drug is semaglutide.

484
01:05:42,570 --> 01:05:57,000
This is the drug that goes under different names marketed by pharmaceutical companies Ozempic used for the treatment of type two diabetes and legally,

485
01:05:57,120 --> 01:06:01,050
which has been recently approved for for weight loss.

486
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:15,670
So here is a study published in The Lancet looking at the efficacy and safety of semaglutide for weight loss in patients with diabetes.

487
01:06:15,670 --> 01:06:21,720
This is a randomized double blind placebo active, controlled, dose ranging trial, phase two trial.

488
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:26,580
So this graph is kind of hard to read. I'm to walk through this.

489
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:31,160
So on the top you have estimated change in body weight percent.

490
01:06:31,870 --> 01:06:36,810
The bottom you have observed mean change in body weight percentage.

491
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:54,210
So on the x axis you have different doses semaglutide ranging from 0.05 milligrams, increasing up to 2.4 milligrams.

492
01:06:54,780 --> 01:07:02,260
And then there are some different applications. So you have semaglutide and semaglutide.

493
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:10,040
And the explanation between the difference to this is here.

494
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:16,480
So you have people who were in these different groups.

495
01:07:16,530 --> 01:07:23,790
Here's the different ranges of the semaglutide. And they were incrementally dosed for up to four weeks.

496
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:28,950
And then you have learned from the type which is shown here.

497
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:36,210
And then the FDA or fast dose escalation.

498
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:48,270
So we're back here. The FDA was for people who were given the drugs and initially giving all of this all of these treatments were given

499
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:53,670
in a stepwise fashion and given a little bit of drug and increased it over time until they reached the target dose.

500
01:07:54,980 --> 01:08:02,060
With that f e group. They were given the dose of medication much quicker than the virus here.

501
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:04,610
Anyway, looking at the highest dose,

502
01:08:05,270 --> 01:08:15,919
24 milligrams semaglutide you see a 16% weight loss in semaglutide retired given at the same dose with a fast escalation,

503
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:23,180
you get a greater weight loss. So you have in trial and on treatment only different colors of bars here.

504
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:26,510
And then you compare that to Liraglutide.

505
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:34,150
Directly tied. I'm sorry I pronounce that wrong. Three milligrams and you see a much better effect.

506
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,500
So even though it's essentially the same drug,

507
01:08:38,590 --> 01:08:45,520
the preparations differ a little bit and there is a greater effect with the secondary

508
01:08:45,610 --> 01:08:49,540
time where some modification of that molecule that made it more effective.

509
01:08:50,830 --> 01:09:00,760
And then the control group kept the placebo, which had the lowest change in weight during the randomized controlled trial.

510
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:10,520
So that make the drug semaglutide injection once per week.

511
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:15,320
And you have here the different doses that are approved for the treatment of type two diabetes.

512
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:24,589
You've seen in the news now that it is off label prescription has increased to such an extent that people who have

513
01:09:24,590 --> 01:09:30,770
Type two diabetes might not be able to get it because there's such a demand for this drug because of this effect.

514
01:09:30,770 --> 01:09:32,360
Because of its effect on weight loss.

515
01:09:34,130 --> 01:09:44,990
The drug that has been approved for weight loss is this would Goji now which is approved for chronic weight management was approved and some are 21.

516
01:09:46,070 --> 01:09:58,070
But why do you think we're not seeing more Gobi prescriptions instead of people getting this and rethink the differences?

517
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:07,380
It's the same drug once prescribed for people who have type two diabetes.

518
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:11,340
One prescribed for people. Four just for weight loss.

519
01:10:12,030 --> 01:10:19,470
Yeah. Insurance coverage. Yes, exactly. And you can get your insurance to pay the 1200 dollars a month the paper is.

520
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:28,650
But if you get a prescription for four to reduce your body weight for people who have to meet the criteria for this,

521
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:33,540
you line 30 or 27 with co-morbidities.

522
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:38,940
Insurance companies aren't going to cover it. So that's the difference.

523
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:47,280
So that's why you're seeing a lot of off label prescriptions using that strategy to get more people.

524
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:52,180
And again, the in these trials, it was a combination.

525
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:58,380
You have the foundation, the lifestyle modifications, plus the drug that effect.

526
01:10:58,710 --> 01:11:04,290
You can't just give people the drug along and expected the benefits.

527
01:11:04,980 --> 01:11:10,980
So here's a here's a comparison of all of these. There have been studies comparing them.

528
01:11:10,980 --> 01:11:17,820
And here's what you get when you look at this. So this is a percent weight loss in one year based on a clinical trial results.

529
01:11:17,850 --> 01:11:23,610
3% with that. Well, you can't prescribe Benjamin for more than three months, so no data here.

530
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:33,150
Better made pyramid in 8%, type 6% and naltrexone appropriate about 4%.

531
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:40,050
And again, most insurance companies won't cover the cost for weight loss drugs.

532
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:47,700
They view this as vanity for the article.

533
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:57,600
All of this because the ACA required money to cover obesity related medications like sunglasses.

534
01:11:58,630 --> 01:12:02,010
Right. Right. They're not mandated.

535
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:07,130
Yes. Yes. So. So if you have type two diabetes.

536
01:12:07,380 --> 01:12:12,380
Well, yeah. You find someone trying to prescribe. There's not the same mandate for people.

537
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:18,660
Right. It's also really interesting because they think it's not like obesity epidemic.

538
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:27,390
It's a contradiction. Right. And it it goes back to the insurance companies cover something but not others.

539
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:30,870
So they'll cover bariatric surgery. Many of them will.

540
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:35,220
So we'll talk about that on Wednesday. But why would they cover that?

541
01:12:35,550 --> 01:12:41,070
We're talking about a procedure that costs 15 to $25000 versus, yes,

542
01:12:41,730 --> 01:12:44,850
it would add up over time because you'd have to be on the rest of your life

543
01:12:45,010 --> 01:12:50,340
right now when these drugs go off and they're no longer 1200 dollars a month.

544
01:12:50,850 --> 01:12:54,570
So Liraglutide is getting close to where it's going to go off patent.

545
01:12:55,410 --> 01:13:03,960
So you might see some modification of that drug and its use end up being more

546
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:12,150
prescribed more frequently to address that with not being as expensive as.

547
01:13:14,520 --> 01:13:18,030
Okay. Real quick here.

548
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:27,690
That shows that the tide this that the study that came out this summer that had lots of social media posts and it

549
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:36,330
was interviews so chairs that the three different dosages and the different injectable pens that were used here.

550
01:13:37,080 --> 01:13:40,470
This is essentially a combination of medications.

551
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:44,590
It's a GLP one agonist and IP agonist.

552
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:49,150
So this is how it's different than the other things that we've talked about.

553
01:13:49,170 --> 01:13:52,410
You've got two different molecules here.

554
01:13:52,650 --> 01:14:04,590
There's agonist for two different receptors. And so they are affecting appetite in the brain, reducing your drive to consume calories.

555
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:08,520
It increases has the increase in effect.

556
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,130
So it's increasing the release of insulin.

557
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:30,120
And it's been shown to preserve the cell mass is in adipose tissue and can increase lipolysis and lipo excuse me,

558
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:39,090
the ability of adipocytes to function more efficiently and appropriately.

559
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:45,840
I tried to follow this up. It's let's see what comes out in terms of the main effects.

560
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:51,240
So the main effects, the primary one of the primary outcomes, if you prescribe this drug,

561
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:59,570
the people who have BMI 30 and who don't have other complications, they might have elevated lipids, but they didn't have diarrhea.

562
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:03,170
What is it about the results that they got?

563
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:08,870
So at the lowest dose, they saw about a 15% weight loss.

564
01:15:09,290 --> 01:15:12,520
Five mg, ten milligrams.

565
01:15:12,530 --> 01:15:16,010
They got about 19 and a half percent loss in the 15 milligrams.

566
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:24,080
They got a 20%, 21% loss compared to placebo, which is the lifestyle is low in about three years.

567
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:29,570
So very effective in achieving this weight loss over a 72 week period.

568
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:37,700
And more importantly, we're looking here at the percent of people who could achieve at least a 5% weight loss during this time.

569
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:51,920
So we're looking at the lowest dose, 85, 89 for the next 93, 91% in people in 15 milligrams versus 34% with a just lifestyle modification alone,

570
01:15:52,490 --> 01:15:55,790
which is kind of like what we saw in the diabetes prevention program.

571
01:15:56,390 --> 01:16:08,480
And then the adverse events affected less than 5% of events occurring in more than 5%

572
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:13,220
of the percentage that's greater than or equal to 5% of the participant participants.

573
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:19,250
So here are the side effects nausea, diarrhea and constipation.

574
01:16:20,120 --> 01:16:24,290
So these are the adverse effects that people experience while on this drug.

575
01:16:25,430 --> 01:16:31,690
So here is the description of how they started the program.

576
01:16:31,700 --> 01:16:38,690
So they had a two week screening. They gave them the low dose and then they slowly increased it.

577
01:16:38,840 --> 01:16:43,340
So people who were on placebo, they had this placebo injection.

578
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:53,060
People who were on the five mg dose, they were had one week to a shorter period of time.

579
01:16:53,060 --> 01:16:59,650
It's four weeks, I should say, to get used to that dose. And then they were five mg and the other dosing regiments,

580
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:06,850
they bumped them up two and a half milligrams after the four weeks of getting used to the dose and then to continue the dosage.

581
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:13,830
And then they had a follow up. So here is the details.

582
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:18,920
This is in the appendix and I posted this on a canvas if you wanted to know the details.

583
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:28,040
This occurred during COVID. So if you notice deaths, the deaths in the X groups, it was just a few people who died who were in this trial.

584
01:17:28,490 --> 01:17:33,050
They had Kovic, and that's why they are thought to have died during this time period.

585
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:37,820
So it gives you all of the reasons for people dropping out of the final assessment.

586
01:17:39,110 --> 01:17:48,500
And then here's the data again showing you the overall percentage weight change, the change that occurred over time compared to placebo.

587
01:17:48,860 --> 01:17:54,020
And then it gives you here this intent to trigger including people who dropped out of the group.

588
01:17:54,500 --> 01:17:59,300
So very effective in terms of promoting this weight loss.

589
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:08,690
Will also mentioned that there was another study using Choose at the time for people with Type two diabetes.

590
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:14,060
And in that particular trial, they were comparing it to.

591
01:18:17,090 --> 01:18:23,370
Left tied and they were looking at outcomes in terms of how well they controlled diabetes.

592
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:26,669
And it was after 40 weeks of treatment,

593
01:18:26,670 --> 01:18:36,780
it was very effective in that regard in terms of lowering fasting blood glucose and in terms of improving insulin sensitivity.

594
01:18:37,290 --> 01:18:45,120
So there will be two applications for this particular drug and one for type two diabetes and one for weight loss.

595
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:53,730
And again, it's expensive. It's going to be about 1200 bucks a month, perhaps more secure, some secondary endpoints.

596
01:18:53,940 --> 01:19:01,980
They're looking at physical functioning, which improves with this is the all data from all at the time groups.

597
01:19:02,790 --> 01:19:11,909
So we're seeing a change in baseline weight in terms of kilograms change in

598
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:19,140
physical function improved and here's your placebo group estimated difference,

599
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:28,229
systolic blood pressure, improved percentage change and triglycerides on HDL cholesterol.

600
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:31,650
HDL cholesterol went up considerably, 88 milligrams.

601
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:41,790
Fasting insulin went down. So we're getting a very nice improvement in insulin sensitivity as people didn't have diabetes.

602
01:19:41,790 --> 01:19:50,399
But we're seeing this improvement. This could potentially be news for people who have pre-diabetes change, diastolic pressure.

603
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:54,090
We also have an improvement in diastolic blood pressure here.

604
01:19:55,410 --> 01:19:57,833
And here's that percent change in the level of total.
