00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:09,226
Hi there, how's your week been going?

2
00:00:09,226 --> 00:00:14,203
What major stressors have you had this
week, several exams, perhaps a big

3
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:20,380
deadline at work, or concerns over
a friend or family member's health?

4
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,790
Think about how you feel
in these moments of stress.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,020
Does your heart rate increase?

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,646
Do you feel yourself tensing up?

7
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:31,749
If the stressor persists for
a long period of time,

8
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:36,510
perhaps you find yourself
feeling nauseous or tired.

9
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:40,270
Once the stressor has passed,
do you feel different than before?

10
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:45,260
Perhaps you find that you get sick,
or you have a change in temperament.

11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:47,012
All of these feelings and

12
00:00:47,012 --> 00:00:51,854
responses are parts of the stress
response, first described by Dr.

13
00:00:51,854 --> 00:00:56,962
Hans Selye in a 1950 landmark paper
in the British Medical Journal.

14
00:00:56,962 --> 00:01:02,940
In that paper Dr. Selye described what he
called the general adaptation syndrome,

15
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,560
or the GAS, and the consequent diseases
of adaptation that are due to stress.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,202
In this module, we will learn about the
general adaptation syndrome, the model,

17
00:01:14,202 --> 00:01:18,716
and examine how the hypothesized pathways
linking chronic stress to disease can

18
00:01:18,716 --> 00:01:22,931
impact at the individual level.

19
00:01:22,931 --> 00:01:26,450
The general adaptation syndrome
includes three stages.

20
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,003
Let's start with the first stage,
the alarm stage.

21
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:35,310
The alarm stage occurs as the initial
stage after a stress exposure.

22
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,563
It is our fight or flight response.

23
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:42,820
We receive a burst of energy that
helps us to respond to that stressor.

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,520
That burst of energy comes from
the release of catecholamines and

25
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,260
cortisol which are released in a way
to give us some energy needed.

26
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,370
As well as the release of
catecholamines and cortisol,

27
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:00,210
other hormones such as growth hormone and
reproductive hormones are suppressed.

28
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:06,080
Because those systems aren't needed as
we respond to an urgent acute stressor.

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,390
So let's think of an example.

30
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,004
Assume that you were running
in your neighborhood and

31
00:02:11,004 --> 00:02:12,639
a large dog started chasing you.

32
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:16,560
Might be fearful that that dog
could bite you or attack you.

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,565
The release of catecholamines and

34
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:22,994
cortisol would help your body react
quickly by increasing your heart rate,

35
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:27,641
increasing your respiration rate, and
increasing the blood glucose levels.

36
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:32,246
All of these things will give your
tissues the energy needed to be able to

37
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:35,471
respond to that stressor and
move more quickly and

38
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:40,610
focus your attention in a way
to solve that situation.

39
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,670
The next stage in a general adaptation
syndrome is called the resistance stage.

40
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:51,781
The resistance stage is when your body
tries to repair itself after the initial

41
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:57,162
shock of a stressor and attempts to
resist or adapt to that stressor.

42
00:02:57,162 --> 00:03:02,717
However, what we see is that if the body
experiences a persistent stressor, that

43
00:03:02,717 --> 00:03:08,597
the resistance stage characteristically
will have long-term hypercortisol levels

44
00:03:08,597 --> 00:03:14,840
and suppression of the other hormones that
are not needed for the stress response.

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,580
This impact of long-term hypercortisolism
and long-term hormone suppression of other

46
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,670
systems is not effective in the long term,
and it can be detrimental to our health.

47
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,920
When this occurs, we might experience
symptoms related to irritability,

48
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,720
frustration, and poor concentration.

49
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,849
So for example,

50
00:03:35,849 --> 00:03:40,688
if we have that initial shock of a stress
related to a dog chasing us, and

51
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:46,520
you've successfully gotten away, we hope
that our body will work to repair itself.

52
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,687
Our heart rate will become lower,
our blood pressure will return to normal,

53
00:03:50,687 --> 00:03:54,320
and our glucose levels
will go back to baseline.

54
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:59,002
This is all due to the ability of our
body to perform at peak to resist

55
00:03:59,002 --> 00:04:00,182
that stressor.

56
00:04:00,182 --> 00:04:04,490
We put all of our best efforts forward
to resist the stressor of a potential

57
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,930
injury by dog attack.

58
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:11,904
But what happens if that stressor
occurs in the context of many other

59
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:16,192
stressors that are ongoing or
may persist for a long time?

60
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:21,101
Perhaps you are dealing with a major
deadline at work on a project that has

61
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:23,620
lasted several weeks.

62
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,000
Your body will continue to maintain
high functioning as best it can

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,310
to help you respond to this stressor.

64
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,410
It will allow you to be hyper-focused and

65
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:36,600
very attentive to
the needs of the project.

66
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,340
You will continue to secrete hormones for
the stress response and

67
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:45,032
maintain higher levels of blood pressure
and higher levels of glucose to maintain

68
00:04:45,032 --> 00:04:47,964
the energy you needed to
get through that project.

69
00:04:47,964 --> 00:04:52,613
However, if this stressor continues
to persist for a long time, or

70
00:04:52,613 --> 00:04:56,789
you experience multiple other
stressors during that time.

71
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:01,673
Your energy reserves may become so
depleted that your body is susceptible to

72
00:05:01,673 --> 00:05:07,037
being unable to fend off other stressors,
including illnesses during this time.

73
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:12,708
This is why you might often find that you
get sick after a period of high stress.

74
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:16,416
If the resistance stage continues for
too long,

75
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:20,948
you may move past that stage and
into the exhaustion phase.

76
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:25,096
The exhaustion phase of the general
adaptation syndrome is when

77
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:29,750
we experience depletion of
energy due to chronic stressors.

78
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:34,976
We are characterizing this stage
due to symptoms such as a weakened

79
00:05:34,976 --> 00:05:39,922
immune system and a significant
loss of homeostasis that makes

80
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:44,887
us feel fatigued, burnt out,
perhaps depressed or anxious.

81
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:49,048
As we see on the graph here showing
the amount of resistance to stress

82
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:52,625
at different phases of
the general adaptation syndrome,

83
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:57,730
we see that the exhaustion phase has
very little resistance to stress.

84
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,790
So if we are experiencing
the exhaustion phase,

85
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:06,380
we are very vulnerable to the negative
impacts due to additional stressors.

86
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,750
Understanding these different responses
and how they relate to each other

87
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,342
may help us understand how stress
can result in disease outcomes.
