1
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,801
After watching this video, you will be
able to use problem mode as a template to

2
00:00:14,801 --> 00:00:19,060
learn how to run any
generalized linear model.

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,684
At the end of the last video,

4
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:24,888
I told you that it's important to
remember those two characteristics for

5
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:28,617
each generalized linear model,
the link and the distribution.

6
00:00:28,617 --> 00:00:31,920
And now you're going to see why.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,833
SAS has a PROC called PROC GENMOD that
can be used to run any generalized

8
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:37,921
linear model.

9
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:40,801
The template works more or less like that.

10
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:45,765
You specify your data set as always,
the model is the same as always with

11
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:49,762
your outcome at the left and
your exposures at the right.

12
00:00:49,762 --> 00:00:54,380
Then now in the options for
the model statement separated by a slash,

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,317
you see that you have to specify
the distribution using the dist option and

14
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:02,080
the link using the link option.

15
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:06,841
Depending on what options you put there,
you will be able to run a linear logistics

16
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:10,890
question or low binomial,
so let's see how.

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:15,670
So now let's look at how we would run a
linear regression model with PROC GENMOD.

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,323
You just need to remember the link and
the distribution, which are identity and

19
00:01:20,323 --> 00:01:24,090
normal in this case respective.

20
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,682
And this is how your
syntax will look like.

21
00:01:26,682 --> 00:01:30,226
You just remember to add normal
in the distribution option and

22
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:31,941
identity in the link option.

23
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:35,902
And you will be running
a linear regression model.

24
00:01:35,902 --> 00:01:40,008
This will be equivalent to running
it with PROC REG or with PROC GLM.

25
00:01:40,008 --> 00:01:41,370
And yes, believe it or

26
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:45,686
not you have three different ways of
running linear regression in SAS.

27
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:50,107
Now, just because you can do linear
regression with PROC REG mode does not

28
00:01:50,107 --> 00:01:52,402
mean that we're going to switch now.

29
00:01:52,402 --> 00:01:55,027
There are important reasons
to stick with PRO REG or

30
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:59,330
PRO GLM when you're just doing
a simple linear regression.

31
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:03,480
And the same logic applies
to logistic regression.

32
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,557
That was a joke.

33
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:08,116
Anyway, if you take into account that for
logistic regression,

34
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:12,850
your distribution is the binomial
distribution and the link is logic.

35
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,384
You can use a template and

36
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:20,240
run a logistic regression model with
PROC GLM equivalent to PROC LOGISTIC.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,865
So now that we know how to use a template,

38
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:28,550
we will move into an U2 models first
person and later log binomial.

39
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,780
In summery in this video we
used PROC GENMOD as a template

40
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,530
to learn how to run any
generalized linear model

41
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,891
in the next video we will
start with the Poisson model.
