1
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:18,550
For many of us thinking about what might be a confounder or an alternate explanation for associations of interest isn't all that hard.

2
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:25,569
It really channels the inner skeptic in ourselves. You might think about watching the news where you see a news story coming out

3
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:29,200
between some risk factor and some new outcome that you think to yourself,

4
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:32,830
Is that really what's happening? Or is there another explanation?

5
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,389
While it's easy for many of us to think about what might be a confounder,

6
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:42,820
it's often very challenging for students and many of us to think about how you

7
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:47,860
predict the directionality of biases that can be introduced by confounding.

8
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,809
In this module,

9
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:57,760
we'll walk through several different examples of confounding and talk about how we can predict the directionality of bias due to confounding.

10
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:02,050
We'll talk about what it means to be a positive and a negative confounder,

11
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:09,850
and then we'll talk at the end just very briefly about how you can assess how big the magnitude of confounding might be,

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:13,980
depending on the relationship of your confounder with your exposure and your outcome.

13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,810
So let's start with an example about Jim Schwartz.

14
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:26,820
Imagine I go out and I ask everybody to tell me how many gym shorts they own, as well as what their blood pressure levels are.

15
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:35,820
If I were to do that, in all likelihood I would find that owning more gym shorts is associated with having lower blood pressure levels.

16
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:44,010
So is the message that if I come home for my doctor and have high blood pressure, that I should go out and buy myself new pairs of gym shorts?

17
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:54,120
Of course not. The alternate and far more reasonable explanation is that people who own a lot of gym shorts are also people who are exercising a lot.

18
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:58,410
And exercise is a predictor for having low blood pressure.

19
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:07,040
In other words, what we're seeing is positive correlations between owning gym shorts and exercising,

20
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,480
as well as exercising and having lower blood pressure levels.

21
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:15,500
This results in what's called positive confounding,

22
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,729
where the observed association between owning gym shorts or owning a lot of

23
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,490
gym shorts and low blood pressure is inflated or that association is too big.

24
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:30,620
Because of the confusion by exercise, intuitively,

25
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:39,770
we could have figured out that the confounding by exercise was likely to inflate associations between gym shorts and low blood pressure.

26
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:47,480
By realizing that the group that has a lot of gym shorts are also the ones who are exercising and also the ones who have low blood pressure.

27
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:53,510
Again, this results in an observed association between a lot of gym shorts and low blood pressure.

28
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,510
That's much too big compared to the true causal association between gym shorts and blood pressure.

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,970
Let's take a second example.

30
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:11,370
So you might imagine in unadjusted analysis, mortality rates in Alaska might look substantially lower than other places in the nation,

31
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:17,610
in spite of what we might think would be the opposite due to the harsh climate and rugged conditions of the area.

32
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,530
So should we go out and put out pamphlets to our population encouraging people to move to Alaska in order to improve their survival?

33
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,850
Again, as before, this wouldn't be the right inference.

34
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,030
Rather, what's probably happening is that Alaska's often inhabited by younger and more

35
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,770
physically fit people that are able to tolerate the cold and tough conditions.

36
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,630
These same people are also less likely to die than the general population.

37
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:54,060
As a result, we see this enrichment of low risk individuals in Alaska as compared to other locations.

38
00:03:54,660 --> 00:04:03,360
This results in what's called negative confounding, which means that the crude rates of mortality in Alaska versus other places will appear to be

39
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,570
lower than the truth due to imbalances in the age structure or the health structure by place.

40
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,380
All right. One final example, this time looking at ice cream and skiing accidents.

41
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:23,520
So imagine we did this ecologic study of looking how daily ice cream sales relate to skiing accidents in Colorado.

42
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:30,720
So most likely we would find that eating more ice cream was related to fewer skiing accidents.

43
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:38,740
So is the message here that we should eat ice cream before hitting the slopes in order to avoid a fall as before?

44
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,650
This would not be the right inference.

45
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,070
Rather, what's likely happening is that people tend not to eat ice cream in the middle of winter when they like to go skiing.

46
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:55,830
Like in the last example, this results in negative confounding where the observed association is much smaller than the true causal association

47
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:04,230
because there are fewer days that have both skiing and ice cream as compared to skiing on days when there's no ice cream.

48
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,500
But another way people generally eat ice cream on hot days when skiing occurs far less frequently,

49
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,560
and therefore people are getting in skiing accidents less frequently.

50
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:22,840
By now, I've shown you a few different ways to intuit the directionality of biases from confounding on associations.

51
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:27,700
But for many students, this intuitive approach is still very challenging.

52
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,060
Therefore, I wanted to give you one more way to see the directionality in a slightly more formulaic approach.

53
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,540
So you probably notice that for each example,

54
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:45,700
I added a plus and or minus symbol to the arrows that connected our confounder to the exposure and our confounder to the outcome.

55
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:55,000
One trick of the trade and a way to predict the directionality of confounding is to multiply the arrows to determine the direction of confounding.

56
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:04,000
For example, in our first example, we had gym shorts being positively correlated with exercise, right?

57
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,720
So that's going to get a positive sign. We also had exercise being positively correlated with lower blood pressure.

58
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:19,940
Again, a second positive sign. If we multiply a positive number by another positive number, the result is positive.

59
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,830
As a result, this indicates the presence of positive confounding,

60
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:31,910
which means that the Observed Association will appear too big in absolute terms from the true causal association.

61
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,690
In our second and third examples,

62
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:44,540
we had confounders that introduced negative confounding as was indicated by a positive correlation multiplied by a negative correlation.

63
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:52,160
In the first scenario, being young and physically active was positively correlated with living in Alaska,

64
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,600
but it was inversely or negatively correlated with dying.

65
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:59,420
In the second example, we switched it up.

66
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:09,620
No cold weather was inversely associated with eating ice cream or a negative association, but it was positively associated with ski accidents.

67
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:17,090
In both cases, the result was finding an observed association that was too small in relation to the true association.

68
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,720
Again, because negative times a positive equals a negative.

69
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,629
So filling out the table more fully,

70
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:32,460
we see that there is a fourth scenario where confounder could be inversely correlated with both the exposure of interest and the outcome.

71
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,430
In this situation, a negative number multiplied by a negative number results in a positive number,

72
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:45,530
therefore indicating positive, confounding, or an exaggeration of the observed association relative to the truth.

73
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:51,740
So hopefully either the intuitive method or the formulaic method will really help

74
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:56,180
you to identify the directionality of confounding when faced with new situations.

75
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:02,809
But before leaving the topic altogether, I just wanted to add one more slide that talks about how,

76
00:08:02,810 --> 00:08:09,050
you know whether or not the magnitude of the bias introduced by confounding is going to be big if it's going to be small.

77
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,640
You know, really, that's an important question. How wrong am I going to get the answer?

78
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:19,730
Intuitively, you can imagine that a confounder that's very strongly associated with my exposure

79
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:24,620
and is an extremely strong risk factor for the outcome is going to have more

80
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:30,769
bias or introduce more bias or confounding than if the confounder has a very weak

81
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:35,860
relationship with either the exposure or the outcome or both of these factors.

82
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,330
So there we've gotten through the whole video.

83
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:48,070
Our key takeaways for today are that positive, confounding results and an overestimation of true association.

84
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:54,010
It happens when confounders are positively associated with both the exposure and the outcome,

85
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,420
or when a confounders negatively associated with both the exposure and the outcome.

86
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:03,850
Negative. Confounding, in contrast, results in an underestimation of the true association.

87
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:11,770
It happens when confounders are positively associated with exposure and negatively associated with the outcome or the flip of that.

88
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,550
And finally, the magnitude of confounding is related to the strength of associations with our exposure and our outcome.
