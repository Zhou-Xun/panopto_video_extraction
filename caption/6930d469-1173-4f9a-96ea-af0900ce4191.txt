1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,500
Doing this. You I know it doesn't work. All right.

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:10,310
Let's continue our discussion on conditional expectation.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,610
So at the end of the last week,

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:29,430
we talk about the need to redefine conditional expectation and then conditional probability because of the caveats of the elementary definitions.

5
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:35,310
Right. So, well, it's a working recipe, but it's not it's not a definition.

6
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:48,090
So so we start saying we're going to do this thing differently and we're going to first define the conditional expectation as a function.

7
00:00:50,550 --> 00:01:03,870
So when we talk about define this notation, why give an X expected value of Y given that as a function of X?

8
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,440
Because it's times.

9
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:25,380
Because when we say evaluated at a single value, that's the equivalent to say things about this value of Y conditional X contracts, right?

10
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:32,730
So this is the simple relationship. You should know this now it's a function.

11
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:40,709
And then because it's a function of a random variable technically and makes itself a random variable,

12
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:44,460
the function of the variable itself is a random party, right?

13
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,190
So that's what we ended last time.

14
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,880
So today we start by giving the formal definition of conditional expectation, which means.

15
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:10,220
Let me first a write down the definition. Now explain what that exactly means.

16
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,400
So at first, look, this is a pretty complicated definition.

17
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:33,440
All right. Let's just start with this is called a modern definition of conditional expectation.

18
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:50,510
All right. So we first need to set up the random variables like X and Y.

19
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:58,610
Be to random variables.

20
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:03,980
So here we don't specify the relationship X and Y.

21
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:20,090
Right. So. Well, in most cases, they're correlated. I think it's pretty arbitrary right now.

22
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:28,850
We cannot describe what this the conditional expectation means.

23
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:39,350
So we're going to say this expected value of Y, given that X is a unique.

24
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,470
So that uniqueness is worth the discussion.

25
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:51,950
This is a measurable function.

26
00:03:53,960 --> 00:04:03,050
So we have to talk about define expected value beyond the expected conditional expectation as a function.

27
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:11,720
Now we're just stressing the point. This is going to be a unique function of X, right?

28
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,100
So we need to define a uniqueness such that.

29
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:28,790
So this uniqueness is defined in such a way.

30
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:40,790
So anything following the such that we find that uniqueness such that for every bounded.

31
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:51,260
Real, real value.

32
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:19,900
Measurable function. That's denoted by a g of x, so and so g of x obviously is a function of x again.

33
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:27,950
So those are two lines. Sorry about the handwriting, but these are as basic as the transformation of x.

34
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:34,460
Okay. So for any for every word, this is the same thing.

35
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,000
And the bounded real value is measurable. G x the following condition satisfied.

36
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:47,960
Are we going to have this condition? I'm going to explain the expected value.

37
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:57,590
Y minus expected value of y minus of x.

38
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:05,030
All right. So this is the first. The quantity refers to subtract this expected value.

39
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:17,300
So this is the conditional expectation from Y. And then we're going to compute with this arbitrary function G of X and then we're going to claim.

40
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:26,840
So the property says if you do this such a calculation for our true function of g acts like a zero in the end.

41
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,560
And then that's it. That's the definition. All right.

42
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,390
So where does this come from?

43
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,120
Obviously. So we need to first understand what this statement is and then where does it come from?

44
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:50,130
And then we need to talk about the uniqueness and the existence of that.

45
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,590
But this is the modern definition of conditional expectation, right?

46
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:02,100
I'm just. I'm going like this. I'll pull this off.

47
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:10,030
Oops. Stop it. On six.

48
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,140
All right. We see that believe that out there.

49
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:26,610
Give you a one minute to digest this. So, first of all, if you find a unique function,

50
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:34,230
another uniqueness as described by this arbitrary V for arbitrary Galax, we're going to have that equation.

51
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,650
Okay. So far, it doesn't make any sense to you. Maybe it does.

52
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:43,020
And, you know, you probably say you've got it.

53
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,100
If it doesn't make any sense to you, don't worry. We will see what that means.

54
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,550
So first I will look into the different parts.

55
00:07:52,610 --> 00:08:11,580
Okay. So first of all, I think the point has been stressed wide, given that this is a function of items according to the definition.

56
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:34,630
That is the second. All the uniqueness or this complex expectation equation isactually until size some optimal of these objects.

57
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:48,210
There's a small amount of interpretation. So it's an ultimate function in the sentence.

58
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,650
So let's first look at the inside the parentheses.

59
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:12,940
So. So what is this? Probably, I think somewhere in your applied statistics sequence you should see a funky thing like that.

60
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:21,330
Right. Anybody think you have seen this before?

61
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:26,580
Progression. Very good. Was that not.

62
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,670
Okay. Good. You regression what that value means.

63
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,820
We'll see you. Yes, very good. So this is a residual.

64
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:44,860
Exactly. So you have the the outcome variable minus the expected value.

65
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,090
So that's where you fit under regression.

66
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:53,230
So this really gave you the residual right in the way.

67
00:09:53,740 --> 00:10:01,330
Now, you can see in the same way we can interpret this destination as treating Y,

68
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:13,680
given x expected y about it, why give the x a some best approximation of y using just variable x right?

69
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:20,290
So that y minus is expected y given the x give you the residual.

70
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:27,520
And that makes a lot of sense because then then you see the next operation.

71
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:32,830
If it's a multiply by any of the g of x, they give you zero.

72
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,450
So this is exactly as the same property as the residual regression.

73
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:45,550
So in some sense, the regression, the linear regression you learn is a special case of this definition.

74
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,510
All right.

75
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:58,600
So in the linear regression case, if you will find the best, the linear projector of Y using X, you get your linear regression model, right?

76
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,419
So you'll see that everything then the residual.

77
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:09,640
Suppose that has nothing to do with X because all the information of X has been included in the Y given x.

78
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,760
If you subtract that part, the residual part has no information about x.

79
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:22,570
That means is independent of anything about x that gives you the independent.

80
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,120
Well, I mean, this first of all, the Y minus e y,

81
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:36,510
even the X give you technically the if you'll compute the the the overall expected value, I give you a zero.

82
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:42,730
And then because the independence, you get this, the property of the expected value always equal to zero.

83
00:11:43,510 --> 00:12:00,790
So right. So the critical part is view this part as approximation and that residual.

84
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:16,870
And then the key point to remember is the residual or this approximation error.

85
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:33,970
Well, I mean, if it contains. No information about X.

86
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:43,310
Therefore, if you calculate the residual with any, you know,

87
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:54,249
just a residual compute that anything was g off at first there get independence and the second because y minus y given expected value of y,

88
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,370
given the x is some sort of a best approximation.

89
00:12:57,370 --> 00:13:01,780
So that should give you zero points.

90
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:15,820
So the point here. Is the best.

91
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:36,720
He stressed the best approximation of why. Based on facts.

92
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:44,880
Right. So are you're going to use X to approximate Y?

93
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:49,970
The difference here between linear regression is that we don't restrict.

94
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:58,700
You have to use a linear function. You can use any distribution, I think as long as you have a Y, given the X,

95
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:06,200
if you write that into a form of conditional expectation that automatically you are looking for,

96
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:12,230
you are searching for the faster approximation of y, and then the optimality is.

97
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,360
It's expressing this uniqueness condition for any arbitrary X.

98
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:25,310
If you have X, you have this y given x use of solely the maximum amount of information of x,

99
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,650
there is nothing left in the residual in the approximation error anymore.

100
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,250
Right.

101
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:44,950
This is a much better definition in terms of this is still not the the definition you're going to learn in the measure of theory which the difference.

102
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:50,740
But it's pretty close that they they give you the induced to this type of the definition.

103
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:58,900
So in the measure theory, we cannot define why given the sigma algebra instead of individual random variable.

104
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:07,719
Right. Again, random variable is some sort of a transformation of sigma agitprop up in the better theory of a redo this definition.

105
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,490
But this is pretty sufficient.

106
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:19,240
And then they have even you don't need the macro theory that captures the essence of the additional expectation.

107
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:26,350
All right. So basically two points. Now, why give an X like right that symbol without equals to a specific value?

108
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:32,480
Because that's our random function. Secondly, this is not just any random function.

109
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,220
This the optimal random function based on this definition.

110
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:50,920
All right. So we have a new destination, but we need to reconnect it to the old alimentary destination.

111
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:55,720
So I have to convince you what you have learned in the previous statistic.

112
00:15:55,790 --> 00:16:01,240
Probability course still works. So let's do that.

113
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:05,650
But before we do that, there are a few things I need to sort it out.

114
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:11,690
One is the definition. Say it's a unique, but you need to prove this is a unique function.

115
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:17,080
If I got multiple optimal functions to satisfy this, then I'm in trouble.

116
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:25,629
Right? So there are different ways to compute. Conditional expectation is that conceptually or theoretically you have multiple

117
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:31,000
version of function satisfy this which one is should should we consider.

118
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:43,210
So that uniqueness need to be proved that also I'm just saying acts of why does this always exist?

119
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:48,010
So that existence and that uniqueness technically need to be proved.

120
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:58,060
We're able to prove the uniqueness of the the existence is a consequence of measure theory.

121
00:16:58,090 --> 00:17:03,940
There is a theorem you can use to seek to prove the existence readout.

122
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,570
Nicodemus Theorem We're not going there.

123
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:15,870
But you know, I believe the reference number like terminology for interest that you can read the relevant text and then show.

124
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:20,380
But basically, if you trust my words, this always exists.

125
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:37,540
Now we're going to show the proof of uniqueness. All right.

126
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:44,950
So this the proof is naturally constructors prove by contradiction if you can see it or by construction.

127
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:52,660
If you if you want to say so, let's assume there are two different functions H1 X and H2 as both satisfies.

128
00:17:53,480 --> 00:18:00,160
Sorry, remove the wrong word, but both satisfy the the modern definition.

129
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:29,080
I suppose, but so H1 X is a function of x and each two x both satisfy the definition.

130
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,010
So we do not. So the definition. Let me write again.

131
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:52,580
So this is basically a residual multiply arbitrary function, this expected value equal to zero.

132
00:18:52,660 --> 00:19:00,640
It's not hard to remember. So we're going to substitute this Y to an x by each one x on h2x.

133
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:10,179
But we're also going to first to calculate the Y, use the distributive law, calculate the Y, expect that about y times.

134
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:13,190
G acts about this thing x.

135
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:29,770
Okay. So they expected about it.

136
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:38,680
So this one, the expected value. If I write this way, the expected value is taken with respect, the drawing distribution of X on Y.

137
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:45,459
Just to be clear. So the expected value, we didn't write density or or probability,

138
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:53,800
but this is a well defined so we can calculate the expected value of four different types of random variable.

139
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,230
So this is has no conceptual problems at all.

140
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:06,230
But if I write this way, so the expected value is taken with respect to the joint distribution of Y and that's it.

141
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,360
Just declare.

142
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:22,930
So this one according to the definition, thinking about and move the expected value to the right hand side going to be equals h1x minus x.

143
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,860
Also this equals h2x.

144
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:44,770
I'm x for arbitrary g of facts which is immeasurable and bounded.

145
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,590
Right. So we have that condition.

146
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:04,850
The right hand side is typical in this respect, but is the expectation on the right hand side?

147
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:12,100
Both equations is taking. The expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of x only.

148
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:32,070
Right. That's.

149
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:43,610
All right. So that implies if you're just operating out,

150
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:50,360
the two join the two expectations on the right hand side you can I get is

151
00:21:50,360 --> 00:22:08,180
expected value H1 X minus two x times geode acts equal to zero for arbitrary g.

152
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:17,150
So because the arbitrary p here it has to be for arbitrary g off x so we can

153
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:24,980
manipulate that and then show basically H1 X equals H to x almost everywhere.

154
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:31,520
So that's the idea. So this is a pretty arbitrary so this is a strong condition.

155
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:39,860
So you can make geo facts equal to the indicator function.

156
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:50,900
This is found in indicator. Function means assert if the condition satisfies equals one otherwise equal to zero obviously bounded and it's measurable.

157
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,050
H1 is greater than H2.

158
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:13,450
Right. So. So this is basically saying if I run on all the places H1 Squeezer that H2 X we're going to assign value one.

159
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:20,710
Otherwise, if H2 attracts less than or equal to h2x, which is a set value zero, right.

160
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,450
The point of this is this is a net negative function.

161
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:32,200
The only way this equation satisfies if you plug it into g of x, that gives you.

162
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:52,679
So think about this. If in the places o the x values x h1 x actually last night H2 exit will always be zero, right?

163
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,550
Because the g axa will zero all the product. Right.

164
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:01,350
And then the only place is non-zero is this indicator function.

165
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:05,700
At the end of the day this one equals the indicator.

166
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:11,060
H1 is greater than H2 once.

167
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:27,610
So so this one this equation becomes this expected value of this function, this a little bit.

168
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:36,130
So you should know expected the value of the indicator function equals what ability?

169
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:41,740
Very good. So in this case, this means the probability.

170
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:48,330
This is an important point. Each one acts right.

171
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:59,730
I should say this right here. It tries whether about is strictly equal to h2x is with probability zero.

172
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:11,920
Right. So the expected value of the indicator is the probability of the event inside that indicator function.

173
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:19,300
I'm not saying that should be obvious, but this is a fact that should should be known.

174
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:23,890
Okay. And that's how you perform, in fact.

175
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:33,670
So this gave you this condition, H1 one x squared h2x strictly where you're not H2 X is with probability zero.

176
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:43,600
We didn't do anything special. We can change that g of x similar.

177
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:51,420
You can show. You can show what?

178
00:25:51,430 --> 00:26:06,639
Don't just say show the probability h1x is strictly less than two x, it's also one zero.

179
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:11,310
Right? We just need to change the indicator function because g of x is arbitrary.

180
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:15,190
We're allowed to change it as as we wish.

181
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,490
So we can change the greater than strictly greater sign to a strip, less than that.

182
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:29,220
And then you can look at this conclusion. The probability H1 x less than H2 x is equal to zero.

183
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:35,980
So that basically saying with probability one H1 X equals H2 x.

184
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:43,659
So we start assuming there are two arbitrary function, both satisfy the modern definition.

185
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:49,870
At the end of the day, we prove, well, they could be different at the points,

186
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:57,340
certain points, but with probability one, they are they are equal essentially.

187
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:05,320
Right. So the different side we know, so to speak, has it's a it's a it's a -0 set.

188
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:10,299
So it doesn't really matter. From the probability point of view.

189
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:15,160
So it's but prove the uniqueness of this conditional expectation.

190
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,120
So don't need to worry about there are two different versions give you

191
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:25,780
conditional expectation by this definition that gave you very different results,

192
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:29,680
at least with probability at zero that can happen.

193
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:38,270
So this slide, you're going to see a lot of such arguments in measure theory.

194
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:50,320
So something you actually allow there is a possibility that H1 and H2 X are different, but the with probability zero that can happen.

195
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:56,050
So that means the difference that it's a measurable set with measured zero.

196
00:27:56,470 --> 00:28:05,640
So it's a bit counterintuitive, but. We're not we're not going to deal with that for us.

197
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:15,080
We just need to show this. Well, you just need to remember that conditional expectation is uniquely defined.

198
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,520
Run the function of X. Okay.

199
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:31,640
Questions? Yes. Shouldn't the function g b divided by each one minus h to its.

200
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:35,270
Otherwise. Sorry. Not sure that I understand. Transition.

201
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,930
So you're talking about this like.

202
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,360
Yeah. So the first the first multiple should disappear somehow.

203
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,050
The first is from the product.

204
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:53,549
Okay, so this line comes from the by.

205
00:28:53,550 --> 00:29:03,270
Just put the right hand side of the this part I get not sure about the second position, the second line.

206
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:10,170
Oh okay. Yeah. There is a drop of switch so I did there is supposed to be a multiply by g of facts.

207
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:12,930
Right. So but I'm using the definition here.

208
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:23,370
So in the case h1 one X is not equals close h2x that's well, I mean, it's strictly less than when you go to h2x, this is zero.

209
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:32,340
So we don't count that. We only count the part h1x strictly greater than h2x that occasion.

210
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:40,840
So you can think about that set in this case g off axis one and then all the points there h1x minus H, true.

211
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,270
Two X. I see what you mean.

212
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,840
Yes. I think this is the condition for that thing to happen.

213
00:29:55,850 --> 00:30:07,100
Right. If this right hand side is a zero and there is a triangle, then you have something positive on the side, right?

214
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:14,090
So positive multiply by indicator function you are right equal to zero because that thing is strictly positive.

215
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:20,900
The only way that you can guarantee the expected value of equal to zero is this thing equal to zero.

216
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,990
You're right. There is a strong pulse.

217
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:35,430
Yeah. Good. Actually, it's just that we're actually right.

218
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,970
This one. Good question.

219
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:46,269
All right. So that established the uniqueness of us.

220
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:49,720
We said we're not going to show the existence,

221
00:30:50,140 --> 00:31:13,300
but we're going to go back and then see if this definition is compatible with if this definition compatible with that definition.

222
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:37,659
It was. The worst case scenario is we made a new destination and now all of the old saying doesn't work anymore.

223
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:42,100
You learn how to cue the conditional expectation.

224
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:54,290
So the following either is like illustration or proof going to show you you don't need to worry about learning anything but the old,

225
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:58,220
that the old recipe still works.

226
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:05,500
Let me just write this before you reference. So rules of.

227
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:24,110
Assistance by Rita mukherjee here.

228
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:37,970
So we're not going to talk about this. So the next point is that equivalence or it's not really that equivalence because the conceptual there are not.

229
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:46,920
But this is basically trying to show that the old recipe still works on.

230
00:32:49,640 --> 00:33:05,210
It's easy for Republicans to call that naive definition.

231
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:20,390
All right. Now we have the definition. If I asked you to prove anything about conditional expectation, the properties of conditional expectation.

232
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,989
Well, the only thing you can use is that more than definition.

233
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:31,820
So every time that you ask for it today, homework problems, you should go back to the modern definitions.

234
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:48,980
All right. First of all, I see that you don't consider X and Y not we going to say there are two discrete random variables.

235
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:08,420
All right. So the modern definition says that H of X is but E given the Y of the x.

236
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:27,580
Going to be written as summation of why the value of y implied by the probability y, y, and not x equal to acts.

237
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:32,360
Right. Um. So this one right here.

238
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:36,430
Right this way. Yes.

239
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:46,220
So I'm just trying to write the. What is that, the naive definition on facts or the conditional expectations?

240
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:57,710
All right, this this one is not defined in our new term, but we can write this a probability.

241
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:08,090
Y y x equals two x. This is define quantity divided by the probability acts equal to acts.

242
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:17,270
Right. So this is the recipe for define the naive definition of the conditional expectation.

243
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:27,200
So that commits up. Quite a workout.

244
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:36,329
All right. So the that that term, the left hand side is the the naive definition.

245
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:42,600
So basically, we have each of the acts going to be equal to.

246
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:55,080
According to that definition. So this is. So we have a definition according to them.

247
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,480
So the question is, does that definition satisfy the modern definition?

248
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:09,010
Right. So they're more than definition. So something about arbitrary G of X, we need to give a try here.

249
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:16,060
So for the modern definition, as I said, so we need to first to calculate is two different quantities.

250
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:24,670
One is nine times white and x and then.

251
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:44,540
So this has. It facts.

252
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:52,220
So this one for arbitrary golf facts has to be zero.

253
00:36:52,430 --> 00:37:19,430
So we can do the calculation first by names of acts and then this implies so zero because this event is one minus two equals zero.

254
00:37:21,350 --> 00:37:28,460
Just split the using the linearity of the property of the expectations, split this into two.

255
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:34,040
And as I said before, this is an expectation with two random variables.

256
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,340
This one, this expectation with a single random variable.

257
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:41,900
Okay. So we're going to do the same trick here.

258
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:59,750
So if we give a arbitrary chill facts and so forth across the definition, it's off the air.

259
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:10,250
So first we calculate this expected value y axis.

260
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,710
All right. So that equals.

261
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:23,680
So this is an expected value with respect to the joint distribution.

262
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:29,510
So how do we do that population? So we enumerate all possible value of X or Y.

263
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:47,310
Allow to calculate y times g of acts, which is the arbitrary bounded function multiplied by probability.

264
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,170
Y y xy class.

265
00:38:54,810 --> 00:39:01,350
Right. So this is a definition of expected value when you how to calculate the expected value.

266
00:39:06,310 --> 00:39:10,140
For this to run the variables for this function y go back.

267
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:15,640
So you need to enumerate all combinations of x on y, right?

268
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:22,360
That the probability is given by the joint probability and the two values is y g of x.

269
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,870
So this is a shorthand notation there's all possible.

270
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,890
So all of these compatible pairs of X and Y, right.

271
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:34,930
Questions about this. Okay.

272
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:43,330
So that's one I know we're going to work out this one on the side.

273
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,490
You already see something up here. Here, the joint probability has already appeared.

274
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:55,740
So all I need to do is X. We could do this.

275
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:08,520
So this is a joint sort of a notation. We could first do an assumption with respect to Y and then do the expectation, always respond back to X.

276
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:14,010
So whenever you have a pair, you can always do this iterated summation.

277
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:24,990
All right. So to do that, we put all the G of X in the terms contained geo facts here and now we we're all them the term and Steve

278
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:42,480
tracks and now we're going to do this big summation just with respect to why why why why X contracts.

279
00:40:53,280 --> 00:41:05,500
What happens is I'm going to change this instead of working on all the pairs, I'm going to do iterate f summation first.

280
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:12,360
It's a similar idea like you do to iterate is integration.

281
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,220
So in measure theory, summation and then integration essentially the same thing.

282
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,450
So this is always guaranteed for this great value.

283
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:31,560
You could always first to do the assumption with respect to the Y and then calculate the corresponding matter with respect to X, right?

284
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:41,520
It's just for any fix. The X value goes through all the y values for the they move to the second y about the x factor.

285
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,610
You do the same summation for the different values. So that's basically that way commentary.

286
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:52,680
In terms of commentary, you basically iterate over the pairs of X and Y.

287
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:59,640
So that is the math behind these. The only thing I did though is argument.

288
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,320
Just add a term, multiply a term, and then divide it by a term here.

289
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:10,620
All right. So what happens is this thing automatically up here, here.

290
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:17,850
So that's something where H of X is summation of Y and then all these things.

291
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:34,470
So that means what? So this is a combination of x, g of x, the probability of X equal to x because this term sum over all possible value of y.

292
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:40,860
So the summation is no longer a function of y, right?

293
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:47,730
All possible values of y are enumerated basically a number, but it's still a function of x.

294
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:56,040
So in that right. This same h and equal to facts, right?

295
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:59,820
This is exactly all work h function defined up there.

296
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:12,920
Okay. That's what this term. So whenever you see this term, you separate the probability and all the other function.

297
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,270
So this is a function of x, x equal to x.

298
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:22,580
I can say this is a function of x equal to act and this is a probability.

299
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:31,460
So it's fair to say this is a expected value H of capital x multiplied times.

300
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:46,510
So that's exactly what we are looking for. So that makes the facts subtract the from the y multiply by arbitrary.

301
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:52,490
So the residual multiplied by the arbitrary function of g of x equal to zero because of this equality.

302
00:43:53,840 --> 00:44:01,250
Furthermore, because we have proved that the nature of acts is a unique function,

303
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:08,810
that means if we apply the modern definition to the two discrete random variables,

304
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:19,130
then that one the formula really defines that unique conditional expectation overall that basically saying

305
00:44:19,550 --> 00:44:27,960
you what you would learn from previous courses is a special case of this random is this modern definition.

306
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:31,850
So that's a working recipe. You don't need to give that away.

307
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:53,630
You need to use it, right? So this establish thinking about why why you this is the first time high g of x equals zero for arbitrary for geopolitics.

308
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,860
Yeah, this is a definition.

309
00:44:57,860 --> 00:45:08,490
So any function satisfies this. Residual equation, it's going to be the according to our definition is going to be the unique conditional expectation.

310
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:12,930
So Ajax, is that conditional expectation we're looking for?

311
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:21,150
Okay, so this should give you a peace of mind. You don't need to change the way to computing things, to to compute things.

312
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:30,000
So in the homework, you need to do this for continuous random variable.

313
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:41,360
Right. Any questions? A clear good.

314
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,790
Oh, sorry. Maybe too fast. I could use that.

315
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:14,950
Okay. So so supposedly now at this point, we have defined conditional expectations successfully.

316
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,580
We haven't defined conditional probability yet.

317
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:24,870
So this is a kind of a new thing here.

318
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:31,570
We can define conditional probability through conditional expectation.

319
00:46:32,590 --> 00:46:43,920
Okay. So the way we define it is the following. All right.

320
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:50,160
So much of the next part is for formality, but this is really simple.

321
00:46:51,060 --> 00:47:18,870
So to define a conditional probability, parentheses, roles, expectations.

322
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:31,880
All right. So how we do that? So given a probability space.

323
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:38,870
So this is a for formality and it's not that critical.

324
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:45,980
Omega three and a run the variable.

325
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,410
And the random variable X.

326
00:47:54,730 --> 00:48:00,490
All right. So we have a probability space and a run, the variable X.

327
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:22,450
So you see where it's going. A conditional probability, probability of an event, let's say is a belongs to this measurable set.

328
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:27,100
Right. So probability can only applies to measurable event.

329
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:52,210
So that has to be an element in in in the sigma enterprise is defined as the probability a given random variable X.

330
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,900
So this is a new notation.

331
00:48:55,900 --> 00:49:04,750
We haven't talked about this yet, but this one equals we're going to say turn this to something we already know indicate indicator function.

332
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:09,430
A So if the adamant is equal to the last through the set eight, that's one.

333
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,260
Otherwise is zero. We know how to calculate this.

334
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:21,780
So this side, it's a random variable. It's precisely a random variable.

335
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:27,250
Right. So this takes value either zero or one. Yeah, it's matched in the real line.

336
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:33,570
And this one is a measurable set in the original sigma algebra because we have

337
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:38,070
this condition and this one is how you calculate the conditional expectation.

338
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,480
We know how to calculate the conditional expected. That's well defined.

339
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:49,170
Yeah, well defined means that we have done all these proofs like it's just now.

340
00:49:53,210 --> 00:50:10,610
Yeah. So just be clear. One a is the now a rather variable y equals y indicator function or the elements?

341
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:15,850
So this is not easy to show the omega.

342
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:20,690
It also belongs to the capital. Sorry, the the sample space.

343
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:25,210
But this one is trying to show this one. A function indicator.

344
00:50:25,250 --> 00:50:30,050
A function. This a random variable. Right. It's just this.

345
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:39,360
All right. So that's what I said. It's a formality. If you know how you calculate conditional expectation.

346
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:45,510
Conditional probability is just a special case for conditional expectation.

347
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:58,350
Right? It carries all these the properties of conditional expectation, and then you can treat this like a conditional expectation.

348
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:02,760
Everything we talk about in the subsequent properties,

349
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:09,480
conditional expectation automatically applies to conditional probability because that's just a special case.

350
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,120
It's expected of a conditional expectation of indicator function.

351
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:21,120
Okay, so this may be confusing, but I think you measure a theory.

352
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:25,270
That's the way conditional expected conditional probability is defined.

353
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:33,239
It's just a very natural way, at least from a construction point of view is it's very clever.

354
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,300
And then it's also rigorous on.

355
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:44,950
Do I want to say so? Actually, there was a thought.

356
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:55,390
So we all start learning statistics probability from the point of view, your first simplifying probability and then expected value.

357
00:51:56,080 --> 00:52:03,190
Think I remember there was a focus probably not that famous but it's a pretty old right now

358
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:10,590
is trying to redefine the statistics from the well without just using the expectation.

359
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:16,820
So the first the defining expectation and then singularity follow this sort of.

360
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:26,049
This this type of the trick or the thought process and the defined probability.

361
00:52:26,050 --> 00:52:32,860
There was a phone call out there. If you see some some other day, that could be interesting to read.

362
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:37,840
But the point is, from the it's either from expectation or the probability.

363
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:45,460
You pretty much even this way I think I'm talking about that book you recover all these that your statistical knowledge.

364
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:52,950
Almost that with all the loss. But anyway, the.

365
00:52:53,550 --> 00:53:01,680
This is how we define conditional probability. Just treat it as a conditional expectation.

366
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:10,620
Special case. Any questions? All right, then we move on to the last part.

367
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:15,270
Um. Of the like the church.

368
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:25,600
We're going to talk about the properties. So some of these properties are really well known and they're basically inherited from

369
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:34,710
the expectation or I should say very similar to to the unconditional expectation.

370
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:43,140
Sorry. Some of those need a little bit of explanation.

371
00:53:57,730 --> 00:54:02,020
I think in the lecture notes we're less about how many?

372
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,830
We're going to talk about sex anyway today.

373
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:24,950
So now basically we know what the new fascination is and now we know how to calculate it, how to calculate.

374
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:28,880
It's not new, but we're basically trying to show that still valid.

375
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:34,880
We already showed that. And then the last bit is the property.

376
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:41,440
So we only need to talk about the property of conditional expectation.

377
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:49,940
Everything should fall. So every properties we discuss is automatically applied to conditional probability.

378
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,890
One. So the properties.

379
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:12,300
I'm not going to prove any of these. There are some things I can't explain.

380
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:20,880
The proof of all these properties automatically follows the destination of conditional expectation.

381
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:25,560
So in the homework you are asked to approve some of the properties.

382
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:32,010
So the only way you can do it, it's go back to the definition and then see.

383
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:40,820
What we did for that equivalence between the naive definition and the modern definition.

384
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:52,080
So that's basically the thing you should try. Some of these would require you to pick the specific g of x function.

385
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:55,710
Um, so that's much I want to say about the tools.

386
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:59,670
So let's first see how the first thing is linearity.

387
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:03,540
So this is very similar to the item condition.

388
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:11,080
Not in there. Everything from the. Firmly unconditional expectation.

389
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:26,770
So if you have expected value A you so you it's a random variable, it's a scalar and it affects a coefficient B times we give an x,

390
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:35,170
then this y equals you can calculate, you can split this same into two parts and culturally.

391
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:46,060
And then also you can factor that a because is a constant all of the expected conditional expectation of operational.

392
00:56:47,970 --> 00:57:06,150
So this is a times you get x plus fee time times expected is about three given X right so this follows from the well,

393
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:09,600
I mean, this is similar to the conditional unconditional excitation.

394
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:21,090
If you don't have this now, you get a expected value of you being type acts and this one is just extends to the conditional expectation as well.

395
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:26,820
Not going to prove it. If you want to prove it using the modern definition, you should be able to prove it.

396
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:32,040
All right. So this one doesn't really need much explanation.

397
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:43,320
The first the field doesn't really need us. So if y so the second one is called a positive property.

398
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:56,970
So if you have a random variable only takes non-negative negative values,

399
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:06,600
then you know that expecting about y given next has to be greater equal right?

400
00:58:08,490 --> 00:58:14,490
This is intuitive, but to prove again using the modern definition,

401
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:22,680
this is also kind of similar to what what we have for the just unconditional expectation.

402
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:29,190
If a random variable is defined on the non negative real line, the expected value cannot be negative.

403
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:34,770
Yeah. Because just make no sense. Same thing for conditional expectation.

404
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:38,579
So. Well in that way. So we talk about okay,

405
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:48,030
maybe this is a place to talk about what is a conditional expectation if it want to use it in modeling or statistics, not mathematics.

406
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:57,540
So much so that definitions basically tell you conditional expectation is you are using X using all the information of X,

407
00:58:57,810 --> 00:59:00,960
trying to approximate Y, just like the regression.

408
00:59:02,250 --> 00:59:10,020
Actually, as a matter of fact, if you talk about general regression that's actually consider,

409
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:17,260
you are trying to construct that the function of approximation function of what using X, right?

410
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:22,979
So that's basically you just define Y given that, although as I said,

411
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:28,730
this is no definite, there is no constraints and you have to use linear function, right?

412
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:33,690
So you can only use linear function of X, you can use arbitrary function of x.

413
00:59:34,050 --> 00:59:40,380
So this the flying you can use later on, you can use plane function or even fancy.

414
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:52,910
Sort of a numb parametric function, arbitrary functional function used to approximate Y from a information point of view.

415
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:57,360
If X contain a lot of information of Y.

416
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:00,980
What does it mean? It means x or y must be correlated.

417
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:05,299
Right? So. Correlation again. A mathematical word.

418
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:08,450
Dependance of mathematical concept.

419
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:13,610
You define on a sigma algebra, right? Arbitrary set of a.

420
01:00:14,060 --> 01:00:19,820
So you have that product to define independence in terms of information sharing.

421
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:25,790
Essentially saying independence means there is no information sharing between the two random variables.

422
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:32,400
Knowing anything about X doesn't help you try to understand anything more then Y.

423
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,870
So in that case, I stress this.

424
01:00:35,870 --> 01:00:44,059
This is kind of a second type of non mathematical sort of intuition because this is a really

425
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:51,560
you can use probability tools in real life modeling in in data science applications.

426
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:59,960
Right. So in this case, regardless of X information about Y, that doesn't change the nature of Y.

427
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:06,830
If Y only take non-negative values every conditional so it doesn't change anything about y.

428
01:01:06,830 --> 01:01:10,819
So intuitively that's something you should expect y.

429
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:15,090
Given that's greater. Right.

430
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:26,110
So we're going to talk about well, the next lecture is going to be a bunch of examples on using conditional expectation and then do the calculation.

431
01:01:26,120 --> 01:01:30,950
So we're going to get into more about this. How to use this definition.

432
01:01:31,370 --> 01:01:34,609
Usually don't go back to the mathematical type definition.

433
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:37,810
I'm trying to find the optimal function. You don't need to do that.

434
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:43,340
But nevertheless, as I said, this gives you a peace of mind.

435
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,120
This is okay. Everything is well defined up to this point.

436
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:56,780
So the third one is called stability and stability.

437
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:08,900
So so this is important. This needs a little bit is c is a function of X.

438
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:19,530
So we will talk about what does it mean a function of acts.

439
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:25,080
Okay, from information theory, point of view, then you're going to have evidence.

440
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:39,380
Why given? If it's a Y in times Z, everything that's going to be equal to Z.

441
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:55,250
So this is a call of stability. And then why is that?

442
01:02:57,050 --> 01:03:10,880
So the way you can understand this equation perfectly is to write Z of X conditional on X, right?

443
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:20,930
So for any given x, so now y, z conditional on axis is a conditional expectation.

444
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:25,660
And Y you can factor Z out of your factor.

445
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:30,680
Z out of the conditional expectations. It doesn't.

446
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:39,860
So if you know X for any specific value of X because Z is a function of x, z becomes.

447
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:47,389
A constant. Right. So now your computer y given X.

448
01:03:47,390 --> 01:03:51,740
So, you know, this kind of elementary definition still works.

449
01:03:52,040 --> 01:03:59,690
If you're conditional on X, we already know x. This become a fixed value or constant conditional on the value of x.

450
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:07,070
Then of course you can factor this out of the expected sign, but this property is non-trivial.

451
01:04:07,070 --> 01:04:09,110
Mathematically, you should prove it.

452
01:04:09,110 --> 01:04:20,809
Using the modern definition have to sum it like a broken record of anything we show here can be pulled from the sum.

453
01:04:20,810 --> 01:04:25,580
All in definition. This is just intuition, right? So why this intuitively make sense?

454
01:04:26,120 --> 01:04:32,359
If you're given any value of x, z is a constant. You don't need to calculate the expected value.

455
01:04:32,360 --> 01:04:36,500
Just treat it like a scalar. Put it outside the expected sign.

456
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:42,360
Right here. Okay. It's called a stability.

457
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:48,520
Very useful. What is.

458
01:04:58,070 --> 01:05:01,170
Fourth one, independence lost.

459
01:05:03,590 --> 01:05:29,729
So number four. So it states if X and Y are independent, as I just said, they don't share any information than expected.

460
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:38,370
A value given x really doesn't help you get a single number.

461
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:47,459
Right? So given all the information of acts in the world, the best you can get is the expected value of Y.

462
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:59,700
So that's the best approximation. Again, you can prove it, but this is not really should be strange to you.

463
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:04,350
While x don't share any information, the conditional x is basically useless.

464
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:15,870
You get the expected value of y. Five out of six are the probably the most important tricks the properties we're going to use.

465
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:21,720
So let's say number five is number five.

466
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:25,470
It's called the tower property.

467
01:06:25,650 --> 01:06:28,680
Sometimes it's also called a filtration property.

468
01:06:33,690 --> 01:06:37,020
Filtration refers to the information filtration.

469
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:55,740
So this stays if Z is a function of X.

470
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:06,180
Then if you want to calculate the Y given z.

471
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:13,170
Right. So this is what you're trying to calculate. Z is a function of x.

472
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:23,110
This Y equals expected value of the expected value y of human x and then conditional.

473
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:30,150
Right. And so this is probably the most complicated one.

474
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:33,540
I'm trying to explain this a little bit.

475
01:07:36,730 --> 01:07:46,680
Why this is true. Again, if you are all this equality, then you need to use the more than the definition to prove it.

476
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:50,130
But what does it mean? I think the property.

477
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:53,940
So if you want to calculate Y directly on Z, right.

478
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:56,520
So this is the problem you're trying to solve.

479
01:07:57,090 --> 01:08:06,800
What you could do is instead of a calculator, there's two expected to expectation conditional expectations nested.

480
01:08:07,350 --> 01:08:13,140
First, that you calculate a Y, you give an X. And this one is a function of acts.

481
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:18,450
Right. And then you can calculate this y given acts of conditional arms.

482
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,790
So you do a nested the calculation.

483
01:08:21,790 --> 01:08:27,310
So we can see a lot of examples. This is why this is a make sense what this means.

484
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:39,010
Right. So. So, first of all, we need to understand what does it mean by Z as a function of X in terms of information?

485
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:46,210
And just ask a simple question, ex-husband, more detailed information or Z has more the information.

486
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:50,840
Thinking about precision, not information.

487
01:08:50,850 --> 01:08:53,870
Right? So access more information at work. Z.

488
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:58,550
If Z is a function of X thinking about mapping.

489
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:06,510
Which one has more information, more detailed information? We think it's right.

490
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:13,460
So the only case, Axon Z has the same information if you have a 1 to 1 mapping.

491
01:09:13,470 --> 01:09:15,390
So there is no information loss.

492
01:09:15,870 --> 01:09:25,380
If you have around to so multiple things mapped to the single value, then giving you Z doesn't really tell you the detailed value of X, right?

493
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:30,240
So this is a critically important to use this power property.

494
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:42,180
All right. So if you are trying to calculate a Y conditional on some rough information, you can always do first by conditioning more information.

495
01:09:43,170 --> 01:09:48,150
Right. So why give an X so that the sequence cannot be different?

496
01:09:48,540 --> 01:09:53,549
If it's a y given x, then you cannot do it y given z.

497
01:09:53,550 --> 01:10:00,870
And then here give it an x. Not just the filtration so that the the information flow doesn't make sense.

498
01:10:00,870 --> 01:10:12,390
The information has to be the most detailed in most conditional expectation that become lot less precise, so on and so forth.

499
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:17,510
So so this is the, the, the field Christian law or the the tower.

500
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:36,120
Let me just write a few things if you want. So it's fair to say Z contains no more information than X?

501
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:48,480
All right. The only way they have the same information is the Z is a 1 to 1 mapping of of X.

502
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:56,849
So this is tower property essentially trying to say, why are you trying to compute on the wrong information?

503
01:10:56,850 --> 01:11:06,630
You can always first do a calculation, compute additional expectation with more detailed information.

504
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:13,170
Right. So you got all of that information and this usually helps a lot.

505
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:18,360
It seems like abstractly speaking, you're not doing anything useful here.

506
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:28,870
But what we see the property on Wednesday, next Monday, we see the examples of using tower problems and help you understanding why they don't.

507
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:33,570
So. All right.

508
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:38,250
So we conclude today's lecture by the last minute.

509
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:46,370
So. So the last property is called a total expectation.

510
01:11:46,740 --> 01:11:55,610
And we should know that. I'm told that expectation law has a some similarity to the tower office,

511
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:04,820
but then the same kind of spirit you can use to understand the total expected.

512
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:12,080
So number six. Oh, it's my patient.

513
01:12:18,950 --> 01:12:21,290
So I'm going to write in the form of a tower.

514
01:12:21,620 --> 01:12:34,190
So if you are given the task to compute the expected value of y, what you can do is always conditional on something, right?

515
01:12:35,840 --> 01:12:46,620
And then calculate this. So the expected value of the conditional expected value of Y given X is just the expected value Y.

516
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:51,080
So we use this quite a bit in statistics.

517
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:08,660
Right. So the same way, the same spirit of using the if you are given the task to compute this unconditional expectation,

518
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:11,299
you can always for us to calculate something,

519
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:20,350
you're conditional some information and then don't forget about because this becomes a function of X in their paths.

520
01:13:20,360 --> 01:13:28,670
Y you calculate this become a function of facts. So this outside expectation must be with respect to x.

521
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:35,870
Okay, so this is the total expected before the new modern definition.

522
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:41,930
This I will say there's none of this property make sense, make mathematical sense.

523
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:53,120
Okay. Because you know, you have to trade y given us some sort of a unique function of facts, right?

524
01:13:53,420 --> 01:14:02,960
So even we're using those models, we just didn't think them very carefully.

525
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:15,240
Um, so the last bit of common is nothing here is possible without the modern definition to explicitly define y given access a unique special function.

526
01:14:15,740 --> 01:14:21,230
That's all right. So we'll end the lecture like 5 minutes already.

527
01:14:21,410 --> 01:14:26,479
I give you a lot of things to digest. See you next Monday.

528
01:14:26,480 --> 01:14:33,170
We'll talk about a lot of these ideas over using different definitions or these properties.

529
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:38,770
You should know it's like patient population, but it's.
