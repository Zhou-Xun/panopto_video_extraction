1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:11,910
I spoke to her and she thought she was absolutely right.

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:12,980
And so. Exactly.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:39,570
So we think that there is a guy just like this is like some crimes are oversize and they're all just like always happy to just get out of here.

4
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:49,760
I just stopped putting it when I was 25 years ago because I just didn't trust anybody that it's like, I don't know because I just never know.

5
00:00:49,770 --> 00:01:00,480
Is anybody else like this with five years when you just.

6
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:17,250
I know it's actually it's a disaster. Yeah, I was honestly, I was not the only person to be subject to these presents.

7
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:25,620
Oh, you're presenting. Oh, have you personally what experience?

8
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:41,310
Like, I was supposed to be able to go somewhere beautiful, know she could be like, no, I think I know what I basically have to do.

9
00:01:41,320 --> 00:02:00,450
Like, it's quite was it was like in here that I knew that I just had no idea how to get paid for it.

10
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:19,790
Yeah. And I don't really have to respect your behavior just because you put the together like that.

11
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,420
Because I had to see what was going on.

12
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:35,330
I was like, she was like, just text, you know, with $3.50 to 66.

13
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,260
Was not surprised that they were going to be talking about behavioral economics and like finding a really great weekend.

14
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:47,600
But please welcome Jeff Culver.

15
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,810
Three Americans out of work.

16
00:02:52,020 --> 00:03:00,960
We've done some work together on the evaluation of the Michigan program, which is certainly expansion in the state originally.

17
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,600
But talking about how we've to supplement sort of these standard models of

18
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,290
microeconomics that we've been talking about sort of both on the consumer side so far.

19
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:24,750
And we're coming up inside and how decisions maybe can be influenced by factors outside of what some of those basic models have posited.

20
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,220
And we might be able to then take advantage of those sort of psychological insights to further enhance the power of that knowledge.

21
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:39,579
So. Right. He's got about 30 minutes of slides if you want to kind of go through sort of the slides

22
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,100
sort of uninterrupted and then leave about 15 minutes for open discussion afterwards.

23
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:49,649
Yeah. So definitely write down questions, think about them, bring them up afterwards.

24
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,010
So it's rich. How do we do anything like it or something?

25
00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:06,000
You know, we do have some slides, so and I realize this is like an unenviable position of first thing Monday morning.

26
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,809
Welcome to my life. Yeah. I've never heard of someone's problem sets and stuff like that.

27
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:16,320
So, like, I'm not going to ask you any questions. This is hopefully going to be fun.

28
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,100
Interesting. Five Okay. We're not going to say that everything Rich told you is wrong,

29
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,889
but we're going to build on that strong foundation and then hopefully bring it into the applied context.

30
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,080
Okay, for real world assignment, which is why you're all here, right?

31
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,360
Is to make health care veteran a real world. And so we're going to take some of that microeconomics here.

32
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,880
We're going to build on that and I think inject some more realistic assumptions with that as well,

33
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,240
some additional context that can shape behavior and choices.

34
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:50,010
And so definitely as you think about questions, write them down. And again, we'll open it up at the end.

35
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:54,899
Okay. All right. So here's what we're going to talk about over the next 30 minutes or so.

36
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,680
So first, I'm going to provide a brief overview of behavioral economics.

37
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,180
And I promised I was not. Going to call on you yet? Raise your hand if you've heard of behavioral economics.

38
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:08,410
Okay. Some of you, maybe about half of you or so.

39
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,410
Raise your hand if you feel like you. Again, I'm not going to call on you. Raise your hand if you feel like you know a lot about behavior like nomics.

40
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,690
Okay, so some familiarity with that. Some of you have not heard of this term before.

41
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:23,560
That's okay. We're first going to provide a level set and then we're going to build on it from there.

42
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,980
And specifically, we're going to talk about some key behavioral economic insights into health care choices.

43
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,520
I think this is going to align really well with some of the things you've talked about thus far around consumer choice.

44
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,549
It sounds like you're going to be segue soon into thinking about provider

45
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:40,300
behavior and how you can change provider behavior using tools from economics.

46
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:42,910
And so we're going to talk about some of that as well here.

47
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,600
We're going to talk in particular about three main ways to improve patient choices using tools from behavioral economics.

48
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:56,530
So one of them is to modify choice environments. The next is the use of financial incentives, and then finally, something called commitment devices.

49
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,480
Now, that may be a very jargony term to you right now.

50
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,350
Rest assured that by 25 minutes or so from now, you'll understand what that means and how it can be used.

51
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:12,970
And that, again, we're going to show some examples of how those same tools can be transferred from the patient side to also the provider side.

52
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,250
So you have heard over the last two months, I guess now at this point.

53
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:25,370
Right. And some of you beyond, depending on what coursework you had coming into the program, some of the assumptions of standard economic models.

54
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:30,100
And just to review some of these that are most relevant, to think about behavioral economics,

55
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,020
you know, starting first, people are rational in their decision making.

56
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,150
They carefully weigh the marginal benefits and the marginal costs of their decisions.

57
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:47,710
Then they make choices that will maximize their utility. That utility that stems from one's own self-interest.

58
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:54,340
All right. So and then the preferences that people have are their utility functions, how they derive their utility.

59
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:59,769
We can learn from that about the choices that they make. So in other words, people have revealed preferences.

60
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:07,160
We see the choices they make. We can then infer based on those choices what the utility function looks like and what sorts of things they prefer.

61
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,890
And then these preferences and thus the choices that people make are consistent over time.

62
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:17,110
Okay. People don't have, you know, changes in their utility function from one context to another.

63
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,770
It does another matter, for example, whether you ate breakfast this morning,

64
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:27,430
whether you're mad at your roommate, whether somebody cut you off on the road, you know, so on and so forth.

65
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,080
Some of those seemingly irrelevant things should not affect your preferences or utility function, etc.

66
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,940
I'm kind of I'm kind of foreshadowing a little bit some of where we're going to go over the next few slides.

67
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:42,950
Right. But those are some of the pillars for some of these, the assumptions of standard economic models, really.

68
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,670
Some of the foundations, I think, from my theory.

69
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:54,290
Now, the way that I frame that a little bit is that, you know, some of those assumptions aren't always realistic.

70
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,390
We could probably, you know, and that's why they're theory, right?

71
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,280
They're not laws or fundamental truths.

72
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:07,710
They're theories that then can be can form hypotheses and hypotheses then that can then be tested so that we can go back and improve our theories.

73
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:13,710
Now, oftentimes in the real world, some of those assumptions may not be tenable.

74
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:19,200
Okay, so what the field of basic economics does is it bring and builds on that foundation of

75
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:24,360
microeconomic theory and it provides it with more realistic psychological foundations.

76
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,170
Okay. So it doesn't say all those things that I just laid out or untrue per se.

77
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:36,960
But it does say that oftentimes they will fail to help us fully understand, predict and then ultimately shape human behavior in real world settings.

78
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,270
And if there's one kind of definition or explanation of behavioral economics, that's the best that I've seen.

79
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:43,770
It's what you see here on the screen.

80
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:50,250
And it increases the explanatory power of economics by providing it with more realistic psychological foundations.

81
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,919
So God doesn't say that all those things are untrue,

82
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:59,610
but it does say that if we bring in insights from the field of psychology that are can be complementary to microeconomic theory,

83
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,910
that that can help us better understand, predict and then shape human behavior.

84
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:06,600
And then the two people, you may say, well, you know, who are these people? Why should I believe this?

85
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,310
These are really two of the grandfathers of the liberal economics. Okay.

86
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:16,259
This is a relatively newer social science discipline that's probably been around for about 40 years or so at this point.

87
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,730
So, you know, microeconomics far predates that. Even psychology far predates that as well.

88
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,320
And has anybody here read Nudge or Predictably Rational?

89
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,729
So some of you have, you know, really these ideas for behavior economics have been popularized,

90
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,480
I think, to the broader public with these publications,

91
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,790
which have been really terrific and kind of capturing the public's imagination about the power of behavioral economics.

92
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,820
I think on the other hand, though, this is also, in some cases,

93
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:47,129
create some unrealistic expectations for behavioral economics because it has led some people to think,

94
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:52,920
well, if we could only nudge people to do all the things that we think they should be doing, that would make the world a better place, right?

95
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:58,650
Well, not necessarily. Okay. I think and Rich and I were just talking about this a few moments ago, really?

96
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:04,770
Behavioral economics works at its best when we help people be able to do the things consistently that are consistent with their goals,

97
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,889
values, aspirations. Okay. And so really,

98
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,700
that's where it's bringing in those more realistic psychological foundations and

99
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,810
aligning them with complementary insights from more standard economic models.

100
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:23,580
And really, there are three key behavioral economic insights from this field that are most relevant to health and health care choices.

101
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,420
And I'm going to go through these in detail and provide some examples of these in just a moment.

102
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,140
First, contextual factors can influence health care choices.

103
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,700
Second, people are often myopic or short sighted in their decision making.

104
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,500
I'll explain that more in just a moment.

105
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:44,160
And then conflicts can also exist between our current selves and our future selves, and I'll provide some specific examples of that.

106
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:48,570
And if we go back and we think about some of those assumptions, some centered economic models,

107
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:51,780
right, these are often in conflict with some of those assumptions.

108
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:54,760
So that's why I started with some of those assumptions.

109
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:00,390
I do know that those don't always fully help us understand and explain and predict human behavior.

110
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:08,250
All right. So INSIGHT one. So let's drill a little bit deeper into how contextual factors can influence choices.

111
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:12,750
Okay. So you guys have talked a lot about marginal benefits, cost, utility, etc., right?

112
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:20,040
And you probably didn't talk much, if at all, about the context in which people are making choices can influence the choices that they make.

113
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:23,940
Right. Because that's not traditionally a part of standard economic models.

114
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:32,310
Yet there are all kinds of examples out there of how the way that choices are framed can make the can affect the choices people make,

115
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,589
the order in which choices are presented. For example, anchoring.

116
00:11:37,590 --> 00:11:42,870
Anchoring is a phenomenon where people are given seemingly irrelevant information before they're asked to make a choice.

117
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:46,260
And that irrelevant information then affects the choice that they make.

118
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:54,120
If I had more time and provide you some specific examples of that, but rest assured that anchoring is a very real phenomenon and the defaults.

119
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,750
So the place that people are starting from can often affect the choices they make.

120
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,709
Again, another contextual factor that certain economic models would say shouldn't

121
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:07,050
necessarily affect the choices people make of how people feel when making choices.

122
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,060
Behavioral economists have called these visceral factors driven clinicians in the room.

123
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:20,910
Okay, one, so we would as clinicians and I'm a primary care clinicians, I'm going to see patients in Ann Hanover VA this afternoon.

124
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:28,290
We as clinicians are going to think of these as symptoms. So these are things like pain, anxiety, thirst, hunger.

125
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:36,360
Well, how people are feeling can often influence the choices that they make, how others feel about people's choices or social norms.

126
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,749
That's another contextual factor that can shape choices.

127
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,580
Now, standard economic models would say, Well,

128
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,250
you know how somebody else feels about the choices they make shouldn't necessarily affect the choices that you.

129
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:50,660
I suppose if that's somehow a part of your utility function to your preferences may be.

130
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:56,630
But you know, suffice it to say social norms or what other people do say what other people do,

131
00:12:56,870 --> 00:13:02,780
how other thinking about what other people would say you should do shouldn't really affect your choices, per se.

132
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:09,919
And all of these things together and more can lead to choices that are shaped not only by anticipated utility,

133
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,810
but also some of those contextual factors.

134
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:17,600
So, again, it isn't to say that we just kind of float through life and the context or in our choices or in a whim.

135
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,389
No, it's saying, you know, we seek to maximize our utility,

136
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:25,970
but there are a lot of other things in the context of the environment that can shape choices, too, that are important factors.

137
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:32,090
And again, this is so important to thinking about health care choices. Think about patient choices, think about provider choices.

138
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,340
An insight to people are often myopic in their decision making, I would say.

139
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,860
You know, there's probably one thing that I would encourage you to remember from this talk

140
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,370
about an insight from behavioral economics that's relevant to health care choices.

141
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,610
It would be this one. So myopia, short sightedness.

142
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:53,810
Some of you probably have this because you have like glasses or contacts like I'm wearing.

143
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,879
Okay? That means that we focus more on the here and now, the things immediately in front of us.

144
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,780
We can see those things best and most clearly, and that's what we pay the most attention to.

145
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,990
So myopia in this context refers to an overweighting of short term benefits and costs.

146
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:15,620
What that means then is people underweight, things that are far into the future, that are otherwise might be important to them.

147
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,870
So longer term benefits and costs.

148
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:27,440
What this means then is when people are incurring short term cost or inconveniences, here is something they have to give up.

149
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,979
This doesn't necessarily mean direct financial cost per se,

150
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,660
but it does mean something that people are going to say have to forgo or something that will be inconvenient to them.

151
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:40,550
People often have difficulty trading some of those short term costs for longer term benefits.

152
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,980
Probably the best example of that is preventive care.

153
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:48,440
Okay, so when I go into clinic this afternoon and I'm counseling patients about stopping smoking,

154
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,440
about getting a colon cancer screening test, you know,

155
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:55,969
there's frankly not going to be a lot of benefit to them in the short term from completing that task,

156
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:58,730
maybe a little bit of peace of mind if that test comes back to be negative.

157
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:04,700
But I'm really thinking about the next, you know, two, five, ten years adaptations life.

158
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,950
So there's a benefits much farther into the future and say if you're having to undergo a colonoscopy,

159
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,030
you've got to take a day off work, you've got to do the prep, you've got to do all kinds of things.

160
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,690
And then you've got to have this, you know, somewhat invasive procedure.

161
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:27,860
Okay. So there's a lot of short term costs, if you will, to put in for a longer term benefit.

162
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,849
Okay. So in situations like that, to the extent that people are focused on the here and now,

163
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:36,800
the things right in front of them, they might only focus on the short term costs and not that longer term benefits.

164
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,050
Okay. So that's why that myopia so important,

165
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:45,440
we can think of all kinds of examples where that myopia gets in the way of people making decisions that might otherwise be in their best interests.

166
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:53,130
All right. And then finally inside three is that people can often have conflicts between our current and our future selves.

167
00:15:53,490 --> 00:16:01,240
Now, all of us as and I will say that everything I'm talking about here today is not like a knock on anybody, anything like that.

168
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,650
It's a condition of being human, right? We're robots. We're not robots.

169
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,080
We're human beings. Right? We weren't robots.

170
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:12,570
We'd, like, walk through life computing, all these marginal benefits and costs and think about things very rationally, very calmly.

171
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:20,340
But it's that we're human beings. So all of us as human beings, as our current selves, want things for our future selves.

172
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,120
Maybe, for example, when your semester ends, you want to be the kind of student, right?

173
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,920
That gets a really good grade. I'm really proud of the work that you've done this semester.

174
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,610
Maybe you're somebody who, at the end of the day, wants to be somebody who goes to the gym every day.

175
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:37,500
Okay. So you may want that for your future self. Think of all kinds of other examples like that.

176
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,900
Right. You guys all want to go out and get a really good job some day.

177
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:44,270
That's why you're here and spending the money to get this terrific training you're getting.

178
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:48,960
So there's something your current selves want for your future self. Yeah.

179
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,629
When our future selves become our current selves, right?

180
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:57,030
When we walk through the future and that then becomes our current state, we may not have those same preferences.

181
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,549
I think the Jim going example is a good one.

182
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:04,890
If we think about things like dietary choices, we can think about things like substance use disorders, right?

183
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:09,600
All kinds of health related context in which we want things for our future selves.

184
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:15,299
But then when our current self becomes that future self, we may not want the same thing, those same things.

185
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:22,080
Our preferences have changed. So these conflicts then can lead to problems adhering to intended courses of action.

186
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,780
And behavioral economists have also called this time inconsistent preferences.

187
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,560
Or preferences can flip from one context and one time to another.

188
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:35,790
So that's kind of depressing, right,

189
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:41,909
that there's all these things that can get in the way of us making decisions that are might be in our best interests and consistent with our goals,

190
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:48,780
right? If our context shapes our decisions or myopic in our decision making, our preferences might flit from one context to another.

191
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,950
Well, that's the glass half empty part. The glass is half full part is that we can.

192
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:58,650
Then, knowing all of that, there are tools from the field of behavioral economics we can use to help people make good choices.

193
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:05,079
So I think the way that I think about these tools is we can map them on to a continuum of patient engagement.

194
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,410
If we focus for some patients and want to help patients make good choices that are consistent with our goals,

195
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,130
values, aspirations will maximize their utility, maximize their health outcomes.

196
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,600
We can think about different kinds of patients for whom some of these tools may be very helpful.

197
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:24,719
For example, patients who are susceptible to the influence of contextual factors, patients who are myopic in their decision making,

198
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:29,970
those who are motivated, but they anticipate problems adhering to an intended course of action.

199
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,530
We're going to start first by thinking about patients who are susceptible to the influence of

200
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:39,810
contextual factors and how we could modify choice environments could affect the choices that they make.

201
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,700
And then we'll talk about the use of financial incentives and then the application of something called commitment devices,

202
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,900
which again, explain that in just a minute. So first, to give out modifying choice environment.

203
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:56,819
So, you know, if so, this is some text you can see here on the screen from a trial we recently conducted at

204
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,170
the Philadelphia VA Medical Center that was focused on improving patient engagement,

205
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:06,239
diabetes prevention. Okay. So you can see here on the screen, this is for patients with pre-diabetes.

206
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,770
So patients who have a blood sugar that's higher than normal but are not high enough to be called diabetes.

207
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,420
And this is pretty standard health communication information, right? This is educational.

208
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,370
This is informing people of things that, well, you know, the marginal benefits of certain decisions that they might make.

209
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,979
For example, losing at least 7% of your body weight,

210
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,620
getting at least 30 minutes of moderate activity can reduce your risk of for diabetes in the future.

211
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:35,340
Joining a weight loss program or asking your primary care team about whether a medication to prevent diabetes might be right for you.

212
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:40,940
This is pretty standard health communication information. You might see some of this over from your colleagues in HPC.

213
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,450
Right? So and this is great.

214
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:50,160
This is information at a fairly low level of health literacy that I can confirm simple information to patients about their options.

215
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:57,480
Now, things maybe change a little bit then when we affect the context by saying, if you consider taking one of these actions,

216
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:03,600
think about someone whose opinion really matters to you, what action they would want you to take, right?

217
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:09,840
That is a different kind of context than simply thinking about this information and about the marginal benefits.

218
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:15,600
Now, we've created some additional context. We've now injected maybe some social norms into this decision.

219
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,770
Okay. And you may say, well, that's a really small change. How would that affect things?

220
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:25,319
Well, yes, it is. A lot of behavioral economic applications and tools have relatively small effects.

221
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,610
But I would say if we're going to be sending this kind of messaging out to thousands

222
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:33,840
or tens of tens of thousands of patients with pre-diabetes across a health system,

223
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:39,420
the marginal cost of it of adding this additional information is negligible.

224
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:46,379
Okay, so it may affect the context slightly, may affect a large population of patients and then creates a different context.

225
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,800
Inject some of those social norms maybe to influence choices that people make.

226
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,350
This is a really clever experiment.

227
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,839
It was published in American Journal of Public Health about ten years ago.

228
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,659
Now, that is really still, I think, to date in my mind,

229
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:07,410
one of the best examples of choice architecture modifications, anybody here from Boston, in fact.

230
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:11,940
So this is a study that was conducted at the Massachusetts General Hospital cafeteria,

231
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,630
and that's General sits in a part of Boston where there's not a lot of other food choices around.

232
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,860
So kind of everybody moves through the cafeteria and that's where they get their food. Right.

233
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:26,610
So you've got tens of thousands of patients, families, staff moving through the cafeteria every day,

234
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:30,390
making all kinds of choices about about food and about nutrition.

235
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:37,680
Okay. And what they did in the cafeteria is they do two pretty minor things to effect the choice environment.

236
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:44,999
Then, as I'll show you in a second, had a relatively large impact for the the resources that had to go into making those choices.

237
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,610
So what you see here is just the layout of the cafeteria. And on the left hand side, the dark shaded areas are where bottled water was located.

238
00:21:54,540 --> 00:22:00,360
On the right hand of the screen, you can see where they put the bottled water after the one stage of the experiment.

239
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,930
Okay, start blocking the screen for some of you.

240
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,240
So it basically made bottled water much more visible.

241
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:11,760
The other thing that they did is they label everything in the cafeteria with a red, yellow or green label.

242
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,590
Red say green things are things that you can eat as much of as you want.

243
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:22,379
High level nutritional value. You also like salads, fruits, water, stuff like that.

244
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,860
That stuff is green. You know, eat, eat, eat or drink as much of it as you want.

245
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:29,520
Yellow are things that, wow, they got some redeeming nutritional value.

246
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,800
But if you consume too much of it, that's.

247
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:40,090
Only about saying that maybe things like pasta breads, stuff like that, and then certain kinds of meats, things like that.

248
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:44,140
And then red things are things that really don't have much nutritional value at all.

249
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:48,130
And you'd probably be better to go without these sugar sweetened beverages.

250
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,700
Really, that's the best thing. Desserts, things of that nature. Okay.

251
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,130
And so what they did, they labeled everything in the cafeteria red, yellow or green, and they put the bottled water at eye level.

252
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:01,070
Okay. And so it changed the prices of anything.

253
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,780
It didn't change, really, the availability of anything.

254
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:12,639
They simply changed the layout in those two ways. And what they found is going from the baseline to that first phase, there are y.

255
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,340
G stands for red, yellow, green. That's the labeling intervention.

256
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,709
What you can see here is that when they went from that baseline to the phase one is that

257
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,580
that decreased the purchase of regular soda so that the sugar sweetened beverages.

258
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,270
Remember, this is Boston. They call it soda. They don't call it pop like we do here.

259
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:35,980
Right. So the sodas, the sugar sweetened beverages. And then the second thing they did is that choice, architecture modification and phase two,

260
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,400
where they put everything, they put all of actually that green stuff at eye level.

261
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,500
And they made that change to the cafeteria layout where the bottled water was more visible.

262
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:52,570
Now, again, the marginal cost to the cafeteria at Massachusetts General Hospital, making those changes to the layout was negligible.

263
00:23:52,960 --> 00:24:02,680
But what they found was a a significant increase in purchase of water with those interventions and a significant decrease in purchase of regular soda.

264
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:08,469
Now, they did something here that, you know, really is not kind of best practice in publishing.

265
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,310
You can see here on the axis, on the vertical axis, it doesn't go from 0 to 100.

266
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:19,900
It makes those bars look like a relatively larger difference. But if you look at the numbers, that numerical decrease is pretty small in those things.

267
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:26,110
But again, thousands of people move that their cafeteria every day and this is simply changing the layout of the cafeteria.

268
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:31,600
There wasn't like a counselor that they had to hire full time to sit down and talk to people about their nutritional choices.

269
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:35,210
They didn't have to change the prices, which might affect their revenue. Okay.

270
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,890
They changed the layout in the cafeteria so people were purchasing different stuff.

271
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:46,329
All right. So that's those are some examples of choice architecture modifications, the use of financial incentives.

272
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:50,469
This can be particularly salient for patients who are myopic in their decision making.

273
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:57,100
So again, thinking about some of those preventive care examples, right, where it's all costs, if you will, in the short term and very few benefits,

274
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:03,160
we provide a short term or immediate benefit to engaging in that clinical preventive service, for example,

275
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:09,190
that might lead more patients who are otherwise focused on the here and now to actually go through with that service.

276
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:16,750
So this is an example of where we tested the use of financial incentives in a primary care setting.

277
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:23,320
This is a clinical setting in which our rates of colorectal cancer screening were very low.

278
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,740
So this was two is back to the Philadelphia VA Medical Center.

279
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:33,550
And the problem there is that, you know, it's really three main options for colorectal cancer screening based on the evidence,

280
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:38,530
we only because of resources had one available at that time. This is a safety net clinical setting.

281
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:42,220
So this Philadelphia VA Medical Center is more of kind of a safety net hospital.

282
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:46,269
And so we didn't have a lot of resources at that time to provide, say,

283
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:50,320
more expensive colonoscopies for patients who are an average risk for colorectal cancer.

284
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:58,870
So what's cheaper is for patients, too. And, you know, the evidence says this is likely just as good is a kit that you can take home.

285
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:02,050
And so it's a colorectal cancer screening test kit that you take on.

286
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,820
And how many of you have heard of this kind of kit before if people having a test.

287
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,040
Okay. Yeah. And I saw a couple of like kind of faces, right? So basically what you do is you take this kit home.

288
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,650
I'm not going to ask any of you to tell your classmates about how this is done.

289
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:18,700
What you do is you take it home, a scoop, a little piece of your stool out of the toilet.

290
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:23,380
You put it in a little test tube, we seal it up, self-addressed stamped out blood that goes to the lab at the hospital.

291
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,530
And then they tell you if there are small amounts of blood in your stool that you can't see.

292
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:31,660
In fact, some of you exemplified on your face as kind of an X factor to that.

293
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,940
Right? That's a lot of costs in the short term.

294
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,620
Most patients aren't, you know, weird like us as clinicians where it's like, oh, yeah, stool, no problem.

295
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:45,400
Right? It's like they don't want to have to deal with that. Right? So there's a lot of costs in the short term, not a lot of media benefit.

296
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:52,090
And the problem was out of patients who are agreeing to complete this test at home, only about a third of them would complete the kit.

297
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:53,709
So we said, well,

298
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:59,800
could a small financial incentive actually help patients return those kids more consistently when they already agreed to do the test?

299
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:03,880
Again, this is different than trying to nudge people to do something they don't want to do.

300
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,060
These are people who said they want to do something but probably aren't going to follow through on it.

301
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:14,620
And what we found here is that a $5 incentive delivered as a one in ten chance of $50

302
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:20,290
led to about a 20% absolute increase in completion of those fecal immunochemical tests.

303
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,680
Okay. So again, relatively small amount on a budget. We didn't have to hire a nurse to like hound people to return their kits.

304
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:31,840
We didn't have to have any, you know, expensive intervention like this is really.

305
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,740
Relatively low cost intervention to to encourage people to follow through on completing their gets.

306
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,770
Financial incentives have also been used in a lot of other contexts, including things like medication adherence.

307
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:49,340
And I can probably come up with dozens of other examples where financial incentives have been shown to be powerful.

308
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,440
Now, I'm not here to market by behavioral economic tools.

309
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:55,169
To you, I would be remiss if I didn't say that.

310
00:27:55,170 --> 00:28:01,290
You know, if you look, for example, in this graph here that you see you see here the proportion of patients,

311
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:06,810
these were financial incentives for adherence to blood thinners among patients who should be on an anticoagulant.

312
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:14,580
Okay. And what you're seeing here is the proportion of time that they are out of range or that they are sub therapeutic on those anticoagulants.

313
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,700
You can see here when the lottery or the financial incentive has taken away,

314
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:23,700
people's rates of being out of control for their anticoagulant goes back to what it was before the financial incentives were delivered.

315
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:29,760
So that's a fundamental problem with financial incentives that often when we take them away, people go back to where they were before.

316
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:36,930
Okay? That's why in some cases those incentives may be more powerful for use for one time, things like a completion of a screening test.

317
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:45,510
All right. And then finally, ease of commitment devices. Now, what commitment devices are is committing one's future self to a course of action

318
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,610
and then implementing supports so that you stay on track when the going gets tough.

319
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:57,030
Okay. Now, if you're simply committing your future self to a course of action, that's just a public pledge.

320
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:01,680
And I will say that the data on public pledges is pretty weak in terms of their effects,

321
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,000
really, practically speaking, because it's so hard to break them. Right.

322
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:09,630
It's like, well, somebody won't really know if you kind of like don't adhere to your public pledge in private.

323
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,090
So what you do with a commitment devices,

324
00:29:12,090 --> 00:29:18,090
you commit your future self to a course of action and then you implement supports to make it hard for you to move away from that.

325
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:21,840
You increase the marginal cost of moving away from your intended course of action.

326
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:25,470
And one kind of commitment device is something called a deposit contract.

327
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:29,819
Deposit contracts are committing your future self to a course of action by putting

328
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,650
your own money on the line that you stand to lose if you don't achieve that goal.

329
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:40,049
If any of you are curious about this, there's a website that, again, I'm not here to market thanks to you.

330
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:45,720
I'm simply giving you tools and information and I don't have any affiliation with this

331
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:52,049
website that exemplifies some applications of this tool is a website called stick dot com.

332
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:58,230
I believe it is either CIC Kcom or s-type sti kcom.

333
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,820
I'm blanking on which it is right now.

334
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:06,330
Two K is basically stick dot com and what you can do is you can go on there and you can set up a commitment device or deposit contract.

335
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,760
You say, you know what, I want to get an A in Professor Hertha's class this semester.

336
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:18,360
Okay? And you can enter into a deposit contract and then there's somebody who is a and okay, well that's a public pledge.

337
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,550
The thing that makes a commitment device then is you lose your money if you don't achieve that goal.

338
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:28,650
And then and then there's somebody who serves as a referee.

339
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,200
So you have to get a friend to serve as a referee for that.

340
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:39,330
And the thing that makes it an even more powerful potentially commitment device is the money you put on the line that you lose.

341
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:45,720
If you don't achieve your goal, you can actually designate that to a kind of an anti charity, if you will.

342
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,350
So it can be more painful that if your money is going to go to, let's say, an advocacy cause that you do not support,

343
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,800
okay, now I'm going to get myself in trouble with Election Day being tomorrow.

344
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:02,820
But you can think in your own mind about like what you would be, who you would be really aggrieved to have that money go to.

345
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:08,940
Okay. And that might be a very powerful motivator that to say, you know, I'm really going to get that that a professor for this class.

346
00:31:09,270 --> 00:31:13,589
Okay so stick out you can check that out as an example of what I call the contract.

347
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:19,229
As we tested this approach in a randomized trial in an employer in New Jersey a number of years ago,

348
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:24,870
and these were these were employees who all had a BMI greater than 30 and all of whom wanted to lose weight,

349
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:31,620
had access to a lot of workplace wellness tools to help them lose weight, but were having trouble achieving their weight loss goals.

350
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:38,600
So this trial asked them to enter into a deposit contract using an approach just like matching in a401kk.

351
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:42,360
We had in three different arms of money you just put on the line you lost if you

352
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,710
didn't achieve your weight loss goals or it was matched 1 to 1 by the employer,

353
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,100
even 2 to 1 by the employer,

354
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:54,990
we can see here in the 1 to 1 match arm is that people on average lost £5 over six months just for that deposit contract and it's a loan.

355
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:03,959
So that's an example of a commitment device. There have also been commitment devices or deposit contrast tested for smoking cessation is a paper

356
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,750
from New England Journal of Medicine several years ago that tested that kind of approach to.

357
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:13,290
So there are a number of applications where deposit contracts could be used to help people achieve their goals.

358
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:18,540
Now, remember, you've got to be highly motivated, right, in order to enter into that deposit contract,

359
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:22,950
if you're ambivalent about it, you're never going to put that money into the deposit contract to begin with.

360
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,729
Okay. So you got to be really highly motivated. All right.

361
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:31,380
So we can use some of those same tools or approaches that to improve clinician engagement.

362
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,030
We can modify, for example, choice environment. So this is a really clever study done a few years ago there really was kind of

363
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:42,499
a retrospective review of a system wide change that was made at Penn Medicine.

364
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,600
So this is University of Pennsylvania's health system.

365
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:51,080
And the problem that they had there is that often a lot of patients were being prescribed brand name drugs,

366
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:56,600
and that was being felt by pharmacies as brand name drugs. But a generic would have been just as good but much less expensive.

367
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:05,120
And so what they did is they then created as a default in the electronic health record, a generic drug when a brand name drug would also be an option.

368
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:09,590
Now, with everything that I've talked about today, it preserves that freedom to choose.

369
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:13,909
That's one of the beauties of economic tools, is that you can kind of override that.

370
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,270
Right?

371
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:20,600
And so it doesn't lock you into any particular decision, but it does account for some of these human factors that can affect the choices that we make.

372
00:33:20,990 --> 00:33:25,070
So what happened here is that if you are going to, for example, ordering antihypertensive medication,

373
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:30,920
it would default to a generic drug rather than a brand name drug. You can override that and request that branded drug.

374
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,790
And so you can see here is on the vertical axis. These are prescriptions that are indeed ordered as a medication.

375
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:41,720
And across all these different classes of drugs,

376
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:47,930
generic drugs were prescribed more often when there was this system wide change to have the generic drugs be the default.

377
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:56,270
Okay, small modification in the chart doesn't require extensive resources, doesn't require a Clinton education program.

378
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,100
Does it require pay for performance?

379
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:03,139
Like all of the things you guys are learning about and we'll continue to learn about does require any of that stuff.

380
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,130
It's a modification. The choice environment of the. All right.

381
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,940
Financial incentives, of course, matter for clinicians.

382
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:16,280
And you guys. I think we'll be talking about that. When you talk about reimbursement models now,

383
00:34:17,450 --> 00:34:21,499
economic incentives or financial incentives as a behavioral economic tool are often

384
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:25,370
different than simply paying people more to do something that you want more of.

385
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:34,010
Okay. It is changing. The way that the incentive is defined is is provided accounting for some of those psychological factors.

386
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:40,010
So there's a paper published a couple of years ago in JAMA Network Open that was a randomized trial of some of these different approaches.

387
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,670
And what they looked at was within a pay for performance program.

388
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,370
So this was delivered by a health insurance company.

389
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:54,530
They said, you know, could we instead of we could just pay people more to try to get more of the things we want to get to provide higher value care,

390
00:34:54,890 --> 00:35:02,440
or we can structure that financial incentive as here's the money upfront and you're going to lose it if you don't achieve the quality metrics, right?

391
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:06,800
Rather than giving people money when they achieve the quality metric, let's take it away if they don't achieve it.

392
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:07,969
And unfortunately,

393
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:15,500
what they found here is that essentially providing financial incentives in that way was no better than just simply paying them more.

394
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:21,440
So these things are sometimes easier said than done, but that's why we need more research to test some of these different models.

395
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:27,440
But it's an example of how these insights can be applied to clinician decision making and that commitment devices,

396
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:31,189
they can be used in this context too for clinicians.

397
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:38,960
So we conducted a randomized trial, actually, two of them using this kind of approach at Michigan Medicine at an IHS with system,

398
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:43,610
which is a multispecialty private group practice in Southeast Michigan, centered in Ann Arbor.

399
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:50,240
And one of the problems that we face in primary care is there was too much low value care delivered in primary care.

400
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:58,760
So low value care is our services that don't improve patient patient outcomes much and could lead to unnecessary harms and costs.

401
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:04,100
Now, you may think about, well, what you know, that's weird. Why would you even provide any of that kind of health care.

402
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:07,459
Right. Doesn't for patient outcomes could lead to unnecessary harms and costs.

403
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:12,290
Well, there's all kinds of contextual factors, right, that it can affect the choices that we as clinicians make.

404
00:36:12,650 --> 00:36:16,430
And this is a good example of some of those time inconsistent preferences.

405
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:20,660
So when I'm talking to you about this today and I look at some things like, for example,

406
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,180
ordering imaging tests for nonspecific low back pain for imaging head imaging tests like

407
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:32,059
a CT scan or an MRI for simple headaches or unnecessary antibiotics for acute sinusitis.

408
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:37,580
So these are upper respiratory symptoms of limited duration that are more likely to be value and to be viral.

409
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,989
You know, as I say, there's things like, yeah, we shouldn't be ordering those.

410
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:45,140
I shouldn't be doing that when I go into clinic and see patients this afternoon.

411
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:50,480
Yeah, because a variety of different contextual factors sometimes we do order services like that.

412
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:54,440
Okay. So that's an example of those time and consistent preferences right now.

413
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,800
I don't prefer those things when I'm in the middle of seeing patients and I'm busy and I'm tired and it's 430 and I'm running 45 minutes behind,

414
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,750
I may feel a little bit differently about that.

415
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:08,479
Okay, so I can commit my future self to a course of action and then make it difficult to move away from that.

416
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,549
When I might get tempted to say, You know what, I'm not going to talk to you about ordering the hammer on head MRI, why it's not needed.

417
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:17,090
I'm just going to order the thing. Okay. So that's a commitment device.

418
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:24,290
I mean, what we found with this command device approach is that we were able to reduce

419
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:30,949
unnecessary imaging for low back pain by 1.2 percentage points on an absolute level.

420
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:36,920
So the. Starting from a baseline of about 10% of visits for patients with low back pain in this clinical setting,

421
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:44,730
not an unnecessary imaging test, we decrease that on a relative basis of 12% or an absolute basis, 1.2 percentage points.

422
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,240
You may say again, that's a small difference, not a big deal. Right.

423
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,080
Well, what we did here is we had a meeting with clinicians. We gave them lunch.

424
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:58,620
We asked them to make a commitment to following these guidelines to avoid these low value services at the point of care.

425
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:04,379
We provided that with a Post-it note with a reminder of the commitment they've made and a nice piece of education handout that could

426
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:10,980
readily be turned into a conversation so that they could stay on track when they might get tempted to order one of these services.

427
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:15,150
Really low cost intervention, really scalable, led to a small difference,

428
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,140
but scaled across thousands of patients could make a big difference across the system.

429
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,580
So this was a whirlwind tour of behavioral economics.

430
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:28,080
Okay. I gave you some key behavioral economic insights into health care choices.

431
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:36,060
But the patient side and the clinician side, we talked about three specific tools to improve patient choices modifying choice environments,

432
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:44,460
using financial incentives, using commitment devices, and then how some of those same tools could be used to improve clinician choices.

433
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:49,560
Okay, I would be glad to answer any questions or respond any comments you may have.

434
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:56,310
And then I love to work with students. Okay. Working with Brandon on a project now unrelated behavioral economics,

435
00:38:56,310 --> 00:39:03,660
but I would be delighted if any of you were interested in this line of work to talk more and see if there's something we could work together on.

436
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:08,260
Okay. So what what questions or comments do you have?

437
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:19,479
So with that generic drug graph, yeah, we'll go back to that decline that was going up.

438
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,040
There is at the moment that the generic term the default.

439
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:29,940
Yeah, that's right. So. So the dash line is November 2014 when that default was implemented in the chart.

440
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,240
Okay. But I'm noticing that. Oh, like okay.

441
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:37,360
That was the only motion that I have.

442
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:43,450
For some reason I might be just very tired. My thought is going up before then, but obviously you just had.

443
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:47,740
Well, it is a little bit you know, it's a good question. I don't remember the exact date of when that was implemented.

444
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:53,590
And those of you that have worked in health systems, sometimes these are not as clean as you might think.

445
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,990
Right. So, for example, if let's say hypothetically that November one is when that change was implemented,

446
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,340
the lights start to go up a little bit before that. Right.

447
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,470
So it's like you really want to isolate the effects of that intervention.

448
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,420
Yeah, people are starting to talk about it. They don't coming. There are a lot of other changes going on in the chart.

449
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:13,659
Right. So something was going on a little bit before that.

450
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:21,010
That is maybe unclear or maybe it was implemented in some clinics first as on a pilot basis and that was rolled out to others.

451
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:27,489
So I'm not exactly sure what was going on there, but really, if you if you separate out even more or let's say, for example,

452
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:32,649
you look at that January and sometimes analysis like this, people will say, you know, well, that's kind of a wash out period.

453
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,670
There's a lot of things going on. So let's in this approach, let's really look at, for example,

454
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:42,910
January to September and then let's look at January to June where it's a little bit cleaner, those differences.

455
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,540
Okay, yeah, there was something else kind of going on there.

456
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:51,849
And as we all know, changing provider behavior is also sometimes easier said than done.

457
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:55,810
Right? So it's not as easy as just can be because we're human beings and we're not robots.

458
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,359
It's just flipping a switch and like providers will just sort of mindlessly then start ordering generic drugs and they say,

459
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:05,019
well, what what's going on here is there's going to be education and other things too.

460
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:09,070
So that probably explains some of that extended upward slump that you're seeing there.

461
00:41:09,490 --> 00:41:20,200
Yeah, the questions. Yeah, because there's something being done to target the reasons that physicians act the way they do, like,

462
00:41:20,830 --> 00:41:26,850
you know, being scared of ratings by patients or instead of just trying to talk to them and to do this and that.

463
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:32,140
And so yeah, yeah. It's a really good question. The short answer is yes.

464
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:37,670
Okay. The longer answer is that I think not enough, frankly, some of that is because, you know,

465
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:42,190
if you think about, for example, levers that like health plans or health systems have to pull, that's why,

466
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:49,960
you know, that is, I think a lot of the power of thinking about standard economic models and approaches in this context is that,

467
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,379
you know, a health plan that has millions of covered lives, right.

468
00:41:53,380 --> 00:42:01,840
Thousands of providers in their network, if not more, they can change reimbursement and effect all those, you know, decisions potentially tomorrow.

469
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:06,640
Right. So that can readily extend to a lot of people in the health. They can have control over all those things.

470
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,380
Think about how we can modify the environment so that all these disparate health systems.

471
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:18,729
Right. How do we go about doing that, other models for doing that, that is harder work, but I think there's not enough that's been done there.

472
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,459
And again, it doesn't mean that those reimbursement models don't matter,

473
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:26,260
but it does mean that we can affect greater change if we think about some of these other contextual factors.

474
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:32,769
Yeah, and there has been some work looking at, for example, the way that, you know, for example, quality report cards laid out.

475
00:42:32,770 --> 00:42:35,499
Right. So we could think about different ways to convey that information.

476
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:42,670
I mean, I get one, you know, in my inbox and clinic, you know, quarterly about like what quality metrics I'm meeting and not meeting.

477
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:46,780
And I think there's a lot that could be done there to make that information more powerful and more actionable.

478
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:54,250
Yeah. For the second like point in the continuum of clinician engagement, yeah,

479
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:58,989
you talked about like making providers like given to pause it further and they got it back.

480
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:05,440
If they're like quality metrics, we're uncertain. How did you get providers to do that deposit?

481
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:09,970
I feel like it's something that people wouldn't want to just like freely give.

482
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:12,040
Yeah, yeah. No, it's it's a really good question.

483
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:20,499
So what that the way and I didn't mention exactly how they did it in this experiment what they did is and cause you're right like right

484
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:29,200
and since they ideally if you really were to adhere to the principles of a financial incentive that relied on behavioral economics,

485
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,319
insight, insights, I didn't talk much about loss aversion, right?

486
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:37,959
So the principle that people can feel losses more powerful than they feel otherwise equivalent gains is,

487
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,560
yeah, we'd give them that money first and then you would literally take it away from them.

488
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:49,180
Okay. In order to to, you know, best engender loss aversion now like for a variety of reasons that would be problematic.

489
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:52,330
Right. And we can think about, you know, ten of those right off the bat.

490
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,070
So what they did in this experiment is they said, you know what, this has been set aside for you and it's years.

491
00:43:57,070 --> 00:44:01,899
We promise, trust us. We really want you to feel like this is yours.

492
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,500
So that when then we take it away. You're going to feel it as a loss.

493
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:11,530
Okay. That could, though, be one explanation when you know for why this approach wasn't as powerful.

494
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:16,700
You guys, I don't know if there's still a course in HP that's on provider behavior.

495
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:24,640
When I was in your shoes, I'm not going to tell you when you're as an MBA student that there was a course in provider behavior.

496
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:32,200
And because, like, you know, as we think about patient behavior, all kinds of actors in health system, it was behaviors we want to modify.

497
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:38,709
Clinicians can be particularly squirrely and difficult to to change behavior on for a number of reasons.

498
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:43,270
Right. Some of which I talked about this. But to others why the semester long course that I took on that?

499
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,600
Because providers know that's not mine. Well, I know what you're doing here.

500
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:51,660
Right. So, like, it could be that that really didn't feel like a loss.

501
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:55,030
They felt like that bonus was really theirs and then it genuinely was taken away.

502
00:44:55,270 --> 00:45:01,300
But that's kind of how you have to do something like that, because you can't just deposit in somebody's bank account and then pull it out.

503
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,620
Other questions. Is are good ones. Yeah. I may just miss this.

504
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:09,609
Can you talk a little more about choosing wisely and how exactly it creates like a liability

505
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:14,830
for physicians if they don't choose the right thing or if they do provide low value services?

506
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:22,450
Yeah, yeah. No, it's a it's a really good question. And so the choosing wisely campaign and then not heard about it choosing wisely dot org as

507
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:27,220
the website for that and that is a list of things that's been around for about ten years now,

508
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:32,110
a list of services identified by a clinic, clinical, professional societies,

509
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:37,810
the things that doctors and patients should question because they may not improve outcomes that could lead unnecessary harms and costs.

510
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:42,879
Now, things that you should question not less of Thou shalt never do X, Y or Z.

511
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,740
But there are things you should question, okay?

512
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:52,330
Because on average, for patients in these situations, they may not add much value, but in fact they can actually be harmful.

513
00:45:52,710 --> 00:46:02,920
Now, you know, the so the medical legal aspects of that are probably beyond the scope of what,

514
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:07,660
you know, my area of expertise and, you know, the time that we have here today.

515
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:13,540
I will say, though, thinking about things like liability and defensive medicine,

516
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:17,560
this is an example of a psychological factor that can influence decision making.

517
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:21,460
Okay. And some of this relates to loss aversion.

518
00:46:22,420 --> 00:46:27,340
If you talk to any clinician who has been sued before, it is a horrible experience.

519
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:31,180
It is a vivid experience. It will stay with them for the rest of their career.

520
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:40,960
And and, you know, and that likely will influence the way that they they make decisions going forward for a very long time.

521
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:48,280
Okay. A lot of it is that loss aversion, because there is the financial potential financial loss, there's the professional status.

522
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:54,640
There's all kinds of things that make that loom really large in people's minds rather than,

523
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:57,910
oh, this patient had a really good outcome from this thing that I did.

524
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:04,540
So I'm going to do this more going forward where the loss aversion kicks in as there was a really bad outcome with this patient,

525
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:11,140
either because they had a bad outcome or because I got sued. And that might loom even larger and have a greater impact on decision making

526
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:15,910
than does a patient having a similarly similar magnitude about good outcome.

527
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:21,430
Okay. So that's where kind of some of that defensive medicine comes into play, especially for people who've been sued.

528
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:25,900
There actually was a really clever paper done about 15 years or so on this very issue,

529
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:32,920
looking at patient and clinicians, actual risk of being sued in different states by different specialties.

530
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,520
And, and,

531
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:49,269
and the actual I think it was the actual like whether they'd actually been sued and then the threat of being sued by the clinicians with their

532
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:56,840
specialty in their state and they found basically that that environment was much more influential was then was whether you actually get sued or not.

533
00:47:56,860 --> 00:48:01,930
So I think that's an example of how that context can really affect the choices that clinicians make.

534
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:11,050
So yeah, good question. Others here in the clinic, have you guys used like motivational interviewing to change the patient's behavior?

535
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:17,920
Yeah, we have. Yeah, it's a great question. And so that's an example of, you know, really that's an intervention or approach,

536
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,980
really kind of purely from the psychology field, from social psychology.

537
00:48:21,430 --> 00:48:26,470
Motivational interviewing is great. It really kind of helps you isolate what are people's goals, values and aspirations,

538
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:32,290
and then helps them make choices that are aligned with their goals, values and aspirations.

539
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:40,479
So I would say that is yet another example, not too similar to what you talked about here with microeconomic theory of insights

540
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:43,389
or approaches that are complementary to everything I've talked about today,

541
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:47,650
because that doesn't get that doesn't kind of get us away from the problem that,

542
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,920
yes, when people are engaged in that motivational interviewing interaction,

543
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:57,309
the context in which they go on to make choices may affect their decisions, how they can be myopic in their decision making.

544
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:02,170
Right. How, yes, their current selves say that yes, this is aligned with my goals and values.

545
00:49:02,470 --> 00:49:06,250
But yet when. Their current self becomes their future self.

546
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:12,730
They may get pulled away from that. Okay, so that's one way to kind of match choices with people's preferences.

547
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:21,340
We actually have a trial going in the field right now at Michigan Medicine that is trying to align insights from self-determination theory,

548
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:24,550
which is a field of psychology that relates to motivational interviewing.

549
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:31,330
And it appears that with financial incentives, so that when people make choices consistent with their preferences and their goals,

550
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,130
the financial incentives help them stay on track when they get tempted to move away from that.

551
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,040
So another complementary approach. All right.

552
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,190
I'm a little bit over my time, and I know you guys have other things to get to.

553
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:52,590
Definitely reach out to me if you have more questions, comments, anything that I can be helpful with, please let me know.

554
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:58,530
Rachel so knows how to get a hold of me too. I'm so happy to help in any way I can and thanks for the opportunity to talk to you today.

555
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:11,390
I like you so much. Yes. Thank you, Rich. Great. Thank you.

556
00:50:11,910 --> 00:50:18,860
Are you there? I'll be overseeing the behavioral economics.

557
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:30,710
It's a commitment. It wasn't just the presentation of.

558
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:45,250
Hi, everyone. My name is Marianne Zak.

559
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:50,500
I'm Nadia. And today we're going to be talking about the experimental evidence on the production of health.

560
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:55,930
So we're going to spend some time talking about two articles today.

561
00:50:55,930 --> 00:51:02,410
So I'm going to go over the first one, which talks about the rise and criticisms of the randomized controlled trials.

562
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:07,179
And then I'm going to pass it off to Zack and Nadia, who are going to be discussing the second article,

563
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:13,990
which talks about the effects of intervention on taxpayers as it relates to health insurance enrollment and mortality.

564
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:20,140
And then in between the presentation, we're going to have some we're going to make some time for some class discussions.

565
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:23,830
So stay tuned for that. Okay. So let's get right into it.

566
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:32,860
In 2019, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to these three individuals pictured here on the screen for a scientific approach they championed,

567
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:36,220
which is known as the randomized controlled trials.

568
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:42,220
For the purposes of this presentation, I'm going to continue to refer to the randomized controlled trials as far as cities.

569
00:51:42,790 --> 00:51:48,160
So our teams are experiments that apply an intervention to a randomly selected group,

570
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:56,050
a randomly selected portion of the population, and comparative effects to a group that did not receive the intervention.

571
00:51:56,410 --> 00:52:00,520
And this has affected the field of economics in many ways.

572
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,500
Not only did it change how questions were posed, but it also changed how questions were developed.

573
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,129
For example, instead of economics, focusing on economics,

574
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:14,500
focusing on larger scale questions with less definitive answers like Why are countries poorer?

575
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:23,410
They have shifted towards more, towards answering smaller scale questions with more definitive answers, like, Do textbooks improve student outcomes?

576
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:31,450
So although answering simple questions you can look straight, can look like it has a straightforward answer,

577
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,560
the path to getting to that answer may be a little bit more complex.

578
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:39,870
So let's take the example on the stream Does drinking soda make people less healthy?

579
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,270
So there are different ways to think about this.

580
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:54,090
So maybe people who are drinking soda were already unhealthy to begin with, or people are drinking soda to combat things like fatigue or energy.

581
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:59,040
So the article talks about a couple of ways that researchers try to get around this.

582
00:52:59,340 --> 00:53:04,739
So the first solution is to observe a neighborhood that just opened up a convenience store and observing

583
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:10,500
whether coupons on soda increases for purchases and observing whether that has outcomes in overall health.

584
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:17,820
The second solution, the most effective solution is to randomly, I suppose, allow a variable of interest to a population.

585
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:23,850
So you would find participants and half will continue to live their life as they did before,

586
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:30,659
and the other half will continue to live their life will continue to drink more will continue to drink soda,

587
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:43,350
but less of it, and as a result will be able to calculate confidently conclude whether the results of the data was better.

588
00:53:43,350 --> 00:53:47,640
The results of the data were caused by drinking more soda.

589
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:56,740
So that leads us into our first discussion question. So what are some advantages and disadvantages of randomized controlled trials?

590
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:05,140
So as you guys brainstorm ideas, I encourage you guys to think about how our cities affect people, policies, and medicine.

591
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,990
Yeah. They reduce bias. Yeah, that's true.

592
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:26,860
They do reduce bias. So since they can actually be studying outcomes, that is a good tool to know the cause and effect relationship between the study.

593
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:31,990
Yeah. Yes. A disadvantage is the really expensive.

594
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:37,360
That's true. Yeah. And. Yes.

595
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:42,960
And. Yeah. And spoiler alert, that is actually one of the criticisms we're going to talk about in the next slide.

596
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:49,080
So you guys are right on track. Yes. They're not always I call it kind of depends on what you're studying.

597
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:52,750
You can study just anything with a randomized controlled trial. Mm hmm.

598
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:59,680
Okay. So with that being said, we're going to move on to talk about some of the criticisms that you guys mentioned.

599
00:54:59,710 --> 00:55:05,290
So the first criticism is that the fact that our sites use do not generalize.

600
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:13,330
So, for example, a book that is used in one region of Kenya is only applicable to that one region in Kenya.

601
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:17,200
However, it won't be applicable to a region and Bangladesh.

602
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:24,310
And this is a concept that is known as external validity. But it is important to note that this is not just unique to our cities.

603
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:32,980
Moving on to my second point, a lot many people have complained that the field has shifted more towards

604
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:38,650
answering small questions and although answering bigger questions are important.

605
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:42,970
The article mentions that we simply do not have the answers for them.

606
00:55:43,210 --> 00:55:51,310
So even though we are answering small questions, we are we are finding solutions to move forward.

607
00:55:51,550 --> 00:56:01,210
And our cities have helped us, you know, improve lives, how to save lives, improve schools, increase incomes, which who doesn't like that?

608
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:09,550
In addition, a lot of people you guys mentioned are concerned about participants and agency.

609
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:15,040
So many people talk about how our cities are more humanizing.

610
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:20,770
But the opposite of a controlled study is an uncontrolled study in which individuals would be given

611
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:29,380
resources about anyone who would be given an intervention without anyone checking as it's effective.

612
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,220
Also, our cities are also expensive.

613
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:39,160
They are viewed as a highly, highly valuable and expensive method of research.

614
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:49,990
And many people complain that the field has become obsessively focused on using our cities to answer questions instead of using cheaper resources.

615
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:59,800
However, an analyst from the World Bank, David McKenzie, found that our cities continue to be a minority to the developmental economic research.

616
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:04,120
And therefore, as my article concludes,

617
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:12,969
the final criticism it had was that our cities were one tool in the toolbox kind of approach with which is an overcorrection,

618
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:24,700
because the other cities have allowed us to develop more answerable questions, which has provided a an enormous and beneficial change to the field.

619
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:30,370
And now I'm going to pass it on to Zach to discuss the second to introduce a second article.

620
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,570
Awesome. So the second article we're going to talk about is health insurance and mortality and experimental evidence from taxpayer outreach.

621
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:45,610
So the introduction of this, it's a scientific study into the 2017 IRS pilot interventions.

622
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,730
And what was that? Was they randomly selected?

623
00:57:49,540 --> 00:58:01,299
I think it was about 3.9 million people who were who had to deal with the tax penalty the previous year and studied and did the intervention.

624
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:08,770
And now they will go into that a little bit more. But the purpose of this scientific study was first to study the effects of tax interventions on

625
00:58:08,770 --> 00:58:14,200
taxpayers to see if it had any effect on health insurance enrollment and the mortality rate.

626
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:17,020
Once that effect was identified,

627
00:58:17,530 --> 00:58:25,330
they wanted to determine if there was a causality between the subsequent higher health insurance enrollment and reduced mortality rates.

628
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:30,580
For the purposes of this scientific research.

629
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:36,940
They noted that the most important things about health insurance coverage in the United States for this is

630
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:43,340
Americans under the age of 65 who lack health insurance for an entire year was about 9 to 13% of the time.

631
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,770
This was in 2017.

632
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:53,440
And for Americans under the age of 65 who lack health insurance for at least one month out of the year was about a fourth of the population.

633
00:58:54,520 --> 00:59:02,290
And the plans that they they'll specifically go into and is important to address are estate exchange plans,

634
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:07,350
which are plans for people who are not eligible for government insurance plans like Medicare,

635
00:59:07,370 --> 00:59:13,060
Medicaid and employer sponsored plans to enroll in an exchange plan.

636
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:20,610
They would have to do it through open room and open enrollment window, which is November 1st to January 31st.

637
00:59:20,970 --> 00:59:25,950
And they'd have to do it through their state or federal online portal and get personal information.

638
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:29,759
And it's pretty difficult to do that.

639
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:37,140
And we'll get into some of the consequences of that, to go into the individual mandate by the show of hands.

640
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,500
Who has heard of this individual mandate or tax penalty?

641
00:59:42,010 --> 00:59:43,470
Okay. So only a few of us.

642
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:51,510
So this individual mandate is defined as individuals who are required to maintain health coverage for themselves or dependents,

643
00:59:51,810 --> 01:00:02,010
or they will face a tax penalty. And this is pretty difficult to figure out how effective this is.

644
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:08,000
And it and it was abolished a couple of years ago by the Trump administration.

645
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:17,670
But for the purposes of this study, too, they wanted to understand why this wasn't very effective as a as a penalty.

646
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:23,640
One, it's a lack of awareness for us, even as a group of individuals who learn about this type of stuff.

647
01:00:23,850 --> 01:00:30,750
Only half of us really know about it. And also, there's not it's not really advertised to the general population.

648
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:35,670
And even when you are when you have to deal with it yourself and get penalized,

649
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:41,010
you might not even know about it because it's a small point on your line in your tax return.

650
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:46,820
It's also very complex. If you look at the formula, there is a whole lot that comes in to how much you're going to pay.

651
01:00:46,830 --> 01:00:52,049
I think it's a minimum of a maximum of a minimum and it is pretty difficult,

652
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:58,920
especially as someone who's looking and seeing that they were penalized, what what went into being penalized and how they came to that.

653
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:01,139
And then also, just the timing of the penalty.

654
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:07,980
You'll find out if you get penalized when you're doing your tax return and or paying your taxes and you just see it there.

655
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:12,209
And if you're doing it through a third party, you're having someone else to tackle it.

656
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,230
You might not even see it.

657
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:22,950
And the complexity of this penalty as well led to the IRS doing this pilot intervention and selecting people to do this health insurance coverage.

658
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:29,040
So a discussion question that I wanted to ask you guys is how effective was was

659
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:33,260
the tax penalty as an incentive to get health insurance and policies like that?

660
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:42,600
How effective do you think that is? So it wasn't that attractive because it mostly affected people who needed health insurance the most.

661
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:47,860
There was equity issues with it. Absolutely. What else?

662
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:53,400
Anyone else? Based on all those things you just said, it must not have been very effective.

663
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:56,879
Yeah, yeah. There's there's equity issues.

664
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:00,540
There's people not even knowing about it. There's so much to go into.

665
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:08,249
But just those type of incentives where where the government is penalizing someone

666
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:14,430
for not not getting something when there are so many different reasons behind it.

667
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:18,810
It's just not a very good general counsel to begin with.

668
01:02:19,350 --> 01:02:24,329
And I dealt with this in a lot of different ways as I sold these type of policies for a little bit,

669
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:30,720
and I dealt with a lot of people who had a son who didn't qualify for certain plans because their

670
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:36,719
family was dealing with a ton of health issues and they weren't poor enough to receive government aid,

671
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,680
but they weren't rich enough to have an employer who would give them health insurance benefits.

672
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:49,950
And it was really hard to see a lot of these people go through and realize at the end of the year when they needed money to pay for rent or they

673
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:57,470
realized they were penalized by the government for not getting health insurance or even the health insurance that counted as health insurance.

674
01:02:57,930 --> 01:03:02,040
So it's a big deal and that's one of the reasons why they did this.

675
01:03:02,040 --> 01:03:03,390
Ah, IRS intervention.

676
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:09,840
Is that what what was the you know, I remember the penalty and we had to file it on our tax system through FOX and check your insurance.

677
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,260
What was the actual penalty? Was it a percentage of your income.

678
01:03:13,270 --> 01:03:17,910
Yeah. So they just did deduct some money from your from your tax return.

679
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,810
So it was like a percentage or was it a fixed amount? I know.

680
01:03:21,810 --> 01:03:27,270
So that that's what the problem was with that formula is there were tons of different things that went into it.

681
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:35,159
I think this one is the amount of adults that you have to pay for, amount of children you have to pay for your gross amount income.

682
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:42,630
And that's just part of the overall equation at the top. So it's just so complex that the average person won't understand it completely.

683
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,820
So now going in audit will take over for that and research design.

684
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:53,129
Okay. So we're going to talk a little bit about how the sample was constructed.

685
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:55,320
And so all the data was derived from Centrelink.

686
01:03:56,730 --> 01:04:03,809
The first place was administrative records from the population files and that second place was information returned and that classified

687
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:12,090
information about monthly insurance coverage and who had insurance and what type of insurance they had and when they says they had it.

688
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:17,250
And the third place was the Social Security death trial and that records all the docs in the US.

689
01:04:17,250 --> 01:04:21,120
So that gave all the mortality data and there were some exclusion criteria

690
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:28,229
that I on the tax not just the taxpayer was dependent upon adults not in New

691
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:36,540
York State if they filed multiple returns that year and if they had a second address and if they had an individual taxpayer identification number,

692
01:04:36,900 --> 01:04:43,680
which is issued to those who are not eligible for Social Security number if they're between the ages of 18 to 64,

693
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:49,110
and if they or a household member had enrolled in exchange coverage like 15 or 16,

694
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:57,360
and for this trial, they were for treatment groups or either randomly assigned to the treatment group or assigned to be in the control group.

695
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:08,040
So the first group was the baseline group and they received a personalized estimate of their potential tax penalty back in mid-January.

696
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,410
So that's two weeks before the open enrollment deadline.

697
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:18,560
And second group was a non personalized group and they received like a very general letter the IRS about potential counseling

698
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:25,680
that they could get and the exemption information provided potential exemptions and how you can kind of get around that.

699
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:30,479
And the early mailing group also got a letter there. It was given back in November.

700
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:35,310
So at the beginning of the open enrollment deadline and overall and looking at the sample

701
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:41,489
population tended to be younger and male and lower income among the general population,

702
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:49,610
but higher income amongst those who don't have full year insurance coverage, about 58% of them in 20.

703
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,069
So we're looking at the coverage effects for the first year overall.

704
01:05:55,070 --> 01:06:00,700
So the first was how much we can affect the likelihood of obtaining insurance coverage in the year 2017,

705
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:03,880
which was the first year after the intervention.

706
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:13,930
And overall, their treatment did induce any increase in coverage and coverage in 2017.

707
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:19,750
And for those who do not have any coverage in 2016, they were more likely to obtain coverage in 2017.

708
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:24,219
So it is likely that they would have obtained insurance regardless of the intervention.

709
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:29,890
But the vast majority of them still did obtain coverage and the form of coverage also had an impact.

710
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:33,700
And the largest increase was for exchange coverage.

711
01:06:34,090 --> 01:06:38,260
And there was a similar effect from Medicaid coverage and there was no significant

712
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:43,030
effect for Medicare VI employer sponsored or off exchange individual coverage.

713
01:06:43,540 --> 01:06:49,870
And the treatment also induced about it and increased coverage for ages 65 and older.

714
01:06:50,410 --> 01:06:54,610
And income also had a really large impact on whether or not someone would get insurance.

715
01:06:54,610 --> 01:07:06,159
And so the largest increase was amongst those in the 100 to 1 38% poverty level, and they may not mainly die from Medicaid and for expansion states,

716
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:12,100
there was an increase in both Medicaid and exchange, but not expansion, since there's only an increase and exchange.

717
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:17,520
And the timing also had an impact on the intervention.

718
01:07:18,060 --> 01:07:21,000
So the woman with the greatest between December 2017,

719
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:28,410
in January 2018 and the open enrollment period started at the end of January and the treatment of folks last for about two years.

720
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:38,010
So you can conclude that fact. And then when looking at how many increased months of coverage were due to the intervention,

721
01:07:38,310 --> 01:07:42,360
the treatment group was more likely to have at least two months of coverage in 2017.

722
01:07:42,810 --> 01:07:49,050
And it is difficult to really determine how many individuals actually changed their behavior because of the intervention.

723
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:53,370
So that makes our study monotonic can be demonstrated in that first equation there.

724
01:07:53,940 --> 01:07:59,460
And then when calculating the total difference between the average coverage, between the treatment groups and the control groups,

725
01:07:59,910 --> 01:08:06,110
that can also be calculated with that second equation or F of zero and is the best probability function of coverage month.

726
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:15,860
And so overall, the final conclusion on the intervention led to between 1.4 to 14% increase in coverage in 2017.

727
01:08:17,310 --> 01:08:27,209
Okay. So after they established that they did, the intervention did have an effect on the participants getting health insurance coverage.

728
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:31,860
What they want to do is see if intervention had any effect on mortality rates.

729
01:08:32,430 --> 01:08:34,499
So what they did,

730
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:41,520
what first was restricting most of the analysis in the section to individuals who are previously uninsured and between the ages of 45 and 64.

731
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:51,690
And if you look at panel A, between the bottom treatment line and the top control line at the time of this at the start of this intervention,

732
01:08:51,690 --> 01:08:56,120
you can see there's a direct sever between the two lines and results in it.

733
01:08:56,130 --> 01:09:03,870
By the time November 2018, there was a significant difference between the two and with a lower table showing

734
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:09,090
that right here there was reduced mortality during a two year sample period.

735
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:18,750
Now, what they wanted to figure out is, is having health insurance coverage, does that impact mortality rates at all?

736
01:09:19,260 --> 01:09:23,610
And in the empirical framework of this was they wanted to identify the average causal response.

737
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:34,620
And then that's assuming that it was monotonic or for the treatment did the treatment did have more coverage than the contract.

738
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:42,870
And I use these two formulas to figure out that that the average causal response or per unit annual average

739
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:50,280
effect does correspond to the per month effect of coverage that individuals enrolled in because of the pilot.

740
01:09:50,910 --> 01:09:57,360
So it did have some effect. And the results of this was each additional month of coverage is associated with

741
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,200
a small but statistically significant reduction in the probability of dying.

742
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:08,249
So this is a pretty impactful statement using this iris pilot intervention,

743
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:12,660
they were able to do do something that other studies haven't been able to do for years.

744
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:17,790
They were able to identify that if you do have health insurance coverage,

745
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:24,510
it will impact your chances of dying sooner and it does help help the population overall.

746
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:29,880
So it's a pretty significant thing. All right.

747
01:10:30,030 --> 01:10:33,660
And I just wanted to provide some concluding remarks from Article two.

748
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,100
So some results that we wanted to highlight after the two year study was conducted.

749
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:45,000
They found that there were positive effects on intervention, drug coverage, enrollment decisions amongst uninsured taxpayers.

750
01:10:45,270 --> 01:10:51,690
And this and they also found that and reduced mortality amongst middle aged young adults.

751
01:10:51,990 --> 01:11:01,110
Now, what makes this study so important is that others have attempted to try to try to reach this conclusion, but unfortunately unsuccessful.

752
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:06,780
But this was the first experimental evidence that proved that health insurance reduces mortality.

753
01:11:07,200 --> 01:11:14,009
And the results from this speak to the importance of speak to the importance of policy

754
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:18,420
questions surrounding outreach strategies to increase health insurance coverage.

755
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:25,710
Two concepts that we learned about in class that was also mentioned in this article was expansive adverse selection.

756
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:37,530
So, for example, in regards to anti people, one can predict that people who would forgo health insurance are those who benefit the least from it.

757
01:11:37,530 --> 01:11:44,249
And thus this results suggest that the behavioral frictions shape how tax incentives

758
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:49,320
interact with adverse selection and health and health insurance markets.

759
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:56,250
So therefore, reducing adverse selection, yield, substantial health benefits and addition in the long term.

760
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:01,200
The study was conducted in the span of two years. So in the long term,

761
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:09,569
they the additional additional years of data would shed light on the more on longer term survival prospects

762
01:12:09,570 --> 01:12:17,640
for those whose coverage was extended because of whose insurance was extended because of the new coverage.

763
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:26,250
Okay. So we have one final discussion question for you guys after you already heard all that information.

764
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:33,579
So have you personally experienced how insurance coverage can improve health outcomes or even on the other side of our personal experience,

765
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:37,560
how the lack of insurance coverage has worsened things?

766
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:44,080
Yeah, I do have insurance my whole life and I got a job. They gave me insurance.

767
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:51,520
I started going to the doctor and getting things taken care of that I didn't have taken care of for a while and now uninsured.

768
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:58,479
But like I say, like in private dental practices,

769
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:03,430
you have a lot of people that will come in and they either be out of pocket or accept their insurances.

770
01:13:03,730 --> 01:13:09,430
And sometimes it just sucks because some people really need like pressing procedures and they just can't afford it.

771
01:13:10,270 --> 01:13:19,800
And the only thing we can do is like try and talk to like maybe specialists that might be nearby that may be able to do something for them or yeah,

772
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:22,960
just like after 4 hours. It's just difficult.

773
01:13:24,120 --> 01:13:30,389
I guess both from a provider standpoint to take on a big loss on procedures like that.

774
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:35,670
But then there's also people who want to help. So an ethical thing to do, help them.

775
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:42,459
Yeah. I've seen like positive outcomes from having insurance.

776
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:50,080
Like one of my medications is like retail value for like 20 $500 per dose every couple of months.

777
01:13:50,620 --> 01:13:54,000
And I, with insurance only pay like 30 bucks, so.

778
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:02,500
You seem to have had like medications with over the counter close to the body.

779
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:11,560
When I didn't have 100% coverage, I had to be trying to have it just easy to take the medication because I mean,

780
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:19,599
it has no effect on me in the long term at this. But then being $300 out of pocket from your coverage is really expensive.

781
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:23,350
And then when I got 100% coverage, that became more with started medication.

782
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:29,880
So having even the level of coverage really affects it, you know how much it gains.

783
01:14:32,270 --> 01:14:34,960
I'm kind of going off of kind of everyone else's side.

784
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:41,650
Me personally, I know the less I have to pay with my insurance, that's more of an incentive for me to actually go to doctor's appointments.

785
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:50,170
And then I also worked at a physical therapy clinic, and I saw with some patients insurances that sometimes they just had such a high deductible

786
01:14:50,170 --> 01:14:54,460
or such a high co-insurance due to some plans that just weren't as good as others.

787
01:14:54,730 --> 01:14:58,570
And it kind of deteriorated them from actually coming in and getting physical therapy,

788
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:02,860
which is something that was needed, some of these people that were post-op and stuff like that.

789
01:15:02,860 --> 01:15:06,130
So I've definitely seen the advantages and disadvantages for both.

790
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:46,380
Great. Thank you. They get five free minutes as I go to school and I'm really familiar with it because I actually got to

791
01:15:46,420 --> 01:16:17,200
see you guys watch right after you get married and you learn how to do it right around the corner.

792
01:16:19,780 --> 01:16:23,350
So you'll be right next door. Yeah.

793
01:16:24,070 --> 01:16:53,430
I mean, anybody who took an extra step to the West, it's hard to get used to the fact that, you know what we're doing everywhere.

794
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:08,620
And now, like you said, it was just like every other.

795
01:17:08,620 --> 01:17:19,630
It's all the issues that I would like to do.

796
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:41,410
So, by the way, you know, I think if you have to do it, you know, like I'm just trying to hit a personal,

797
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:48,969
like just yes, I'm so I'm going to send this to you as soon as I find my coffee online.

798
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:52,100
I mean, I knew what it was like.

799
01:17:53,130 --> 01:18:03,420
I know. And I'd say I'm so I made a small step right now over 25 or so years.

800
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:17,800
But like, that's what I do that I can just kind of all tap on what he's walking out for, but I won't be able to get out.

801
01:18:17,860 --> 01:18:21,370
But I just take some of the guys who organized, do I?

802
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:27,790
So this is kind of tough. Yeah, I know it's super hard, but it's not, like, crazy.

803
01:18:28,900 --> 01:18:38,230
It's got to see you do. I don't write an acoustic, I assume, but I mean, I'm like, Yeah, it's got a weird chord.

804
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,640
It's a minor seven. This is what I used to of minor said different things.

805
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:45,640
So do you have a friend who does not?

806
01:18:46,250 --> 01:18:53,200
And then he switched off the first quarter and look at the issues and it just gets deeper.

807
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:56,589
I can't remember which is or what I don't.

808
01:18:56,590 --> 01:19:03,940
It sounds like it's only offered in the winter that you guys do it now I'm taking this first class

809
01:19:03,940 --> 01:19:13,520
is not like a super strictly for this advice so I feel like some classes I feel dizzy know I just I

810
01:19:14,140 --> 01:19:23,020
guess I'll classes because of the job by my nature like yeah I was going to respond I'm done me after

811
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:29,580
I had some yeah I have another one I'd like try to get more done if I can do that for a while.

812
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:39,040
So I'm not trying to do it all into one or you like I don't mind you know that you add called side of everybody that makes them copy them out.

813
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:43,610
Yeah. So there's nothing that I can just the first morning that's how.

814
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:48,490
Yeah. Sometimes it just, it's like if I take that to credit to me.

815
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:54,370
No I just like and I just feel this humanity not a lot of good, good.

816
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:58,744
Just go to the gym is good for you. Gain control your house.
