1
00:00:01,326 --> 00:00:04,086
Sarah Zelner: alright.

2
00:00:04,086 --> 00:00:08,046
Sarah Zelner: Great thanks for adjusting your names.

3
00:00:08,046 --> 00:00:17,376
Sarah Zelner: So what we're going to do today is just we've got three goals for this session, one is just to share our motivation and the goals for the core.

4
00:00:17,376 --> 00:00:24,546
Sarah Zelner: revision, I have a chance to share some of the data that we've collected that we've used.

5
00:00:24,546 --> 00:00:35,736
Sarah Zelner: To develop the goals for the core will talk about the role of the Faculty advisory committee what we envision the work that will be doing together will be like.

6
00:00:35,736 --> 00:00:49,326
Sarah Zelner: And then we'll also have some time to gather your feedback your questions and your ideas about what we what we can do together as part of this committee.

7
00:00:49,326 --> 00:00:53,526
Sarah Zelner: So I want to start.

8
00:00:53,526 --> 00:01:00,306
Sarah Zelner: Just with some guiding principles that we're using for talking about this core revision.

9
00:01:00,306 --> 00:01:14,676
Sarah Zelner: There really isn't a one size fits all formulaic approach to curriculum development and trust me when I say that I really wish that there was, I wish, there was a handbook that I could go to and and get the step by step instructions.

10
00:01:14,676 --> 00:01:23,406
Sarah Zelner: But but there's not and, fortunately, we have a lot of faculty with expertise, who can help us.

11
00:01:23,406 --> 00:01:31,836
Sarah Zelner: join in this highly collaborative and iterative effort to to redesign the mph core.

12
00:01:31,836 --> 00:01:41,046
Sarah Zelner: curriculum so part of our aim, then, is to recognize and include the diversity of perspectives.

13
00:01:41,046 --> 00:01:47,556
Sarah Zelner: Not just represented on our faculty advisory committee, but in the school as as a whole.

14
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:59,316
Sarah Zelner: So we have a variety of different stakeholders, we have a variety of different experiences and opinions and an important part of this process is going to be recognizing and including all of those perspectives.

15
00:01:59,316 --> 00:02:21,456
Sarah Zelner: As a result of that diversity of perspectives, it will be complex and we are aiming to embrace that come that complexity and then as a team we're hoping to you know practice is self reflection and looking for this common ground as we try to move forward with with the core revision.

16
00:02:21,456 --> 00:02:44,766
Sarah Zelner: um I think a big question that people initially have about this effort to reimagine or revise the mph core curriculum, is why are we doing this now what's our motivation, and so I think many of you were part of the initial transformation of the mph corps and I think it was 2017 or 2018.

17
00:02:44,766 --> 00:02:53,316
Sarah Zelner: And this revision took us part of the way toward our final goal of transforming the core.

18
00:02:53,316 --> 00:03:03,366
Sarah Zelner: But, as a result of data that we've been collecting over the last couple of years, we see some additional ways that we can develop on the improvements that we already made.

19
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:22,896
Sarah Zelner: In this initial part of the revision and so to talk about some of the feedback that we've been collecting and I have to say I think coven kind of you know, as it, as it has been wanting to do drove a bomb under the some of these efforts and made them in more piecemeal.

20
00:03:22,896 --> 00:03:32,646
Sarah Zelner: But since winter of 2020 we've been collecting some feedback we've done our students focus groups on the mph core curriculum.

21
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:40,956
Sarah Zelner: we've looked at student course evaluations and student students have had individual meetings with Sharon we've collected.

22
00:03:40,956 --> 00:03:49,866
Sarah Zelner: feedback from faculty and from the deans about the curriculum we've received evaluation feedback from CIF.

23
00:03:49,866 --> 00:03:59,526
Sarah Zelner: And we are in the process, I know all of you, in your in your individual departments are also doing this of collecting alumni feedback as well.

24
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:23,106
Sarah Zelner: And so, Sharon is you know feels that we are able to, and there is a strong need to showcase more of sth his mission in our core curriculum to showcase our commitment to innovation to equity and inclusion and to creating a strong impact on on the field of public health.

25
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:30,066
Sarah Zelner: So, before I get into talking about what the data have shown us.

26
00:04:30,066 --> 00:05:08,646
Sarah Zelner: In terms of this initial evaluation phase, I want to open it up to hear your voices and opinions about what you think the purpose of a core curriculum is in our mph program and then, what are the challenges of creating a core curriculum so i'm going to share a link in our chat.

27
00:05:08,646 --> 00:05:14,706
Sarah Zelner: And then ask you to share your ideas again about the purpose of the core curriculum and an mph Program.

28
00:05:14,706 --> 00:05:34,056
Sarah Zelner: And then what are some challenges, you could think about challenges from the perspective of students and from the perspective of faculty and then go ahead and upload any i'm sorry upload upload any comments you have from your colleagues that you find to be new or particularly insightful.

29
00:05:34,056 --> 00:07:04,296
Sarah Zelner: will just take a couple of minutes to do that.

30
00:07:04,296 --> 00:07:07,746
Sarah Zelner: Some great responses here.

31
00:07:07,746 --> 00:07:21,966
Sarah Zelner: So, in terms of the purpose, providing a foundation preparing students to operate as public health professionals.

32
00:07:21,966 --> 00:07:25,686
Sarah Zelner: And then, some of the.

33
00:07:25,686 --> 00:07:37,236
Sarah Zelner: rights and then thinking about what we mean by foundation so measurement collection of data analysis foundational skills.

34
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:52,266
Sarah Zelner: And then, in terms of southern some of the challenges of creating a core getting all the competencies in and leaving space for departmental courses and electives it has definitely been a challenge.

35
00:07:52,266 --> 00:08:03,456
Sarah Zelner: and creating a kind of connected experience right like an integrated integrated core experience across these courses I think it's been a challenge as well.

36
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:10,776
Sarah Zelner: You have this idea of being in sync.

37
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:24,876
Sarah Zelner: Yes, for faculty teaching courses that are their students are obligated to take these required courses sometimes without you know explicit knowledge that they were not thinking that they would have to take a core course like this.

38
00:08:24,876 --> 00:08:33,276
Sarah Zelner: and engaging students with many different interests in a common experience.

39
00:08:33,276 --> 00:08:55,056
Sarah Zelner: Does anyone want to elaborate on any thing that's been posted on here or share deeper insight than what you can fit on a sticky note.

40
00:08:55,056 --> 00:09:03,816
K Rivet Amico (she/her) HBHE: So it's it's really a I mean, aside from just saying that it seems like we are sticky notes are very similar in terms of.

41
00:09:03,816 --> 00:09:17,046
K Rivet Amico (she/her) HBHE: Not just the the purpose, but the the real challenge of creating a harmonious kind of experience that's something that students will feel like they're getting something valuable from.

42
00:09:17,046 --> 00:09:19,536
Sarah Zelner: yeah I think there are a lot of similarities.

43
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:37,326
Sarah Zelner: across these sticky notes um something that I think about as well, which I think is embedded in some of these responses, is the challenge of teaching very large courses where students are coming into classes with different levels of preparation someone sort of.

44
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:40,806
Sarah Zelner: noted different interests.

45
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:52,446
Sarah Zelner: And that can be a real challenge as an instructor figuring out how to how to meet all of those needs and create an engaging context.

46
00:09:52,446 --> 00:09:59,856
Sarah Zelner: it's going to take one more look here.

47
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:14,886
Sarah Zelner: yeah so i'm seeing a nod in the purpose is I like this idea of not just you know foundational skills, but skills didn't engage in complex, multi sector approaches to solving public health problems right, that is.

48
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:24,666
Sarah Zelner: Fundamental to public health problems is their complexity for sure.

49
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:29,196
Sarah Zelner: Okay, if there are no further thoughts.

50
00:10:29,196 --> 00:10:36,576
Sarah Zelner: it's great to see some of your perspectives here, and I think, as I share some of the student perspectives and.

51
00:10:36,576 --> 00:10:48,966
Sarah Zelner: More of the goals, hopefully you'll see some alignment in what you've put here and what we're seeing elsewhere as well.

52
00:10:48,966 --> 00:11:14,166
Sarah Zelner: So just to reiterate, I think all of all of you have suggested, this is that this core curriculum for mph students is designed to provide a shared foundation for all students, we know from our student focus groups that students love to come to Michigan to learn from faculty experts.

53
00:11:14,166 --> 00:11:21,846
Sarah Zelner: But that they all also need this shared foundation that prepares them for the field of public health.

54
00:11:21,846 --> 00:11:28,866
Sarah Zelner: So what we mean by that, in terms of what what kind of foundation, it can provide you can define what public health is.

55
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:38,166
Sarah Zelner: And what it is the public health, researchers and practitioners do that it defines major challenges in the field, lays out.

56
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:46,596
Sarah Zelner: various perspectives on how to address these challenges, it ensures that students from all backgrounds and all departments.

57
00:11:46,596 --> 00:11:54,096
Sarah Zelner: And all experiences are receiving the same exposure training and assessment on a set of common material.

58
00:11:54,096 --> 00:12:12,486
Sarah Zelner: And that it's addressing these competencies right that Steve has given us that provides students with specific skills, knowledge and attitudes that that they have found to be needed to solve the world's greatest public health challenges.

59
00:12:12,486 --> 00:12:19,146
Sarah Zelner: challenges inherent in teaching a common core right we talked about some of these as they're noted on the board here.

60
00:12:19,146 --> 00:12:24,126
Sarah Zelner: Students come in with different levels of preparedness they come in with different levels of.

61
00:12:24,126 --> 00:12:40,116
Sarah Zelner: Exposure to public health, material and they come in with different levels of experience right, some of them are coming in with work experience some of them are coming in with a BA in public health when you put them in these common core classes, it can be very challenging.

62
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:43,176
Sarah Zelner: to teach to design courses.

63
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:57,756
Sarah Zelner: Especially at I think the graduate school level students, also have a diverse diverse interests and goals for their careers, which means developing student centered courses around their interests and goals is challenging.

64
00:12:57,756 --> 00:13:08,946
Sarah Zelner: Students also have as many of faculty have shared with us that students tell them they have an interest in developing a disciplinary expertise right they're not necessarily committed to a general.

65
00:13:08,946 --> 00:13:15,546
Sarah Zelner: Public Health degree, but they like the idea of becoming an expert in the specific discipline.

66
00:13:15,546 --> 00:13:24,096
Sarah Zelner: And we also know from our student focus groups that there's this desire for mentorship right that kind of closeness that you associate with graduate school training.

67
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:32,406
Sarah Zelner: That you, you might not with an undergraduate degree, we also know that teaching these core courses or.

68
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:44,376
Sarah Zelner: include a lot of demands on our teaching faculty so as we talked about where do you aim and, of course, when you have students with such diverse levels of preparedness and experience.

69
00:13:44,376 --> 00:14:00,936
Sarah Zelner: On where do you in the content in a course like that, how do you create engaging and authentic content, when you have 200 maybe 200 students in your class and how do you create equitable assessments and that sense of community.

70
00:14:00,936 --> 00:14:12,486
Sarah Zelner: That that we know is so vital to activating student learning and then I think the big headache for faculty often to is the overall logistics for teaching a core course.

71
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:23,496
Sarah Zelner: And you know everything from course designed to managing ongoing issues in the Semester and then grading as well, so there's some big.

72
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:39,696
Sarah Zelner: reasons why we have a common core and there's some big challenges that are also part of this core, I want to pause here and see if anyone has any questions or comments that they would like to add.

73
00:14:39,696 --> 00:14:55,146
Sarah Zelner: And i'm happy also to as long as my technological skills allowed to to work on them in the chat here if there's anything else you'd like to add.

74
00:14:55,146 --> 00:15:01,116
Okay.

75
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:10,686
Sarah Zelner: So I want to get into some of the data and share a little bit of common themes that we saw in our student focus groups.

76
00:15:10,686 --> 00:15:19,326
Sarah Zelner: which were from what I want to make the caveat there from winter so pre code that I think they were in February of 2020.

77
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:39,756
Sarah Zelner: So you know, given the changes the shifts that we made on the in our how we delivered material there may be some differences here but students one theme that we saw clearly was students wanted greater depth in their core courses and they wanted to see fewer credits.

78
00:15:39,756 --> 00:15:43,326
Sarah Zelner: So here a couple of quotes.

79
00:15:43,326 --> 00:15:56,466
Sarah Zelner: To this end, we had students say Michigan isn't really setting me up to be able to get a job afterwards, because I don't have the time or flexibility to do stuff outside of class that would further me professionally.

80
00:15:56,466 --> 00:16:08,346
Sarah Zelner: there's a perception of there are these competencies, we know there's important they the competencies are important but nobody's actually keeping track of whether the classes are hitting the competencies.

81
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:16,686
Sarah Zelner: The students said, I think, overall, for me, the theme among the public health core classes, has been let's throw mud at the wall and see what sticks.

82
00:16:16,686 --> 00:16:27,306
Sarah Zelner: And so it's a lot of busy work and it's very surface level, but we don't actually get into understanding things and because there's so much to cover, we have to zip through all of these topics.

83
00:16:27,306 --> 00:16:34,086
Sarah Zelner: And then finally we've heard a lot about the number of credits that are required for our core courses.

84
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:49,146
Sarah Zelner: Students says, there are some semesters where, if you want to take an elective you have to take 18 or 19 credits, so I know, several students who consistently take over 16 credits semester we want to learn, but sometimes, this is just not realistic.

85
00:16:49,146 --> 00:17:03,756
Sarah Zelner: And so we know that students have this interest in elective courses within their departments, and we know that the core as it is now it's crowding out their ability to to take those elective credits.

86
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:15,696
Sarah Zelner: We also saw from our focus groups that student want students want more engaging opportunities to develop these skills that are important to them for for their professional goals.

87
00:17:15,696 --> 00:17:34,536
Sarah Zelner: So they said, if there are less assignments, but they were really structured to engage us, then I might be learning more, rather than just taking quizzes we should be focusing more on things that are directly relevant to what we're going to do post graduation.

88
00:17:34,536 --> 00:17:47,976
Sarah Zelner: i'm not toward these skills, I don't feel like i'm getting the tools to be able to analyze techniques instead i'm just googling things for homework.

89
00:17:47,976 --> 00:18:00,186
Sarah Zelner: Okay, so i'm seeing a comment in the chat I think we're making making classes large is our choice we could get multiple sections with CAP numbers of students, which will increase the number of courses and instructors.

90
00:18:00,186 --> 00:18:13,356
Sarah Zelner: I think there are ways around this idea of there being very large courses, and that is indeed one of them, and that should be part of our conversation about the core for sure.

91
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:22,326
Sarah Zelner: And then there was sentiment of you know I just feel like I don't learn very well from lectures right, and this is something we know from the pedagogical research that.

92
00:18:22,326 --> 00:18:30,546
Sarah Zelner: And you all know, as teachers that students learn better when they're these forms of what we call active learning when students are actively engaged.

93
00:18:30,546 --> 00:18:45,276
Sarah Zelner: So they said the students said, and so, for me specifically having the opportunity to work through something, how do you apply it, how you apply what we're talking about in theory that is extremely valuable.

94
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:57,426
Sarah Zelner: We also saw that you know, despite these challenges and the challenges that are inherent in the core that students did see a value to doing the kind of interdisciplinary work that comes out.

95
00:18:57,426 --> 00:19:07,116
Sarah Zelner: In our core classes, so they say I like the opportunity to actually engage with different fact faculty of different disciplines.

96
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:22,206
Sarah Zelner: And there's appetite for this interdisciplinary work, you know, I think, with the caveat that they're looking to see it strengthened in some capacity.

97
00:19:22,206 --> 00:19:34,206
Sarah Zelner: it's valuable to understand how particular mph discipline and our own discipline interacts with other fields of public health, having a core curriculum kind of does make us think about how we interact.

98
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:43,776
Sarah Zelner: With with other fields, so these are some of the main themes that we saw from from the focus groups with some.

99
00:19:43,776 --> 00:19:48,816
Sarah Zelner: Isolated quotes to help you give it some some shape.

100
00:19:48,816 --> 00:19:54,096
Sarah Zelner: Any questions about the focus groups or any comments about.

101
00:19:54,096 --> 00:20:00,486
Sarah Zelner: What students have said.

102
00:20:00,486 --> 00:20:12,066
K Rivet Amico (she/her) HBHE: yeah I do and I apologize for my dog so it's repay and one of the things sorry, one of the things I was wondering actually was.

103
00:20:12,066 --> 00:20:19,326
K Rivet Amico (she/her) HBHE: Just in terms of about how many students were met with and how was that distributed across departments.

104
00:20:19,326 --> 00:20:25,806
Sarah Zelner: So this was prior to my arrival, but I okay focus groups were.

105
00:20:25,806 --> 00:20:32,946
Sarah Zelner: held by department, so I believe it was each you know mph students from each department separately, I don't know the exact.

106
00:20:32,946 --> 00:20:36,336
Sarah Zelner: number of students in each.

107
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:37,776
Sarah Zelner: In each focus group.

108
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:51,006
K Rivet Amico (she/her) HBHE: Okay Okay, but, but the sense was like the overall themes really were represented across the different departments, I mean because, obviously, people are going to be graduating and doing very different things, in some cases, depending on what department.

109
00:20:51,006 --> 00:20:51,606
Sarah Zelner: Yes.

110
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:55,296
K Rivet Amico (she/her) HBHE: they're in so it just curious about whether or not.

111
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,856
K Rivet Amico (she/her) HBHE: But I know I saw that Thank you.

112
00:20:56,856 --> 00:21:09,786
Sarah Zelner: yeah no I think that's a good point I think the questions for the focus group group were really focused on the core classes right and their experience in those in those core classes.

113
00:21:09,786 --> 00:21:11,046
Sarah Zelner: So um.

114
00:21:11,046 --> 00:21:22,416
Sarah Zelner: There were also efforts to speak with faculty we received obviously feedback from CIF as well, and we actually found that there's a fair amount of alignment.

115
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:36,126
Sarah Zelner: between our faculty CIF and some of the student feedback so just underscoring some of the themes that we saw from the student perspective and there's.

116
00:21:36,126 --> 00:21:45,726
Sarah Zelner: A perception of redundancy across courses that students are being taught and tested on material multiple times.

117
00:21:45,726 --> 00:21:55,596
Sarah Zelner: And I will say, the other side of this is a faculty not being able to hold students accountable for something that they've learned in a in a prior course.

118
00:21:55,596 --> 00:22:03,306
Sarah Zelner: Because they're being rethought, the material or we're not quite sure what's being taught in what what class.

119
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:12,546
Sarah Zelner: So this actually speaks to something that we saw on the board here, which is creating this kind of in sync connected experience we also saw.

120
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:20,196
Sarah Zelner: heard a lot from faculty as well about sequencing challenges so students are on have a lot of requirements.

121
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:28,296
Sarah Zelner: They have a lot of demands on their time and they're taking the core at different different core courses at different points in their mph.

122
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:50,526
Sarah Zelner: Experience so, for example, students, taking a core course in their final Semester and being introduced to him, you know this foundational knowledge right as they're exiting I think that process that fact is frustrating, both for faculty and and for for students so.

123
00:22:50,526 --> 00:22:57,156
Sarah Zelner: And that speaks to the idea of there being the core occupying too many credits right that.

124
00:22:57,156 --> 00:23:06,156
Sarah Zelner: We know from from faculty speaking with students that students are interested heavily interested in these elective courses and that.

125
00:23:06,156 --> 00:23:22,476
Sarah Zelner: The number of credits in the chorus is crowding out their ability to to pursue those electives we also heard again about this need to increase the relevance of the core courses to student goals and part of that is really.

126
00:23:22,476 --> 00:23:25,896
Sarah Zelner: unpacking what our students schools.

127
00:23:25,896 --> 00:23:37,146
Sarah Zelner: professionally and how we can create courses that help them better meet those goals and, as we said before there's challenges related to to teaching these large.

128
00:23:37,146 --> 00:23:50,766
Sarah Zelner: classes at the graduate school level and then challenges of meeting our competencies and, as you know, if you spent a lot of time with these competencies, some of them are are multi pronged.

129
00:23:50,766 --> 00:23:59,046
Sarah Zelner: And contains so much and could really one competency could be entirely you know in one class entirely.

130
00:23:59,046 --> 00:24:08,916
Sarah Zelner: And, and so some of this feedback is forcing us to really think more about how we have clustered competencies together in particular courses.

131
00:24:08,916 --> 00:24:38,466
Sarah Zelner: and doing that work of unpacking the competency, to see what, what are the skills that we are trying to teach people what skills are embedded in these particular competencies, so I want to pause here and see if anyone has any comments about about faculty and see feedback.

132
00:24:38,466 --> 00:24:40,596
Sarah Zelner: Okay.

133
00:24:40,596 --> 00:24:47,556
Sarah Zelner: So, before I move on, I just want to give you a sense of where we are.

134
00:24:47,556 --> 00:24:59,046
Sarah Zelner: In our in our timeline for for this project because there really are multiple phases, to the project, and I want to make sure that we have a sense of where we are right now.

135
00:24:59,046 --> 00:25:09,216
Sarah Zelner: And so we're moving from you know, taking stock of the current core and phase one into phase two where we're thinking about redesigning.

136
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:22,446
Sarah Zelner: The new core and in terms of what happened in this phase two I think our team has ideas, based on the goals that we've developed, based on the feedback that we've received but part of our.

137
00:25:22,446 --> 00:25:31,716
Sarah Zelner: effort in having a faculty Advisory Committee and having a student Advisory Committee is really to involve our stakeholders in this design.

138
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:53,856
Sarah Zelner: In this design process and so that is part of what we will do on this committee and then moving into our subsequent phases, hoping to roll out the new core in our fall of 2023 so right now we're kind of at the tail end of phase one into interface to here.

139
00:25:53,856 --> 00:26:05,586
Sarah Zelner: So with all this feedback that we've received, we came up with four goals for reimagine the core and i'm going to go through each of them separately.

140
00:26:05,586 --> 00:26:16,146
Sarah Zelner: But I think one that stands out is creating better alignment between the core courses right creating this synergy creek getting core courses that are in sync.

141
00:26:16,146 --> 00:26:26,586
Sarah Zelner: With with one another, is it is a critical goal and alongside that goal is decreasing the credit load right so that students can focus on.

142
00:26:26,586 --> 00:26:40,056
Sarah Zelner: Their discipline specific courses which we know are motivating to them and their there's also a goal of centering our core courses around real world.

143
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:51,306
Sarah Zelner: Public health problems, so that we are adequately preparing students for their professional goals of working as as public health professionals.

144
00:26:51,306 --> 00:27:01,206
Sarah Zelner: and designing courses that are student centered right that that start with the goals of students that are anti racist that are equitable and that are.

145
00:27:01,206 --> 00:27:12,396
Sarah Zelner: That are engaging and, of course, that goal is a goal that we all share for our courses, regardless of whether they're part of the core or not.

146
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:22,206
Sarah Zelner: So I want to talk about how we would get kind of just frameworks for thinking about how we're getting toward each of these goals.

147
00:27:22,206 --> 00:27:30,576
Sarah Zelner: So to design student centered courses that are anti racist that are equitable we're looking to.

148
00:27:30,576 --> 00:27:39,726
Sarah Zelner: Think about this idea of student centered course design, so a student centered course design is the one that begins with.

149
00:27:39,726 --> 00:27:48,846
Sarah Zelner: This question of what will students, be able to do by the end of the course taking that goal, and moving into learning objectives.

150
00:27:48,846 --> 00:27:55,326
Sarah Zelner: Thinking about how will assess those learning objectives, how are we going to ensure that students practice.

151
00:27:55,326 --> 00:28:05,586
Sarah Zelner: And what we want to assess them on and what is it that we need to provide them in terms of content, in terms of instructional materials.

152
00:28:05,586 --> 00:28:16,896
Sarah Zelner: In order for them to be successful, so I didn't include this diagram but many times we start with the flip to version of.

153
00:28:16,896 --> 00:28:24,366
Sarah Zelner: This design process where we start, which is sometimes called a teacher centered course design, which was we start with what do we know.

154
00:28:24,366 --> 00:28:37,176
Sarah Zelner: What is our sense of expertise, what do we know about what's important in in the field, and then we move the opposite direction of this so you might have heard this called backwards course design is another.

155
00:28:37,176 --> 00:28:46,896
Sarah Zelner: way of talking about this, but designing courses in this professional school context of promoting the the goals.

156
00:28:46,896 --> 00:28:58,716
Sarah Zelner: of students and and thinking carefully about what skills they need to to get to those goals and when we talk about this student centered course design.

157
00:28:58,716 --> 00:29:15,936
Sarah Zelner: We are really hoping, not to think about our core courses as individual courses, but as a as a collective core right then we're creating a curriculum in its entirety, that is, student centered.

158
00:29:15,936 --> 00:29:29,946
Sarah Zelner: So we sort of talked about teacher centered design, we talked about a student centered design, but the elephant in the room is always the competencies right competency based education is another approach to.

159
00:29:29,946 --> 00:29:43,746
Sarah Zelner: Designing courses and thinking about our competencies is going to be an important part of getting this more coherent core curriculum and about decreasing our.

160
00:29:43,746 --> 00:29:50,856
Sarah Zelner: Our our credit load, and so I think there are ways in which the competency based education can feel like a third.

161
00:29:50,856 --> 00:29:59,436
Sarah Zelner: Having these foundational competencies can feel like a third wheel right that we have what we know we have what students goals are, and then we have to attack on these.

162
00:29:59,436 --> 00:30:10,776
Sarah Zelner: foundational competencies on on top of it, but the history of competency based education is actually one that is is student centered right is really committed.

163
00:30:10,776 --> 00:30:19,026
Sarah Zelner: To beginning with this question, if you look at the diagram here, beginning with this question are what are, what are the real world public health problems right now.

164
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:25,206
Sarah Zelner: and using those and using those problems and figuring out what skills, we need to solve them.

165
00:30:25,206 --> 00:30:38,976
Sarah Zelner: to derive our foundational competencies and using these think about our course objectives and then how we're going to build out skills for these students, so that they can then solve these real world.

166
00:30:38,976 --> 00:30:42,096
Sarah Zelner: Public health problems.

167
00:30:42,096 --> 00:30:55,686
Sarah Zelner: And again, when we talk about competency education we're looking for a sense of mastery for that student we're looking for the sense that students are walking out of their core classes and the core curriculum with a sense that.

168
00:30:55,686 --> 00:31:06,126
Sarah Zelner: They have mastered each individual objectives for each class but also they have a kind of horizontal mastery as well as sense of.

169
00:31:06,126 --> 00:31:28,356
Sarah Zelner: confidence and mastery that connects these core courses together so an important part of creating this alignment and decreasing the core credit is really going to be returning to these competencies looking at how they're attached to our core courses and unpacking.

170
00:31:28,356 --> 00:31:38,466
Sarah Zelner: What everything that's embedded in them just going to pause in the chat here.

171
00:31:38,466 --> 00:31:57,426
Sarah Zelner: Okay, so so Sarah is asking in this student centered course design who decides what the students should be able to do at the end is that student or faculty driven so i'm going to go back to this diagram.

172
00:31:57,426 --> 00:32:06,996
Sarah Zelner: I think the idea behind this is that you if we are also marrying this with our competency based approach.

173
00:32:06,996 --> 00:32:17,346
Sarah Zelner: Is that the competencies on the students themselves, their own professional goals are helping us to derive a learning goal for a course.

174
00:32:17,346 --> 00:32:25,626
Sarah Zelner: And sometimes those learning goals for the competencies and from the student perspective align with what might be a teacher centered design.

175
00:32:25,626 --> 00:32:35,166
Sarah Zelner: Which is what you think as of as an expert in the field is the most important thing that they take out of, for example, this you know introduction to.

176
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:50,076
Sarah Zelner: epidemiology, but we might find if we are centering the student perspective if we are centering competencies and professional goals, how we articulate what the goals are might be different so.

177
00:32:50,076 --> 00:33:09,756
Sarah Zelner: In terms of content and course design the to the to design perspective might lead to something to something different, but it also can be reflected in how we present this information to students, so you might find that a student centered course design is one you know where.

178
00:33:09,756 --> 00:33:26,136
Sarah Zelner: you're bringing out those things that you want students to be able to say they can do by the end of course not what's most important in in the field of epidemiology at large, so I think that it's complex in the sense that we are also.

179
00:33:26,136 --> 00:33:35,226
Sarah Zelner: Looking to these competencies but that's why I like to remind that the competencies are also actually student centered they don't feel like it, because they come from this.

180
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:45,816
Sarah Zelner: You know this third arm of CIF, but they are also designed to help students prepare students for these professional goals.

181
00:33:45,816 --> 00:34:06,336
Sarah Zelner: Okay, so David do all these do all students really need a three credit level of depth for all the foundational competencies, I think that is a question that will have to be considered as as part of the conversation about how to meet the competencies and how to design.

182
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:11,046
Sarah Zelner: Courses around those competencies.

183
00:34:11,046 --> 00:34:17,046
Sarah Zelner: I don't have a simple answer to that, but I think that is part of the conversation is how do we reduce.

184
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:34,416
Sarah Zelner: The number of credits, without compromising content, how do we reduce the number of credits, but still meet our goal of creating students who can have a strong impact on the field of of public health it's a great question.

185
00:34:34,416 --> 00:34:55,026
Sarah Zelner: And what defines the student perspective, how do we work with students with different goals and wouldn't that change year to year, yes, I think that it does in some sense change year to year, and that is part of the mission of a competency based education is that your your.

186
00:34:55,026 --> 00:35:05,166
Sarah Zelner: Is that it is a an approach to curriculum that is under constant revision, because it is student centered because it's centered on these professional goals.

187
00:35:05,166 --> 00:35:24,756
Sarah Zelner: It is an approach where it's not sage on the stage it's not what one person thinks is the most important thing in their individual field but it's constantly taking taking information in about what's happening in the professional world what our students goals.

188
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:31,806
Sarah Zelner: And I think that brings us back to what we started with on the idea board about.

189
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:44,076
Sarah Zelner: The challenges of meeting students with diverse diverse goals and really using some of our kind of outstanding sources of data right now.

190
00:35:44,076 --> 00:36:00,156
Sarah Zelner: About from alumni to figure out what what our students professional goals and do students do our alumni feel that their curriculum that we have is is preparing them to meet those those goals.

191
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:14,706
Sarah Zelner: You just pause for a second here and see if anyone else wants to add anything in the chat or comment on on things that are in the chat.

192
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:19,956
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Is what to say Sharon has entered the building.

193
00:36:19,956 --> 00:36:24,936
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So sorry to be to be late.

194
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:30,276
Sarah Zelner: You want to add anything Sharon, and I know when you entered.

195
00:36:30,276 --> 00:36:43,896
Sharon Reilly Kardia: I just want to say sort of thank all the Faculty that are here, and you know this is such an important thing for us to be doing, and we are.

196
00:36:43,896 --> 00:36:48,156
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Looking forward to your input feedback.

197
00:36:48,156 --> 00:36:52,296
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Creativity wildness.

198
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:57,246
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And I hope you'll stick with us.

199
00:36:57,246 --> 00:36:58,926
Sarah Zelner: All right, you want me to keep going.

200
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,896
Sharon Reilly Kardia: With us please nope.

201
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:20,166
Sarah Zelner: So um as Sharon was saying, and, as I mentioned before, much of what we're thinking about the core is under construction, and so we have some goals that we've identified based on the feedback that we have.

202
00:37:20,166 --> 00:37:34,416
Sarah Zelner: received I think something I didn't mention also as we've looked at other what other programs are doing for ideas about what could be useful in terms of restructuring, but it's very much.

203
00:37:34,416 --> 00:37:59,556
Sarah Zelner: we're building the airplane as as we go here, as is kind of the necessity, one of the ideas that we are considering for a revision of the core is centering a team based project for students to complete as part of their core.

204
00:37:59,556 --> 00:38:10,686
Sarah Zelner: curriculum, so this idea of a team based project, which would span across two semesters in the first year would be one piece of the scaffold for the core.

205
00:38:10,686 --> 00:38:23,646
Sarah Zelner: And this would allow us a team based project would allow us to really Center our core courses around these real world public health problems that have motivated students to to pursue their.

206
00:38:23,646 --> 00:38:33,156
Sarah Zelner: mph so a team based project would help us meet other goals that we have for revising the core as well.

207
00:38:33,156 --> 00:38:44,286
Sarah Zelner: It would help us to meet the competencies the required competencies and this is also where competency based education begins with these real world public health problems.

208
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:56,616
Sarah Zelner: would also allow us to help students reach their goals in these teams, they can think about taking on different roles that they might envision themselves, taking as public health.

209
00:38:56,616 --> 00:39:16,026
Sarah Zelner: professionals and centering this kind of team based project would also require us in our core courses to explicitly teach skills that are embedded in in these competencies that are required to solve.

210
00:39:16,026 --> 00:39:26,616
Sarah Zelner: These real world, plus pressing public health challenges, I think we know pedagogically as well we mentioned this before, in terms of active learning.

211
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:38,436
Sarah Zelner: That students are more more engaged and more motivated in there to learn when they're given some choices about about what it is that they pursue.

212
00:39:38,436 --> 00:39:54,786
Sarah Zelner: So something that we're considering as we're thinking about what a team based project might look like is giving you know, putting students into teams of four or five and being able to give them some choices about the problems that they are interested in.

213
00:39:54,786 --> 00:39:58,236
Sarah Zelner: The geographies that they're interested in and maybe.

214
00:39:58,236 --> 00:40:07,236
Sarah Zelner: Particular organizations or agencies that they might be interested in to add to simulate this experience of being a public health.

215
00:40:07,236 --> 00:40:22,146
Sarah Zelner: Professional so this could be a way to to not only Center real world public health challenges, but you know, to get students really engaged in in these core courses and to show us what they're learning.

216
00:40:22,146 --> 00:40:25,806
Sarah Zelner: In these foundational courses.

217
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:38,766
Sarah Zelner: I think one of the big things that we're thinking about as we're considering this idea of a team based project is a logistical challenges of a group based projects or of teamwork.

218
00:40:38,766 --> 00:40:53,166
Sarah Zelner: And those challenges are many, particularly in the context of a large courses and so there's a new piece of software from Ai here called tandem, I don't know if any of you has encountered it.

219
00:40:53,166 --> 00:41:18,426
Sarah Zelner: In other contexts, but it's actually won some awards and is has been used in that school of engineering and architecture and other places as well, but this is a piece of software that helps you both monitor and support team work, so it helps you form teamwork, so it helps you form teams.

220
00:41:18,426 --> 00:41:29,676
Sarah Zelner: For a class that provides students with a series of lessons about what makes effective teamwork it collects data from students on how their.

221
00:41:29,676 --> 00:41:45,066
Sarah Zelner: team is doing across a variety of dimensions over time and with that data that faculty then receive they can have more targeted interventions to troubleshoot some of the team challenges.

222
00:41:45,066 --> 00:41:56,346
Sarah Zelner: So you can see, an example of some of the kind of data that is collected from tandem here, you know the the X axis here is is over time.

223
00:41:56,346 --> 00:42:09,366
Sarah Zelner: And we see different points in the Semester this particular group is is doing really well and then at other points is you know, right at the beginning, having trouble managing logistics, etc.

224
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:26,316
Sarah Zelner: So this is one option of something that would really allow us to potentially support teams in this context, I think, for me, one of the most interesting things about the tandem tool is that you can work with.

225
00:42:26,316 --> 00:42:32,826
Sarah Zelner: tandem, to decide what lessons to provide your students it's not all.

226
00:42:32,826 --> 00:42:48,816
Sarah Zelner: Pre pre determined, but you can think about we could think about what is most important for public health professionals and build lessons around they're seeing something in the chat.

227
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:56,286
Sarah Zelner: Okay, so right so david's asking about what these be centered in the department or school right or or school.

228
00:42:56,286 --> 00:43:08,736
Sarah Zelner: wide and ensuring saying that is something that we are considering as part of the project Sharon, do you want to add anything fun.

229
00:43:08,736 --> 00:43:18,606
Sharon Reilly Kardia: No, not at this point, I mean is there when's a good stopping place so we can we because we've got only about 10 minutes left.

230
00:43:18,606 --> 00:43:24,096
Sarah Zelner: yeah so let me, let me just share the last the last slide here.

231
00:43:24,096 --> 00:43:33,936
Sarah Zelner: Which is you know, to say that, just to reiterate that the team project that we're considering is one component of how we're reimagining the core.

232
00:43:33,936 --> 00:43:46,866
Sarah Zelner: And we would like it to be the focus of this phase for the for the Advisory Committee on to help us think about how to scaffold the team projects and the questions that are being raised in the chat.

233
00:43:46,866 --> 00:44:00,366
Sarah Zelner: How competencies could be attached to the team project and thinking about what content or skills would need to be taught to to support a team project.

234
00:44:00,366 --> 00:44:11,436
Sarah Zelner: i'll stop there, and maybe we could open it up for some feedback.

235
00:44:11,436 --> 00:44:14,946
Sharon Reilly Kardia: You could pull the slides down and.

236
00:44:14,946 --> 00:44:22,326
Sharon Reilly Kardia: I can see people's face, I deeply appreciate.

237
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:33,426
Sharon Reilly Kardia: called the brains on this call, so this is one of the trickiest pieces of doing this kind of.

238
00:44:33,426 --> 00:44:50,826
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Revision of the core is that we would like something that really addresses the students desires to be working already in public health right on a on a problem of their choosing rather than our sort of well scoped.

239
00:44:50,826 --> 00:44:55,776
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Examples that they often rail against.

240
00:44:55,776 --> 00:45:05,346
Sharon Reilly Kardia: But how to do that is going to take well it's a multi variable calculus problem because departments have what they want.

241
00:45:05,346 --> 00:45:10,626
Sharon Reilly Kardia: students have what they want the instructors have the core have what they want right.

242
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:33,396
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And we are probably going to have to do, I think, a couple of revisions it's almost like throw something up see whether or not it works, what does work what needs to be refined and will, over the next several months kind of go through some iterations of this by enlarge, one of the clear.

243
00:45:33,396 --> 00:45:43,476
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Things we're trying to address with this sort of team based project is students having to apply what they're learning.

244
00:45:43,476 --> 00:45:48,966
Sharon Reilly Kardia: we've heard over and over again that kind of get through it's like I didn't really know what that course was about.

245
00:45:48,966 --> 00:45:55,746
Sharon Reilly Kardia: I learned a lot of things, but I can't use any of those I mean we've heard from a number of people, for instance.

246
00:45:55,746 --> 00:46:03,066
Sharon Reilly Kardia: That the bio stats that they're learning it's that that's great I got an A but then they don't carry it into the next course.

247
00:46:03,066 --> 00:46:22,416
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Right so we've got to get some way for them to have this sort of multiple touch points of using that actual knowledge that we're giving them so that they can say sort of with confidence Oh, I really I get this.

248
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:36,576
Sharon Reilly Kardia: I can think of about a dozen really good ways in which we could do this team based project to both reduce some of the core credits highlight what they're doing in terms of their own.

249
00:46:36,576 --> 00:46:39,426
Professional identities.

250
00:46:39,426 --> 00:46:44,376
Sharon Reilly Kardia: But it's going to have to be something that we all are kind of.

251
00:46:44,376 --> 00:46:52,626
Sharon Reilly Kardia: brainstorming and that'll probably be January, before we start to do more of that sort of in depth.

252
00:46:52,626 --> 00:47:08,106
Sarah Zelner: I want to make another plug for the team based project which I didn't mention before, which is that the pedagogical research about these kinds of projects is that it alleviates a lot of work for the instructor.

253
00:47:08,106 --> 00:47:31,236
Sarah Zelner: That it, it makes it such that you don't have to occupy the sage on the stage you're not prepping hour and a half lectures twice a week but it's a much more collaborative environment and exciting environment and that's when that has real, tangible benefits, I think, for faculty as well.

254
00:47:31,236 --> 00:47:35,706
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Well, even just the questions that are in the chat are ones that we are.

255
00:47:35,706 --> 00:47:43,626
Sharon Reilly Kardia: currently deliberating because just about everybody, we talked to have sort of like their own.

256
00:47:43,626 --> 00:47:55,386
Sharon Reilly Kardia: thoughts right So if you asked me today, I would say, where I think it might work, given our combination of needs across departments his.

257
00:47:55,386 --> 00:48:05,736
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Students are working within their department in a team and that where we get the interdisciplinary it is actually if teams have to work together.

258
00:48:05,736 --> 00:48:12,906
Sharon Reilly Kardia: In the second semester so you've got to hire an epidemiologist team you gotta hire a policy team.

259
00:48:12,906 --> 00:48:23,016
Sharon Reilly Kardia: you've got to hire an environmental health or nutrition, I mean, so we could add a gamification of this that actually is a little bit more like real world.

260
00:48:23,016 --> 00:48:35,586
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Right you kind of work in your own office or department and then you spend out to get other expertise, depending upon what you want to do.

261
00:48:35,586 --> 00:48:46,326
Sharon Reilly Kardia: And so that could be one of the ways to do it, I do think that they will this project will be integrated with the core classes.

262
00:48:46,326 --> 00:49:08,016
Sharon Reilly Kardia: This might be one of the designs that allows us to figure out how to handle some of the variety of ways in which departments want the core to be right so just about every different department has a vision of what the core should be and let's just say they're not all the same.

263
00:49:08,016 --> 00:49:21,816
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So how do we handle that kind of variability, we want a structure that will allow us to Center the students needs and for us to hook into that.

264
00:49:21,816 --> 00:49:44,226
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So, but I shouldn't say too much more because sarah's absolutely right, this this airplane right now I got a pair of wheels over here I got the landing gear over there i'm not sure it goes to the same vehicle.

265
00:49:44,226 --> 00:49:48,186
Sharon Reilly Kardia: it's 156.

266
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:57,006
Sharon Reilly Kardia: we've only got a couple of minutes there's any thing else people want to ask before we.

267
00:49:57,006 --> 00:50:08,286
Sharon Reilly Kardia: wish you a farewell for this semester, and ask you all to come back in January will send out a doodle poll, to try to get a regular time.

268
00:50:08,286 --> 00:50:20,016
Sharon Reilly Kardia: it's going to be hard, even just with this, it was pretty difficult.

269
00:50:20,016 --> 00:50:21,876
alright.

270
00:50:21,876 --> 00:50:25,596
Sarah Zelner: i'm adding a just a quick.

271
00:50:25,596 --> 00:50:27,996
Sarah Zelner: question.

272
00:50:27,996 --> 00:50:31,536
Sarah Zelner: I don't know what to call exit survey about.

273
00:50:31,536 --> 00:50:38,856
Sarah Zelner: Making sure that knowing the purpose of the Faculty advisory committee thinking about your schedules for next semester.

274
00:50:38,856 --> 00:51:03,516
Sarah Zelner: We want to develop a firm list of who's participating, I think this kind of regular energy creative energy is going to require people to participate regularly so we wanted to make that apparent and also it's just a spot for you to know any questions that that you have.

275
00:51:03,516 --> 00:51:05,586
Raghu (Biostatistics): It seems that.

276
00:51:05,586 --> 00:51:14,946
Raghu (Biostatistics): Not only just the core but also, I think we had to think about the department what they're getting in the department that feeds off the coal.

277
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:27,786
Raghu (Biostatistics): And then, how they can combine the Code and the department or do the project so it's kind of a project is that the end goal which they come back to the school to kind of.

278
00:51:27,786 --> 00:51:40,986
Raghu (Biostatistics): use all the knowledge that i've gained from the core and the department to do the project so it's kind of a school department school kind of a structure it might be.

279
00:51:40,986 --> 00:51:56,556
Raghu (Biostatistics): benefit them so that, at the end, as they go out they get a complete picture of hey, this is what I learned from the code, this is what I learned from the Department, this is what I am applying this is how I applied so.

280
00:51:56,556 --> 00:52:02,406
Raghu (Biostatistics): it's not just a division of the quarter loners is just looking at the whole.

281
00:52:02,406 --> 00:52:04,416
Raghu (Biostatistics): gambit of two or two years.

282
00:52:04,416 --> 00:52:11,616
Sharon Reilly Kardia: We would we would love that ragu I mean one of the things we're going to emphasize is making the curriculum transparent.

283
00:52:11,616 --> 00:52:22,536
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Like you know what you're learning and why you're learning it in the core and I would think that having that same kind of transparency in the department level courses.

284
00:52:22,536 --> 00:52:33,936
Sharon Reilly Kardia: So that people are actually like oh wow look at this incredible tool kit I have this knowledge base this capacity and its applications so.

285
00:52:33,936 --> 00:52:55,386
Sharon Reilly Kardia: You know, it probably took me a decade to get there, because I, nothing was transparent least when I was taking classes so maybe we could do a little bit better job across the core and the department's we'd be happy to help with that bridge to.

286
00:52:55,386 --> 00:53:00,756
Sharon Reilly Kardia: All right, 159 you have a whole 60 seconds.

287
00:53:00,756 --> 00:53:03,696
Sharon Reilly Kardia: before your next engagement.

288
00:53:03,696 --> 00:53:08,196
Sharon Reilly Kardia: Thank you all for coming on a Friday afternoon wonderful to see you.

289
00:53:08,196 --> 00:53:12,130
Sarah Zelner: Thank you, Nice to meet you all.
