1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:05,900
Okay. Hope everybody having a great Thanksgiving.

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:09,320
Welcome back. We are starting off. No, we're not.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,590
This is the video. Yeah. Download it. There we go.

4
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,770
Let's see if this works. Double click it. Okay.

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,250
Perfect. And how to find the right one. My name is Mariam and I'm sorry, guys.

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:31,919
They're interviews scheduled at exactly the same time as the presentation, and I just couldn't do any more shuffling.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,040
And so she was she recorded her presentation for us.

8
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:38,970
So I think we can all take a second look. Okay.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,790
All right. You ready? Cool. So today we're gonna be talking about endometrial cancer.

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:51,240
But before we do a deeper dive into this topic, I just want to give you a brief outline of what we're going to be discussing today.

11
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:58,480
So we're gonna start off by giving you all an overview of what endometrial cancer is, and then we'll move on to the burden of disease as well,

12
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:07,100
some trends and statistics, and then move on to risk factors and causative agents and disparities and social determinants and prevention efforts.

13
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,940
Treatment of survivorship. I'm going to finish off talking about some current research going on in this space.

14
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,330
So first off, what is endometrial cancer?

15
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,090
As you can see on the screen, endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant cells form in the endometrium,

16
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,550
which is also known as the lining of the uterus.

17
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:32,580
Endometrial cancer is the sixth most common type of cancer in women, and it is also the most prevalent type of uterine cancer globally.

18
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:40,890
Generally, enemy trial cancer is separated out into two different types based on stage and grade type one and type two.

19
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,290
Looking at type one, this makes up about a bulk of the cases.

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:52,950
It's pretty common. Typically slow spreading and not very aggressive is more prevalent in younger adults than in older adults,

21
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,660
and it is often caused by hyperplasia or estrogen dependency.

22
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:04,980
Some types of endometrial cancer type one include endometrium at grade one and endometrial at grade two.

23
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:11,820
Now moving on to type two, this one is a little bit more rare and it only represents about 10 to 15% of cases.

24
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,430
It is more aggressive and because it is more aggressive, it often has a worse prognosis.

25
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,240
And this one is more prevalent in older adults.

26
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,509
And the causative factor is not very well known.

27
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:31,470
It's not caused by hyperplasia or attrition. But there are some thoughts that it might be caused by endometrium polyps.

28
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:36,570
Moving on to look at endometrial cancer in the United States.

29
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:42,370
As you can see, there was just shy of 1 million people living with endometrial cancer in 2019.

30
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:46,690
And as of 2022, there were about 65,000 new cases.

31
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,850
Looking at future projections,

32
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:57,100
the incidence is expected to increase by about 17% and mortality is expected to increase by a little bit over 36% by 2040.

33
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,470
So this makes endometrial cancer an area of importance for public health coming in the future.

34
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:06,790
Now, moving on to endometrial cancer globally, as you can see,

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:15,460
the incidence was about 382,000 new cases in 2018 with a mortality of just under 90,000 deaths in 2018.

36
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:22,090
Globally, the incidence is projected to increase by about 55% across countries.

37
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:28,450
That being said, the incidence and mortality is not distributed equally amongst low and high HDI

38
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,820
countries with low HDI countries or human development index countries faring the worst.

39
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,650
As we can see with incidence.

40
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:44,320
The incidence is projected to double by 2040 and low HDI countries and the mortality is projected to increase by about 104%.

41
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:48,760
Whereas with high HDI countries it's projected to increase by about 62%.

42
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:56,230
So as we can see, we need to really focus our efforts on these low HDI countries as well as endometrial cancer prevention efforts globally.

43
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:58,270
All right.

44
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:06,340
So now taking a look at some risk factors and protective factors, the causative agent of endometrial cancer is not very well known at this point.

45
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:13,120
However, it is currently hypothesized that an increase in the original hormone within the body

46
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,400
may be responsible for endometrial cancer because it catalyzes uterine lining buildup,

47
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:24,850
which can lead to abnormal cell growth. That being said, there are some risk factors that are strongly associated with the cancer,

48
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:31,360
including old age, because it frequently happens in postmenopausal women as well as obesity,

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:41,200
diabetes and genetic predisposition, particularly having lynch workout, etc. all increase an individual's likelihood of developing endometrial cancer.

50
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:47,950
Shifting gears to some protective factors, we've seen that healthy diet as well as an active lifestyle,

51
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:53,470
can be productive against endometrial cancer because it reduces risk of obesity.

52
00:04:54,310 --> 00:05:02,950
Living on pregnancy, IUDs breastfeeding as well as birth control have been associated with a decreased risk of endometrial cancer,

53
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,550
likely because it reduces the oxygen hormone in the body.

54
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:14,530
And lastly, and very interestingly, cigaret smoking has been associated as a protective factor for endometrial cancer.

55
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:21,610
However, it is not recommended because cigaret smoking is associated with so many different cancers and then aspirin,

56
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:27,969
which we'll get to later on in the presentation. All right.

57
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:36,400
So now we're going to shift over to Miriam's slides. I everyone.

58
00:05:36,730 --> 00:05:42,610
My name is Mariam and I'm going to talk to you a little bit more about the disparities that we see in and of internal health,

59
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,680
individual cancer, and so the determinants that may cause barriers for that.

60
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:53,470
So the first thing I want to draw your attention to is the incidence rates from 2015 to 2019.

61
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:02,530
And on this graph it may be a little bit hard to distinguish, but the biggest takeaway is that non-Hispanic black men tend to have the largest

62
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,450
incidence rates compared to the Hispanic women and other racial minority groups.

63
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:17,530
And so here I know that between non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic, black and very Indian and Alaska Native populations, it's very hard to distinguish.

64
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,630
But for the non-Hispanic black rate, it is actually 29.3.

65
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:31,570
The American Indian and Alaska Native Rate is 20.1, and then the non-Hispanic white rate is 28.

66
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:42,610
So here the biggest takeaway is that the non-Hispanic and that has been a black incidence rate per 100,000 persons is actually much larger.

67
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:46,750
And so this is one of the biggest disparities when it comes to your health.

68
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:52,060
But it kind of is the beginning of the disparity that we will really be talking about.

69
00:06:54,490 --> 00:07:03,280
Okay. So here's another kind of is this graph, but this specifically is targeting an aggressive form of individual cancer.

70
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,180
And so this is kind of something that I talked about at different stages.

71
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,340
But here you can see that the non-Hispanic white population has a much larger

72
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,029
gap in incidence rate when it comes to an aggressive form of individual cancer.

73
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:25,599
And so this is really one of the biggest incidence disparities that is discussed when it comes to cancer,

74
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:32,230
because they are being proportionately diagnosed with more aggressive forms of this cancer type.

75
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:40,930
And so another thing that is also interesting to look at when it comes to this graph is that you have the Hispanic and Hispanic,

76
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:44,680
white and Asian Pacific Islander populations kind of down at the bottom.

77
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:51,490
And for Hispanic white, the rate is where they kind of seem pretty steady, maybe decrease a little bit.

78
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,370
But really, there's a major change to it now when it comes to Asian, Pacific Islander and Hispanic,

79
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:06,490
you can see that there is clearly an increase in the last few years similar to the non-Hispanic black population as well.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,190
And so what is really interesting about this is that currently there is very little research that

81
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:18,880
specifically targets Hispanic populations or Asian Pacific Islander populations and endometrial cancer.

82
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,650
So therefore, that's why it's really hard to talk about the disparities that they have in those populations so critical forward.

83
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:34,210
When I talk about racial disparities, it's going to be very specifically more so about non-Hispanic black women compared to Hispanic white women.

84
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:38,650
However, with this clear increasing rate,

85
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:45,790
researchers are hoping that they are able to collect more data and that this trend here continues so that they are able to make more

86
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:52,930
definitive claims on the disparities that they see between non-Hispanic white populations and the other racial disparities as well.

87
00:08:53,170 --> 00:09:00,310
So I know the last slide that we saw that the Native American population had a really big incidence.

88
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:09,850
And so that is a large part of that is due to things like expansion of research into these different racial groups.

89
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,720
But yeah, moving forward, we're not really going to be seeing a large role that they play when it comes to this disparity.

90
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:25,510
Okay. So this is really the majority of the racial disparities in outcomes summarized.

91
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:35,290
So the biggest thing is that the non-Hispanic white population has almost two times the mortality rate compared to the white populations.

92
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:41,200
So there's a 21% gap in five years and our survival rate and talk a little bit more about that later.

93
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:48,070
And unfortunately, non-Hispanic black women are also very much less likely to receive surgery as

94
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:52,840
treatment for their endometrial cancer or to receive the proper surgical guidelines.

95
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,749
And this is another that I wanted to include, and this is specifically from sisters, because again,

96
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:05,319
this was the last graph you can clearly see the gap between the Hispanic population and then everyone else.

97
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,650
And it's kind of an alarming gap here. And in this crack itself,

98
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,230
this is where you can see that they simply have almost two times the mortality rate

99
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:21,730
compared to non-Hispanic white populations and I think a lot of other populations as well.

100
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:33,430
And so I think around 2019, they had a mortality rate of about 9.1 versus 4.6, which is what the non-Hispanic.

101
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:37,230
And so that was again, per 100,000 of persons.

102
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:47,160
And so this is a very alarming disparity. And we'll talk a little bit more when it comes to the trends about why this maybe this is because.

103
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,340
But yeah, and then there's a 20% you in five year survival rate.

104
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:55,739
So I'm going to move on to the slide here that will clearly show that.

105
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,800
So this is the five year survival rates.

106
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:07,050
And this is also from Sears. And the biggest thing that you notice here is that it is just certainly significant, sorry,

107
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:17,400
that the non-Hispanic population has a much larger or much smaller column compared to the columns for the other racial groups around it.

108
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,459
Now, again, specifically, we're going to be comparing the non-Hispanic black population to the non-Hispanic white population so

109
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:30,060
we can see that they are clearly significantly associated as having a difference between the two.

110
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:33,630
And so this is where the 12% gap kind of kicks in.

111
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:43,950
You can kind of see it here with these numbers. And I believe nonspecific translation has a 63% five year old rate, which is extremely low.

112
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:51,510
And then the non-Hispanic I translation as 85 or 84% on a five year survival rate.

113
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,380
And so this difference in the top is also extremely alarming.

114
00:11:55,380 --> 00:12:03,900
So when it comes to endometrial cancer, there's not only disparity in actually like outcomes like the survival as well

115
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:09,809
due to treatment and prognosis and all these things that we all kind of discuss.

116
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:10,740
But essentially,

117
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:21,120
one of the biggest things that I want you to take away from looking at the graphs for the five year olds is by the rate and the aggressive incidence

118
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:32,080
rates is that a lot of researchers I spoke to believe that a lot of the disparities that we see are kind of caused because women are not.

119
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:38,999
25 women are traditionally also diagnosed with more severe forms of cancer or more higher grade forms of cancer.

120
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,480
And as we've learned, higher grade usually means poor prognosis.

121
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:52,800
And so that could be why there is such a low survival rate now for some parents to also consider our socioeconomic status,

122
00:12:53,100 --> 00:13:00,330
education level and types of education. So when it comes to socioeconomic status, I know this is something that we've discussed many times,

123
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:07,290
but it is associated with advanced age of cancer at diagnosis decreased so that decreased

124
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:12,480
survival rates and the decreased odds of receiving guideline adherent treatment.

125
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:22,200
And so here we can see with the lower socioeconomic status, women are much more disadvantaged and may not receive the proper treatment that they need.

126
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,040
And we have to see that they may have lower survival rates.

127
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:36,030
And they are also traditionally diagnosed with an advanced stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis, which we have just talked about,

128
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:44,910
that may lead to the decreased survival rates and the increased mortality rates that we've seen when it comes to education level.

129
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:54,090
It is actually a predictor of worse endometrial cancer incidence and mortality and associated with higher stage cancer diagnosis.

130
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,290
And finally, when it comes to type of insurance, this is quite interesting.

131
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:07,530
But we see that when it comes to Medicare and Medicaid, it is actually associated with an advanced stage diagnosis at the time of diagnosis.

132
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,300
And then when it comes to not having insurance or having public funded insurance,

133
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:17,970
there are differences in the treatment and survival outcomes that we see in patients.

134
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:23,760
And then finally, when we look at home insurance, they tend to have the highest overall survival rate.

135
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,610
So anyone that does not have private insurance just seems to have a pretty low overall survival rate.

136
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:39,120
And so these assessments are pretty alarming. And so you can see that a lot of them have similar outcomes or that they may all work together.

137
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:39,790
So, you know,

138
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:48,690
we've seen a lot of classes of other help that losses and maybe a lower education level kind of sometimes affect each other or go hand-in-hand.

139
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:55,140
And so it's just really interesting to see how a lot of these determinants are separate but also impact each other

140
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:04,590
to create really major barriers and inequities in health that have created these very alarming disparities.

141
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:20,819
So that's the determinants. And this varies. Okay.

142
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:27,630
So we started off with primary prevention. As mentioned before, smoking was considered a protective factor.

143
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:34,740
However, quitting smoking is a very highly encourage because it makes it harder to kill

144
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,320
cancer cells and for a second cancer to occur or recurrence of the original cancer.

145
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:49,889
Smoking was considered to be protective because there was a study that said that smokers are lead and so they have less fat,

146
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:54,250
so their body creates less estrogen and excess fat.

147
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:57,510
So that's why smoking, I guess, was considered protective.

148
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:04,860
So maintaining an active lifestyle and weight is also really important.

149
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,850
As I mentioned,

150
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:13,020
obesity is a risk factor in having excess fat and dangerous because it's linked to hormonal changes and having more fat tissue increases.

151
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,950
Estrogen levels, which also increases the high risk for cancer.

152
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:27,360
Breastfeeding is quite controversial because some say it does it for that and some say it doesn't.

153
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:34,290
There was an analysis that explored the relationship and it concluded that having ever breast fed decreased

154
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:42,510
a woman's risk by 11% and having breastfed for even longer or has been breastfed for like a few months,

155
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:51,139
showed results that she had even decreased risk that kind of leveled off around 6 to 9 months.

156
00:16:51,140 --> 00:17:00,150
So more than 6 to 9 months of breastfeeding, everybody really had the same decreased risk and only 55.8% of women breastfeed.

157
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:07,920
And so if this really does help, women are promoting this to a whole population, it would be really beneficial.

158
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:17,610
And there aren't really cons to breast feeding because they already have so many positive effects for the women in that area.

159
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,150
And there's also combination hormone therapy.

160
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:30,240
So taking contraceptives that have both estrogen and progesterone to increase the risk of cancer, someone to take into treatment of all the symptoms.

161
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,850
But oral contraceptives without progesterone can lead to higher risk of cancer.

162
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,790
So taking so contraceptive with both estrogen and progesterone or your risk for.

163
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:51,210
Oh. So for secondary prevention, there really isn't a screening test, but there are diagnostic tests.

164
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,720
For example, endometrial sampling for pap smears.

165
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:00,270
They'll take a sample of the cells in the vagina and will determine if there are precancerous or cancer cells.

166
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:06,300
It's important to mention that these diagnostic tests have really high rates of false positives and false negatives,

167
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,760
and sometimes they'll even improve by getting the results done.

168
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,870
So it's kind of like useless to them sometimes.

169
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:25,139
There's also transvaginal ultrasound, which is a water inserted into the vagina that looks at the uterus and looks for a master tumor.

170
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,680
But it can not tell if the mass is benign or cancerous.

171
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:35,310
So a biopsy is probably needed. Well, I just want to mention that we have people who have Lynch syndrome.

172
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,700
It's connected to a 70% higher risk for endometrial cancer.

173
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:42,450
And most doctors, when they find out their patient has Lynch syndrome,

174
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:53,640
they're really highly recommend removing the uterus full of tubes and the ovaries before they even show signs of cancer just as a protective measure.

175
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,860
So with tertiary prevention and treatment, the most common treatment is a hysterectomy,

176
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,900
which is which removes the uterus if it metastasized and a radical hysterectomy is done.

177
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:12,590
The treatment history of experience and surrounding tissue of human radiation are sometimes used,

178
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:18,080
but it's usually used before surgery to shrink the tumor before they go in and surgically remove it.

179
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,710
As mentioned, treatment is usually surgery.

180
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:28,940
Despite high survival rates for cancer, it's very likely for it to reappear in the first few years after treatment.

181
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:39,800
So it's it's really highly recommended to get a physical exam every 3 to 6 months for the first two or three years after getting unusual cancer.

182
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:44,180
And then you switch to every 6 to 12 months for a physical exam.

183
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:50,930
But if you really had a high stage of cancer that is also recommended, you get CT scans of the chest,

184
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:54,950
abdomen and pelvis along with a physical exam just to make sure everything's okay.

185
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,130
So life after cancer.

186
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:12,430
So unfortunately, when you do what the surgery is the most common type and so you become sterile after that surgery, so you cannot have children.

187
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:19,180
Thus, for most patients, this isn't an issue because it's more likely to happen in post-menopausal women.

188
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:27,460
However, it is also possible for it to happen in younger women who are considering having families or just want a child later on.

189
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:35,499
And it's an issue because the symptoms that come with other material cancer are similar to period symptoms.

190
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:43,059
And so it can often go undiagnosed in these younger women and then eventually lead to a higher stage because it's untreated.

191
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:47,260
And then when it's finally noticed, surgery is probably the only option.

192
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,490
So like I said, they become sterile. So.

193
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:02,469
But also there are other. Side effects that come with the treatment.

194
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:08,260
So older women usually have menopausal symptoms and sexual dysfunction, which includes the loss of the climax,

195
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:15,970
painful intercourse or psychosexual support, which is like how old he was herself and her emotional state.

196
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,600
Yeah. All right.

197
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:27,470
So now we're going to talk about some current research in the public health relevance of that term.

198
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:34,180
So I'm going to focus on aspirin, also known as a serious a serious salicylic acid,

199
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:43,990
which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or NSAID used to relieve pain, reduce fever and inflammation.

200
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:52,390
Aspirin is one of the most widely used NSAIDs in the world, and 40,000 tons are produced worldwide each year.

201
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:57,280
Aspirin has also been used to prevent strokes,

202
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:04,930
as well as heart attacks in people at risk death and people who have recently had a heart attack as well as the prevention of preterm birth.

203
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:11,920
The use of aspirin has also been linked to a reduced risk of cancer of the breast, prostate and colorectal.

204
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:19,210
However, the evidence for a protective effect against endometrial cancer is conflicting.

205
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:33,360
All right. So a meta analysis and systemic review published in 2020 included nearly 15,000 cases of endometrial cancer and found a significant inverse

206
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:44,280
association between any aspirin use and the risk of endometrial cancer in case control studies with pools are pooled odds ratio .88.86.

207
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:48,180
So that kind of shows that there is a protective effect.

208
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:59,550
Another meta analysis found a 15% reduced risk and higher and higher reduction of risk for higher frequency of use.

209
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:07,620
And these effects were strongest in women with obesity, so with a BMI over 30.

210
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,660
However, there have also been studies showing a slight negative effect.

211
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:22,950
So one study found that women using aspirin or other NSAIDs for over ten years before diagnosis of

212
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:29,610
endometrium cancer were found to have a two fold increased risk of mortality from endometrial cancer.

213
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:36,420
So that is another thing to consider. We're not sure if if that has a protective or negative effect.

214
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:47,130
And additionally, one study has found that there is no association between low dose aspirin use and endometrial cancer specific survival.

215
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:57,510
So more research does need to be done on the risks and benefits of low dose daily aspirin use and its

216
00:23:57,510 --> 00:24:02,970
association with enemy cancer before we're able to move forward with this as a public health intervention.

217
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:12,659
But if it was a public health intervention, if aspirin was shown to reduce the risk of enemy child cancer,

218
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:20,520
it could be used as a preventative intervention in patients with a family history or genetic predisposition to endometrial cancer.

219
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,559
If it worked, it would improve the global scope of endometrial cancer by reducing health

220
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:30,810
care costs as an effective preventative tool for individual and other cancers,

221
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:34,770
while also having the added benefit of preventing cardiovascular disease,

222
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:40,920
stroke and preterm birth because these protective effects have already been established.

223
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:50,010
Cancer treatment is expensive, and the high prices of cancer medicine have a large impact on accessibility in low and middle income countries.

224
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,720
Aspirin is highly available and affordable in these low and middle income countries,

225
00:24:55,080 --> 00:25:03,120
and administering low dose aspirin use to patients at risk could be significantly cost saving from the health care payers perspective.

226
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,930
Aspirin would be easier to use in low and middle income settings,

227
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:13,410
which would solve the problem of accessibility and affordability of preventative cancer care in these countries.

228
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,129
However,

229
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:24,180
more work does need to be done in the research of aspirin and how low dose aspirin use use works to prevent an immature cancer and related mortality.

230
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:33,360
More research also needs to be done on the risks of this low dose daily aspirin use, such as ulcers, stomach irritation and severe bleeding.

231
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,560
More research is also needed about the problems related to cancer control in these low and middle income countries.

232
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:48,480
Research and innovation in high income countries are often not relevant for the cancers of low and middle income countries,

233
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:55,229
and the cancer control strategies are also not always applicable due to differences in accessibility,

234
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:59,280
availability, differences in health systems and socio cultural factors.

235
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,360
So there's more research needed.

236
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:26,860
If you are closing. So not specifically for endometrial cancer.

237
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:33,439
It has been used as an intervention for cardiovascular disease as well as stroke and I believe

238
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,180
other cancers where that link is more well established but not in the cancer specific.

239
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:54,730
I have a couple of questions. Um, so some of these are a little bit kinky.

240
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,030
So one is you talked about prophylactic surgery in Lynch syndrome patients.

241
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,780
Sorry. And you mentioned that one of the secondary prevention slides.

242
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:08,240
Do you think that that is secondary prevention? What kind is it?

243
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:13,290
I would say if they're doing a surgery to prevent something, it's public primary.

244
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,540
That's correct, yes.

245
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:19,970
So those prophylactic surgeries are examples of primary prevention because you're trying to prevent them from ever getting it in the first place.

246
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,200
Right. Also talk about breastfeeding.

247
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:30,810
Is breastfeeding a modifiable risk factor? Yes, to an extent.

248
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:35,490
Some women are not able to breastfeed. So when you don't have kids.

249
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:39,630
Right. Yeah. So that one is tricky, right?

250
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,930
Because you're in you said in the applicable population.

251
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:47,860
And so I think I knew what you meant by that, which is women who are having children and are able to breastfeed.

252
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,680
Right. But I don't know. It's one of those things that seems very natural and easy.

253
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:56,120
And until you do it, you realize, oh, it's not actually.

254
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,139
And there's a lot of potential barriers. And so, yeah, so it's one of those things.

255
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,630
It's a tricky thing to be like everybody should breastfeed, right?

256
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,840
Because then not everybody can for various reasons and some of them are just.

257
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:16,050
And then. LEWIS Yes. Women sometimes it is a barrier just because like the type of job that they have, they can't pump while they're at their job.

258
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,680
They have to go back to work. Right. So I don't know.

259
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,030
It's a tricky one, right?

260
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:33,959
It's a it's a tricky one to promote as a this is this is as like a public health, uh, intervention kind of promotion kind of thing.

261
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,350
It's a tricky one to promote as like a primary prevention tool.

262
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,540
Not saying it shouldn't be done, it's just you have to be a little bit delicate about it.

263
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:51,070
Does that make sense? Um, and then I wanted to do story time about the estrogen only contraceptives thing.

264
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,280
Are there such things anymore as estrogen? Only contraceptive?

265
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:57,540
But I don't know.

266
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:09,239
I don't think we even so they will give estrogen of anyone who has a uterus has to have um opposed estrogen, which means opposed by progesterone.

267
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,370
So you have to have both in, in the thing. Right. Yeah.

268
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:19,919
It's, I've seen that same time women who've had their uterus removed will take estrogen only hormone replacement therapy.

269
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,950
Right. Without the progesterone. But if you have a uterus, you have to have both.

270
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:27,120
And the reason is because when they first started giving HRT to women with menopausal symptoms,

271
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:32,159
they gave unopposed estrogen and they realized that they were giving women endometrial cancer.

272
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,930
So that happened in the late seventies.

273
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,710
So that is why we now know that giving unopposed estrogen to women with the uterus causes them to be more cancer.

274
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,120
This is just a question, actually. We've done randomized controlled trials.

275
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:53,730
So, first of all, is there any cancer for which aspirin is actually recommended as primary prevention?

276
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:13,430
It's the guidelines have changed a lot. So at one point the guidelines did set or didn't say that anyone under 50 who has a history of.

277
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,520
Cancer should take it, but it's more for cardiovascular disease and stroke.

278
00:30:20,970 --> 00:30:28,549
It has for decades. I thought, well, maybe I'm not.

279
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:32,530
I'm not finding it now. Let me see if I can.

280
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:40,540
I thought that it was recommended at one point as primary prevention for colon cancer and colon cancer.

281
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:44,680
But now I can't find it, so maybe not.

282
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:48,550
Maybe you're right. So ignore what I said.

283
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:52,930
But so they've done trials, right?

284
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:56,110
For colon cancer specifically. I know. And for colon polyps.

285
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,170
So has anybody looked in those meta analysis where any of the studies like those trials do you know,

286
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,170
like how they looked at the trial data because they may not be in the colorectal cancer?

287
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:15,310
Yeah, I think there have been trials like randomized controlled trials of aspirin for cancer prevention, but I think it is for other cancers.

288
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:21,730
And if it was for colon cancer, then it's going to include men and women. So you lose half your samples and it'll be trials rarer.

289
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:31,090
So it might not be powered, but, um, I, I can't remember off the top of my head if I was able to.

290
00:31:31,450 --> 00:31:35,319
That would be interesting to see because that's, that's the right way to do it.

291
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,670
Right. To see if it really does anything but the existing trials, certainly the ones for cutting it.

292
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,900
This is the trouble, right.

293
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:48,580
Is that these drugs that are that are tested for cardiovascular disease prevention, the trials are not powered to look at cancer outcomes.

294
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:54,430
So it's difficult to use those trial data then to make any inferences about cancer.

295
00:31:54,940 --> 00:32:02,740
The other thing I'm curious about is if you go back to your slide where you go back like a couple of slides, one go forward to.

296
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:10,980
Forward. Forward. Don't you go?

297
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,240
I want to ask because like this one. This one. You have this negative effect.

298
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:19,970
So. I would be curious to read that paper.

299
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:24,870
I wonder if the way that they collected the there could be a bias that could be causing.

300
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:32,159
That is what I'm wondering. But also I'm wondering if they if it's only one paper that found that I would be very skeptical

301
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,819
and I would like maybe carefully to see if I thought that there might be some sort of bias,

302
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:41,520
because there can be biases in the way you collect data about common medications and other outcomes.

303
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:46,020
I do wonder also, though, has anybody looked at this protective effect?

304
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:51,330
And I'm guessing no, because it's only recently that people have started looking at those subtypes that you guys talked about,

305
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:56,520
like the enemy triggered some type or the not endometrium, whichever one is that not in the meteoroid?

306
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:00,120
That's the one that has the worse outcomes. Yeah. So like clear.

307
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,410
So yeah. Yeah. Non not endometrial ones that are more common in the black women.

308
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:07,710
I'm wondering if those have a different relationship.

309
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:11,010
Like if you're increasing those or if you're not increasing those,

310
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:17,490
if you're not decreasing those with the aspirin, then you might end up with some weird looking thing.

311
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,360
If you're not taking into account the subtype, you could end up with some weird looking thing with aspirin.

312
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,750
Use survival. Yeah, I am not.

313
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:29,520
And I don't believe that it was. I bet they have.

314
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:35,349
I was, um, split up by subtype because the individual studies probably didn't look at that.

315
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:43,659
And then within that to analyze it, you can. Yeah. Well, okay, so this, this specific paper that found that, um,

316
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:51,970
increased risk of endometrium cancer specific mortality was a large scale nationwide prospective cohort study.

317
00:33:53,110 --> 00:34:05,590
So that found that women who had used aspirin or other NSAIDs for over ten years before their diagnosis had that to increase risk of.

318
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:09,940
Mortality. Okay. I can send you the paper if.

319
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:16,850
No. Yeah, I'm sure you reference that. Yeah. Oh, that's interesting.

320
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:26,750
Okay, so I think this stuff is pretty cool. I mean, this is cool, right? So the trouble is, people have done a lot of randomized trials for aspirin.

321
00:34:26,750 --> 00:34:30,409
I mean, to tell you what the trouble is going to be, they've done a lot of randomized trials for aspirin.

322
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:37,129
No one wants to pay for another one. No pharmaceutical company is paying for it because aspirin is not a drug that they're making money on.

323
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:44,000
Right. And it's going to be it's going to need to be real, real big to find anything for endometrial cancer,

324
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:47,570
especially if you're interested in this subtype preventive nature of cancer.

325
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:54,800
And so suddenly this becomes an extremely expensive and long term undertaking that nobody is going to pay for.

326
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:59,270
And they're like, Well, aspirin is good for you anyway, so you might as well just take it and maybe it's going to do something.

327
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,209
So finding like the definitive answer about a drugs and this is why it's difficult to do.

328
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:08,000
Like when I tell you I'm working on statins and cancer,

329
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,360
it's really difficult to do any kind of trial work on that because the pharmaceutical companies are already making money hand over fist on statins.

330
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,770
They don't need to make any more.

331
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:22,040
They're not going to pay a bunch of money for a trial when they're already have 30% of the population taking that drug.

332
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,240
Like it's not going to happen right at that age, huh? With the new age.

333
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:34,860
Yeah. But then you've got. Then your. The trouble is, when you write a grant,

334
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:40,950
you have to convince these people that what you're doing is important enough that they should pay a bunch of money for it.

335
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,350
And I will tell you, the argument we get with statins,

336
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:48,659
if you try to propose to look at statins and some of the other people's get, we know statins are good for you.

337
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,210
Everyone's taking them anyway. We don't need to study this.

338
00:35:52,770 --> 00:36:00,599
There's they're arguing that like the marginal increase you're going to get in Statton users by proving

339
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:05,639
that they do something for prostate cancer or whatever is so small that we don't even need to study this.

340
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:09,420
Everyone's taking them anyway. If it does something good, that's great. We can spend our money elsewhere.

341
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,649
They're going to make the same argument about aspirin, right? Because everybody's taking it for cardiac protection.

342
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:17,640
We're already telling people to do it. A huge chunk of older adults are already taking it.

343
00:36:17,970 --> 00:36:24,720
And so the trouble is that no one wants to pay the money to do the big study when in their mind everyone was already doing it anyway.

344
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,709
So if it's good, it's good, great. It's good for something else.

345
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:32,880
That's awesome. Let's solve the problem and study things that we haven't studied before.

346
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:38,010
So it's it's frustrating, right, when you want to have a real answer.

347
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:43,710
But the trial you could do that smaller that would be easier to pay for would not be an incidence trial.

348
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:48,000
It would be an objective treatment trial of patients to see if it improves mortality or outcomes.

349
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:55,470
That's the one you can do, right? Because you need a much smaller group of people because the outcome of mortality or recurrence is much higher.

350
00:36:56,580 --> 00:37:04,320
Right. So you don't need as big of a sample size because your outcome now mortality among patients is not uncommon.

351
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,770
So you can do that study what the smaller group of people. If that's not none of us is a criticism.

352
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:19,349
This is a cool. I just you know, I think it's an interesting discussion and what gets funded and how you get to do this work,

353
00:37:19,350 --> 00:37:25,150
even though it's important and interesting, it's hard. Near and dear to my heart.

354
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:28,489
The common medications stuff. Yeah.

355
00:37:28,490 --> 00:37:40,010
It's just interesting because in 2015, 18% of Americans who are taking aspirin regularly said they were doing so to prevent cancer.

356
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,720
Really? Yeah. Huh. So something.

357
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:59,720
Something like 52. So a bit over 50% of adults in America, 45 to 75 are taking aspirin regularly and 18% of them are taking it to prevent cancer.

358
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,020
So I think it is important for us to make this association clear because, yes,

359
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:13,100
like the general population, our big chunk of them think that this is actually preventing cancer.

360
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:18,320
So maybe that'll that makes them less likely to go in for screening or.

361
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:24,889
Yeah. You can argue that other preventative effects or other you could argue that the people who are so health conscious that

362
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,810
they're taking aspirin to prevent cancer are probably worried about it and therefore are getting their screening.

363
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:38,140
It's all about I mean, giving something for the design all about convincing the reviewers that they should spend their money on their.

364
00:38:42,230 --> 00:38:50,740
Cool. All right. Great job, guys. And last but not least, drum roll.

365
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,090
We have lung cancer, right?

366
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:10,630
No liver cancer, the other. No. Specialist advice.

367
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:24,830
And do I hear? It's around.

368
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:55,800
I've been watching the playoffs. You have to sign out first so it doesn't actually work to switch.

369
00:39:55,860 --> 00:40:24,800
I don't know. That's weird. It's annoying. So while we're waiting to get this going, next time we have our dinner with you.

370
00:40:24,970 --> 00:40:30,800
Right. So the document, I think, is, has anybody got, I think, published?

371
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:35,870
Yes. Okay. So the review document is up there again, just like last time.

372
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:39,200
Come with questions. I have nothing prepared. It's the you show. So.

373
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:50,510
And then Tuesday is our exam. And if anybody has, you know, any any accommodations or things that they need, just get the exam separately.

374
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:55,300
Do either me okay. All right.

375
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,550
You guys are up now, everyone. We're going to be talking about liver cancer today.

376
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:06,940
I'm Christina, and you guys are introducing an umbrella.

377
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:12,460
I'm Alex. So we chose the color green for these slides because it is for liver cancer awareness.

378
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,830
So even though it's not the prettiest slide, hopefully it adds to the theme.

379
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:23,740
So we want to talk a little bit about what liver cancer is before we get into the epidemiology of it.

380
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:30,180
So liver cancer obviously is cancer in the liver and there's the most popular or the not popular kind,

381
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:37,510
but the most common kind of hepatocellular carcinoma. And so symptoms for this usually don't arise very early on,

382
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:44,410
which makes it difficult to identify early on and treat, leading to some pretty poor survival rates.

383
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:52,060
Once you do get symptoms, they would usually be something along the lines of yellow skin, stomach pain, vomiting and especially weight loss.

384
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:59,650
And again, those survival rates are pretty lacking. Um, I think the localized rate is the highest one at about 35%,

385
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,110
although that number is improving, which gives us some hope in terms of global prevalence.

386
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:13,299
There's a lot of concentration around China and South Eastern Asia, as well as some sub-Saharan African countries, especially in China.

387
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:21,040
This is because of the spread of hepatitis C virus, which is a major cause for liver cancer.

388
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:27,280
Hepatitis C virus is also a cause for concern and is also circulating in these areas.

389
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:31,480
Um, we'll talk a lot about hepatitis C later as it doesn't have a vaccine right now.

390
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:37,210
So the main focus for preventing liver cancer is right now on hepatitis B.

391
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:47,620
And so you can see with the colored scale here that China and some other sub-Saharan African countries are really, really concentrated.

392
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:57,250
U.S. we'll talk about later isn't also doing that. Great Mongolia has the highest rates in the world, and they're actually some pretty shocking rates.

393
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:02,530
About 15% of their entire population dies due to liver cancer, which is crazy.

394
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:11,290
There's a lot of articles about that. Um, but, um, for liver cancer combined with cirrhosis, um, for global incidence,

395
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:18,550
you'll see a lot of the same rates as global prevalence because that's what's contributing to it.

396
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:22,240
So incidence is in fact going down for some Asian countries,

397
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:28,570
but those rates are still so far ahead of the game in terms of other nations that it's still pretty concerning.

398
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:35,890
And vaccination programs need improvement in order to bring this down because there is a hepatitis B vaccine.

399
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:40,810
But, um, these rates show that it might not be being implemented well enough.

400
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,540
Uh, and then trends are on the rise in Western countries like the U.S., especially due to hepatitis C,

401
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:54,759
which doesn't currently have a vaccine and is commonly transmitted through injection drug use, which is also on the rise in the U.S.

402
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,740
So about 900,000 people, um, have new cases of liver.

403
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,430
There's, there are about 900,000 new cases of liver cancer every year.

404
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:13,000
Um, global mortality, again, kind of follows the same trend with China and some other Southeast Asian countries.

405
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:17,960
Um, and this could indicate differences in access to treatment, uh,

406
00:44:18,010 --> 00:44:24,550
differences in identification stage of liver cancer and also maybe some cultural differences.

407
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:29,320
And about 800,000 people died from cancer in 2020 globally.

408
00:44:30,850 --> 00:44:35,320
Um, for the US we have higher rates than either of our neighbors.

409
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:44,470
As you can see from again the colored scale, the dark green showing about 7.6 per 100,000 people.

410
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:52,420
Um and they the, the rates here could be attributed to increases in alcoholism,

411
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:59,110
obesity and especially increased drug usage, all of which are increasing especially in youth in the South.

412
00:44:59,110 --> 00:45:03,160
In emails and later slides, we'll discuss those demographics some more.

413
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,360
Um, the spread of hepatitis C is also a big concern in the U.S. right now,

414
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:14,830
particularly given that there's no vaccine at the time for national incidence in the United States.

415
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:25,180
Again, higher than either of our neighbors. And about 850,000 people in the U.S. are estimated to be living currently with hepatitis B chronically.

416
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:34,030
And the rate of new hepatitis C infections, according to the CDC, was four times as high as it was in 2010.

417
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:38,320
In 2018, and this is probably due to injection drug use,

418
00:45:38,620 --> 00:45:43,780
which brings up the question of safe injection sites, if any of you want to ask about that later on.

419
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:53,950
Um, and the enhanced survey revealed that an estimated almost 4 million U.S. citizens have been infected at one point with hepatitis C.

420
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:58,400
Yes. And but of those, approximately 3 million are chronically infected with that,

421
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:03,590
which is a pretty startling statistic, considering that many of those people probably don't know.

422
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:08,900
And those rates could be a lot higher, leading to a lot of transmission of that.

423
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,290
That can't be stopped if people don't know that they have it.

424
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:19,400
Our last night for epidemiologists focusing on national mortality once again follows the same trend.

425
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:26,740
With the U.S. being higher than its neighbors, hepatitis C rate is slowly increasing.

426
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,950
And again, a big concern because there's no vaccine at the time for it.

427
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:38,810
And there are estimates of 30,000 plus people dying from liver cancer for the year 2022.

428
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,690
So now we're going to talk about the risk factors and causes of liver cancer.

429
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:48,980
So age, sex and race are all non modifiable risk factors.

430
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:56,360
Men are much more likely than women to develop HCC and they have a 2 to 8 times higher

431
00:46:56,360 --> 00:47:01,910
incidence rate than women in all regions across all ages and across all ethnic groups.

432
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:07,850
And there's evidence to suggest that estrogen is actually a protective factor against liver cancer.

433
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:18,980
Hispanic men specifically have the highest increasing incidence rate and your risk increases with your age.

434
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:27,170
And in terms of family history, you're four times more likely to develop liver cancer if a parent or sibling has had it in the past.

435
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:32,570
So alcohol is a major risk factor for liver cancer.

436
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:39,200
Approximately 10 to 20% of heavy drinkers will develop cirrhosis, which can lead to liver cancer, which we'll talk about later.

437
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:48,050
Alcohol is a major risk factor because ethanol is metabolized by the liver in the hepatocytes and it produces acetyl aldehyde.

438
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:55,850
And acetyl aldehyde is a known carcinogen and it increases point mutation frequency and causes sister promoted exchanges.

439
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:57,830
And these mutations can lead to cancer.

440
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:10,360
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is another risk factor and this is due to the excess weight access, insulin and hepatic iron.

441
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:14,170
And these can the three of these can lead to fibrosis and cirrhosis.

442
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:30,030
So Type two diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are both linked to liver cancer and the biological mechanism.

443
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:40,200
Specifically linking Type two and Nafld are the association with obesity, insulin resistance, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.

444
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:45,120
And these factors lead to development of cancer because they increase and promote proliferation

445
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:51,600
and growth and they decrease apoptosis and they increase DNA damage and angiogenesis.

446
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:59,780
So hepatitis C and hepatitis B are both risk factors of liver cancer.

447
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:07,760
And hepatitis B is one of the most chronic infections, common chronic infections worldwide,

448
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,450
and it has the highest rates in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia.

449
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:15,740
As you can see on the graph and there is a vaccine, however,

450
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:21,380
there's a failure to really implement the vaccine, especially in the rural areas that need it the most.

451
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:29,600
And this virus is transmitted through blood or bodily fluids during sex or from mother to child during birth.

452
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:33,710
And this is one of the major risk factors of liver cancer in developing countries.

453
00:49:34,700 --> 00:49:41,390
And then hepatitis C, the most affected regions are in the US, parts of Africa and parts of Asia.

454
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:45,830
And this is also transmitted through perinatal routes.

455
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:51,290
But in most developed countries, it's actually transmitted through intravenous drug use in sex.

456
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:58,520
And patients can develop hepatitis C and do cirrhosis, and that increases their chance of cancer.

457
00:50:02,410 --> 00:50:08,680
Obesity is another major risk factor of liver cancer, and this is because of the chronic low grade inflammation.

458
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,930
And this can impact the immune system,

459
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:20,020
which helps fight against cancer and to locate inflammation also AIDS in the progression of fibrosis and angiogenesis, which help the tumors grow.

460
00:50:20,590 --> 00:50:26,110
And people who are obese have access. Adipose tissue and adipose tissue can secrete leptin.

461
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:32,980
And leptin has been proven to support cancer development by increasing proliferation metastasis and angiogenesis.

462
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:44,050
So Aflatoxins are are a known carcinogen and a risk factor for liver cancer.

463
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:52,450
They are environmental toxins and produced by fungal species and they can be found in many common foods such as corn,

464
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:55,720
oilseeds, ground nuts, tree nuts, milk and dried fruit.

465
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:59,860
And the liver is their primary target organ.

466
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:08,860
And they cause cancer because they are involved in the activation of proto oncogene and the mutation in the p53, the tumor suppressor gene.

467
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:17,649
So this graph shows all the common risk factors and then how your of liver cancer and

468
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:23,410
then how your chances of liver cancer increase if you have cirrhosis or cirrhosis,

469
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:31,240
even if you have all the other underlying risk factors. If you have cirrhosis, it greatly increases your risk of developing liver cancer.

470
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:41,300
And then some of the trends and risk factors that are contributing to increasing rates of liver cancer are the increased hepatitis C rates,

471
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,000
which increase liver cancer.

472
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:53,210
There's been an increase in alcohol consumption by 16.4% among young adults, and the prevalence of obesity has tripled in the past four decades.

473
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,810
And there has been an increase in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

474
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:03,170
And an increase in all these risk factors are contributing to the increased incidence and prevalence of liver.

475
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:11,850
Social determinants of health are the conditions in which we work, live and play, according to the 2020 Healthy People Initiative.

476
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:16,260
Social determinants of health can be categorized in five subsections.

477
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,680
Economic stability. Health care. Access. Education.

478
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:23,140
The social and community. Context and neighborhood and environment.

479
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:29,880
We'll be using this framework to discuss liver cancer and hepatitis C virus or HCV acquisition specifically.

480
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:37,740
Starting with economic stability, people living at or below the poverty level have less access to screening or diagnostic

481
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:43,260
tests and are less likely to be able to work take off work to receive treatment or checkups.

482
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:50,550
This ties into health care access. Other examples of people who have little to no health care access are those who are homeless,

483
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:56,010
people with substance abuse disorders and people who do not have adequate health insurance coverage.

484
00:52:56,520 --> 00:53:01,050
A low educational status is also associated with higher HCV risk.

485
00:53:01,830 --> 00:53:05,610
In terms of the social context, there are multiple factors that may be at play.

486
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:06,629
For example,

487
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:14,610
language barriers between doctors and their patients can inhibit a complete understanding and make patients more medically avoidant in general,

488
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:18,300
which has been linked to a greater HCV related mortality.

489
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:25,440
Finally, when considering the environment, a lack of access to nutrient rich foods and a lack of quality housing which can

490
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,060
expose residents to as fast as the secondhand smoke can also increase the risk.

491
00:53:30,510 --> 00:53:36,030
Additionally, high rates of opioid sales have been linked to higher HCV acquisition as well.

492
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:46,040
Okay. So this graph is contained info on liver cancer incidence rates, which are age adjusted and separated by race and ethnicity.

493
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:52,460
It's from 2000 to 2019. The blue triangles represent Hispanics from any race.

494
00:53:52,790 --> 00:53:56,420
The green triangles are non-Hispanic American Indians and Alaska Natives.

495
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,350
The pink diamonds are non-Hispanic, Asian Pacific Islanders,

496
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:06,440
and the brownish squares represent non-Hispanic black people, and the circles are non-Hispanic white people.

497
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:08,090
As you can see,

498
00:54:08,090 --> 00:54:16,880
there seems to be a slight increase in incidence until around the years 2014 or 2015 where it starts to plateau or decrease in most races.

499
00:54:17,330 --> 00:54:22,370
One study suggested that the decrease is due to an increased detection of localized HCC.

500
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:31,430
What happened to hepatocellular carcinoma? One thing that is important to note is that incidence for non-Hispanic whites is very slightly increasing,

501
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,880
which may be due to poor access to diagnostic tests tests for white populations.

502
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:41,270
However, it is still much lower than any other race showing a disparity present.

503
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:50,200
Moving on to mortality. We see similar trends as using the same key as from 2000 to 2020.

504
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:54,790
Again, nonwhite population rates are much higher than the non-Hispanic white people.

505
00:54:55,030 --> 00:55:02,230
Another important trend to note is the dramatic increase in mortality for the non-Hispanic American Indian and Alaska Native populations.

506
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:10,150
One study suggested that this may be due to the population being less educated on cancer screenings and diagnostic tests,

507
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:15,580
and that they are more likely to express negative attitudes toward cancer treatments than other patients.

508
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:19,600
However, this population is unfortunately very underrepresented.

509
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:27,090
It underrepresented in cancer literature, and there is not a lot of data regarding people who are of this race ethnicity.

510
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:33,690
There are disparities present globally as well.

511
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:40,560
This graph shows age, standardized incidence and blue and mortality and red rates in 2020.

512
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:49,080
For liver cancer includes both sexes, and it shows Asia, Africa, Oceania, Northern America, Europe and Latin America and the Caribbean.

513
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:57,600
Rates for liver cancer are highest in less developed areas. As you can see, Northern America has the largest gap between incidence and mortality.

514
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:05,280
North America has more diagnostic measures available, meaning that more cases can be diagnosed leading to a higher incidence.

515
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:10,080
Additionally, Northern America has better access to liver cancer treatment than less developed areas.

516
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:19,700
Cause the mortality rate to be on the lower side. And so now we're going to talk a little bit about their prevention efforts with liver cancer.

517
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:27,200
So as we know, liver cancer is a disease caused by predominantly caused by infection with hepatitis B and C.

518
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:29,120
So addressing liver cancers,

519
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:36,140
increased incidence globally revolves mainly around minimizing the exposure to these etiological factor etiologic factors.

520
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:42,890
Current efforts are aimed at increasing vaccination rates across the country, across the world, which you can see there.

521
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:48,590
The United States and most developed nations have the highest rates of vaccination.

522
00:56:49,190 --> 00:56:57,740
As we talked about earlier, the incidence rates in South Asia, Southeast Asia are improving and that is because of the increased rates of vaccination.

523
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:04,460
Individuals that are vaccinated have a 70% decreased risk of occurrence of HCC.

524
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:15,440
And then there are large investments in education to reduce needle sharing, increased condom usage and increased safe sex practices.

525
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:24,830
While there is still no vaccine for HCV, hepatitis B, hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for all individuals 59 and younger.

526
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:34,160
It is also been found that coffee, statins, metformin and aspirin have been shown to be protective against the development of HCC in

527
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:39,800
multiple observational studies and it's not proven by randomized control controlled trials.

528
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:50,149
But the European Association for the Study of Liver now recommends coffee usage for adults in Eastern Asia and sub-Saharan sub-Saharan Africa,

529
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:53,330
which account for 80% of new HCC cases.

530
00:57:53,630 --> 00:57:58,310
Exposure to aflatoxin, as we described earlier, is another big risk factor.

531
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:06,740
So in these areas there is increased prioritization of the proper treatment of crops in order to prevent this fungal contamination.

532
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:16,490
In terms of secondary prevention and diagnosis, many different countries have taken a lot of different approaches.

533
00:58:16,790 --> 00:58:23,209
In Taiwan and Japan, there's a comprehensive tracking system to identify high risk individuals and enroll them

534
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:28,640
in surveillance programs to catch any early cases as earlier that liver cancer is got,

535
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,890
the higher your survival rate is, of course.

536
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:40,850
And then additionally, there is the AFP test, which is the alpha FETO protein test, which is a tumor antigen.

537
00:58:41,390 --> 00:58:50,660
So that helps to tell to diagnose the cancer as well as liver function tests which can help to identify individuals who have decreased liver function.

538
00:58:51,380 --> 00:58:55,070
These screenings are not recommended for normal, healthy individuals.

539
00:58:55,820 --> 00:59:03,950
They are recommended and considered to be useful for individuals with chronic HPV and HCV infection.

540
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:11,780
And there is no evidence to really support the screening of any adults today if you're healthy.

541
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:22,629
And then in terms of tertiary prevention, the main means of treatment are with thermal ablation,

542
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:27,400
which is basically using heat to kill the infected area.

543
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:32,290
Liver surgery to remove the affected area. Liver transplants.

544
00:59:32,950 --> 00:59:38,590
Chemotherapy. Radiation therapy. And a partial directed me o.

545
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,960
So. Oh. Oh.

546
00:59:45,370 --> 00:59:52,000
So this is highly influenced by the stage of liver cancer that an individual is in liver

547
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:58,960
serve or complete transplant is the best option as you have the highest rates of survival.

548
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:07,660
However, this is the best for individuals at early stage liver cancer, and at that point, your liver mice may still be fairly highly functioning.

549
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:12,670
So the odds that an individual is at a high order for a liver transplant is pretty low.

550
01:00:13,270 --> 01:00:19,629
So then because of that, there's often kind of this disparity in which individuals that are sicker and of actually getting the liver transplant.

551
01:00:19,630 --> 01:00:21,190
But since they're at a later stage,

552
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:29,020
that liver transplant doesn't end up being as effective and their survival rate is actually not as high as we would like it to be.

553
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:42,400
And going on then going into survivorship, as you can see, this graph shows the survivorship based on the stage in which liver cancer is high.

554
01:00:43,450 --> 01:00:47,499
So survivorship is heavily dependent on how early liver cancer is got.

555
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:54,490
And as we've discussed, there is very few symptoms of liver cancer until it has reached the point in which it is in a later stage.

556
01:00:55,210 --> 01:00:57,820
If it is able to be caught in early stage,

557
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:03,880
such as through surveillance programs of individuals which which are chronically infected with hepatitis B or C,

558
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:08,050
the five year survival rate is 35% for that stage one.

559
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:14,530
As it progresses to regional cancer that affects surrounding lymph nodes, the survival rate quickly drops to 12%.

560
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:18,370
And then, if it goes in, metastasizes to distant parts of the body.

561
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:29,140
The five year survival rate drops all the way to 3%. So as I describe the surgery, liver transplant is the best means of treating liver cancer today.

562
01:01:30,040 --> 01:01:34,389
A liver transplant is the best because it can correct cirrhosis,

563
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:42,250
which we've described is kind of the main cause of liver cancer and can actually lead to development of other cancers due to the lack of severity.

564
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:47,770
At this point, very few people get it. But if you are able to get a liver transplant at an early stage,

565
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:56,020
which is highly dependent on where you are and the abundance of transplants, the four year overall recurrence free survival rate is 85%.

566
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,250
But as it progresses, it becomes less effective.

567
01:02:01,540 --> 01:02:09,010
But since liver cancer is like has inflammatory origins, it is actually a good candidate for immunotherapy.

568
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:17,980
Opdivo, an anti PD one immunotherapy drug, has replaced next bar as an effective treatment for advanced stage liver cancer.

569
01:02:18,910 --> 01:02:21,700
And it is highly sorry.

570
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:33,460
And the cirrhosis which the immunotherapy helps to reduce, has actually shown to also lead to kidney, pancreas and urinary bladder cancers.

571
01:02:33,850 --> 01:02:42,250
So views of the use of immunotherapies can help reduce the occurrence of these cancers post liver cancer as well.

572
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:51,970
And then if you look here, this just shows the five year survival after an individual gets a liver transplant.

573
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:56,350
It just shows the five year recurrence following early treatment.

574
01:02:56,350 --> 01:03:06,340
And then if it's this is after five years from the original diagnosis, the percentage of people that have gotten cancer to come back.

575
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:08,030
Next.

576
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:18,580
We also wanted to examine other side effects having to do with survivorship from liver cancer, including, importantly, mental and physical effects.

577
01:03:19,570 --> 01:03:22,630
And so you can kind of conceptualize it with this sort of real here,

578
01:03:23,230 --> 01:03:28,870
ranging from emotional wellness to spiritual wellness, sexual wellness and a whole myriad of things.

579
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:38,229
So what's really important is that, as many groups have mentioned, a lot of different cancers and post treatments will lead to constant fatigue,

580
01:03:38,230 --> 01:03:49,660
constant stress and anxiety, insomnia in some cases, cognitive decline from certain treatments, mental health problems and sexual dysfunction.

581
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:55,300
So cancer treatments can cause infertility heart problems and bone problems.

582
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:01,150
And then some specific drugs targeting cancers might have their own side effects.

583
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:06,219
What's really important as well is that a lot of financial worry can come from this.

584
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:12,610
Based on bills. You probably wouldn't have been able to work during lots of intense treatment.

585
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:19,120
And then another really important thing is liver cancer specifically is familial relationships and social relationships.

586
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:25,120
Every cancer kind of incorporates this survivorship aspect, but with liver cancer,

587
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:33,820
there are some instances where family or loved ones might be able to donate partial part of their liver for the transplant that I was talking about.

588
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:43,180
And that could definitely do a lot of feelings of guilt and owing people, things like that, which puts a huge strain on healing after treatment.

589
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:53,320
Um, an interesting area of ongoing research for liver cancer is the hepatitis C vaccine, the development of a hepatitis C vaccine.

590
01:04:54,280 --> 01:05:00,370
We talked about this a lot through our presentation. How much of a difference a hepatitis C vaccine would make as one of the main

591
01:05:00,370 --> 01:05:06,790
causes of liver cancer and also was one that's currently increasing as a cause.

592
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:11,139
And so this is in the works right now.

593
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:17,290
It's probably still got a long ways to go, but the introduction of it, we would expect to be pretty monumental.

594
01:05:18,130 --> 01:05:27,820
So hepatitis B immunizations in a study in Taiwan in the 1980s showed up to a 90 to 95% decrease in chronic hepatitis B infection,

595
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:32,830
not necessarily hepatitis B infection, but chronically in children specifically.

596
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:42,730
And then vaccination as a whole shows up to an 84% decreased risk for developing liver cancer attributed to age b b.

597
01:05:43,450 --> 01:05:46,929
So the hepatitis C vaccine, we would hope, would have a similar effect.

598
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:50,830
And if it had any kind of fraction of this effect, it'd be something to work with.

599
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:57,040
Obviously there are important limitations to discuss with any screening or vaccination.

600
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:01,540
As we talked about, it needs to be easy to administer, it needs to be cost effective,

601
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:06,460
especially for a lot of the countries that don't have access or a lot of resources.

602
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:13,450
And it also needs to be really accessible in terms of storage and delivery.

603
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:18,640
And then another important note about this study in Taiwan is that it's not necessary.

604
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:23,830
We can't necessarily apply it across the board. It was only in the 1980s, which wasn't that long ago.

605
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:27,070
There could still be some effects to be seen in the future.

606
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:35,019
And we are using the hepatitis B immunization program in Taiwan to inform us of what a potential

607
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:39,730
hepatitis C immunization program could look like if it was installed with the right mechanisms.

608
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:45,400
So thank you so much for listening. And if you have any questions, we would love to hear them.

609
01:06:54,950 --> 01:07:02,220
But do you know how big they are or if they're like.

610
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:13,760
But I wonder. Yeah.

611
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:21,030
I don't think they're in that many suits in, in they're like I think the farming here they do.

612
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:29,469
They have like not have to fight for something to fix it. We're at very low risk for exposure to Aflatoxins.

613
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:34,300
It's more in the rural and lower income areas in which they don't always have the resources.

614
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:45,460
But it's not. It's also not something that is that hard to prevent with proper, adequate washing of the foods, the aflatoxins are easily removed.

615
01:07:45,550 --> 01:07:50,350
So it is a prevention effort that's currently ongoing and should be quite effective.

616
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:55,930
It's not in our food system in the United States. It is in more it is in developing country problem.

617
01:07:55,930 --> 01:08:02,290
And it's really I don't even know if it's and you may you may have read this is what I heard.

618
01:08:02,290 --> 01:08:06,490
So you may have read something different and correct me if you're reading is different,

619
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:11,170
I think it's less about how you grow the food and more about how you store the grain.

620
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:15,160
Right. Because you were never like pesticides when you're growing it. Our antifungals when you're going.

621
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,580
And I don't think that's really so much the issue. I think it's more how it's stored.

622
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:26,950
So like in proper storage of grains can lead to this fungal buildup and then you end up with it in the food supply.

623
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:31,569
But it's not really an issue here in the US and we'll just story time.

624
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:37,750
I went to Guatemala with a group for work at some point and one of my students was from there who's a Ph.D. student.

625
01:08:37,750 --> 01:08:40,810
He was like, Don't eat, don't eat the black tortillas.

626
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:45,100
Like, I'm sorry, what? It's like they have aflatoxin, like, oh, okay.

627
01:08:45,130 --> 01:08:53,140
He's like, Yeah. So I guess it's even kind of a, I guess like a on purpose food thing sometimes.

628
01:08:53,140 --> 01:08:56,740
But he's like, don't, don't eat that. I'm like, okay, I'm cool.

629
01:08:56,740 --> 01:08:58,510
I'm cool with the yellow ones. I'll stick with those.

630
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:14,640
Oh, I was wondering about whether you guys sex about like the rate of liver transplants being successful versus unsuccessful.

631
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:17,069
Just because I don't like, I don't know, like all see, like,

632
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:21,479
shows and stuff for like the transplant goes wrong or like the body doesn't like accept it.

633
01:09:21,480 --> 01:09:24,550
Like, does that have any impact on the survival rates? Yeah.

634
01:09:25,850 --> 01:09:32,670
Yeah. I mean, it definitely does. I don't think that I looked as much into the rates of the liver transplant actually being successful.

635
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:39,840
I looked at more when the liver transplant was successful at each stage, like, what are your odds of survival for that?

636
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:49,110
So that would be an interesting point. Um, I think that a liver transplant in a later stage individual might be considered unsuccessful if that

637
01:09:49,110 --> 01:09:57,240
liver then develops have a cellular carcinoma because of the liver cancer that was already there.

638
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:05,330
Yeah. I also think if it's in early stages and you do get a liver transplant, I saw one statistic that said it could be upwards of 70%, 60.

639
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:09,270
Oh, that's great. Yeah, I was surprised.

640
01:10:09,300 --> 01:10:14,490
Are they doing a lot of liver transplants for people with cancer? I thought that that would actually prevent you from getting one,

641
01:10:14,490 --> 01:10:19,140
but it depends on the region that you're in and the availability of liver transplants.

642
01:10:20,130 --> 01:10:24,450
But it's considered the most like effective treatment.

643
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:32,400
And so because of that, it's it makes liver cancer. Are they trying to do it for people with cirrhosis before before they get cancer?

644
01:10:32,490 --> 01:10:35,830
Like is cirrhosis a qualifying condition?

645
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:40,590
Yeah. So that's considered stage zero liver cancer. I have cirrhosis of the liver.

646
01:10:41,010 --> 01:10:45,900
And that does those those rates I think are even higher there in the nineties.

647
01:10:45,910 --> 01:10:49,500
If you're able to get a liver transplant, your survival rates are in the nineties.

648
01:10:50,310 --> 01:11:02,990
Which is which is really good. I had a question here somewhere.

649
01:11:03,020 --> 01:11:08,120
Give me a second. Did you run into any like some for like lung cancer?

650
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:12,000
I feel like there's a lot of stigma, right, because everybody knows that lung cancer is caused by smoking.

651
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,290
Do you think that that is as much of a survivorship issue for liver cancer?

652
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:22,259
Like do people know that liver cancer is caused by this kind of like alcohol use, drug use, sex,

653
01:11:22,260 --> 01:11:26,729
you know, things that people might be like, oh, you caused that and therefore there would be stigma?

654
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:32,670
Or is there really not as much stigma because that's less known kind of by the general public about what the causes are.

655
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:41,240
I would think like since there's the HPV vaccine in a lot of developed regions, we don't find that study.

656
01:11:41,510 --> 01:11:44,760
It could be HPV. Okay. So I thought you said HPV.

657
01:11:45,180 --> 01:11:49,420
Yeah. Sorry. H h viruses. Yeah. Hepatitis B, that B vaccine.

658
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:57,120
I think that there is isn't especially because that's more widely available in developed regions, which is where we would more find the stigma.

659
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,940
Since 80% of new cases come out of sub-Saharan Africa and rural areas of Southeast Asia.

660
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:12,000
I don't think that you find as much of a stigma there just because the rates of infection with the different hepatitis strains.

661
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:22,020
And then what? So we've had hepatitis B vaccine for a long time, like since the 1980s, something like that.

662
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:30,810
Why is it better to see so much harder nut to crack? Because knowing nothing about the viruses and vaccine development, I would think you did one.

663
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:36,180
It's only one more letter. Like why? Why is this one so tough, right?

664
01:12:37,530 --> 01:12:41,450
Do we know or do you. Did you? That's a good question. Yeah.

665
01:12:43,550 --> 01:12:48,620
I don't know the answer either, but I mean, it must just be a very different something about it.

666
01:12:48,620 --> 01:12:53,560
Biologically, this must be different than it would be harder to do, but it's prevalent in the US.

667
01:12:53,590 --> 01:12:57,979
I'm sure that there is like funding for it. Oh, I'm sure that like and especially since liver cancer,

668
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:05,570
they've been talking for several years now about increase liver cancer rates and blah blah blah and everybody has, you know, the opioid epidemic.

669
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:09,260
And I'm sure that if it is that they're throwing money at it,

670
01:13:09,260 --> 01:13:14,930
I would not be surprised that would be a that would be a big moneymaker for a pharmaceutical company.

671
