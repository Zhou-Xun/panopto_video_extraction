1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:11,310
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:19,300
Yeah, I saw it. But I wanted to say, you know, I really.

3
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:30,060
The whole idea that this allows you to do that.

4
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:42,460
I realized that is true. I'm now starting Wednesday doing presentations and say, you have a plan,

5
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:53,110
so go ahead and get into your groups and I'll be able to answer any questions or if you want any thoughts or anything.

6
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:56,880
And I believe it will be here soon too.

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:24,110
So you'll have those stresses on me because that previous week, like the last time I did things,

8
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:56,680
I was like, I feel like I feel that wasn't right before I was over everything because I was over there.

9
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:08,290
So I'd like to see that I was there.

10
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:37,810
And I know, I know our topic is the highlighting is was you left because I was I'm just about to change Henry through the process.

11
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:51,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, my gosh.

12
00:02:54,930 --> 00:03:11,190
Yeah, I know it's not. Yeah, I think it's really have to think about it.

13
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:23,930
Did you not like that one that anybody else?

14
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,830
I never really had to really like.

15
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,610
So there's other things. I was doing really good.

16
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:39,730
I was like, okay.

17
00:03:40,810 --> 00:04:02,590
I think all my highlighting that we should highlight the era of what I was saying earlier, and I like I said, I digress.

18
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:13,240
Yeah, I was with somebody that obviously, you know, I don't know.

19
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:22,320
It's like the highlight of the site right at the moment.

20
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:52,020
And I was like, I think I was like, I like I think it will help us understand what's going on here.

21
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,870
I don't know what I would do.

22
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:12,129
And I'm sure that all of our 91 thing and all the other things, I think that's a model.

23
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:19,170
Again, I know we heard that.

24
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:30,759
I was really happy with the kids are really good friends,

25
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:51,580
really like it sounds like I like carrying out their stuff and then like they kept up some of the color schemes to make it different.

26
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:01,790
I just don't think so.

27
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:31,290
I think so too. I like the way I'm going about it, but it would have been used in such a way that I had that conversation.

28
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:45,610
I think it's great to revise the background to say yes.

29
00:06:46,180 --> 00:07:00,220
All right. I thought I was going to talk about making a different approach.

30
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:13,240
So, yeah, I think that we are going to be able to do something that you had another bring up about what we did, our final verdict.

31
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:25,930
Anything about the Internet? The interaction supposed to be the place that's got to get something to forget.

32
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:40,780
So it makes you realize, Oh, I can't wait until he asks what it's gonna be.

33
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay. I know everything that's happening today, and I know I think that's right.

34
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:11,770
And it's not fixing our situation. I feel like we chose a community that has our software background.

35
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,360
Yeah. Yeah, I. This is what I'm saying.

36
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:27,370
It's like, just like like it's just, you know, I long for this morning.

37
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:34,090
I wasn't any specific. They just like going to like background models.

38
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,449
They're really just like, like it's it's just like seven.

39
00:08:37,450 --> 00:09:10,000
I did like the next model and I was like an overview intervention last night and then I like how much I that we should just he's going hire.

40
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:31,980
Yeah it was because I wanted to. You have to do it with you because I was like, Oh, yeah, you need to see what I mean.

41
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:42,650
I'm sorry. Do you think because we made something last until I was like, Oh, whatever is your problem?

42
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:48,350
Yeah, I don't think you did.

43
00:09:48,360 --> 00:10:05,159
I think you were kind of like, yes, I remember a lot of moderators and then we could have another I believe it was just like you realize that,

44
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,649
you know, they really are like, I don't think that was broken.

45
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:39,930
And now they're moderating areas like education. And so I was like, I should have mentioned it when I like it because we were in between individuals,

46
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:56,600
because I like to see like, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

47
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:08,520
Like a fi or whatever from Iowa.

48
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:36,380
And I was like, okay, I have mixed feelings about Mitt Romney's Mormon absentee.

49
00:11:39,540 --> 00:12:13,260
And she was going to be very clear this morning how we only have to trust that it wasn't planned and stuff like that.

50
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:33,660
Sometimes I just like I don't have to look today he's going to argue about how not to help the astronauts.

51
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:56,320
Yeah, you do. But this was my husband was kind of, like more realistic instead of like, like like mindboggling.

52
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:02,480
Like, I'm not even sure whenever you look.

53
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:11,470
And I was like. I know these are my heart rate and I feel like I don't know when I feel like they're excited.

54
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:20,990
And I think we should actually be like this.

55
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:30,680
Like we know it's a problem that's helping our out here.

56
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:53,180
I just know these are all the questions that you didn't really have any regrets.

57
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,830
The error, probably.

58
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:33,640
While this is the first time in my life where we often feel like you're one of the top candidates for my head, I felt like I was like, Oh yeah, yeah.

59
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:49,939
I can't sit my and basically just concentrate on the amount of pain that we had

60
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,900
was maybe another year where they were moderating the relationship between areas.

61
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:08,790
You know, I think it comes right out with the trainers and Joe and then imagine what's going

62
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:33,980
to happen because your heart is part of creating or it seems like the moderators

63
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:46,280
that I did so different demographic cetera and substance use I wouldn't worry

64
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:52,110
about that we have to I mean we have tough questions to be lot questions to.

65
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:58,670
So when I look I don't know how to experience how not to be terrible about this is what the

66
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:12,459
DSM five which they're trying to access to to get some things but I'm not saying I can do.

67
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:16,560
What is it like for you?

68
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:32,569
I'm sorry I challenge you to be. I mean, we were talking about race and access to care and I think I have.

69
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:41,710
Yeah. Like that cover story ends up in an area with access to screening answers.

70
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:46,280
So I just talk about what I think.

71
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:55,270
I don't know. I feel like I was just learning and I think that's a good idea.

72
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,870
It's nice to have everybody there. Guess that's brilliant.

73
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:14,990
It would be like, Oh, you're probably trying to make friends here.

74
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:35,620
Today is the other time as far as like, you know, the demographic factors, you might try to just put all the actions.

75
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:43,490
It's just like a long line. So like she actually is I mean, I don't know honey like you know,

76
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:54,960
the description of how we background population and outside the institute includes some reference point I think that's like moderate and that's

77
00:17:54,980 --> 00:18:04,790
out there like my like physiology presentation like the last two slides are like everything else first is just like an industry where this is.

78
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:30,610
As it stands now I think we're supporting the whole keeps your mind from traveling without having a certain amount of research just like you to.

79
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:39,360
Yeah, because I know I can take that throughout the summer.

80
00:18:42,390 --> 00:19:04,300
I don't think about it. All right. I really I mean, I was called, you know, how things are going to be like, let's tidy everything out.

81
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:14,820
That's okay. Because like I say, I think there's a lot of our colleagues on doing what we, you know,

82
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:22,339
just like putting out that information miles from where I'm presented to you.

83
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:37,620
Like what about the model has a definition for it wasn't like guidelines and how they know they get everything here.

84
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:41,340
Yeah we're citing I mean I can't speak for you guys,

85
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:57,400
but I could literally get up and find out my you have the question and you'll be referring to it as soon as possible.

86
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:11,880
We still have to help you have it. Yeah, there is a like I do think you really like the idea of like 99% education.

87
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:18,780
Less text is not a bad idea, but it's not because you can.

88
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:30,510
Yeah. So that makes sense. I think like socioeconomic status, even employment like clearance.

89
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:39,600
So yeah. So I mean, that's what I think.

90
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:50,510
So it's not like we have to read description to look like, come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

91
00:20:50,550 --> 00:21:00,900
I don't like, like companies are like, oh, let me know if any more of like anything.

92
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,959
Yeah. They said, well, I'm sure you won't, but I made my comment was wrong.

93
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:18,750
So you can see how they have, you know, you're showing that like they just don't know.

94
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,730
And I wrote some of the smaller stuff, so.

95
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:33,990
Okay, we will happen. But I think okay, maybe just like.

96
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:39,340
Yeah, but we I think there's a label.

97
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:41,020
Yes.

98
00:21:41,100 --> 00:22:04,850
I'm talking about the second and third time in a series that actually for the next quarter, sometimes I just feel like thought it was the literature.

99
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,760
I was surprised because I wanted to take it away.

100
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:15,920
So she really, if you like,

101
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:35,220
£160 as a factor for the insurance because like up until 2665 you get of this year that might

102
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:49,560
not have over there is like a child insurance and it's going to get something like oh yeah,

103
00:22:55,770 --> 00:23:01,590
this is not a good experience. Pick me up.

104
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:15,010
I was like, No, I know that it would be. Probably because of this witness lines as well.

105
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:29,620
They said, I questioned about something like that and he was like there was in the house like so like when I

106
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:35,560
talk about you were talking about social environment specifically say like a special education,

107
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,020
health care, access in social environment.

108
00:23:41,320 --> 00:24:00,940
I think she just wants to keep saying she wants to talk more about this program, but I want to make sure I like it would make sense.

109
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:14,310
I don't know. It's one of those things you're talking like I think I've heard that connected to social get you out of here so I

110
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:23,320
think you would just say like specifically I know what you're saying so so much better than just sort of a torrent.

111
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:42,850
You guys are highly populated like a little bit having to look after friends,

112
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:51,220
what your alternative is like the citation stuff because once you have, you have you size to go writer.

113
00:24:51,580 --> 00:25:00,190
My only concern is I think I'm going to work to switch and it seems to me like all that kind of stuff,

114
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:19,500
like talking about all the different trials and promotions or whatever, you can do something, I don't know, like something like this.

115
00:25:19,510 --> 00:25:27,420
I understand it's one thing, but I feel like whoever is presented to the you know, you need to find that, you know,

116
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:42,760
we just need to get everybody which, hey, you're like, now that everything's in their story here matters nothing about it or simplified.

117
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:58,600
So you just want to take a look at that. I wanted to make sure it was what was needed to be be that you want to be like

118
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:06,130
community capacity to finally share responsibility to competent themselves.

119
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:12,300
I mean, that's why you're the class.

120
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:34,690
I'm going to go to everything, I think on the test, she's like, Yeah, that is why this is like like, oh yeah, that's, I mean, that's how I did it.

121
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:52,780
My other refugees, like it's important to like this is what I do obviously believe is great.

122
00:26:55,160 --> 00:27:10,629
And one of the things for me because that's where I was kind around like more like actually gets by.

123
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:22,940
So I guess it's easier to pretend, you know or something like that.

124
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:33,550
Yeah. That's also, I don't know, show your model.

125
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:40,360
I wanted to show the update, but yeah, we're ready for it.

126
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:46,600
So yeah, it looks good.

127
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:52,090
We've got 50 last month and probably does another crossing still.

128
00:27:53,050 --> 00:28:04,410
That's really good. I mean, we're really having some fun.

129
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:13,650
Particularly when using social media and stuff like that.

130
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:37,770
And I think probably also so got some good feedback because it is like that.

131
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:45,790
So I think the way that you are thinking about it, that means that we do need to go on.

132
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:56,890
And I was like, No, no, I really hope that you can get it a MLA EPA automatically.

133
00:28:56,900 --> 00:29:07,830
Oh yeah. I was talking about councilors like I know it.

134
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:19,180
It's the description of my school council with a script that was meant to be experiences.

135
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:27,530
Specifically, make sure you choose to do all right now it's it makes you watch it.

136
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:31,970
You wanted to do it so we're kind of like, you know, I,

137
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:46,360
I think it's like in the process is get rid of this kind of part of your life, all the intervention stuff.

138
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:52,890
So that's 5 minutes huge chunk.

139
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,400
True, but there is no reason.

140
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:11,140
Why do you think you could still be able to change?

141
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:26,800
Yeah, I think there we have deviating and I'm going to go with this particular issue about the meters and them it is,

142
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:44,860
but it's not a one way street going up my heart person mine was always that this was not like focused on their going 2012.

143
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:57,549
So a mediator is something that you get into the judgment like I feel like I'm too much because it's so it's not something between the relationships.

144
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:01,060
Focus on the boss. Okay.

145
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:13,000
Yeah yeah. Okay. So instead then with you there was a problem that we have always get out and see.

146
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:17,709
Actually think it's a story of someone.

147
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:24,910
Maybe it's like a bathroom. Yeah, I think it's like.

148
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:30,970
I think it should be on this other side is absolutely.

149
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:38,170
Yeah, unfortunately I think we have to change but in the end I think we will put it in between intervention.

150
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:47,290
So we'd have an arrow that goes to there and then that policy change or I guess you could just put it in the middle of that.

151
00:31:47,290 --> 00:32:02,470
And to go out, I would say whether you add another one, you have another interview restructuring, it's like, yeah, that's going to be from scratch.

152
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:06,010
Yeah, yeah.

153
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:31,720
Well, you have this for me as well. Have an arrow go from here till I feel like we didn't intend to do something like that.

154
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:41,379
Yeah. What I would make would be the way I have a Superbad here with my teachers.

155
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:54,030
And especially your resignations. Because this happened, like when you have a girlfriend, make it sound like the actual text on slide.

156
00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:03,770
Slide. That was the thing I.

157
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:10,400
It's just like such a stupid thing to get upset about. That's why I didn't see that.

158
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:17,570
You know, I just don't understand why they didn't.

159
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:21,680
It doesn't really like everybody else. I just.

160
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:34,420
I feel like project to be like, I don't want to win a war in the United States of America.

161
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,730
He's so much less comfortable, so tired of change.

162
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:56,180
Yes. I mean, you know, I don't like like when I was there's absolutely nothing part of the reason it was all.

163
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,780
You just did your stuff that happened in seven.

164
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:03,650
I graduated. So I'm going to give speeches.

165
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:13,880
You just had Microsoft Word and you did it just like, you know, just somebody else aside from the office.

166
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,660
And they'll get a couple. Yeah. Yeah, I think I was.

167
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:29,150
I mentioned, like, better typing cause it had not be smart, connected by interpersonal enough to have a Nielsens make their own.

168
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:37,010
I'm not sure that I like how feel that I like.

169
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,860
I think that the main sections of society like a source of.

170
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:56,480
Right. No, they don't. No, I don't think that that at this point we're going to get to that point next.

171
00:34:56,870 --> 00:35:04,340
Nice to meet you and I'll see you tomorrow.

172
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:11,959
I'll go with you. Can you maybe if we write it because then we'll have that.

173
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:16,060
It just won't get confusing with the arrows since we already have things to connect.

174
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:21,919
Other are initially, you know, it's just not so explicit.

175
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:29,959
But if you look at it, I think you are writing a probably be much but then again I guess that maybe

176
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:35,990
in our intervention like just you put it all in the notes with the syllabus,

177
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,250
it's just I just love it back.

178
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:55,610
And I was so happy to hear about this the I gave lots of track when I said I absolutely business.

179
00:35:55,610 --> 00:36:06,830
Okay well it's hybrid with separating out like just like an exam because you can target patient need a drug or if

180
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:16,940
you just like having prescriptions is it okay to just keep like I like I know I read this study ever to tell you.

181
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:21,050
Okay. Does that make sense? You know what it's called. I'll go look it up.

182
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:27,660
I'm just glad I can.

183
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:32,540
Actually, I was there to help the textbook. Oh, we already removed some.

184
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:40,030
You still refer? Oh, yeah. I was like, oh, you know, I think.

185
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:46,040
Okay, does that help? Because our lab last again this week.

186
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:53,330
I'm like, what do I want to turn now?

187
00:36:53,490 --> 00:37:04,310
It seems like this. I think maybe, you know, maybe it's somewhere like I'm not sure the speaker like, oh, my thing is that's true.

188
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:10,040
Me I don't think we're headed in the right now.

189
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:17,749
I don't know. I think I'm just not sure that we're going to be it in Michigan.

190
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:23,690
We don't know what it is like fake.

191
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:46,430
So I called and I was like, you know, I didn't know nothing about overview of what our prospects for finding out which is how they.

192
00:37:46,460 --> 00:38:02,060
Sophomore So we're finding like what are you just like why are you asking me?

193
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:19,340
Because I. I just saw the title and I was like, Yeah, I think it's good because you can see what everybody else did.

194
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:27,460
On steel. And then, I mean, this is exactly what happened.

195
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:39,060
I was then I would also like to play this story inside.

196
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:45,140
Don't worry about that. One who decided but doesn't want to do it at the end.

197
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:52,730
I just think I get caught up.

198
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:57,049
No, I just. The problem has become this Beatitudes.

199
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:03,250
Please don't write those in 66% drop so self-satisfied people.

200
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:22,550
I was calling the schools, especially in terms of sexual contact with the lack of action.

201
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,290
So that is Michigan, where women are also declared.

202
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:38,090
Yeah, I think that I think that schools have registered because I don't think I have so much as a luxury.

203
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,810
I like them or a lot of their first.

204
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:48,140
I think it's like, Oh, I'm not into the eggs.

205
00:39:49,310 --> 00:40:03,220
It's not that there's just cause, you know, you're I was like, Oh, yeah, yeah.

206
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,220
Okay. It's a good idea that you've been informed by.

207
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:20,630
And then it goes in what you did, and then you have to look at that and I think it's like relevant.

208
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,850
Which one? Okay. I get my feeling this is about like opportunities and barriers rates are.

209
00:40:25,850 --> 00:40:38,509
The key is to understand why these five pack outlets from increased physical education opportunities and added age.

210
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:46,190
I think by design he's often staggering like there was a magic on other than later tonight.

211
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:55,190
Yeah. Like for example. Yeah. No, not at all. Actually put in some you can choose which ones procedures or to the sizes.

212
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:11,330
Thank you, Andy. That's a change in terms of two year anniversary of the meeting, a plan to hold the company waiting for me implement.

213
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:21,260
So it's funny, I tried to scroll up in the underside and they're like, Wait, don't tell me what they want to make around.

214
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,880
I like I'm aware of how they get people to participate.

215
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:47,740
I think they're like, I was, I'm going to say that they send socks and I'll change a little later.

216
00:41:48,260 --> 00:42:07,090
You can see that personal factors like that, like getting people experienced this problem and are like, Oh yeah, that's why I was.

217
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:12,280
I guess also now that we have so many people that kind of that she takes Vancouver

218
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:19,880
you see it's more like anything you do I think it will be one of those shows I think

219
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:28,429
that I think is we want it should put one around the people you know I think we could

220
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:35,180
do it but I don't think I don't think they should have to come or I think to keep it.

221
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:44,719
We should also put one around afterwards. I just don't want there to be any health insurance in terms of racial differences.

222
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:50,190
And what is especially important, we can put a title about your parents.

223
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:57,290
Some folks, I don't know.

224
00:42:57,290 --> 00:43:04,730
I mean, I think we can get that could expand beyond just to get rid of the stuff.

225
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:17,910
So it keeps explanations of trades and geographic location because as you said, that is absent.

226
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:29,850
We're all hoping to start the travel insurance plus comprehensive book area is one of those jobs are attracted a whole lot of money

227
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:48,750
and that's why people are the times when we're to publish these slides prevention is like understanding environmental factors.

228
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:56,330
So it's not people either have to say exactly.

229
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:04,800
I was like, I think I think that for all social actors and networks.

230
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:16,770
So yeah, so so like it. But it's also direct so opportunities or otherwise by having those providers this for the world.

231
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:24,130
And so is there a progression in the lifetime of right I'm so serious that I actually health education

232
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:35,040
actors can have participation but I feel like diseases like cholesterol education privilege was not at all.

233
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:49,630
I know, but it's not what I don't like that it's going to the this simplicity is the goal here is I mean, this is like really, really hard.

234
00:44:49,860 --> 00:45:00,800
But you just I'm like I would I would write like $0.15 on the right to use something like script and sort of superscript specifically.

235
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:06,540
And yet it also makes it easy to then.

236
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:12,060
But here's what it was like. This is what we're trying to do.

237
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:16,290
Here is how we want to do it later. We can use like cultural.

238
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:29,400
Yes, but we haven't seen anything similar at the same time.

239
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:39,300
And so therefore and it's really just like minor tweaks for both agricultural and resource,

240
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:56,380
but we have always had this perception problem like throwing out, for example, from the point of view goes, oh, let's see that they're messed up.

241
00:45:57,090 --> 00:46:14,200
And similarly, people who are aware of this folks do to help change whether or not the students or their child gets a good job.

242
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:27,420
Additionally, education, I think it's actually more educated about what's happening on their actual level

243
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:36,120
rather than just trying to go and find or I was going to make it like right there.

244
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,499
How do you think you're going to say?

245
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:50,670
I would say that they open it because they are like me and they are engaged in how we're going to show that basically they are not at risk,

246
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:16,740
whether it's on the front lines and how that's like insurance is playing out for the first time there.

247
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:24,410
You go to your go to school and it's also done.

248
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:34,700
I didn't do anything like I was going to change like the first couple outcomes.

249
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,120
And it doesn't have to be that I didn't do anything with this person making a different color.

250
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:42,510
I mean, as a no, I'm not going to Mississippi.

251
00:47:42,510 --> 00:47:48,059
I'm just gonna be like, That's too much.

252
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:54,710
And I didn't want to do that at all. Playing on what was once a lot of times now.

253
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:57,810
So yeah, I'm. I'm sorry.

254
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:02,820
I'm sorry. Okay.

255
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:17,189
You're actually very, very good at making it.

256
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:38,999
So we have three weeks before finals week to really be like you use your own words or I use so much.

257
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:52,410
So it's not like we have to tell you what we need to make the text, but I got to go to table right now.

258
00:48:53,790 --> 00:49:00,000
So I try it again and then for the cost, you know,

259
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:20,759
I think anything that's like that's very nice by the end expertise and come this is not right and you know I invalidated myself like how

260
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:32,130
would you out of shape which is basically really like another like you're like you know someone added to this very like all these different,

261
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:37,520
you know, how that works in Russian business.

262
00:49:37,550 --> 00:49:55,290
And I'm sure the terminology and I wrote like I'm here to talk about how, you know, not that I'm sorry.

263
00:49:55,290 --> 00:50:18,600
I was like, oh, I was like, don't confuse me. I'm gonna make us our dogs are also is that you know so I mean I wrote this one.

264
00:50:21,830 --> 00:50:40,830
This is this is not going to be so because that is so.

265
00:50:42,090 --> 00:51:05,980
Yeah, we had a discussion. Oh, you like this was just one of these two paragraphs that I have to give you an example of this.

266
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:28,170
And, you know, even communication or somebody who's like, that's how we're running all this information.

267
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:35,050
So you're the owner of like design.

268
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:39,160
It's not like I said that.

269
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:45,180
And if I did that, I didn't really see that.

270
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:53,430
It really tells it. Yeah, because like I had started this like a true paragraph or like like we had the three of,

271
00:51:54,500 --> 00:52:06,230
you know, I'm not saying this is what it's like, it's because it's like nothing else.

272
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:12,030
It's like, I don't care what she said.

273
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:19,380
She has been. So you need up there talks for like. Yeah I think so and so which should be easy.

274
00:52:20,490 --> 00:52:32,910
But that's how you qualify to talk about how to change the results to the southeastern area, Nicaragua.

275
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:48,210
I'll look through it again. And she was like, Oh yeah, I think we should just finish all the records.

276
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:55,480
There's a place you can try and you know that we actually like.

277
00:52:56,730 --> 00:52:59,910
The positive side is sometimes the.

278
00:53:09,650 --> 00:53:17,920
Hiding behind some, you know, moral support from the government.

279
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:29,460
Is the theory having not to do with this entire recovery?

280
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:55,170
Because I think I just think that it's it's like it's like, oh, we're allowed to like maybe they have very special effects.

281
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:06,300
And also, it's like like we don't have to get out of here.

282
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:13,230
I mean, it's a great principle.

283
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:33,300
Yeah. Yeah. Like, you know, there are something I don't think it just goes along with our decision.

284
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:40,270
But we do want like I don't think I did, but I think some of these titles are like 50 words.

285
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:52,780
I think that you talk to anybody asks me to write and they're like, and now we're all going to have more.

286
00:54:53,490 --> 00:55:03,830
And the rocks are not something that we're making.

287
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:28,050
And it's just I think that's just acting is like lifetime and that's why it's their way, because otherwise we're having to deal with it instantly.

288
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:51,530
I don't think I can ever like a sentence of 30 minutes from 2018 as our I guess you are outlined I

289
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:58,770
think for you is exactly what you're going to do with like making them more prominent helps to try to.

290
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:10,229
Yeah. Yeah. So like these channels are okay, that's our audience cards.

291
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:15,240
And they decided it was too often and that person is no longer.

292
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:19,320
And I guess it's family,

293
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:32,370
you know you guys when like know I haven't been any like through the semester like since we started like more like yeah, yeah, I know.

294
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,780
It's like, oh, no, no, that's okay. See you.

295
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:56,260
That probably nothing like, oh, okay. You know, but like, I guess, I mean, I mean, do they have like, oh, oh, oh, sure.

296
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:06,420
You do not need to like having some friends she works for.

297
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:25,230
Yeah, I think, you know, like listening, you have to make it kind of looks like it's so annoying sometimes.

298
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:43,050
It's almost like, you know, you look at how do you tell us exactly?

299
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:54,410
Either you can do we can actually just be really hard to be back next year versus vaccine.

300
00:57:54,750 --> 00:58:02,500
Yeah this is I don't just want to find do a little bit of counseling as long as it was like was in a guy like with.

301
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:09,560
I can say you were able to find a lot of our students on public school data.

302
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:16,249
So these are our chance to do that.

303
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:21,000
And maybe there's like similar, like, I'm sorry, I should know how to do that.

304
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:35,740
It's actually my children because like I was like, oh, I remember, as I say, in Michigan,

305
00:58:35,790 --> 00:58:52,470
76% of their produce right now that I see that you just don't like that doesn't do we have to wait on the revised.

306
00:58:52,620 --> 00:58:59,840
So I'm deleting her title track that we should be the original so yeah you know I was like I'm not leaving everything.

307
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:11,549
The original stories that you can copy here just from the size of the revised so much that all my trying to

308
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:27,360
probably like it because that was a way somewhere in the fact that actually seven new needs are just links.

309
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:30,660
You okay?

310
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:53,520
I, I was like, yeah, I just want to make sure I know how this act is going to be addressed that last before you can actually be here at this point,

311
00:59:53,900 --> 01:00:02,670
the 71.3 and if they're 2018, something like I mean, I guess you no, it's okay.

312
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:07,300
So what does it look like?

313
01:00:07,350 --> 01:00:12,929
You know, the exterior action and I was using earlier,

314
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:21,780
you actually want to maybe I'll just give you some of the actual and I can send and receive to back in time.

315
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:35,900
I wish that I could say the same about this construct without having to give up like in turn out because I was threatened.

316
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:54,479
So this is happening. I was just not against communication and not letting you feel like, Oh, I have never done that before or not like that.

317
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:02,270
So I guess you just got in trouble because I wanted to let you know.

318
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:15,930
I guess that's why I mentioned in my title a role that I think that if you say or no, no, that's still Michigan.

319
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:30,300
I think it's also I think there's a difference between you and Julia, but you can show them again.

320
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:36,690
There's a there's this website that tells you how to stigmatization and if you find it.

321
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:41,760
But we learned about it. So yeah, yeah, we just like, talk about it.

322
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:48,690
So that's what I was trying to hide, have to look at.

323
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:54,120
I think it's like, yeah,

324
01:01:54,120 --> 01:02:12,530
so each one of the individual because even accurate assessment sexual are trying to get this far from the max you know I just mentioned that

325
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:23,640
medical resources overall vaccination for these people 67% dollars hopefully 49% anything because it is the contract is a set of issues.

326
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:43,920
That was one of her current issues where I know I can't make it because like I don't think anybody cares about something because the

327
01:02:45,000 --> 01:03:03,870
registry acts like that and social networks and you describe it actually there are a lot of mental health and I believe and I'm kind.

328
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:17,549
So as long as I just explain what social support is doing, because that's just like losing formatting allocation because you feel free to review.

329
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:27,120
And if there's anything you think that's a huge change, go for it. But I think it would have to be with you.

330
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:40,010
I was like, Oh, but let me let me change something.

331
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:42,599
I think that's not as confusing.

332
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:57,600
Like what you're just like just because you can have allergic reactions and clothing, that wasn't something you should be,

333
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:18,750
you know, like and I heard that one before, the one that was good, but there was one out in the room that doesn't fit.

334
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:28,320
We were basically saying the same thing. I don't think you're acting totally wrong.

335
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:37,730
I think I like really shouldn't be required to go because we have that.

336
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:55,890
We're really talking about this. So it's better for people to think that just because someone else on your screen hours.

337
01:04:55,890 --> 01:05:01,020
But I do think that we could be like, say, that's what she was saying.

338
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:08,720
He was 18 years old. I was like, I typed out, No, no, no, sorry.

339
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:14,100
I didn't even know what like, I don't know.

340
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:26,610
I don't want to say. It's like it's always saying that they go into a little, you know, you want the break.

341
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:40,410
And I wonder under something that would go under that might know, I don't want this high resolution, I'd rather do that so much information.

342
01:05:41,010 --> 01:05:49,979
So she goes on to tell, which I talk about, and that's why I'm like knowing where to put.

343
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:58,470
A lot of times it's like you didn't have meeting.

344
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:06,600
The more days someone's been told that it creates a crisis in which they are more likely to engage in.

345
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:11,940
I think, as I was saying, maybe instead of putting in the demographic box.

346
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:21,599
So it's never going to stop.

347
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,690
And once you never like before, you will think like this.

348
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:28,190
I got it from right here. I mean, you have so many people. See you.

349
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:34,740
All right. I'm talking to me, and I'm scared.

350
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,770
But let me get me to tell you something.

351
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:50,720
You're one of them. So it's the difference between Series seven and all directly impacts on our relationship between the two classes.

352
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:56,240
Right now, we don't know it yet because all vaccinations do keep an eye on it.

353
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:04,860
But I wasn't really like starting right at now I'm pretty fast.

354
01:07:04,860 --> 01:07:08,310
Yeah. I mean, it's,

355
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:34,470
it's general it's just all sort of like recommended that you're not recommended baffling who's just like I go into combat or patients staff, right.

356
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:45,420
I'm like, it's just not right. I mean it's like I think you have to go through it together and I don't mean to be sorry to keep, you know.

357
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:54,270
Yeah, right. We got we got a lot of challenges to get through.

358
01:07:55,170 --> 01:08:00,990
Everything else is not do anybody would have to help me out the way.

359
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:09,850
Yeah. This is the presentation. I think they just want to get it done.

360
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:32,070
I think that. Yeah. I have. Can I take your phone science class?

361
01:08:32,690 --> 01:08:42,450
If you have to. You know, that's actually tomorrow night.

362
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:47,770
So is it working? Yes. In theory, yes.

363
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:51,490
In practice. Thank you so much.

364
01:08:54,550 --> 01:08:58,000
I think you could just take that bottom line. I know.

365
01:08:58,870 --> 01:09:03,580
We all do.

366
01:09:05,030 --> 01:09:11,260
Yeah, I mean, it just makes sense to find something that makes sense.

367
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:19,120
Yeah, like genetic and social engagement.

368
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:25,750
That's a big. You can elaborate whoever is presenting that and you can use incentives like,

369
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:34,050
like, um, let's say in particular you co-morbidity with psychological disorders.

370
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:47,110
I was like, what are the high risk specific topics when you say like, this is one of the reasons I focus on this group.

371
01:09:47,890 --> 01:10:06,340
Eating disorders are really high in adolescents and like I think that we're not learning to really go in that because it goes against everything else.

372
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:14,560
And I sympathize with high school over at the same time.

373
01:10:15,970 --> 01:10:19,980
All right. Everybody said I should make more.

374
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:28,000
Let's go through that. There's not a lot of time.

375
01:10:33,460 --> 01:10:37,000
There is a lot of time. And then there's always a lot to lose.

376
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:48,250
Do you think we should make like these to their own paragraph? And it's kind of like everything should be covered from the get go.

377
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:57,610
It doesn't really matter if recurrent and persistent binge eating is defined as rapid consumption, and I like that.

378
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:14,120
If somebody asked, I think it would be relevant. Somebody asked specifically and I wrote I think on these photos.

379
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:18,160
But yeah, you want to trim. That's just that. Yeah, I'm just making a note.

380
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:22,020
I don't know how you just do this.

381
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:33,850
Well, that's a blank. We can plug it into whatever is not going to care about anybody I really like.

382
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:39,100
I will take that as a back up for you because it looks like you're.

383
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:43,000
Yeah I think it's time to go back a second. I am.

384
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:51,340
Self was just going to say yeah I like oh yeah I can work out no.

385
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:57,180
Final thought. Right.

386
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:02,290
It's like. It's like this one time over the weekend.

387
01:12:03,160 --> 01:12:06,670
Yeah. I'm happy to it. At ten numbers words.

388
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:26,550
I guess I think you can also get after it as part of the distribution and be encouraging has its own whole very upstream.

389
01:12:26,590 --> 01:12:31,150
This really target six times more than 500.

390
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:35,980
She can't look at the screen. I think she was like I said, that's great.

391
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:43,240
So I was pleased with it.

392
01:12:43,630 --> 01:12:55,240
It's a place. There's nothing backwards. I'm a big fan of the music.

393
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:00,700
You know, I did a lot of different population centers like this.

394
01:13:03,390 --> 01:13:20,020
And I think it was like there's been a lot of people that I just and I tried to find this one that,

395
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:34,239
you know, I don't think you can just do that one to wait in line with your site model.

396
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:44,640
Just for one thing, we have like a struggling outcome for society.

397
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:49,650
You're right. You're trying to scare people.

398
01:13:49,650 --> 01:13:55,460
And this is why it's important to me. You know, it's not.

399
01:13:55,470 --> 01:13:58,750
Yeah, that's in the notes or whoever takes it. You know what?

400
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:06,040
I have no choice but to do that.

401
01:14:06,250 --> 01:14:14,530
But I'm sure if we like work for people who have welcomed by insurance companies like I want to probably.

402
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:22,160
Is this Jerry Mathers? I think that's like I wasn't sure.

403
01:14:22,270 --> 01:14:29,450
Didn't want to be like everybody else.

404
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:47,380
But I do think that first noticed it wasn't like it was like a Z use that would feel a little bit like it's just like know it's good.

405
01:14:48,610 --> 01:14:53,640
I think we should be doing that.

406
01:14:55,270 --> 01:14:57,460
We feel about the same thing.

407
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:11,229
I think based on our model we should be uppercase or and and we have a bunch of I could read about this being where you know I prefer

408
01:15:11,230 --> 01:15:21,940
uppercase and like what you have like when you have the bullet like the colon and then the next thing like I think it's weird.

409
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:26,440
I know this is just so, like, wait a minute. Oh, I thought you heard about this.

410
01:15:27,790 --> 01:15:34,300
I like it, but it's not going to make sure it's that number.

411
01:15:35,020 --> 01:15:46,170
And so I don't know. But I do think it's really elements of different theories.

412
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,430
Yeah, I'll give you something that says like.

413
01:15:48,490 --> 01:15:56,120
So I think I could write about a lot I was trying to write about this is that we might as well be satisfied.

414
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:06,350
Yeah, there's so many consequences and the impacts of the externality and then really know.

415
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:10,770
So I think that's all I had tried to create.

416
01:16:10,940 --> 01:16:24,340
I had written about 99.99 white background and I could do this Middlesex student in one sense of all because, you know, it's it's great.

417
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:38,110
Is it just me or is it like a versus like what it is a score was that why is a screenshot anybody make that

418
01:16:38,110 --> 01:16:52,810
that I can write it's from the south specifically Jimmy Michigan so obviously just copy the slide down so.

419
01:16:56,690 --> 01:17:06,100
I know this is going to be specific videos and that's okay.

420
01:17:06,130 --> 01:17:12,630
You can change variety. That makes sense. All right.

421
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:23,710
I was actually going to say, because I think there's just a lot of them saying, you know, everything works.

422
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:29,070
Why helping them?

423
01:17:32,790 --> 01:17:39,020
Yes, because this is why, you know, the U.S. Supreme Court has put it that way.

424
01:17:39,040 --> 01:17:44,980
Please. And they did anybody else.

425
01:17:45,400 --> 01:17:55,420
It was bad intervention right now.

426
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:04,160
I mean, we talk about that. These are looking like they're not things the way that do.

427
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:09,130
They all do. They all look similar. If you get the instruction.

428
01:18:09,250 --> 01:18:24,190
I don't know. I just don't know what to do about this.

429
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:30,220
I mean, I assume that nobody should write about these two.

430
01:18:31,630 --> 01:18:36,780
I think just kind of we already did. So I would be laying it out now.

431
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:47,900
So I like about two years or so because I think that's kind of Sydney what you're talking about from this.

432
01:18:48,490 --> 01:19:01,090
So from part of what I write to the individual actors for the provider highlights on and say, okay, I will make that tomorrow.

433
01:19:02,810 --> 01:19:06,850
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

434
01:19:07,180 --> 01:19:14,910
It's a little novel project so I'm going to place I don't want to remember, just did something like that.

435
01:19:16,540 --> 01:19:24,739
I was just like, I'm sorry, but at least you have something.

436
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:27,639
I do this. Let's get right to it.

437
01:19:27,640 --> 01:19:38,070
So real quick, that opens tomorrow is something you want to talk about you just like you're all covered because we're all doing our interview like,

438
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:41,940
you know, through our staff.

439
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:50,350
Right. If you want to do background as a model.

440
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:54,160
Okay. All right. Let's think about this.

441
01:19:54,220 --> 01:19:59,910
So you know what I think is different because we didn't have a background.

442
01:20:00,310 --> 01:20:14,090
And then Sarah right now coming into the two actors target practice and then ultimately you guys can always write about science fiction.

443
01:20:15,940 --> 01:20:29,739
We might even want to have outside your credit is that you didn't write because I feel like she has become more and then add what they call citations.

444
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:40,260
You might not have time yet, but it's just different.

445
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:44,379
Critique outcomes outcome. Maybe need one more there.

446
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:56,050
I think I respect them. I think we should tomorrow night just at least to make sure we're good.

447
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:09,850
It's fine if he doesn't like after reading are not alone and professor like I don't know I will never forget that.

448
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:19,930
I think it really is funny to me.

449
01:21:20,650 --> 01:21:25,630
I'll make it. I mean, I'm like, I don't want any of us.

450
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:30,280
So I think it's really hard to make how we do that.

451
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:49,320
In the minority stress, you're having a relationship, we're good friends and then know if you have anything about me.

452
01:21:56,250 --> 01:22:23,130
But I do want to tell you, I told my next guest that you were going to make it a key resource for any convention.

453
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:30,389
Does that make those decisions? Like what is the best way?

454
01:22:30,390 --> 01:22:48,120
I guess I'm going to get it. We want it to be able to be interpreted as a statement on how we want to do the club.

455
01:22:48,550 --> 01:22:52,280
So congratulations. Really.

456
01:22:52,530 --> 01:22:58,190
So I'm going to be someone I don't know.

457
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:11,500
Well, you. That's fine, but it's not working for 515, that's all.

458
01:23:15,510 --> 01:23:18,760
It's just like radio. I know.

459
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:35,169
They were like, I didn't even really you know, I didn't apparel, didn't have something.

460
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:49,659
You're like, Oh, yeah, I'm going to do everything I can do.

461
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:55,840
Like, try to make, like, you know, you can fix up.

462
01:23:56,710 --> 01:24:03,220
Oh, I incorporated What's Good.

463
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:14,330
You did this amazing work. This was supposed to be kind of terrible because I love.

464
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:20,610
But I think the reality that, you know, I don't mind.

465
01:24:20,650 --> 01:24:25,060
I mean, it should still be the first thing that was nice.

466
01:24:27,060 --> 01:24:40,450
So yeah. I mean, I guess you could just promise me was probably yeah it was like rather heartbreaking if think I'm actually

467
01:24:41,730 --> 01:24:55,720
I feel better but apparently about Thanksgiving it's about what were you able to carry with me like,

468
01:24:56,140 --> 01:24:58,410
you know the worst thing.
