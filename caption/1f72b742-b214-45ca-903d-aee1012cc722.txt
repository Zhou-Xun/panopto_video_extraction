1
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Okay, Good morning, everyone. let's start so for your first review the

2
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The quiz for lecture 7 as usual.

3
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So there are 4 questions the the first one is about to sample key tasks. Right? so?

4
00:06:46,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Truths Every I so you think it's good about to zoom first one is a study wish to estimate the probability of sexual intercourse in us teenager a 13 to 15 so is there anyone want to

5
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:19,000
tell us whether you think 2 Samo git has applied to this case or not, and why

6
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I said that the 2 sample t-test did not apply to the first portion.

7
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Because it was difficult like it's not describing a probability it's more comparing a couple of means and so that was the first component of the question that kind of scared me away from it.

8
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But then also, like when you're talking about sexual intercourse of us teenagers like, Are we dividing this up, male versus female?

9
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Are we looking at more like or socioeconomic status like all of these different things?

10
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If there's more than 2 variables then you can't use the 2 sample t tests.

11
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So that's what swept me away from that answer thank you very much, Sarah.

12
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah, you're absolutely right. So there are 2 signature. that was will apply.

13
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
One. Is that essentially you're comparing 2 group mean by your person to have 2 group here.

14
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
We are looking at the Us. teenager age 13 to 50.

15
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Only at one group is Unclear, which 2 group are defined right.

16
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:26,000
The second signature is that the 2 group are usually defined by a binary variable, and then all comments are continuous, variable.

17
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So 2 sample data, essentially studying the association between a binary and a continuous variable.

18
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Here. Not only we don't. have the binary variable for the 2 group definition also the outcome is the probability of sexual intercourse, so the probability is, something it sounds like a continuous, but it's actually if

19
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:56,000
you think of the probability it's for the whole population actually at the individual level? is, i'll binary variable because they have either have it or they don't have it right? So we'll actually talk about starting today

20
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
we're gonna talk about. How do we deal with binary alcohol.

21
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
But so far we have been dealing with a continuous outcomes.

22
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So from both aspects. If this item does not apply i'm gonna give that the file plot here any question

23
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Thank you very much. the second one is a study. wishes to compare mean body masking.

24
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That Vmi between us children was parentborn. Us us us children was immigrant patterns.

25
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:45,000
So anyone think this who's on with you has a lot applies here

26
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I said, Yes, because is it compared to different groups?

27
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Thank you. crazy. Thank you very much. Yeah, exactly. They compared to a group.

28
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
And not only that I compare the blue group meet management on Bmi.

29
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
So that's the setting to Sample Keith as was designed to apply.

30
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you very much, and the third is that the study wishes compared.

31
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Average duration of President Pretty, and sentences between non-hispanic and Hispanic man, age 15 to 25, or arrested for now.

32
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Costa takes possession anyone I picked this one, too, because we have 2 different populations, the Hispanic and Hispanic. and we're measuring a a continuous variable with the

33
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
duration of prison settings. Okay, Thank you very much.

34
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Andrew. Yeah, you are exactly right. So no matter how long the sign is is you just need to identify.

35
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There are 2 groups here being compared right, and then the outcome is the average of the variables.

36
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The original prisoner sent us that the duration is a continuous variable, so that tool signature give you the hand that to some of people is a good one to apply here and finally, the study wishes to assess the potential impact

37
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
of our employment on the diverse race in married couples.

38
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So anyone. This is a little tricky for this one I said that it's not comparing population mean of 2 groups because they're just talking about the unemployment on divorce rates in married puppies so it's

39
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,000
not comparing 2 groups at all it's just talking about unemployment of divorce rate.

40
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Thank you very much. Yeah, you are right. This is this 2, Sam.

41
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Okay, let me go over you know the reasoning right So first of all, let's look at a variable here, right?

42
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
One of the variable is unemployment so it doesn't spell our community.

43
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:55,000
But essentially, you know, the impact of our employment on diverse rate.

44
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So there's a high employment there's a diverse rate.

45
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:05,000
There are 2 variables we talk about you know unemployment. that's that's a binary variable right?

46
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So someone is employed some ways unemployment right?

47
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
And the diverse rate, which is also a binary variable.

48
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Someone is divorced. So you sign right here we are studying, associated with the 2 binary variables.

49
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
So it is actually you can. You can form it as a tool group.

50
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Comparison. but we're not comparing the the the mean measurement, who we're actually comparing the the mean rate into Google.

51
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:38,000
That's a binary person's binary comparison which will require not if you're going to talk about actually in today's lecture high school.

52
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So 2,003 that was not designed here, but they are actually very much like I'll talk about the high school test.

53
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Is the extension again from 2,000 he has to the binary outcomes. So this one is the trickiest one.

54
00:12:50,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But nevertheless, who's i'm looking at any question

55
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So you can think about. If you want to design a study to study this right you you are going to have a group of people who are.

56
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:19,000
How often How do you look at it you're going to have a group of people who are employed?

57
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And then you look, you know. you look at some of them will be I important.

58
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Some of them will not right I mean after a while i'm able to see after a while, whether there are divorce rate in the 2 group or the same or not. right?

59
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
So I mean it doesn't spell out but to design a study like this.

60
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You need to have 2 group of people One group will have, So the unemployment is the exposure.

61
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The divorce is outcome. so you need to have an exposure group.

62
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:52,000
With you know we'll go on unemployment the other group who and then look at a divorce rate on the toolku.

63
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
That's the best way or the only way to design the study.

64
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
So in the end we do have to just how come we study or not continuous.

65
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'll comp a binary album

66
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Okay. second question: a nova analysis variance is appropriate with data with which of the following characteristics who's every responsibility to be correct?

67
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Number one. Every subject can only belong to one of the groups being compared.

68
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Is that correct?

69
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
: that was correct. Yeah, Yeah. also, right? This is correct, Right?

70
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So the group are exclusive to each other. Right? second.

71
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:52,000
There must be 20 subjects in each group. Well, I never saw that in class right there.

72
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You just need a group to be large enough for the central limit.

73
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Theorem to apply. If the group size are small, then you need to have normal assumption for the for the population, which is hard to check for a small group, anyway. Right?

74
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So I deal with You have a large group of not really you know you don't require to have at least one.

75
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:23,000
If you have at least 20 that the normal assumption is not crucial anymore, because, Saturday met theorem will kick him right by. There's nothing saying that you cannot apply it to less.

76
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You know, smaller groups. Third one, the all home measured on each subject must be continued.

77
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Is that correct?

78
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I think that's correct, because you can only compare to like me.

79
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
So it has to be like a continuous variable. Thank you.

80
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Exactly right. This is an extension of 2 sample, Github.

81
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So those schools are either, and Nova they work out continuous outcome.

82
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Finally, the number of groups being compared must be 3 again.

83
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I never said that right? The number of groups candy, auditory 3, 4, or 5, actually, even.

84
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Can you 2 There's Nothing. Stop! you from applying a number to 2 group, although in 2 groups, you can actually do But all the formula, all the math book.

85
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, why Will Mobile also applies when you have 2 groups, and you will easily got the same key value.

86
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay as a t-shirt which is all very comforting You know there's there's some more technical detail to do with that, because there are different versions to sample tasks.

87
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,000
One of the version is equivalent to one way or Noah the otherwise. No.

88
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So I don't wanna go that you know deep down in in in the detail.

89
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But the version we've had going class somehow equilibrium.

90
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
So you can pipe through an arbitrary number of groups as well.

91
00:16:51,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Greater than you call that, too. Any question here

92
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Okay, number 3. Which of the following statement describe about veronic fraction?

93
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Who's that real response you believe to be correct this might be a little tricky.

94
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Let's go over the one by one number one a bonnie corruption. we'll always make it harder prejudice.

95
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Now anyone wants to answer this

96
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Let me think that's true, because the correction will always just make the p-value larger.

97
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Yeah, You're right I mean there there are 2 ways to do the Bonfrani production right?

98
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
One way is the multiplied the pio by the number of tests that way.

99
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The P might be larger, making a harder right. The other way is to keep the key value.

100
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But divide the the cut off by the number of tests, then the color will be lower.

101
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
That is also harder. Right? So either way. this is correct.

102
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So essentially the bomb or the correction will lower the pipeline error rate per test.

103
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Right. When you lower the hypervisor, remember the power also.

104
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Drop everything else equal right when the power drops you you know it's harder for you to reject the now.

105
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Okay, So that's the exactly what's going on number 2 about warning correction is only a property with continuous data.

106
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Anyone

107
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:45,000
So this is incorrect right? The Bavaroni correction was designed to handle multiple testing.

108
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:55,000
So whenever you are running 101 half, you need to think about module testing and bonfarnic correction is one way to deal with that. It has nothing to do with the type of data has nothing to do with the type.

109
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Of test. Right So far we run about running correction for for the opposed Hot Pass, because there we have multiple paths.

110
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
But my finally, crafts and apply everywhere, we're not going to do multiple paths.

111
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Okay, So you apply with all sorts of data also sometimes it's a more general approach.

112
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Sure about proning correction limits the number of false problems.

113
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Finding anyone. I said that this one was also correct, cause you reduced the type.

114
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
One error and type one error is a false positive.

115
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
At least That's how I remembered it yeah exactly you're right?

116
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Yeah, the whole point of ironic production is control type of error.

117
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Rate to limit a number of possibilities perfect. Finally, about running corrections should be used when most people have all the paths are being done with the same data.

118
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Yup that's exactly the point right if you run different tests on the same data.

119
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:59,000
And you'll you know if you don't do any correction. Then you have a multiple testing issue.

120
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Then you you place the type of error. So the harmonic question was designed here.

121
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:09,000
So this is correct. a follow-up question will be that What if you do add multiple tasks with different data, right?

122
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That's more controversial right? So if you run multiple tests with the same data of parity you need to control for you, right?

123
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
But if you run different paths with with different data, you still have a multiple testing issue.

124
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,000
How to control it or not, there's some controversial controversy right?

125
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Because, for example, think about the the other example they're not really the same data, because that's different caller for javascript right?

126
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Say, you know you you do 20 study and only pick the ones that gonna make them publish.

127
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,000
There's also a mon multiple testing issue. but now, you give you think about, you know, 20 people in the same lab doing 20 study.

128
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Only one of them got a key value at some point or 5 That's also a particle testing usual in the end to extreme right.

129
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,000
20 different lab doing 20 study independently aligned with each other.

130
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
There's also a multiple passing usual but It sounds kind of silly to do about browning correction to do with pass.

131
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You know you didn't do other people did and you didn't mean you are aware you're not you know there right?

132
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:23,000
So that's why, Bob ronnie correction is is not only about Friday project, but the multiple testing issue is is this prevalent?

133
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Well at different level. So the in A on a minimal.

134
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:33,000
If you analyze your data many times you need to keep that in mind because the module has an issue is definitely there.

135
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
And then, usually people don't think about multiple testing issue beyond the particular experiment you're doing right.

136
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So if you have experiment, one you have the experiment, 2 you don't consider this as multiple testing, and you you also don't consider modeling testing to do with other people, you know so far.

137
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,000
But not with the last There is multiple testing going on and that's part of the reason why many of the publications you know their P.

138
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Value do not really reflect their, you know, overall reliability.

139
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Because you think about this, this publication bias right if only if only findings with pivotal lesson point or 5, can be published. The all the publication will have people.

140
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
That's not far regardless whether they're they're true or false right?

141
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So that's the other problem to to deal with it's kind of controversial weather.

142
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
We should control for those or not and does it's not clear?

143
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:38,000
How do we even control of that? But the bottom line that if you are doing multiple tests in the same study, especially on the same day, you definitely need to control for that at the bottom line?

144
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Oh, not doing this. We just make things worse. you know If you you do this. The problem is not 40 going away.

145
00:22:45,000 --> 00:23:01,000
That's that's the current situation anything here

146
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Okay, number 4. A study has enrolled 100 each of us.

147
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Why long is planning children, black no he's been the children, and his many children.

148
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Each child complete the past, assessing their general level of Z anxiety.

149
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The test give a score from 0 which it's no I'm sorry to the study used analysis of variance to compare the mean level of value in each racial group.

150
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
They will use a pivotal 3 point or 5 that defies the new significance.

151
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Which of the following statement is correct, because every response we believe to be correct.

152
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Number one for determining which pairs of racial groups differ from each other.

153
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
The study should use a pivotal press from 0 point 0 1 7.

154
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Anyone for this one. I said that it would be correct if the post hawk test where you use the bonfarni correction by dividing your like point 0 5, the p-value threshold by since that's the number of

155
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:24,000
comparisons between each of the groups that you have. So that would give you a value through about 0 point 0 1 7, which you can use to determine which of the 3 actually differ from each other.

156
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Thank you very much that's that's perfectly correct right you're doing 3 task here in the same study your control for multiple testing.

157
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
That's why that's what you do thank you very much for the next one.

158
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
If the data produce a pivotal 0 point, 0, 2, 3 for the Anova.

159
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
The study can conclude that all free racial group differ with each.

160
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:53,000
With respect to I mean i'm sorry rather wrong anyone

161
00:24:53,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I said this was incorrect because we don't know the relationship unless we do the prepared t tests.

162
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
So I said this was false. Thank you very much. Yeah, you are right.

163
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
So with this queue by a we can reject the No.

164
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
But the knowledge is that all 3 group are the same right.

165
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
If we reject it now, we can only conclude that at least 2 of them are not equal.

166
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,000
But we still don't know whether all 3 are not equal or not right, that.

167
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,000
But to make that conclusion we need to do the post office.

168
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:30,000
So this is incorrect, You know if the payoff produce a pivot is 0 point 1 5 for the Nova.

169
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:40,000
That's that you can conclude that all 3 group or it's the same with Bracket meeting anyone

170
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah, I think it's wrong as Well, it's the same principle, from the last assumption, we can all say that all 3 groups are different.

171
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
At least 1, 2 of them might be different. but oh, not all of them like 3.

172
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Thank you. Yeah, this is wrong. you are right. But you know, if you look at this, this is the key value is locked.

173
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,000
1.0 5 right? So actually we failed to reject them all, so fail to reject them all.

174
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
Doesn't means proof at all right the now says all 3 group are the same.

175
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I would fail to reject that. But we cannot conclude the now is the true.

176
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:26,000
We just failed to reject it so that's the argument here, right there's a lack of evidence rejecting them, which is not the same as saying that no is true last one.

177
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
If the data produce a pivot 0 point, 0, 2, 3 for the noba, then the study can compute that at least 2 racial group.

178
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Therefore, with respect to me, this is the definition of rejecting them all in this case right?

179
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
So this is correct. So yeah, I mean the as you see it's very subtle, right?

180
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
We're wording difference by very subtle so a lot.

181
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Just be careful what what now? what alternative you are putting there right, and what key value greater or less than point or 5, meet in this page each case right?

182
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:04,000
So plus. you are used to this kind of thinking is you know it's kind of natural, but for people who are not familiar with this will find this pretty tricky.

183
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:23,000
To pop up alright any questions for this quick, deployable

184
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Okay.

185
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
So today we're gonna start a new lecture 8 we are not going to finish everything.

186
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:55,000
So the good news is that there's nothing due tomorrow. or this weekend, or even on Monday both the quiz and and the project, I believe, will be due on Tuesday, so both do on Tuesday.

187
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Is that right? yeah, both, Do you want to? So you can have a relax?

188
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:12,000
The weekend, and now let's move on to lecture 8

189
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
So so far, you, you know, if we do a quick recap what we learn right.

190
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Besides all the introduction, and, you know, basic fundamental principles.

191
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,000
We learned one sample team has co sample key test and an overview.

192
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
And they basically what some of it has apply on 1 one population.

193
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,000
2 samples you have to apply on 2 population. a nova will apply, you know.

194
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,000
2 or more population, are you all these cases? The outcome is continuous, Right?

195
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,000
The exposure, our categorical Av. either, but all comments continuous.

196
00:28:50,000 --> 00:29:00,000
So now let's think about what if we have you know categorical outcome, which include binary or more than 2 to category. right?

197
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:08,000
So how do we do? is kind of garbage outcome It turns out that it's it's quite similar to Tv has, but because the nature of the outcomes, you know the formula will be different.

198
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:13,000
So we're gonna have different kind of paths So today we start dealing with binary Icon.

199
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Yeah, there are many vamp hold on your Alcom.

200
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
But essentially we think about whether somebody has who's going to develop a particular disease.

201
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Or now that's binary, if some wise are going to be cured by the particular treatment or not, that's binary, right?

202
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So basically when the question is yes, no question. and the answer is binary.

203
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,000
So previously we learn all sorts of continuous outcome, like a family income.

204
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:55,000
Bmi. age, healthy advantage, and so on and so forth Now let's look at category oracle i'll call categorical variable right like leaving in poverty.

205
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,000
The answer is, Yes, no the weight itself, you know, if you imagine the way this continues.

206
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:12,000
But if you categorize the weight into a different group like underweight, normal, overweight, now you have categorical outcome or categorical, you know variable, right or general, how if you measure, in you know sort

207
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,000
of like or score, right or or you know this kind of category, or fair, good, excellent, and you have categorical.

208
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Oh, some you know this in this case it's very clear they're categorical.

209
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Sometimes it's not so clear especially when we talk about for example, divorce rate, right divorce rate itself is continuous.

210
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
But that's the continuous parameter for the population in that formulation.

211
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Everything goes, individual actually is either divorced or not exactly a binary measurement.

212
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:54,000
So think about those So, for let's you know first focus on binary variable, because that's the simplest categorical case.

213
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Well by the variable right. we can essentially define a proportion of some people, you know, fill out one group versus the other for categorical variables.

214
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:15,000
The same thing you've had divide. the proportion of the population resizing each category. But that all of those you know, for pocket will add up to one.

215
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
Oh, you Saturday! Think about the individual in the population.

216
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:25,000
I think about a measurement on the individual if the measurement is categorical, then we're dealing with categorical outcome.

217
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
However, the parameter of interest is actually continues distinguished.

218
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:34,000
The all call and the parameter. they have a different thing.

219
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:46,000
So remember with continuous outcome. Very often the the parameter of interest is the mean is the mean of the population right?

220
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
So for categorical outcome. Typically, the problem of interest is the proportion.

221
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,000
The population of a particular category. So these are different.

222
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Parameter, based on different outcome right So for example, If the outcome is overweight versus not overweight, then the problem of interest is a proportion of people in the population who are overweight right in this case i'll

223
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:24,000
call it binary, while parameter is continuous the proprietor is a special continuous parameter, because it's always between 0 and one

224
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,000
So remember previously the sample mean is denoted X Bar.

225
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
Hello, I mean it's denoted meal now we use different.

226
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
No! patient distinguished the case right now.

227
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:46,000
The sun Hope proportion. we call the p ha you can see that the change of no paycheck is sort of a arbitrary.

228
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
But that was that's what what you know got stopping history.

229
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:55,000
People start using this, and you know they got use it. so please stand for pro proportion.

230
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
So. P. is the population. proportion on the hot stands for estimate.

231
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:05,000
So women use the sample to ask me the population proportion.

232
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:10,000
We just put a hat on top of It so P. hat is the sample estimate of the population proportion.

233
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Therefore it's a sample proportion so he had it assembled for project, and P.

234
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:21,000
Is a population proportion. So in that sense you can say X bar equals mu hat right?

235
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:27,000
Just X Bar is so. So why did you so people stick to it? But it's actually the same thing as new Ha!

236
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,000
We'll ask Bar to to to with mute therefore X. bar equals new hat.

237
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:45,000
Yeah, let me know if you have any questions. Okay.

238
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:52,000
So now with the question, you mind, we want to study the population proportion.

239
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,000
How do we design the study? right? So with some hope and subjects from the population?

240
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:04,000
Ideally a simple, random sample and that's the same as people.

241
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:17,000
But now, from each subject in our sample, we do a measurement right, either as a question or manager something. and then the measurement subject I we call the Xi.

242
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Just like that before, except that previously Xi is a continuous startup

243
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:34,000
But now Xi is binary right. Suppose we have a particular category, then, for that category we can define.

244
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Xi. We use 0 and one to call it so. we use 0 one for coding purposes.

245
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,000
These are not numerical numbers. polynomial you'll see actually weekend.

246
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,000
Finally, is a special case we can. We can deal with binary like categorical.

247
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,000
All we can do is binary like continuous. It turns out that they give equivalent mathematical outcome.

248
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Medical, you know. result, but nevertheless, just bear with me. now.

249
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
We use 0 one to code right? What means the subject? I is in that particular category a 0 means. It is not.

250
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:12,000
This is called an indicator variable. okay for mathematical community. and then you can define a different variable for different categories.

251
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,000
Right you have Xi y. I have zi So on, so forth, so supposedly.

252
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
Now the management is general health. Now we have 4 categories, poor, fair, good, or excellent.

253
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
No, for the accident category we can define is Xi. right?

254
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
So Xi will be one if and only give subject. R.

255
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Is excellent, otherwise next time will be 0. So this outside does not distinguish poor fair versus good.

256
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
So distinguished that you need to define other variables. right?

257
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:59,000
One variable like this, only distinguish one category from the rest

258
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Similarly, you have group differently. right, for example, if you group 4 versus and fair in one group, and good or access you another, you got a different Xi right?

259
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:16,000
So your calling scheme actually matters. you have to choose your calling scheme.

260
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Based on your the goal of this study.

261
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
And truth of specific holding scheme will allow you basically that optimize.

262
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Right Here we have a four-level categorical manager using a calling scheme.

263
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
We actually collapse them into a two-level category for outcomes.

264
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Basic binary outcomes.

265
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:53,000
So the key is, You need to think about the coding scheme, which, because the coding scheme determining how to analyze the data, right, Hi: Daley, you need to think about this and decide on this before

266
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,000
you'll see your data, and the reason is because you can think about.

267
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:08,000
There are many different calling students, and each one will give you a different summary, and each one will give you a different p value in the end, right.

268
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:14,000
If, after a collect your data, you look at the data and you decide, Oh, I want to do this way.

269
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:29,000
You might be unconsciously or consciously choosing the calling scheme to give you a so good, good and fine. And that's biased because you you have this multiple passing in translated by gene once you think about different

270
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,000
way of analyzing data, even if you don't do those right?

271
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:51,000
But after you see the data you're already, buying so ideally, if you decide on your audio scheme before you collect your data, and that's unbiased, because whatever decision, you made was not depend on the data yourself.

272
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,000
Yeah, So what i'm trying to say is that it's multiple testing issue.

273
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:03,000
It's prevailing it's everywhere and I have to be very careful sometimes, even if you don't really do multiple testing.

274
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:15,000
But just the just the the fact that you are thinking about it. it's already Make it the type I already inflated a little bit.

275
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:24,000
Okay.

276
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Okay.

277
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
You know that's exactly the reason why you know Fda required the pharmaceutical comedy to Chris right right document.

278
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,000
The their analysis, but as a report before they even collect the data right So that's the most rigorous approach.

279
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:48,000
That's the approach. can rigorous control type of Now, if you violate that, then our top hour will be inflated.

280
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Sometimes it'll buy a little amount sometimes i'll give you a month.

281
00:38:51,000 --> 00:39:00,000
It's hard to qualify you know if you obviously change your analysis after you see the data

282
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:06,000
Okay. So now let's put in some notation I don't know why there is a green bar always there.

283
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Let me 5, 2,

284
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Okay. Got rid of it. for no patience. right? So now Xi is our measurement for subject.

285
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
I and Xi is always 0 or one let's take it for simplicity.

286
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:36,000
0 One here is now new married they're basically means the indicator for a particular category.

287
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,000
Well. Nevertheless, we can treat outside as new married right.

288
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,000
One means it is in the category. 0 means it's not let's just ignore that let's just treat as I as as numeric.

289
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,000
It turns out we can do a lot. It turns out anything we learn from 2.

290
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Samo Kit has still applied here to some degree.

291
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Okay, in this case, if we were to calculate the sample proportion, Basically, how many people in in your sample has a Xi was one.

292
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:08,000
You can just take your sample on account. how many people has A.

293
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Xi equals one right basically is here number of subjects with Xi equals one, then divide by the total number subject.

294
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,000
You can do this pounding, and your call is sample proportion. P.

295
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,000
Hi! for the reason i've talked about earlier by turns out that discounting.

296
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:32,000
We'll give you the same answer as simply add on all the X.

297
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,000
One back side and divide by N. which by definition expon.

298
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:44,000
So, although we are not dealing with continuous outcome here to be specific, what did it was binary outcome?

299
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
But this particular calling scheme make them equivalent.

300
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,000
So under this calling scheme X bar always equal P.

301
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
High.

302
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,000
I want you to think about it, and you know i'll be convinced.

303
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:06,000
Otherwise, you know, Let me know if you have questions. So we told this coding scheme for mathematical convenience.

304
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:20,000
It turns out that under this calling scheme p hat my mind is pretty equals extra. So although we use 0 one just for coding, but turns out we can also treat them as that's continuous numbers, and then take the average and

305
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:37,000
that will give us the same number

306
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:45,000
And this probably only apply to binary variable doesn't apply to you know you have 3 class these called x one and 0, 1, 2 that doesn't work anymore.

307
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:56,000
So only when you have 2 clouds and you call it 0 one, it turns out the binary is is somewhere in between the categorical, and it continues, You can treat it as a categorical can also treat us continues You

308
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:04,000
don't wait for the same answer that's very special about the binary

309
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,000
So, but i'm trying to say that when you'll see people taking the average of a binary variable.

310
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:18,000
They're not wrong, because mathematically that's the same as counting how many ones, and divided by the total

311
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
Are you you can't play with the design hope so you have 10 taxes, right?

312
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:31,000
3 of them are 1, 7 are 0. right then the proportional ones is 30%, but that's the same as adding them all and divided by 10.

313
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You got 3 over 10. That's also 30% so it just turned out in mathematics.

314
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,000
They were the same

315
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,000
And because mathematically they are the same. it turns out many thing we do is to some of these are still apply.

316
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,000
Here.

317
00:42:52,000 --> 00:43:01,000
Just the sample. They are only 0 once right they are a special type of continues, but not with the last central name, and theorem doesn't require you to have a certain distribution.

318
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:10,000
Even you have a binary variable Saturday with, you know, steel plots.

319
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,000
So remember previously, with continuous outcome, we have a sample size.

320
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:21,000
We have X bar, and we have a standard arrow, a standard deviation, right defined.

321
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:31,000
This way we can compute 3 quantity based on our sample

322
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,000
It turns all that you can use the same formula to compute the same thing for your binary variable.

323
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:45,000
Just treat I access 0 one. You can do the same

324
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,000
But it turns out that because your bio variable is binary, you can do it.

325
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,000
You know another way which seems much easier. I have some home, mean or sample proportion is P.

326
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Hat which equals X bar your sample standard deviation, you can compute once you've got p hard, you can easily compute sample standard division using this pointer

327
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:25,000
So you essentially you can. You know you can use the the formula on the top to computer standard deviation, or you can use the formula on the bottom can be the standard deviation.

328
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:32,000
They are supposed to be the same. Okay, this 2 formula look rather different.

329
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:36,000
My turnout mathematically. they're the same for finer variable Wow!

330
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,000
I there's a caveat you can really calculate they have not exactly the same.

331
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:45,000
They're they're almost the same but they all buy a little bit, because this one actually come from the formula divided by n rather than n minus one.

332
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:52,000
So there's some mathematical trick. in this there but nevertheless, they are almost the same.

333
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,000
So we use this formula this parameter, you know.

334
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:01,000
Bother one. Only apply to binary

335
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:16,000
Okay, So the binary variable are different from continuous alcohol, because for continuous variable, you see the mean and the standard deviation, they're not directly related.

336
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
You could have different distribution with the same mean but different standard deviation.

337
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:24,000
Or you could have different distribution with the same standard division of a different mean right.

338
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
These 2 variable me and standard devices are separate remember I'm.

339
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,000
You on the signal for a binary variable. It turns out that me and the standard deviation are related for each other.

340
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
You know the mean, you know the standard deviation which means if your population is binary, you only need one variable, which is the population proportion.

341
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:52,000
You don't need the standard deviation because once you know the proportional standard division is already determined, so that in that sense binary is different from continuous is different from normal. right.

342
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:56,000
Remember the normal distribution required, who are 2 provinces to 40 or characterized.

343
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
But, by the way, you know, this distribution is called the Binomial.

344
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Only require one variable so they are different after all that's why, you know, we have a different formula for binary.

345
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:17,000
But now, with the last mathematically, this will give you almost the same answer

346
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:29,000
Any questions so far

347
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Okay. So now we have samples as sample mean samples that a deviation.

348
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:48,000
And then what we do is that we remember p hat he's the activate for the population proportion key, and because P.

349
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:54,000
Hat is calculated from the data p hat is random because It's random.

350
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:07,000
It has a sampling distribution. Their voice has a standard error, right, which is the final division For the summary of the you will find its formula very similar.

351
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:16,000
The standard error for you have is the standard survey standard deviation divided by the sperm.

352
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:27,000
The sample time. So basically, standard arrow for this quantity is this quantity divided by square root of n, which is almost the same as before.

353
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:32,000
So that's why you know that they are mathematically very much related there for the followers very much similar.

354
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
So once you use this to figure out the standard arrow. P.

355
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:46,000
You have. you had to things just like people right? For example, you can construct the 95% common level for the population proportion, which will be the point.

356
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:53,000
Estimate of P, which is p hat plus minus 2 times the standard arrow pi, which which is this thing.

357
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:02,000
He had, plus minus 2 standards. that would be the 95% polynomial for the P.

358
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:12,000
Similarly, if we work to conduct a one, this is called a one sample proportion test essentially do not have how to assume that P equals some particular value.

359
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,000
P star, and it's i'm telling him assumes that he doesn't equal his star like a constructive statistic.

360
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:35,000
Yeah, this is the you know, the the amount of deviation under the No, divided by the standing arrow by the signal over the noise. and then you got it again.

361
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:40,000
You got this statistic is again he. which, reminds you that this thing still follow a key distribution.

362
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,000
So. everything we learned before still applies just slightly different formula.

363
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But the only difference is here. We use a different formula to calculate the standard deviation, and this monitor isn't that different from this one.

364
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:59,000
We learn already at all

365
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:16,000
So you know, i'm moving a path a little faster now, right? because we are repeating what we learned earlier, just slightly modified to take care of different kind of data by if you do have questions, Please let me know You know again.

366
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:24,000
We'll be going over example, and also projects you know to to repeat this right, so that you you're fully honest.

367
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:34,000
Fine, but so far, you know, we are talking about the mouth behind it.

368
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:49,000
No example, some real data. So suppose we are curious about the proportion of of lashing children 2 years old and younger in the Us. Ms.

369
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Carries. So the population is this this group of children right?

370
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:00,000
And the measurement is that, that that you know no cavity, right teeth, cavity?

371
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:05,000
You could do a continuous all account for sure well for the demonstration purpose here.

372
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:17,000
That's collective. the other outcome. so suppose we have a sum of 247 of these families each with a 2 year old tile.

373
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:22,000
Now we collapse data as a binary Xi will be one.

374
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:28,000
If child I have developed, carries at in at least one tooth and 0.

375
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:35,000
If that's not the case in principle you could also collect a continuous, Basically, the number of cavities right?

376
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Okay, Paris and Keith. But here we are data with minor, so either they have it or they don't have it.

377
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,000
And suppose of all the 247 children we find 38 of them have developed carrots.

378
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:57,000
You know this one, too. So 37 of them has a Xi. equals one.

379
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
The remaining 209 of them had a X.

380
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:12,000
I for 0. So if I were to ask you what's the best estimate for the population proportion, so because really remember, the sound is not something we are of interest.

381
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:23,000
The sample is random. We really care about in this particular population right What's proportion of the family of the child has Ca: cavity, right?

382
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,000
So the best we can do is to use the sample proportion.

383
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Who asked me to the population portion. So here we compute the P.

384
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:39,000
Hat assembly equals 38 over 247

385
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:55,000
You need a calculator by what you've got is 0 point 1 5, 4, I think I don't have to kind of vency with that This 0 point 1 5, 4 is our best guess for the population p which is unknown.

386
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,000
And I don't have to come in you at this moment that this number, exactly, randomly, depend on the sample.

387
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,000
If you repeat the study you might get a side a different number. Now, with us, given the sample we have, this is our best gas for the population.

388
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:16,000
P.

389
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:32,000
Any question.

390
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:40,000
Okay, So with this P. hat, see, the difference carries out. We only need to get a P.

391
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:49,000
Hat and we are, we can continue because as I mentioned earlier right this distribution, because it's binary only has one parameter, which is the P.

392
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:58,000
Once. we know Key. we know everything. For example, the 95% common level for P is equal to this pointer right? He had, plus minus 2 as P.

393
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:02,000
Over square root of n. You might ask me what is asp?

394
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:07,000
It turns out, asp can be activated just using this monitor as P.

395
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:13,000
Equals P. hat times one minus P. have x for root right once you look you have, you know. Sp.

396
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:21,000
They're related so that I think is so convenient we don't even need to compute the standard deviation because it's given here by his father.

397
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Right, so as key over square little n That will be square root of P.

398
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:34,000
Hat times one minus p hat over square root of n over end, and everything takes square root and then times 2 by 2 times the standard arrow.

399
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:38,000
I don't just plug in he had an end into this formula.

400
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,000
You got this in double? So that is the 95%.

401
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:50,000
How many level for P. So basically, from the sample, we can guess that the population proportion is about 0 point 1, 5, right?

402
00:53:50,000 --> 00:54:03,000
About 15%, but because we have a i'm certainly not on it. right? Taking the uncertainty into consideration, our best guess about a bracket for the population P.

403
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:10,000
Is from about 11% to 20% right. the largest sample size.

404
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:23,000
The smaller the bracket or the interval will be, which means with more information, you can narrow down this estimate

405
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Now let's see what we can do with it right once we got this interval.

406
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:37,000
What? what can we do with it? One type of question is this: Suppose a dental agency is curious.

407
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:41,000
You have 10% of a lot in children. Age, 2 and younger have developed carries.

408
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:51,000
Now we can see, because the 95% company in the vote does not include 10%.

409
00:54:51,000 --> 00:55:03,000
Bye which means the population. p although we don't know what it is, it's very likely larger than 10%, because it's very likely following this interval.

410
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:09,000
Now, where are we? Far in the interval is larger than 10%. right?

411
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:21,000
So what we can conclude that it's very likely that more than 10% are large in children have developed carries. How?

412
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,000
How do we realize that? I mean I may be like I didn't understand before?

413
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:34,000
So how do we know that the 10 person does not fall in the 95 person confidence interval?

414
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,000
Oh, yeah, you look at the interval at 10% equals 0 point.

415
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:45,000
One. Okay, So this is 0 point 1 oh 8. This the laugh Boundary is larger than 0 point 1.

416
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:52,000
So the whole interval is all side, 10%. Okay, Okay, Thank you.

417
00:55:52,000 --> 00:56:04,000
Any other question.

418
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:18,000
So the other way, you know, not using a 95% common interval, but using her also testing but mathematically equivalent way is that suppose we do have our test for the null p equals 0 point 1 versus

419
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:25,000
alternative. P is not equal to 0 point. one right? We can then plug in the number.

420
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:28,000
Using this pointer P. half minus P. Star, where P.

421
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:38,000
Star is the value you assume under the know, then, divided by this standard error, How are you computer here?

422
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:42,000
So you plug in 0 point 1, 5, 4, which is the point estimate of P.

423
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,000
Hat, subtract 0 point, one which the value you assume under the null.

424
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:56,000
Then divided by the standard error, your computer here by using this formula after a lot of the calculation.

425
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,000
What you got is 2 point, 3, 5,

426
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:08,000
And the fact that this this t statistic is larger than 2, give you a hand. now.

427
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,000
The Pio will be left on point o 5, right just like before, because this is again at least that is the so.

428
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:22,000
Now your key value is, Pardon me, 0 point 0 1 9, which is left on point 4, 5, right.

429
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:27,000
So your your conclusions that you reject. Now remember the null space P.

430
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:33,000
0 point, one which means that you conclude is very likely right.

431
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:36,000
The true population. proportion is not equal to 0 point.

432
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:44,000
One it's not equal to 10% in reality it's more likely it's very likely to be larger than 10% right?

433
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:51,000
Because you're pounding always larger but about testing only rejected. Now it doesn't tell you a direction right look at the common interval.

434
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,000
You know it is above 10%. The true pro proportion is more than 10%.

435
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:01,000
That's your conclusion by with high confidence you never know for sure.

436
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:05,000
But that's what you have conclude with this data right the data support.

437
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:18,000
Provide evidence, right support. The conclusion that the true keys locked in the 10%

438
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:22,000
I did actually, you know, to some of you that is very, very widely used.

439
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:25,000
But this proportion has also very, very widely used.

440
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:35,000
You can put it in many settings. We go ahead. Well, you want to study weather or vaccine is effective in more than 50% of population. right?

441
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:43,000
That's the same question as we are putting here right or you want to, you know.

442
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:48,000
Estimate a particular education intervention that will be effective.

443
00:58:48,000 --> 00:59:08,000
More than, say, 30% of kids. it's the same thing right? whenever you want to show something is is applicable to more than a certain proportion of the population you find in this particular type of test

444
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:12,000
Right. This is 1 one sample proportion test they don't know about who's have a multiple sample.

445
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:17,000
But so far with dealing with one sample, proportion has, which is a parallel of what sample key test.

446
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:24,000
The only difference is, we have a binder. All our robin continues

447
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:32,000
Yeah. So So we are now entering the route where we're gonna talk about different kind of tests with different kind of data, different kind of study design.

448
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,000
It's easy to call confused right in the end I will summarize a table, and this course is just introduction. course right?

449
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,000
We talked about the most basic ones. But if you want to deal with more comic, it wants to take.

450
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:51,000
You know, a device courses. But now the last thing all all of the same. principal, that's why I spend all hope first week. Talk about the principle behind cause those apply.

451
00:59:51,000 --> 01:00:03,000
No matter what pass you are doing. Okay, I I have a question because i'm a little bit confused here, cause you said the proportion is likely to be larger than 10%.

452
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:11,000
But it could be also smaller than 10%, right cause the the alternative hypothesis is that it's not equal to 10%.

453
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:19,000
But could that could also be mean like a smaller number? Or, yeah, am I wrong?

454
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,000
You. You are right, you know, just from the hypothesis happening.

455
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:30,000
We can only say it's not equal right because how about it doesn't care the direction so from this number with the Peabody we cannot say is larger or smaller.

456
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:37,000
We can say it's not equal but on the other hand We also did a common interval right from the comedy unable.

457
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:44,000
We can see It's actually larger so different analysis give you a different piece of evidence, I see.

458
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:53,000
Thank you. Welcome. Yeah. So usually we analyze data. Now, not only do I have all testing also provided how many interval right?

459
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:14,000
Putting both together, You can make one step further your conclusion you're gonna say, Yeah, we we rejected now, and we have high confidence back is greater than 10% that's putting these 2 keys of information together

460
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:23,000
Cool. Yeah, if any of you have questions, please let me know

461
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:35,000
Yeah, I i'm going to you know this is the one sample proportion test, because we only have 1 one distribution, one population, and one will compare the population proportion against the null value just like the one sample key.

462
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:43,000
that. So on this slide. Now i'm going to talk about 2 sample proportion tests.

463
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:50,000
So in this case, just like a 2 sample key tas, which we compare to population, mean to see whether they are equal or not. equal.

464
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:56,000
Bye, you still remember. Meanwhile, the mean of population, one new to the meal operation 2 now is that mu y equals mu 2.

465
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:10,000
You turn the mu one not equal to mu 2, we can collect the statistic from probably one and 2, and couple of this test statistics to see whether it's larger than 2 or less than minus 2 or t between right to make decisions

466
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,000
This is what we learned: the 2 sample Pdf.

467
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,000
But in parallel we can do something for the proportion. right.

468
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:24,000
Suppose we do have 2 population, but now we we not really care about the ability for me, but rather we cared about population proportion.

469
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,000
So what we do is here now. this 2 side are very similar, right? something changed.

470
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:34,000
But most of the things say I, if you you can, you know, take some time.

471
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:36,000
Go back and forth. right. These are the 2 sample you have.

472
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:45,000
This is the 2 sample proportions, have so now we have 2 proportion, one and a 2, and there's something we want to compare their proportion, you know.

473
01:02:45,000 --> 01:03:00,000
You can make a big example for example, you've populated one our Mayo, probably, than 2, or female on the proportion we care about our the people who are, for example, obese.

474
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Right. so I want to see whether male or female. The proportion of you know obese people in the 2 population are the same or not.

475
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Right? Okay, essentially, there are 2 variable being involved. One variable is the binary variable used to define the population.

476
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:23,000
Here is gender, which is the exposure. the other variable is the is again binary, used to define the outcome, which is obesity.

477
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:32,000
Here. So essentially, these 2 sample proportion tests are used to study the association between 2 binary variables.

478
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,000
Once you figure out what what are the 2 binary variable things are much clear.

479
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:42,000
So always keep, you know, those kind of thing in mind. Otherwise, every time they they write a sometimes in different way, Right?

480
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,000
Maggot computers always keep your mind shark think about what what variable are they considering here?

481
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:50,000
And what is the exposure? what's the outcome what type of variable?

482
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,000
They are right now. if you are, you know my my much shocker.

483
01:03:54,000 --> 01:04:00,000
So here, P. one that's for the proportion of proportion in population, one p.

484
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:06,000
2 stands for the proportion population 2, and then the No. I part will be P. Y. equals P.

485
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:10,000
2 alternative with p. one*, Some of that could be before.

486
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:15,000
Now we can compute statistic p one half p 2 half, which are the sample proportion in the 2 samples.

487
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:26,000
Now we don't need a computer standard deviation because the standard deviation is linked to the mean for the sample proportion because it is binary, right?

488
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:31,000
Sorry. It turns out that you have computer piece that is using this monitor.

489
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:38,000
I am not going to talk about where this come from by it's sort of a mimic, you know what we learned earlier on this line.

490
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:47,000
Alright, just different formula, you know, if this is a course in mathematical statistics, I will show you how to derive this right.

491
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,000
But this is a course is about really the the use and in the interpretation of statistics.

492
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:58,000
Right now. I just show you there is a formula and Then this is the the quality we're trying to matter right?

493
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:14,000
So the larger this difference between human I don't know what I clicked the larger The difference here in magnitude. the larger the evidence against no just like this new one x one more minus like 2 bar right here We have P, one minus

494
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:21,000
P. 2 hat. The denominator of this whole complicated formula is simply the estimate, the standard arrow of the for the numerator.

495
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:27,000
Here. So the numerator, divided by standing error

496
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,000
You see that? you know we have queue. I have up here in a denominator.

497
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,000
We have something called a P. hat, and the P. hard is this thing.

498
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,000
So this formula looks simple, exactly, quite complicated, because his P.

499
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:42,000
Had itself is a function of you know, all the ends and all the he has.

500
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,000
So you know he had an n one key. one and 2 people have plug in here.

501
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:54,000
Got a p hot, the plug everything in here Katie I assure you. you don't need to do that by hand.

502
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:58,000
We're using calculator right the software would do it on the spreadsheet would do it.

503
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,000
But in the end you got a p out of it and now you'll look at.

504
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:13,000
Why did the t is larger than 2, or last time minus 2? and then galaxy viral? then make the interpretation. So that's what you I want you to learn here

505
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,000
Sorry i'm running a little late for the break let's take a 10 min break right if you do have questions you can ask.

506
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:29,000
Otherwise. let's take a 10 min break thank you

507
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:39,000
Thank you, John. Can I ask you a question not relevant to the talk, but that overpowering Well, I never.

508
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:44,000
I always thought having hypers good. But is that a problem?

509
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,000
Is because you would take the very, very tiny differences that might not be meaningful.

510
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:57,000
Is that the problem Yeah, having more power, everything else equal, having more power is good right?

511
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
In many, many cases, but everything you know there's no pretty lunch.

512
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:06,000
There's some downside with that number wise. that you probably are wasting your your your resource right?

513
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:09,000
It's the same amount of resource money ever candy spend elsewhere.

514
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:24,000
Right. second is that you know higher power will pick up very tiny effects which may not be interesting in practice. Right? So he's a wait for for for your study is a waste for the whole community in some sense, right and Finally, you know If

515
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:29,000
you pull this out power too much. You focus on the pivotal too much.

516
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:35,000
You are in the morning. Things are more important. so I I think i'm trying to be picky here, right.

517
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,000
But high power is good by sell what is associated with with other things right when you are overpower.

518
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:49,000
What you pick up may not be relevant.

519
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:58,000
Point 0 0 0. The third overpowers is that the problem

520
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:03,000
That means you know, that could be to them it could be all over power, but also could be.

521
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:09,000
You know your effect. that is too big. right? they just just surprise any bit right.

522
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:22,000
Find something surprisingly on that sense. is is good is there like A number sample size that's above that you're like this is going to be too much or No, it depends what your effect size.

523
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:32,000
You're looking for like in randomized design a study typically the power you're aiming for is 80%.

524
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:38,000
80% of all is good. But if you have a study, your power is 99, point 9, 9%.

525
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:43,000
I think the No, I meant like the sample size like there are, you know, multi-center studies.

526
01:08:43,000 --> 01:09:08,000
You have like 10,000, they are related. Yeah. so, The The truth is that the power of calculation is just theoretical my my question was, if you were calculating your power you wanted that much power you've all over

527
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,000
so, why would you overpower? Why would the study be?

528
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:17,000
Because you The thing is the power. Calculation is just theoretical.

529
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:28,000
You never really know what your 2 power is because to calculate the power. Not only you need to know the sample size, you also need to know the variability that you fact size many things which typically you don't know So you make

530
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:37,000
assumption, and those may be off we may end up with overpower, because you're you're underizing your power in in the in the design place.

531
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:50,000
Okay, make sense. Thank you.

532
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:57,000
So I know you mentioned this was just for when you have like binary outcomes.

533
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:08,000
Is there feel like i've seen like some research papers If there's like more than 2 outcomes, they can still run some type of high-square tests is does that break the rule or is that you know

534
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:12,000
test with like different I don't know variation or No, I I will.

535
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:16,000
I will actually talk about that second half of this lecture.

536
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:22,000
Yeah, I mean this will generalize to multiple category with we start simple.

537
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:32,000
I saw that yeah can be done all right. I I also know I always get confused like looking at a research paper like, When do you?

538
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,000
When you use like this Chi-square test versus like some papers will do like Fisher exact test.

539
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:43,000
I I know. how. How do you? How do you decide when to run?

540
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:56,000
Okay, yeah, just like what we talk about is the focus even for this. So first of all, high school has is to study the association between your categorical and another categorical So that's why you know you need

541
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:03,000
to use password tests. But just for the same type of study there are different paths like feature exactly is a different version, so they apply.

542
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:09,000
They both have different pros and accounts, assumes certainly with you.

543
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:17,000
So you need a large sample So if it turns out that you know you have this collect the data and turns out some of the accounts you've got from you know table, right?

544
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
You have a contingency. Some of the phones are very small.

545
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:25,000
In those case, the highest part pass will be off that's when the feature exists.

546
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:31,000
Oh, you know, assume we'll be better sorry just different different assumption, and always different tests.

547
01:11:31,000 --> 01:12:01,000
So feature. if that doesn't count up it doesn't rely on So it works give up a small sample

548
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:36,000
Okay, let's continue so. as you can see the lecture. today is a little long, so we're gonna spend the long run unusual times on this.

549
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:42,000
I will continue with some of the exercise on Monday so that's why I think it's due on Monday.

550
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,000
So this is a 2 sample. proportion has right.

551
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:53,000
So essentially you, you collect the data. You calculate the pi hat for each group that you use those things to.

552
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,000
To plug in. Okay, the key and the software will do all of this for you unless you have the key.

553
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:10,000
I make this decision. So that's now look at a real example again, is the you know, about this teeth.

554
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:18,000
Study right borough health study. So suppose we were assessed that you're back in the public house intervention aimed at parents for preventing carries and children.

555
01:16:18,000 --> 01:16:26,000
Now we have 2 population. So so when you walk to study intervention versus the outcome right?

556
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:30,000
Usually the invention itself is the exposure. So use that to define the group right?

557
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:38,000
So the first group, or the first population or children whose parents did not use the intervention, and the second one that they used.

558
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:56,000
So the thing is that if you find anything different between this cool population, that means the intervention is playing a role, because the 2 parties are the same, except for whether they use information or not, and then the allcom is that whether they provide a carry or

559
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:02,000
not so. The holidays are. Remember, the 2 sample proportional has all these.

560
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,000
H naught is t y equals P. 2: Yeah. No attorney is not equal to P.

561
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:14,000
2 where P. One is the proportion of population. Children with car carries with parents, not using the intervention, and P.

562
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:19,000
2 is the same proportion of children with Carry in the second rule, right?

563
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:26,000
So having that you provision or not is the exposure, and having carry or not this outcome, so both are binary.

564
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:30,000
That's why we do this to sample proportion test.

565
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:34,000
So you port data, and we reject the now with strong evidence.

566
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:44,000
Showing alternative is true. then it's actually way of finding the association between the exposure and outcome here.

567
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:49,000
The Association is a neutral work it doesn't really talk about the Direction Association right?

568
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:53,000
There could be the innovation actually review the rate of carry.

569
01:17:53,000 --> 01:18:00,000
It could be the integrity, you know, increase the rate of care in both case we reject it now.

570
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,000
So that I passed again. Only reject the null doesn't tell the direction.

571
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:13,000
So really see the direction. when you do couple of things talking it'll commonly, you know

572
01:18:13,000 --> 01:18:21,000
Okay, Now, in this particular real study, we gather sample from children from both population and God.

573
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:32,000
The falling data right in the long intervention group we have a total 36 infants and the model 10 has carried in the intervention group.

574
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:38,000
We have 68 infants where 6 has carried just by eyeballing this number you see the rate of carry in.

575
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:45,000
The 9 American group is high, so that's supports the idea that individual might be helpful.

576
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:55,000
But because all these numbers are random, we don't know how significant the you know the difference is

577
01:18:55,000 --> 01:19:03,000
So what we do with that now let's plug in the numbers. n. One is the sample size for group one which is 36, and 2 is 68, and P.

578
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:14,000
One is the sample proportion, which is in the first rule, which is 10 over 38, which is 28% 0 point, 1, 2 way.

579
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,000
Similar P. 2 is 6, over 68, which is 9%.

580
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:25,000
So this core quite different. You see, the rate of carry in the * group is very much higher 3 times higher.

581
01:19:25,000 --> 01:19:37,000
Well, the question is that are they significant or not? given the randomness and I sort of. and to really copy the statistic, we need to calculate the the P.

582
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,000
The piece. Actually, what is the peak? The p is the pole right?

583
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:44,000
If the is that under the now the 2 group have the same proportion.

584
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:48,000
So the best way to ask me that common proportion is, pull them together.

585
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:52,000
This is very much like a denominator, right? You put them together.

586
01:19:52,000 --> 01:20:01,000
So when you put the 2 group together you got 16 right 10 plus 6 cases, I'm all 36 pause 68.

587
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:07,000
Hello, sample size, right? So the pi is 15%. You see, the P.

588
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:15,000
Height is always in between p one and p 2 have because that's the estimate of proportion assuming that now is true.

589
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:22,000
So we use. P. had to ask me the an arrow, so the t statistic will be P.

590
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
One hat minus P. 2 half here divided by this formula I'm.

591
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,000
Not going to to say it, but you're plug in a formula which has P.

592
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:33,000
Hat, which has n one n 2. we planning everything. Are you?

593
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:40,000
Do the math. You have 4.7, one

594
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:46,000
Yeah, this is larger than 2, which implies the pivotal significant.

595
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:51,000
Your target is 0 point 0 0 7, which is last 9.0 5.

596
01:20:51,000 --> 01:21:02,000
So we conclude that we have audio model, modest to strong evidence, right against the null, which shows that the rate of care differ between 2 populations.

597
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:11,000
Again. This does not help us. which population is higher. but if you cover the company novel, for the difference. You will see the first population is higher than the second.

598
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:21,000
That's the significantly higher. So which is avenue intervention is associated with outcome.

599
01:21:21,000 --> 01:21:25,000
If this is not, you know, experimental study, This is a reservational.

600
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:30,000
How about intervention? established environmental? But this is not observational, Right?

601
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:35,000
Because eventually something you give it. Who the to the parents?

602
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:43,000
But the problem is that you didn't randomize which means that the parents themselves, you know, if you did the random as the parents itself for the information.

603
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:54,000
So in that sense is still observational. because you didn't give the treatment in that sense you cannot make causal conclusion because there could be confounding.

604
01:21:54,000 --> 01:22:02,000
Let me ask you a question Right? Yeah, the parents they are in for the intervention or not, which means that you're not giving them.

605
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:09,000
So what kind of confounding could be there to disrupt this causal inference?

606
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Anyone hear me? The potential Confounder

607
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:50,000
Maybe the food they give to their children, if they if they give them like candy all day, Thank you.

608
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:59,000
Anything else.

609
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:03,000
Yeah, it could be the food could be other. You know. habits right?

610
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:09,000
The The crucial thing of confounder is that a confounder will be associated with both the exposure and outcome.

611
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:15,000
So essentially there are some characteristic of this parents right, which the term is their behavior.

612
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:26,000
For example, some parents that care about peace, health, one or other oral health more than other parents, and those parents will tend to yeah the new.

613
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:34,000
Into this intervention study, and those parents will also be more careful in the kind of piece or other other, you know.

614
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:38,000
Hygiene, right all of hiding every day. right?

615
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:44,000
So those kind of a characteristic of the Paris will be a component right.

616
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:52,000
Maybe the university is not really doing anything, except that the parents who opt in for the intervention they were careful with with auto hygiene.

617
01:23:52,000 --> 01:24:00,000
In the first place, i'm making this up but if I see this our potential can volunteer have to watch for right.

618
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:08,000
So that's the fundamental you know difficulty of using observational study to draw causal conclusion, because there always could be confounded out there.

619
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:16,000
Something you can think of something you cannot think of right they're all, always possible component.

620
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:25,000
For example, even when we study, you know, smoking for decades, we have hundreds, not thousands of studies showing the same conclusion.

621
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:31,000
Again again, and people can still argue because you're always doing observational study on smoking.

622
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:34,000
You cannot force people to smoke right you're always observing smokers.

623
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:39,000
Non smoker. there's always a chance for example maybe there's a gene.

624
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:45,000
We never discovered. having that Gene will make you like the smoke.

625
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:57,000
Also make you like to get lung cancer. How can I rule out that possibility

626
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:05,000
And the argument nowadays that yeah, there could be a gene like that. Other association of that gene with smoking and lung cancer must be super high.

627
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:09,000
To explain the effect side we observe from all the study we have seen right.

628
01:25:09,000 --> 01:25:14,000
For example, we know smoking can increase the chance of long cancer by like 10 point, 24, right?

629
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:20,000
That's a very, very strongly path, so the gene must be very strong with that strategy.

630
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:32,000
The chance. we still couldn't find it is very small right So you have to go through argument like this showing is I'd like it to be a confounded like that exist to be convinced that smoking is really causing lung

631
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:36,000
cancer. You'll see that if you if you can do a randomized trial on this.

632
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:41,000
Then you don't even need to call concern about this kind of confounding question.

633
01:25:41,000 --> 01:25:50,000
But unfortunately just, we cannot do a random trial on smoking or human, so so pros and count right.

634
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:57,000
Randomized trial is is good. Oh, it has a limitations right of the visual study is, you know, it's also good, but it also has limitations.

635
01:25:57,000 --> 01:26:01,000
So we just have to try whatever we can to draw conclusion as much as we can.

636
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:22,000
Any question here

637
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:27,000
Okay, Now let's move on to talk about chi smart path.

638
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:42,000
Okay, another way. Oh, analyzing the same kind of data we did with to sample testing proportions is to use this.

639
01:26:42,000 --> 01:26:45,000
So how the Chi squared had, and the customer is cut.

640
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:51,000
Customer test is more general. just like a the Chi squared has is a generalization of these 2. sample test.

641
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:53,000
Proportion is just like one. We are no wise.

642
01:26:53,000 --> 01:27:01,000
A generalization. Okay.

643
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:05,000
So let's first use high school test to do this analyze the same kind of data.

644
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:11,000
Now we generalize it to analyze all you know, even more general type of data.

645
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:16,000
So now we have 2 hypothesis right. h not safe.

646
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:20,000
The development carries independent of using the intervention, and H. A.

647
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:27,000
Is that they are associated with, we could say, not associated with what social risk or you depend on with not any panelists.

648
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:30,000
There are some subtle difference between the wording but for this purpose.

649
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,000
Of this course, let's treat them as the same so association independent whatever.

650
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:44,000
Okay, So these are all. Now have office, and then we can put the data.

651
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:46,000
We just collect into this 2 by 2 contingency table.

652
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:50,000
If you still remember contenders, they would otherwise you for one.

653
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:58,000
So there are 2 roads, 2 columns. The 2 roles are for one variable, which is the carries which is the outcome, and the 2 columns of one variable, which is the individual.

654
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:03,000
We see exposure, you could swap rows and columns.

655
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,000
You just transpose the paper, which is the same thing.

656
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:07,000
Well, nevertheless. now we have 2 back with paper, right?

657
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:11,000
So there are 6 people who had intervention will also develop caring.

658
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:16,000
There are 10 of them who didn't have the information developerry 62 had intervention.

659
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:21,000
Didn't develop carrying on 26 harding version i'm not either having a very different developer.

660
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:25,000
You put them in, and then the third call on a third row.

661
01:28:25,000 --> 01:28:32,000
They are not really data, but they are salary statistic, because the third column and third row They are just marginal songs, Right?

662
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,000
16 is 6, plus 1036 is 10, plus 26 1.

663
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:46,000
No voice the sum of the full numbers view, so although there are 3 by 3 numbers, this only 2 by 2 table. This is a 2 by 2 contagency table.

664
01:28:46,000 --> 01:28:58,000
We're gonna get familiar with this from lama so this table. perfectly summarize our data, and you can only do this when you have categorical the exposure and our outcome. right?

665
01:28:58,000 --> 01:29:04,000
You could have a larger table where when you're exposure outcome has more than 2 classes here.

666
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:11,000
We have a 2 by 2, because both are binary

667
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:16,000
So now we are trying to have whether the role variable is associated with the column.

668
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:27,000
Variable right if they're associated now which means that's the same, you know this is a different way of stating the now and the target.

669
01:29:27,000 --> 01:29:35,000
But this this statement right. The car is independent with intervention, is actually the same thing same.

670
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:39,000
The proportion on the are the same in the 2 population.

671
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:43,000
So these are different way of taking an oil and a target, but they are actually turned out to be equivalent.

672
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,000
But this particular way of stating it will generalize to one and 2 categories.

673
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:58,000
So that's, why we're taking this from now on so Now they're always saying that the role variable is independent of the column variable, and the part of the savings they are not independent.

674
01:29:58,000 --> 01:30:02,000
They are associated they're they're associated.

675
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:07,000
They're dependent to the same same wording for all properties here.

676
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:13,000
So how do we do it? let's think about it right to do run any past?

677
01:30:13,000 --> 01:30:19,000
We need to collect evidence against the null in favor of the of.

678
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:24,000
I know we need to quantify the uncertainty

679
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:30,000
So this guy's part has take this approach let's now fix the pro.

680
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:33,000
The the marginal sound right, the third row in the third column.

681
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:37,000
Remember the third row, and the third column they're not really all the data.

682
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,000
There are summary of the data now with the left now Let's.

683
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:45,000
Now do it, you know, in the in A, in a universe.

684
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:50,000
We fixed the first row in the first column that's why part of the real data?

685
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:55,000
Suppose we don't know the data but we know the third row third column?

686
01:30:55,000 --> 01:31:02,000
So the question is what's your best guess of the number in the table to generate this third one for a call I'm.

687
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:09,000
With them. All of this

688
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:17,000
You can think about this right, and i'll give you the answer on the next slide.

689
01:31:17,000 --> 01:31:23,000
You repeat the question on what i'm sorry so assuming that all have not the role of call them variable.

690
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:30,000
They are independent, they have nothing to do with each other. and knowing the marginal songs. right of this table.

691
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:37,000
What's your best guess of the number really in the in the for South here?

692
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:46,000
I would guess that yes would be like the Yes, yes, column would be 8, and then No, no cop or the yes, no column.

693
01:31:46,000 --> 01:32:05,000
Yeah, that one would also be 8. So both are 81, because you would assume that there is no no impact of the intervention on dental carries, which means they would have an equal chance of having carries in both groups I think

694
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:12,000
you're definitely on the right, the right something? Yeah. What if the what if we focus more on the proportion? right?

695
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:20,000
So the carries. Yes, yes, should be I don't know say it's like of or not half sorry.

696
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:27,000
Say it's 18 right or sorry I guess Let me think about this better.

697
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:35,000
So what i'm thinking is if we're saying that there's there's no association that they are independent of each other.

698
01:32:35,000 --> 01:32:38,000
Then they carries the percentage of carries or a proportional carries.

699
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:52,000
These groups should be the same or similar. right? So for carries occurring out of 68 should be a similar proportion of carries occurring out of 36.

700
01:32:52,000 --> 01:33:00,000
That makes sense. Yeah, you have to survive. So the number make it hard to make, make, you know.

701
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:04,000
Make a story. let me. but you know, let me let me draw something.

702
01:33:04,000 --> 01:33:24,000
I think it's much easier 1 5 give me a second i'll use my ipad to to draw something

703
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:29,000
Okay, So this I I think both of your are definitely on the right side.

704
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:43,000
They just this number here make it hard that's use some simple numbers see if I can

705
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:48,000
You can see my whiteboard right so let's let's make a simpler table.

706
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:57,000
Right it's. it's the same thing we don't know the number here that's 8 the roles are mayo female.

707
01:33:57,000 --> 01:34:13,000
Okay, let's say, we have like 60 mail on 40 female pulled up 100 people in the cost, and the column could be anything.

708
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:19,000
Let's say we have I don't know just put something neutral right.

709
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:31,000
I think we have a mayo email that's say swimmer non swimmer, And then let's say we have

710
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:44,000
Let's make another number here right hi 81 so now we know the roles and columns wouldn't all the south there.

711
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:53,000
So, hey? you can make it a little hard that's make it first thing. hope 50 50 that's much easier right.

712
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:58,000
So we'll have 50 swim or 50 now member and the 60 mail, 40 female.

713
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:07,000
I ask you how many male swimmer, if if gender has nothing to do, whether you like to remember now right, how many males are there you can actually think about?

714
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:13,000
There are 60 mail and 50 swam our 59 neighbor.

715
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:18,000
So if they have nothing to do, this should be 30. This should be 30 similar.

716
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
This should be 20. This should be funny because they are equal.

717
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:27,000
But how do you agree together? Because they have You have 50 50.

718
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:33,000
What if we take all the number

719
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:41,000
What if we have, say, 80 here and 20 here, that you should think in the same thing in the 60 mail?

720
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:47,000
80% of should be swimmer. so this thing would be 48.

721
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:51,000
This should be 12, because they have to follow the same proportion.

722
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,000
Right. And then in the 40 email there should be 32.

723
01:35:54,000 --> 01:35:59,000
There should be 8. So essentially the numbers they should follow the proportion both for the role at the bottom.

724
01:35:59,000 --> 01:36:08,000
That's when you don't really see any association does that have everyone can be by this argument right?

725
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:19,000
Basically you look at both horizontally or vertically. the the proportion of the 2 cells will follow the proportion on the margins.

726
01:36:19,000 --> 01:36:38,000
Any question here that's the only you know this set of number on the number makes sense when you think of under the null right gender has nothing to do with Smith swimming or not

727
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:40,000
I'm gonna pick a minute here for you too. Well, think about it.

728
01:36:40,000 --> 01:36:46,000
We have 50, 50, I think everybody agree. but when you don't have 50, 50, so little, you know.

729
01:36:46,000 --> 01:37:01,000
Why, is that beyond? But it's actually the same argument

730
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Yeah, exactly the one you know you, Sarah put in the track. right? So essentially the rows on columns, they should always follow the same proportion as the 2 margins

731
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:22,000
Right So in the May. Well, there are 80 swimmer, 20, you know, 80% male cross swimmer, 20% male who announced women.

732
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:31,000
Same thing for female right. And in the swimmer group there should be 40% men oh, no 60%, man, 44% woman.

733
01:37:31,000 --> 01:37:35,000
Same thing for the non smoker. now splitting right.

734
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:47,000
This is the case where really sex has nothing to do with the outcome

735
01:37:47,000 --> 01:38:02,000
Any question here

736
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:12,000
Okay. So now, let's go back

737
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:18,000
So now is the same thing. Right, except the number here are harder to do is but they should follow the same principle.

738
01:38:18,000 --> 01:38:31,000
Therefore it turns out that you know, if if if role had an column has nothing to do with each other, then this will follow the same proportion.

739
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:42,000
Therefore the right way to compute the number in the upper left cell is this: you know, so essentially the probability of having a car is 16, over 104. right?

740
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:54,000
So you look at 16 over 104 and 68, or 104, when you model right up to God, i'm only about one o 4, and that's the number you should still leave so essentially 60 16 times 60

741
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:59,000
8 divided by one over 4 should be the number you're putting here previously.

742
01:38:59,000 --> 01:39:03,000
It's easy, because we have 100 you know but if it's not 100.

743
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:15,000
Everything should proportionate, go up right. So 16 times 68, divided by 104, should be the number of pure in here similar you have you in future the number in other cells.

744
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:24,000
I hope you are convinced by this calculation and then, that's the number we this is our observe the table.

745
01:39:24,000 --> 01:39:36,000
This is the real data, but this is the table we would expect under the knowledge of this

746
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:44,000
So essentially every cell is the rock run total mode rather than column, total, divided by the total sample size, which is one o 4.

747
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:48,000
Here should be the table you you would expect under the null and part of this.

748
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:56,000
You see that in the end what are you applying the number you've got fractions because you know you have a division here which is fine because this are expected number.

749
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:13,000
It's not real zoom number they could have fractions It's just like you know. if you flip a coin 3 times how many plans you will these back to hat which is 1.5 so the expectation could have a

750
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:24,000
fraction in there all the the real management doesn't so here we expect 10.5 people in this cell, but in reality we will start with 6.

751
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:31,000
Right. Similarly, here we expect 57.5 people in this South probably are 62, and so on.

752
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:43,000
So phone. So the questions are these 2 table are not equal they're not supposed to be equal, because the first time of this table is random.

753
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:55,000
Well, the question is that are the difference between these 2 people who table large enough, because the further away the observe the table is from the expected table. the more evidence against the now, because this expected about was I have to meet under the no

754
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:59,000
hypothesis right even to know about it is true.

755
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:05,000
This is what you should expect. but this is one of you really observed.

756
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:12,000
If the difference between the 2 table is big, which means more evidence against the No.

757
01:41:12,000 --> 01:41:38,000
I want you to you know. think about it, and got convinced by what I said

758
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:42,000
Okay, So how do we measure the the difference between the 2 table?

759
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:51,000
There's so many number there, right we use the same trick we somehow pick the difference, and then square them and wait it to a waiting song.

760
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:58,000
You will end up with one number right so what we do is that we subtract first table from the second table.

761
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:08,000
I know we square them, and then do a way to the phone that's that's our trick of summarizing many number into one. right?

762
01:42:08,000 --> 01:42:16,000
So this is the procedure by a reality. For every single cell there are 4 cells, right every single cell.

763
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:19,000
We stop, trapped the 2 number between the 2 table. This observe the number.

764
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:25,000
This is the expected number, and then square them. so that negative number turned to positive.

765
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:31,000
No, we do a way to the phone. We cannot just sum up together because different cell.

766
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:34,000
They have different variables. To begin with, the larger accounts in the cell.

767
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:37,000
The larger of our ability turns out that. So how do we?

768
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:46,000
How do we, you know, Waited them right we divide the the square by the corresponding the expected number horizontal?

769
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:53,000
That's the right thing to do and they're doing this waiting sound. once you plug in all the numbers, right?

770
01:42:53,000 --> 01:43:03,000
So basically the the observed account minus the expected Count square, divided by the Expect account, and then add that up overall the expect itself.

771
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:06,000
Once you do this, you have that with a number in this particular case.

772
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:17,000
6.7. Sorry that the the particular formula guarantees that this number will follow a certain distribution which is chi-squared distribution.

773
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:23,000
This whole thing is discovered by a i've here some you know many years ago.

774
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,000
So this is called appear since Chi Square statistic. Remember the last.

775
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Are you to understand is that the larger this number is the more evidence against the no right, because the larger this number is means that the larger the difference between the 2 table and all the questions that is, this number largely not it turns out that during

776
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:54,000
this not this dividing right? people in this normalization, this formula already take care of all the uncertainty.

777
01:43:54,000 --> 01:44:00,000
So now this number is no longer doesn't really have a unit something like that.

778
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:05,000
This number. that rabbit has a distribution called the High School Distribution.

779
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:10,000
So you need to look out in the Chi squared distribution of this number, and then turn that into a P.

780
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:14,000
Value. Again, this is not something we can do by hand for the software.

781
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:21,000
Does it for us

782
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:30,000
And this whole procedure, somehow underlying. you know, the Pearson developed is polymer based on the central name of theorem?

783
01:44:30,000 --> 01:44:37,000
Because I right remember, counts by proportions. They are also me right.

784
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:49,000
They also follow Central in the team. So when the counts are large, this thing will be approximated very well by high school distribution. i'm not going to say, well, if high school that you're doing is it's just like a half

785
01:44:49,000 --> 01:45:07,000
distribution, which is always positive. it's not normal the larger the number is the same of key by, but it's whole procedure relax, I believe, with theorem, which means that the counts cannot be too small I will

786
01:45:07,000 --> 01:45:21,000
talk about that later, but it but you know the rule of phone is that if all the accounts here are larger than 5, No, you are good with sending a few, this one of them is less than 5 need to watch on that it's mostly still

787
01:45:21,000 --> 01:45:33,000
good. Well, there are other paths like a feature exact path which work on the same kind of data with a different statistic, which doesn't allow, you know, central in the theorem which may work better when you have small counts

788
01:45:33,000 --> 01:45:42,000
nevertheless, that's beyond the scope of this course, right? So as long as the counts in each cell is log of the 5 hi spar.

789
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:44,000
So statistic is a good approximation. I sent her in a theorem.

790
01:45:44,000 --> 01:45:51,000
It works.

791
01:45:51,000 --> 01:46:00,000
So it turns out that the Chi squared distribution also depend on a parameter for a degree of freedom, just like the T distribution which depend on the size of the table.

792
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,000
Here for a 2 by 2 type of the degree of freedom.

793
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:06,000
The Chi Square is always one i'll not give you a P. value.

794
01:46:06,000 --> 01:46:12,000
But you have a larger table the high school statistic will be have a higher degree for them.

795
01:46:12,000 --> 01:46:18,000
So basically, i'm trying to show that this particular way of computing high-square statistics is not limited to 2 by 2 table.

796
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:22,000
You can do the same, even if you have large. that will that 2 things say 2 by 3, 3 by 3.

797
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:29,000
Okay, Well, you can do the same thing right? So the chi-square statistic is generalized for larger table as well sorry.

798
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:41,000
But for larger table you have a different diary, freedom, which means when you turn the statistic into a P value, you need to look up different tables.

799
01:46:41,000 --> 01:46:51,000
The software will take care of for that for you.

800
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:58,000
So for this example, what would our degrees of freedom be? Is Is it just one?

801
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:03,000
Yeah, it turned out to be one. So the degree of freedom is calculated by the number of rows minus one.

802
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:07,000
The number of columns minus one, so it's 2 minus one times 2, minus one, which is one.

803
01:47:07,000 --> 01:47:22,000
Yeah, turns out that. But you just have to call that software will exactly tell you what degree freedom you'll have when you're plug in a number. And in this case there are some association Okay, actually a high squire was

804
01:47:22,000 --> 01:47:26,000
degraded for the one it's just a square of the normal.

805
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:35,000
So that's why you call the chi square but nevertheless, which means that if this number is large enough for for 2 by 2 table, you kind of pivot on the left, and point or 5.

806
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:40,000
So now you'll have a 6.7 right the pivot is point 0 point 0.

807
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:55,000
One which is significant. So one thing I have to mention here using Chi squared has, we call the Q*, 1 one which is significant against the null right now, say the row in the column.

808
01:47:55,000 --> 01:48:01,000
They are independent. And this is the same data as the 2 sample proportion as here.

809
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:09,000
Remember same data Here we are happy to know that the you know the 2 sample proportion. The 2 for part in the population are the same.

810
01:48:09,000 --> 01:48:15,000
That's actually the same thing. i'm saying you know Karen has nothing to do with innovation, right?

811
01:48:15,000 --> 01:48:18,000
Basically they have the same. No. And here from the same, no same data.

812
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:24,000
All came out of 0. Point 0, 7

813
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:32,000
0 point, 0 7. Here is 0 point, 0 0 0 point, 0, 1 1.

814
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:46,000
Both are significant, but they're not equal, on one side that's, because we are doing different pets right high sport test versus 2 sample proportion tests, although they're passing the same thing essentially a morning positive here.

815
01:48:46,000 --> 01:48:49,000
We got. This difference is because we did a lot of wrongly.

816
01:48:49,000 --> 01:48:54,000
You see, this number is actually not 1.9 right? and this number is not 10.5.

817
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:59,000
This is probably 10.4, not something right we did a lot of wrongly.

818
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:10,000
That's why we end up with a different. P. value if you use the Google software, which doesn't do wronging that much you have to get pretty much the same if you like.

819
01:49:10,000 --> 01:49:16,000
Okay. So the 2 sample key no, the Chi squared has is a generalization of the 2 samples purpose.

820
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:21,000
Has it just like a Nova scandalization to sample tasks. Right?

821
01:49:21,000 --> 01:49:24,000
If you apply a nova on the tool sample, you can still apply it.

822
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:36,000
You got the same keyword same thing here. If you apply Chi squared test on a 2 by 2 table, you actually will get the same key value as a 2 sample proportion. Very fact. We are not getting the same key.

823
01:49:36,000 --> 01:49:40,000
Value or close people is because we did a lot of wronging.

824
01:49:40,000 --> 01:49:45,000
Okay.

825
01:49:45,000 --> 01:49:49,000
So in both cases we have modest 2 strong evidence. right?

826
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:55,000
Go against them all, showing me there's association showing the individual is likely to be helpful.

827
01:49:55,000 --> 01:50:01,000
But we cannot rule out possible confounding

828
01:50:01,000 --> 01:50:06,000
For only get you this far cool. reject or not.

829
01:50:06,000 --> 01:50:12,000
What does that really mean? In practice? You need to take the study design into consideration, right?

830
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:15,000
Whether you have an experimental study or observational study, right?

831
01:50:15,000 --> 01:50:26,000
Whether you have randomized data or not randomized data those go beyond. what is the physical meeting? The peabody the same as far as you got the same data, It doesn't care how the data was collected.

832
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:40,000
Oh, you know, interpretation cares a lot about how the data was collected so separate that

833
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:55,000
Any questions.

834
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:02,000
Okay, Now, let's talk about you know polarized this sector is very long.

835
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:17,000
Sorry, thought I, have to bear with me. but not that small talk about other things right that we can measure. So it turns out that it's 2 by 2. table has many way of interpreting it right Now we Have 2 interpretation

836
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:30,000
one is that the 2 population proportion that are different or not right; the otherwise that by the the 2 variable associated or not, these are 2 equivalent but different way of stating the now have office.

837
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:39,000
And the target. It turns out that you know the 2 population proportion difference.

838
01:51:39,000 --> 01:51:45,000
This is something we call it the absolute difference, right? Remember, in the non-information group we have P.

839
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:48,000
One hat equals 28%. In the individual book we have key to Hollywood.

840
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:54,000
9%. By what do we take the difference of this tool? As you know, through sample proportion, Tab.

841
01:51:54,000 --> 01:52:02,000
We are quantifying the fact. 5 is something called the absolute difference in carry weight.

842
01:52:02,000 --> 01:52:10,000
If this absolute difference is 0, which means independent, has no effect on carrier

843
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:19,000
You are doing this kind of thing. when you talk about, say a particular drug will reduce hypertension by 10%.

844
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:28,000
Alright how potential rate by 10% that's when you're only buying this absolute difference bye way

845
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:31,000
Nevertheless, there are many other way of summarizing the event.

846
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:48,000
What if you don't really summarize absolute difference but you summarize it relatively different. Say, you'll take the ratio of this, too, you know, in this case you could say the intervention seems like reduced Terry

847
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:56,000
Ray, bye? what's the 17% right absolute per second?

848
01:52:56,000 --> 01:53:09,000
Are you qualified by the relative rate? You actually can say that intervention reduce the carry rate by 3 full, because you draw from 28% to 9%.

849
01:53:09,000 --> 01:53:12,000
So this 17% is the difference is the actual difference.

850
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:26,000
But 3 port is a relative different right they're a different way you'll stay the same event

851
01:53:26,000 --> 01:53:32,000
Okay. and i'm going to talk about even more strange one for all ratio.

852
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:45,000
Oh, here first bar, with me right so there's a relative there's a There is the absolute difference, and there's a relative difference in the right, and that's the point

853
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:51,000
For example, when you hear about you know the w-h-o.

854
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:53,000
They are now put. Third, Many offer right once in a while.

855
01:53:53,000 --> 01:53:59,000
There are some study, and they announced that something is Carso Genesis right?

856
01:53:59,000 --> 01:54:05,000
For example, they say things calls cancel right?

857
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:10,000
We know smoking cost cancer alcohol calls cans are almost, you know, many in cost Canada.

858
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:17,000
Nowadays. If you go to say California they require by law, I think part of the genesis. things will be noted right, you know, managing cause cancer.

859
01:54:17,000 --> 01:54:26,000
Well, then, there's a study. Say, for example many years ago. several years ago, they say process the meet you know cause cancer, especially.

860
01:54:26,000 --> 01:54:37,000
I think it's call oracle council right So process meat probably means bacon, and the sauce and other things right.

861
01:54:37,000 --> 01:54:41,000
But you have to look at a study and see how they summarize the the result right?

862
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:46,000
They probably did mostly observational, large scale co-host study.

863
01:54:46,000 --> 01:54:52,000
They reduce. For example, you know, they increase the chance of Colorado Cancer, for example.

864
01:54:52,000 --> 01:55:01,000
Usually when they say that they have a they have a ratio of, say, 1 point, 2 for 1.5.

865
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:07,000
What does that really mean. But that's exactly what i'm going to talk about here.

866
01:55:07,000 --> 01:55:12,000
The way people summarize their effect. Size is very tricky.

867
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:14,000
Okay, Now we have 2 wheels up around the impact. Right?

868
01:55:14,000 --> 01:55:18,000
Why is the actual difference? the optimizer relative ratio Third way.

869
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:23,000
So, for all the ratio

870
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:29,000
What is the odd? All the ratio? the odd ratio is the ratio of the off.

871
01:55:29,000 --> 01:55:39,000
And what is the off the off he's the proportion divided by one minus.

872
01:55:39,000 --> 01:55:47,000
So P is the proportion of P over minus P is the odd in this case, right?

873
01:55:47,000 --> 01:55:53,000
28% is the proportion of carry in the non-c intervention group.

874
01:55:53,000 --> 01:55:59,000
Then the aws in the now in the control group right in the now individual group is 28, divided by one minus 28.

875
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:12,000
It's 39%. So the risk you could say the rest of the valid and carry is 28% in the 9 individual group, but also 39%.

876
01:56:12,000 --> 01:56:18,000
I will, you know you may find this all a little strange or why do we even capital this?

877
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:22,000
They're actually a good reason. mathematical reason they don't. but that was the last.

878
01:56:22,000 --> 01:56:40,000
Now you can understand, pause in just different way of representing a risk, and in the individual group is 9% divided by one minus 9%, which is 10%

879
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:46,000
So when you have a rest of 50%, then 50 over one minus 50 is actually one.

880
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:52,000
So all of the one means the rest of oh, 0 point 5, right, but also above below.

881
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,000
What means the risk, green or less than you know. 0 Point 5.

882
01:56:56,000 --> 01:57:02,000
Just bear with me. I explain more later. on why we're even doing this.

883
01:57:02,000 --> 01:57:20,000
You're gonna see this all the ratio many times in in reading literature any questions so far

884
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:35,000
Okay. So in this particular table, that's the how do we compute all the ratio, it turns out the odd ratio for the from a 2 by 2 table is very easy to compute right So from this calculation by

885
01:57:35,000 --> 01:57:38,000
the Os in the individual group is 10%. the Os.

886
01:57:38,000 --> 01:57:41,000
In the control group. Now, 800 group is 39%.

887
01:57:41,000 --> 01:57:47,000
Then the odds ratio, or is called, or is simply 10% divided by 39%.

888
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,000
Right. So you just do that backup that give you 0 point 2 5.

889
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:57,000
That's the odd rational or you can you burn them right? This is the odds racial of the interventional group versus non-negative goal.

890
01:57:57,000 --> 01:58:00,000
The the The other ratio is the non-division group.

891
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:04,000
First of the intervention group, which will be full right. Just pull up.

892
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:15,000
This will be 4. This is the one you'll say It Seems like intervention, right?

893
01:58:15,000 --> 01:58:27,000
Reduced the off by 75% or you can Say Now, individually increase the Us by 400 times, provide by 400% right? about 4 times.

894
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:31,000
That's the same thing stating it that's my way you read a you know.

895
01:58:31,000 --> 01:58:35,000
News article, saying, You know, eating process meet like 1 one unit.

896
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:39,000
A day will increase your off. for developing, call record kind of test.

897
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:50,000
Or if I say, you know 1.5 1 point there's all 3 for 1 point, 2 right that's exactly what they're talking about.

898
01:58:50,000 --> 01:58:55,000
Now let's go back to the contentious payload you see like it turns out that we don't have to go through all this, you know.

899
01:58:55,000 --> 01:59:01,000
Detailed calculation we get all rational Bravo! Continuous table is very easy to get all racial.

900
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:13,000
You just multiply the 2 number on the diagonal that divided by the 2 number on the off diagram, so 626, divided by 10 times 2662.

901
01:59:13,000 --> 01:59:18,000
That's the data. when you do this calculator you got the same author ratio.

902
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:23,000
So it turned out. all you did here in the end is equal to just doing this.

903
01:59:23,000 --> 01:59:26,000
Okay, So all the ratio is very easily measured, you know.

904
01:59:26,000 --> 01:59:32,000
Go back to contenders and table. So with this is all the racial hat.

905
01:59:32,000 --> 01:59:46,000
Because we are using the Os. ratio we calculated from the sample who have them in all directory in the population the population has a true ratio, which is a parameter.

906
01:59:46,000 --> 01:59:50,000
So we've got all our ha all ratio hat is 0 point 2, 5.

907
01:59:50,000 --> 02:00:03,000
We conclude that the halls of developing carriers 4 times lower in children with parents using intervention, dying children with Paris, not using intervention

908
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:12,000
Okay. So whenever you're running for a study with this design of 2 by 2 contentious table, usually they report the audio, which is very weird.

909
02:00:12,000 --> 02:00:19,000
But I was playing later on. Why, that's the case it has to do with case control study number the last Now you understand.

910
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:27,000
What? How do we interpret that right

911
02:00:27,000 --> 02:00:35,000
So all the ratio of what means there's no association the larger it is from one.

912
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:42,000
The further away. It is from one right, either on the offside or downside, means more evidence against. no!

913
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:57,000
Is that there's a strong association

914
02:00:57,000 --> 02:01:01,000
Yeah, now, there's a third way once we have this odd ratio.

915
02:01:01,000 --> 02:01:10,000
There's a third away sticking them all right so the all have holidays of the customer has can be said that under the Mall, either P.

916
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:14,000
One equals p 2. that's the 2 sample proportion have or they are independent.

917
02:01:14,000 --> 02:01:19,000
That's the chi's worth have or you can say the all the ratio equals one that's the population.

918
02:01:19,000 --> 02:01:26,000
Option of the 2 variables equals one. This 3 way of stating the knowledge equivalent.

919
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:31,000
Similarly, a ton of people could be the algorithm not equal to one.

920
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:38,000
So now, what we did is that we couple of hours, Rachel, which is 0 point, 2, 5, which is far away from one.

921
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:50,000
And now we got a key idle point. Alright, it turns out that the Chi squad has to give you a p-value, and the 2 sample proportion has to give a p value that will be the same key value right which is also the

922
02:01:50,000 --> 02:02:01,000
keyword against all 3 for one and beyond that there's actually a formula to get a 95% polynomial for the audio.

923
02:02:01,000 --> 02:02:04,000
I'm not going to show you the formula because it's just add more convocation right?

924
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:10,000
It's hard for me to explain why the problem looks like it is but the spreadsheet you know it's scratch.

925
02:02:10,000 --> 02:02:20,000
It's probably exercise. We actually have the polymer. So we have a computer, 95% common number for the ratio, which will be the same thing if the this time you the 95% common interval of the ratio

926
02:02:20,000 --> 02:02:39,000
does not include one. they would reject them all it's not 0 anymore, because the the population you know no values what not 0 Sorry if the company doesn't include what they will check them all

927
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:49,000
So because you know time usual right i'll i'll go by relatively quickly today of this lecture, and then we do some exercise on Monday.

928
02:02:49,000 --> 02:02:53,000
I will revisit, You know why people do all ratio, and so on, and so forth.

929
02:02:53,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Okay, right now, just bear with me there's something called audio for which is why we use

930
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:26,000
Any questions so far

931
02:03:26,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Okay. So

932
02:03:33,000 --> 02:03:45,000
Yeah, let's talk difference right there's a 2 way of quantifying the the fact size, but they're not one to one.

933
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:50,000
So they they they measure a different thing. For example, if P.

934
02:03:50,000 --> 02:03:55,000
One is 10%. keep it with 30% Then the absolute risk difference is 20%.

935
02:03:55,000 --> 02:04:07,000
That's the difference of them right Well, the ratio if you calculate it, because 3.8 almost 3.9.

936
02:04:07,000 --> 02:04:12,000
So it's a very large cost ratio why do you have a different P.

937
02:04:12,000 --> 02:04:17,000
One Q. 2. Now it's 30 versus 50 the absolute risk difference is 2, 20%, right?

938
02:04:17,000 --> 02:04:23,000
So that if you take the difference, you know 10 versus 30% or 30 versus 50%.

939
02:04:23,000 --> 02:04:31,000
The difference is the same. Well, the all the rate in the second case is 2 point, 3, 3, which is different from the first operation.

940
02:04:31,000 --> 02:04:42,000
So the odds ratio and absolute risk difference. they both measure the effect size you just like absolute difference.

941
02:04:42,000 --> 02:04:47,000
And the relative difference are not the same. the absolute difference in all regional also not the same.

942
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:53,000
You could have the same actual difference, but different odds, ratio, or you could have the same algorithm about different absolute difference.

943
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:58,000
They they match a different quality

944
02:04:58,000 --> 02:05:05,000
What I'm trying to say is that think about the call oracle case right in those article they study.

945
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:14,000
They show. For example, having process meet every day will increase our you know we'll have a hard ratio basic increase at all for the development call right.

946
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:20,000
Look cancer if they you know 1.2 or 1.5 right that's a look like a pretty strong alteration.

947
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:35,000
If you look at a company level. doesn't include one so it's clearly associated, might be the actual difference actual risk difference in those cases exactly tiny, because Colorado has like a rare disease.

948
02:05:35,000 --> 02:05:39,000
Is it like a y in Pennsylvania, or something like that?

949
02:05:39,000 --> 02:05:46,000
So eating process means every day will increase our rest. Oh, by finding it right.

950
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:52,000
So maybe you let's let's put aside all those you know call or inference type of argument of confounding.

951
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:55,000
Let's say it's real the auditory is 1.2.

952
02:05:55,000 --> 02:06:00,000
Then what you know. Suppose the baseline level is one intensity.

953
02:06:00,000 --> 02:06:06,000
The eating process need. Every day we will increase our base level to 1 point, 2 for 10,000.

954
02:06:06,000 --> 02:06:09,000
Well, you still have a very tiny risk at the bottom, that cancer.

955
02:06:09,000 --> 02:06:19,000
But if you look at all, Rachel, it's pretty hot exactly, not 1 point for you, even 1.1 the operation is not the same as a relative risk.

956
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Okay. So So basically i'm saying when you look at all the ratio, you don't really know what exactly absolute risk differences there, because that depend on the baseline risk when the baseline risk is lower the odd

957
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:37,000
ratio will be higher

958
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:43,000
With the same level of absolute risk. difference.

959
02:06:43,000 --> 02:06:49,000
Yeah, I'm saying, changing from 1% to 1.2% is a large change, relatively by the small change.

960
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:58,000
Absolutely right. So keep that in mind. there's no contradiction just depend on the way to summarize it.

961
02:06:58,000 --> 02:07:12,000
Alright. So, as I mentioned earlier, this high school has association is a generalization that the 2 sample proportion has where the 2 sample proportion has only apply on 2 by 2.

962
02:07:12,000 --> 02:07:18,000
Table. But this high school has association apply on any size of table which means Dio.

963
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:22,000
Exposure could be categorical, and your outcome could be categorical. With Mona.

964
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:27,000
2 classes

965
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:34,000
And, on the other hand, this Chi squared has is asymptotic between the exposure and outcome.

966
02:07:34,000 --> 02:07:39,000
So these 2 2 sample proportion tests exactly asymptotic right.

967
02:07:39,000 --> 02:07:41,000
One better of variables used to define the 2 group.

968
02:07:41,000 --> 02:07:43,000
The other binary variable is used to define outcome.

969
02:07:43,000 --> 02:07:49,000
But this Chi Square test. If you look at the statistics

970
02:07:49,000 --> 02:08:01,000
When you compute this table you didn't really care which is the role which is a column, you can flip the roll in the call, and you got the same table flip this the statistic also doesn't care the role in the

971
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:09,000
problem, which means that you can Actually, you can actually swap the exposure outcome.

972
02:08:09,000 --> 02:08:12,000
You will get the same key value from Chi squared test.

973
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Hi smart pet doesn't really care what is the exposure was it outcome right?

974
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:32,000
So no have. all the same, the 2 variable independent. It does really care which one of the exposure we started to all call, and when your computer, all of the ratio, you see the house ratio is 6 times 26 over

975
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:37,000
60, 62 times 10. it's also symmetric you can swap, row in a column.

976
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:44,000
It's already also doesn't change so the now how about it, say all, Rio, because one also is symmetric.

977
02:08:44,000 --> 02:08:55,000
So the whole thing of Chi scrap path doesn't really care about which is the role which is a column which is the exposure which is the call it doesn't care.

978
02:08:55,000 --> 02:09:02,000
So the customer has more general you can't you must beate association between 2 categorical variable.

979
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:10,000
Each can have more than 4 categories

980
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:14,000
So it's in that sense is even more general than the not the you know.

981
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:27,000
Generalization from 2 sample key high school to one over right, because on Nova, although you have audible group by each group, you only have a continuous variable right here, you know, in high school test.

982
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:29,000
You could have multiple group that each group has multiple of outcome.

983
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:37,000
So you put everything into a gigantic, you know. Contenders say, Well, you guys still run pi square test on it. How do you call the one P by all of them?

984
02:09:37,000 --> 02:09:48,000
For the customer has only have the association between the role in the column variable

985
02:09:48,000 --> 02:09:54,000
Okay, in this particular case.

986
02:09:54,000 --> 02:09:57,000
Let's suppose we still have a binary exposure about.

987
02:09:57,000 --> 02:10:03,000
We have a multi-calry or category call which is not a limitation.

988
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:08,000
We could actually have a multi category exposure that just make the interpretation much harder.

989
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:21,000
So now let's say the exposure is employment status employed versus oning point, and all call is, you know, overall health right from poor fair good to excellent you're not with all of them you would think like

990
02:10:21,000 --> 02:10:27,000
this. Now you have a tool by 4 paper, because one variable has 2 level, the other variable is 4 level.

991
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:34,000
You put everything into the 2 by 4 table, and then you have roll and the column phones.

992
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:43,000
Now you can run high school test I don't know how about saying this 2 parabol and independent

993
02:10:43,000 --> 02:10:56,000
Think about how your computer, The expected table is essentially the same formula and a high school statistics

994
02:10:56,000 --> 02:11:10,000
And then, however, although chi-squared, has worked on this type of label, the definition of pause racial, it's restricted to 2 by 2 table right, because you need a full timeline so the

995
02:11:10,000 --> 02:11:14,000
computer all visual on this table. You need to specify 2 columns.

996
02:11:14,000 --> 02:11:20,000
So what i'm saying you can compute manual operation just like in a nova in the post office you've got.

997
02:11:20,000 --> 02:11:25,000
You can compare many pairwise to 2 sub 2 group, right same thing. here.

998
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:30,000
You can you can't pick any 2 column come to the audio.

999
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:40,000
So there are many operators. You can compute we've got to build all the ratio between poorer versus good, or you can compute all the ratio, if you think fair or is this excellent right

1000
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:43,000
you can compute all the it will be at any 2 levels.

1001
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:48,000
Basically, you restrict yourself to 2 column owning and can be the operation there.

1002
02:11:48,000 --> 02:11:54,000
We're gonna pick a level as a baseline and compute all the ratio of dialogue against every other level.

1003
02:11:54,000 --> 02:12:04,000
Right. So now you have 4 levels you're come to build 6 different alterations, just like the you know pairwise comparison.

1004
02:12:04,000 --> 02:12:09,000
What i'm saying is that running a high school has on this we will reject.

1005
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:19,000
If you've got to keep out of that's 1.5, we'll reject the overall now saying this 2 variable are independent, which means at least 2 level.

1006
02:12:19,000 --> 02:12:26,000
We have a halfway for not equal to one just like I know you don't really know which to level you have to do post on path, to see?

1007
02:12:26,000 --> 02:12:33,000
Which to that will have different operations. right it's just a parallel here.

1008
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:39,000
Right. For example, here we compute all the all regional, poorer, fair, and the good versus excellent.

1009
02:12:39,000 --> 02:12:43,000
We got different log ratio, and some of them are far away from one.

1010
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:54,000
Some of them are close to one

1011
02:12:54,000 --> 02:13:00,000
And when you run a high school path of the big table.

1012
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:06,000
So now have all of this, either saying the role in the column are independent, or you could say all the 3 operator R.

1013
02:13:06,000 --> 02:13:11,000
One actually all the 6 o'clock all this if this 3 are one, then the remaining 3, also one.

1014
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:22,000
So all the Rachel among all the levels are one, or you could simply say one variable is unrelated with the other, or not associated or independent, no matter how to stay.

1015
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:26,000
Okay, the alternative is saying, there are. They are associated.

1016
02:13:26,000 --> 02:13:29,000
We say at least one of the operator is not one.

1017
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:36,000
Think about what we did in one way over. some other thing happened here

1018
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:42,000
And now let's run the customer path again. we compute the expected table right for any number.

1019
02:13:42,000 --> 02:13:47,000
Here we simply take the the road song, modify the column sound divided by the total sound.

1020
02:13:47,000 --> 02:13:53,000
You got this number right? They got this table. They computer high school statistic right?

1021
02:13:53,000 --> 02:13:59,000
Subtracted 2 table standardized you know square them the distance and then standardized by the by the exact account, and add them together.

1022
02:13:59,000 --> 02:14:04,000
So you got a high school statistic in this particular high school.

1023
02:14:04,000 --> 02:14:14,000
It is very big, Nevertheless, it has a degree of freedom of 3, because there are 4 column, 2 row, so it's 4, minus one times 2 minus one, as 3.

1024
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:18,000
So this high school statistics have a degree of freedom 3, and then you look up in the paper or use a software.

1025
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:34,000
They will tell you the cosmic key value is very tiny which means we have strong evidence against the not which means employment is strongly associated with most significantly associated with health, but it doesn't tell us how the association is

1026
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:38,000
formed. So to do that we need to look at an individual.

1027
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:45,000
All the ratio, or even their own call the interval or run, you know, pair, wise post hot test.

1028
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:59,000
Really figure out how the associated is phone. The only one Kysburg has only rejected all saying they are associated

1029
02:14:59,000 --> 02:15:06,000
So I i'm i'm sorry for the very you know length and lecture, because there are a lot of things to cover.

1030
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:09,000
I will review a little bit about this. all ratio and other things.

1031
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:20,000
On on Monday morning. I want to, you know. Pick a break now, and I use the rest of time today to exercise any question before the break.

1032
02:15:20,000 --> 02:15:25,000
Oh, you could actually, you know, start taking a break, and You can add people passing as has been during the break.

1033
02:15:25,000 --> 02:15:55,000
Let's take a break Now thank you

1034
02:25:19,000 --> 02:25:24,000
Okay, that's fine. continue. So for the rest of time today.

1035
02:25:24,000 --> 02:25:32,000
We can focus on Project 8 8, but nevertheless. you know, regardless whether we can finish or not.

1036
02:25:32,000 --> 02:25:34,000
It won't be due until tuesday so if we finish the day.

1037
02:25:34,000 --> 02:25:39,000
Of course, I feel free to submit any time right, but it is due on Tuesday morning, and also the postdoc request.

1038
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:46,000
Do you want Thursday morning on monday we're gonna review the lecture a little bit, and also do 8 video awesome.

1039
02:25:46,000 --> 02:26:00,000
And the project is here is to do is article on violence against women in selected Harris and us in particular, deal with a table one and the tool in the article.

1040
02:26:00,000 --> 02:26:03,000
So you can open the article given here articles here.

1041
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:08,000
You can read it a little bit. But we are gonna focus on paper.

1042
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:12,000
One very long table go to focus on fuel garbage on the table.

1043
02:26:12,000 --> 02:26:16,000
Yeah. and table, 2 focus on the 2 boxes in the table.

1044
02:26:16,000 --> 02:26:21,000
So basically need to understand a where the pay always evolved the number in the paper on the boxes. right?

1045
02:26:21,000 --> 02:26:34,000
You're gonna materially learn today. So when you answer the question, you may need to use the the high smart test brashi which will provide here.

1046
02:26:34,000 --> 02:26:39,000
So when you follow the spreadsheet look like this, I explain a little bit, but you know there are.

1047
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:48,000
There are gray boxes here. you can read right. So the data goes in the 2 columns here, just like the Unknowna.

1048
02:26:48,000 --> 02:26:53,000
The first column is the group indicator. The second column is all calm.

1049
02:26:53,000 --> 02:27:07,000
So, although the customer has dealt with arbitrary size of table due to the limit, Hey, you on the scratchy right here we can only deal with module groups could be 2, but could be molecule and a binary

1050
02:27:07,000 --> 02:27:10,000
outcome so he's always binding and i'll call Yep.

1051
02:27:10,000 --> 02:27:15,000
You can't have multiple group as an exposure i'm similar. You put a group label here. you have a 5 group.

1052
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:18,000
You. You put 1, 2, 3, 4, you have 4 group. You just remove this one.

1053
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:24,000
Once you put all the data here in the group label this count table, you will be automatically get talented.

1054
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:30,000
I'm in to gather with the with the the marginal.

1055
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:38,000
I'm. in the high school will be carry out with a pivotal policy here, and then you you'll be estimate the P. one P.

1056
02:27:38,000 --> 02:27:46,000
2 up to P. T. 5. So they are kind of maximum, 5 groups, and also for any group, hey versus B, A.

1057
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:49,000
L. C. and so on. It will capture the odd ratio.

1058
02:27:49,000 --> 02:27:53,000
The 95% confinable for the audio which I mentioned cost, and the P.

1059
02:27:53,000 --> 02:27:59,000
Value for that particular 2 group. So this is a post-hog pairwise comparison, just like the Nova.

1060
02:27:59,000 --> 02:28:14,000
This is without phone for any corruption so you know Do the combat pronouncing yourself similarly if you don't have the raw data, you have fuel on the paper, yourself, right?

1061
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:27,000
Just fill the number here. but that will break the we'll break the link between the Dave data and the themselves right?

1062
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:32,000
So if you use the data again, you have to undo your changes or download the new table.

1063
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:52,000
So any question regard we're going to do with this table although access has in general, before I send you to breakout rooms

1064
02:28:52,000 --> 02:29:02,000
I will again set up breakout rooms for 25 min, and the you feel free to join the room, or, you know, switch room, or stay in the main room.

1065
02:29:02,000 --> 02:29:32,000
Either way, whatever works for you, and then I will see you in 25 min.

1066
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:26,000
Hey? Hello, everyone! Oh, did I hope you had a good time on working on this?

1067
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:33,000
You may not have enough time to finish. but that's fine we'll go over to the other if we've finished the day.

1068
02:55:33,000 --> 02:55:37,000
Feel free to send that, or you can wait until Monday to sun man.

1069
02:55:37,000 --> 02:55:49,000
First question is to ask how to use the sales spreadsheet for chasper, as you tell me if there is a significant overall association between the problems and emotional it's going to sexual abuse and kind of

1070
02:55:49,000 --> 02:56:10,000
woman's age right provide evidence let's first review what the table is about so table wise here specifically asking us to study the the type of abuse essentially 3 type of deals, and then a multiple versus the

1071
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:14,000
age we aren't given here and there are 3 age group so

1072
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:21,000
You could say that age group might exposure there are 3 group the I'll call off also 3 or 4 groups right?

1073
02:56:21,000 --> 02:56:29,000
It's kind of article by categorical so our especially it doesn't allow us to do this analysis directly.

1074
02:56:29,000 --> 02:56:32,000
So instead, what we can do is that we can look at each.

1075
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:44,000
Hi, Paul, abuse course with the rest. right So because we have the total number of people in that call. for if we know these are the number people have that abuse, then we can think about the remaining, or those with all that abuse although the multiple is

1076
02:56:44,000 --> 02:56:49,000
a little complicated that's just for simplicity assume you know. they're not there.

1077
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:54,000
So this number subtract this number will be the number without abuse.

1078
02:56:54,000 --> 02:56:58,000
Then we can turn it into a 2 by 3 table because there are 3 age group.

1079
02:56:58,000 --> 02:57:08,000
So that's try to use our strategy to do that job. So because we're not gonna have rodies that are just directly filled in the numbers here.

1080
02:57:08,000 --> 02:57:14,000
So first type in the the 3 groups right so now we have 3 groups.

1081
02:57:14,000 --> 02:57:19,000
Let's take out this full group right so group one let's let's look at it.

1082
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:26,000
Group. One is this is let's put it here 18 to 26 years old.

1083
02:57:26,000 --> 02:57:36,000
Group. 2 is 23, 5, 7, to 33, and this is greater than 34 greater equal than 34.

1084
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:45,000
So the total we can first building the total 7 37 8, 37, 5 oh, 2 7 60 for the 3 group.

1085
02:57:45,000 --> 02:57:56,000
I'm. Then if you pull in the the emotion let's first do the emotional views that's 2, 7, 6, 1, 57, 2, 2, 3.

1086
02:57:56,000 --> 02:57:59,000
You see that the the non-emotional number is actually automatically.

1087
02:57:59,000 --> 02:58:04,000
If you eat, you don't have to do anything so now we have a 3 by 2 table.

1088
02:58:04,000 --> 02:58:09,000
The columns are emotional views or not the rolls on the 3 age group.

1089
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:14,000
I'm done, the chi-square task is automatically conducted on this 3 by 3 table we got A.

1090
02:58:14,000 --> 02:58:20,000
P. V. 0 point 9 for 2, 1, 2, 9, 4.

1091
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:33,000
So this is apparently nothing. which means there's a lack of evidence showing 8, you know, Basically, the different age group has the same rate of emotional abuse.

1092
02:58:33,000 --> 02:58:37,000
So that's how I approach the problem. if you have a different idea you know.

1093
02:58:37,000 --> 02:58:56,000
I'm have you look here about it any comment

1094
02:58:56,000 --> 02:59:02,000
And apparently you can do the same. for that's first look at a number here, right

1095
02:59:02,000 --> 02:59:08,000
The 3 proportions are 33%, 31.3% of 29%.

1096
02:59:08,000 --> 02:59:13,000
They're very close that's also supporting that there's no real difference among them.

1097
02:59:13,000 --> 02:59:16,000
Not with the last you can computer 3 group calls ratio.

1098
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:23,000
Why is one Oh, 8, 1 point, 1 8, and 1.1 0.

1099
02:59:23,000 --> 02:59:27,000
So the 3 group of all ratio they're all greater than one.

1100
02:59:27,000 --> 02:59:32,000
Nevertheless. you know the completion of an operation.

1101
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:37,000
They all include one, which means we cannot rule out that's awesome for the 2 o'clock.

1102
02:59:37,000 --> 02:59:43,000
One which is also cause one of the pivotal poles, are large regards to do about Ronnie fraction or not.

1103
02:59:43,000 --> 02:59:48,000
All of these are insignificant

1104
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:53,000
So there is someone in the chat saying, for reminding us.

1105
02:59:53,000 --> 02:59:58,000
Not try saying, I added a number of all the abuse together, instead of doing them separately.

1106
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:04,000
Yeah, that's totally fine. I I says post you get the same number here, right?

1107
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:08,000
Yeah, just easier this way. But you put your data in that way.

1108
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:22,000
Correct. So if we do the same for physical views, we got 4 O 1, 1 8, one no sorry, one in 1 87 and 1 33.

1109
03:00:22,000 --> 03:00:25,000
See this remaining, you know, non physical views are automatically capitalist.

1110
03:00:25,000 --> 03:00:35,000
You don't. have to build them in Now the pio is you know 0 point 0 5 7 that's the case where it is marginal. right?

1111
03:00:35,000 --> 03:00:43,000
So it showed some levels of evidence is not strong enough to reject them all.

1112
03:00:43,000 --> 03:00:50,000
You see that in the youngest group there are more physical abuse, or the difference is not big enough.

1113
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:58,000
We'll check the know, even giving the sample size like this right? And then the odd ratio is also what higher than one.

1114
03:00:58,000 --> 03:01:07,000
But this interval includes one. This info barely exclude one, which is also corresponding to the P value.

1115
03:01:07,000 --> 03:01:13,000
There is smaller than Point or 5. well can see the we are doing 3 tasks here.

1116
03:01:13,000 --> 03:01:17,000
The color we only we are really going to look at is point 0 point 0 1 7. right?

1117
03:01:17,000 --> 03:01:28,000
Using val product fraction. so we cannot really conclude I mean anything any difference, although you know the piece of evidence here is stronger than the for the emotional abuse.

1118
03:01:28,000 --> 03:01:37,000
Similarly for sectional abuse, which is 47, 32 69.

1119
03:01:37,000 --> 03:01:44,000
This time we indeed get a pivotal lesson point or 5

1120
03:01:44,000 --> 03:02:00,000
So just based on a key value itself, we could conclude that you know the the older group, The oldest group, has a higher seems like, have a higher rate of sexual abuse, which is also the concordant with the rate here the

1121
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:04,000
highest. Also, if you look at all the ratio right.

1122
03:02:04,000 --> 03:02:10,000
This all the ratio this all the ratio the highest versus the flow with the group.

1123
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:16,000
They're all the racial is below one right with the p by 0 point 0.

1124
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:20,000
One less than the cut off 0 point 0 1 7.

1125
03:02:20,000 --> 03:02:26,000
Right, So seems like we are rejecting the null, and seems like we find a significant difference among the youngest.

1126
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:31,000
And all this school

1127
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:36,000
Okay, go ahead each of you. Yeah, I mean take time. Sorry.

1128
03:02:36,000 --> 03:02:44,000
First we were just talking about this in our group i'm sorry Goodbye.

1129
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:49,000
Seems like I lost you froze so i'm gonna get to go.

1130
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:53,000
So the the question, Go ahead, Sarah, you're back on my back.

1131
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:58,000
Sorry I don't know what happened my question is to start off with.

1132
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:02,000
If your p-value is significant for the old or insane it's not significant.

1133
03:03:02,000 --> 03:03:07,000
Right, so it's greater than 0 point 0 5 which I know earlier was like point 0.

1134
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:26,000
5 something. just barely over we stop there though right we really see that at this point you cannot reject the null, or i'm confusing myself, Yeah, you you cannot reject the null hypothesis and therefore you wouldn't

1135
03:03:26,000 --> 03:03:35,000
really even look at your pairwise comparisons right, although I mean, I know we did, because it was barely over, and we saw that it was barely like we found something that was barely significant.

1136
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:46,000
Between A. and C. But generally speaking, I could stop there right this one.

1137
03:03:46,000 --> 03:03:50,000
Yeah, look at this. we could stop we don't have to look at this .

1138
03:03:50,000 --> 03:03:56,000
As a exercise. Okay? And then my second question is, when we go into the pairways.

1139
03:03:56,000 --> 03:04:07,000
Comparisons in order to really make any conclusions or inferences, or whatever you need to apply the bond for any corre correction.

1140
03:04:07,000 --> 03:04:12,000
Because we're comparing multiple or we're We're.

1141
03:04:12,000 --> 03:04:22,000
Running multiple tests. Yup: Okay, that's right thank you So my question there was, what was the

1142
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:32,000
So like on this one. the number of tests right for the bomb for the correction.

1143
03:04:32,000 --> 03:04:45,000
Here is a 10 Are my counting on We have 3 group right, so we will run 3 past

1144
03:04:45,000 --> 03:04:51,000
Right Here we are on 3 past 3 key vials, Thank you.

1145
03:04:51,000 --> 03:04:55,000
That makes sense. If I have 5 rules don't have 10 yeah, thanks for both your questions.

1146
03:04:55,000 --> 03:05:05,000
Now I have a scorn of a Oh, if they not so comfortable question in the sense that we look at this key value along.

1147
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:09,000
It's significant i'll recall we just did another 2 P.

1148
03:05:09,000 --> 03:05:18,000
Values. right? So do we consider that as multiple testing Hi this is the same data side, Optimal?

1149
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:24,000
Well, we'll look at a different variable right if we consider that, too, as a multiple testing.

1150
03:05:24,000 --> 03:05:31,000
Then we just look at 3. Then, taking that into consideration, this one is nothing right.

1151
03:05:31,000 --> 03:05:36,000
So So I at at what stage you'll stop thinking about multiple testing.

1152
03:05:36,000 --> 03:05:41,000
That's a very, very controversial question so when you are doing this post.

1153
03:05:41,000 --> 03:05:47,000
Half path. People agree. you definitely look at about having but when you test different variable in the same table.

1154
03:05:47,000 --> 03:05:57,000
Some people do something. People don't right and when you consider all the people in the same lab, all all the different left.

1155
03:05:57,000 --> 03:06:02,000
Nobody do the multiple testing for those right? So basically, where do we draw the line?

1156
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:11,000
Is this sort of a controversial Yeah, no matter where you draw the line. the module testing issue is there right? So you know that that's the That's the point.

1157
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:14,000
I'm saying, people look at his peabody alone it's significant.

1158
03:06:14,000 --> 03:06:25,000
But you just run another 2 right so hey? whole message is that you'd be run along the path.

1159
03:06:25,000 --> 03:06:32,000
It's not actually that crucial What exactly cut off you use because the color itself is arbitrary.

1160
03:06:32,000 --> 03:06:37,000
It is crucial for you to report that you run so many tests.

1161
03:06:37,000 --> 03:06:41,000
So people can make their own call right say if people know You're right?

1162
03:06:41,000 --> 03:06:46,000
Whether you call this negative or not doesn't matter because people can make their own judgment.

1163
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:56,000
But the worst is that you run 3 paths you only report one you didn't even tell people you run the other tool, and that would be problematic.

1164
03:06:56,000 --> 03:07:02,000
So going back to the paper, you see that in the table, too, they run so many, half right.

1165
03:07:02,000 --> 03:07:07,000
Each star. Here is a tab, Hey, run a test of every single operation.

1166
03:07:07,000 --> 03:07:11,000
In this paper there are probably a 101 and they didn't do about running correction.

1167
03:07:11,000 --> 03:07:14,000
They just say P is less than point, or 5 itself. Is one star right?

1168
03:07:14,000 --> 03:07:21,000
Less than point or one is 2 star I don't really see the deep on chronic correction.

1169
03:07:21,000 --> 03:07:24,000
They didn't mention you have search you know a Bonkarani.

1170
03:07:24,000 --> 03:07:31,000
It's not in the paper by multiple testing right not in the paper.

1171
03:07:31,000 --> 03:07:39,000
I didn't read the paper on. work. by work I just from my intuition, you know, from my experience, they did the Dupont chronic corruption.

1172
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:48,000
So if you think about see up seeing a key by the lesson point or 5 in this table doesn't really say a lot, because if nothing is coming out, i'm going to see a few pivotal that's 1 point

1173
03:07:48,000 --> 03:08:01,000
5 other, and these, although they didn't do byronic fraction they told you they run this manufact, so you make your own call, whether you trust it not Personally, I think it's still good because you see there are so many key by

1174
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:07,000
the lesson point. Oh, one, by taking that college into consideration, you know those are still significant.

1175
03:08:07,000 --> 03:08:13,000
Even if you adjust for bomb for any practice. Oh, 50 of them! right?

1176
03:08:13,000 --> 03:08:18,000
So you have to make it on call at some point. But the worst is not about.

1177
03:08:18,000 --> 03:08:23,000
I. I think the the biggest issue is that you are aware of this module testing, so try to avoid it.

1178
03:08:23,000 --> 03:08:31,000
Twice will be comprehensive in the type of analysis you can do, and in the all analysis you have done to report them.

1179
03:08:31,000 --> 03:08:40,000
So the worth and that is that you you tried a 100 different tests via one of them being significant and only right about that one.

1180
03:08:40,000 --> 03:08:52,000
And now even mentioned you did another 99 which I need significant That's where the problem really lies by that. that's the most you know That's That's the most important.

1181
03:08:52,000 --> 03:09:00,000
You know thing value to be aware of beyond that right whether you do corruption for a paper or not. it's sort of a controversial.

1182
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:11,000
Some people do want me to be out I hope that you know that's a little bit helpful what understand how you know how how to act on this issue.

1183
03:09:11,000 --> 03:09:14,000
Right, so be aware of the issue, and be careful what you do.

1184
03:09:14,000 --> 03:09:31,000
What might mislead the readers that's most important thing any questions, so far

1185
03:09:31,000 --> 03:09:40,000
Okay, no question to continue with one. There are specific age groups that differ from other age group.

1186
03:09:40,000 --> 03:09:47,000
With respect to all of this right? So I think what we found.

1187
03:09:47,000 --> 03:09:53,000
What is the problem? right? So for the this is the third.

1188
03:09:53,000 --> 03:09:56,000
This is the sexual abuse, right for sexual abuse.

1189
03:09:56,000 --> 03:10:00,000
We find a the youngest group versus the oldest group.

1190
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:05,000
We have a ratio of 0 point 6, which is significant just by myself, Right?

1191
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:12,000
Which means that the young group has second been lower sexual abuse than the oldest group.

1192
03:10:12,000 --> 03:10:17,000
So for the face like how abused this one is.

1193
03:10:17,000 --> 03:10:23,000
Sort of a interesting, but the Pv. value is not exactly the kind of optical consideration.

1194
03:10:23,000 --> 03:10:34,000
Nevertheless, I think it's. worth mentioning right see any the mid age, I mean the the youngest group is lower than all this group in terms of physical views.

1195
03:10:34,000 --> 03:10:42,000
But it's nothing. Everything in the emotional abuse.

1196
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:48,000
No! this is

1197
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:55,000
This is the emotional abuse It doesn't seem like any of the odd ratio is significant.

1198
03:10:55,000 --> 03:10:59,000
Okay, So that's basically how I would summarize my finding right.

1199
03:10:59,000 --> 03:11:06,000
Can you summarize that One more time, please, for a sexual abuse?

1200
03:11:06,000 --> 03:11:19,000
So young this cool and pause 63 or 6 times lower.

1201
03:11:19,000 --> 03:11:28,000
Not lower that pasta, all of this Google: right? Yeah.

1202
03:11:28,000 --> 03:11:32,000
So you could say more. For example, 95%.

1203
03:11:32,000 --> 03:11:39,000
Common. The interval is 0 point 4 4 1 2 0 point 8, 9. right?

1204
03:11:39,000 --> 03:11:41,000
So that's what I would write you could also write for the physical abuse.

1205
03:11:41,000 --> 03:12:04,000
But that's Why, it's a little bit marginal by the youngest group, as i'm paused to 1.3 times that of the oldest right, But that is the you know, 95% commonable

1206
03:12:04,000 --> 03:12:11,000
was. Does 1 point, 1 1 point, 6, 7. You could write this one.

1207
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:22,000
Well, you know you could ignore it as well as off for you right? I mean, because it's it's It's this office, you know controversial, whether you're positive or not if I know whether you do multiple

1208
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:35,000
passing or now right? So all of this depend on how to do module passing. I think the company in the one, you know, Basically, if you report a comedy novel, you also report a number of tests, you did people come

1209
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:39,000
in make their own call by the who, how, how much they they, they trust.

1210
03:12:39,000 --> 03:12:52,000
This, finding any question

1211
03:12:52,000 --> 03:13:02,000
Okay, let's go on P. table, 2 hey? both of here, right actually in table 2 the author did the same analysis as we did.

1212
03:13:02,000 --> 03:13:15,000
We just did it's just a result. since different let's Look at them right in table, 2 in the 2 rows in the red box here displaying the facility Religious the odd ratio and 95 common interval

1213
03:13:15,000 --> 03:13:23,000
in the box. As to those you have in your expectation right now, our spreadsheet, you know, let's go all the way.

1214
03:13:23,000 --> 03:13:35,000
So this is the sexual abuse data. We have the audio here and the comedy in the book here, and they have the audio here.

1215
03:13:35,000 --> 03:13:40,000
Sexual, right? So these are the let's say just the the oldest versus the youngest 100.

1216
03:13:40,000 --> 03:13:45,000
They're all 3 choice. 1.6 9 they have the star there, which means it's less than 0 point 0 5 right.

1217
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:50,000
This is also by cell. Oh, we have a you know.

1218
03:13:50,000 --> 03:13:55,000
The youngest was also 0 point 6 0 point 6. We have a star here.

1219
03:13:55,000 --> 03:14:01,000
We have a combination of the number doesn't seem to be a lot right.

1220
03:14:01,000 --> 03:14:05,000
We have all sorts of 0 point 6 they have all those 1.6 9.

1221
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:11,000
So what's happening? any one can answer

1222
03:14:11,000 --> 03:14:20,000
Is the same analysis. How come the number is different so I'm speaking on behalf of group 2 here, they?

1223
03:14:20,000 --> 03:14:26,000
So like they're comparing like c versus a But then they're a cell phone comparing a versus, c.

1224
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:39,000
So in our group we we found that we have to take the reciprocal of the Os ratio, because the if you flip the at the Osborne equation, exactly thank you.

1225
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:44,000
Bye you're absolutely right, so the hard ratio will Flip, you could flip the numerous under denominator.

1226
03:14:44,000 --> 03:14:49,000
That's all right. so you'll flip this wine you got an operation, you'll flip the lower bound.

1227
03:14:49,000 --> 03:14:54,000
You got a hopper of our ratio to flip the upper bone at the lower bound of all our ratio.

1228
03:14:54,000 --> 03:14:57,000
So this is our company number you'll flip that you got this company.

1229
03:14:57,000 --> 03:15:02,000
So it is the same answer. The qi is the same it's just the way you'll measure them.

1230
03:15:02,000 --> 03:15:05,000
Why would it be auto that's that's basically going back to what i'm doing?

1231
03:15:05,000 --> 03:15:12,000
Pass right. This guy's part pet doesn't really care about the order of the 2 variable.

1232
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:16,000
They don't even even care the order of the 2 2 rows and columns.

1233
03:15:16,000 --> 03:15:22,000
Okay, if you have all ratio, which is like limit time, you have all the ratio which is significant in the app, you know.

1234
03:15:22,000 --> 03:15:25,000
The invitation will be harder to log than one or lower that one. Right?

1235
03:15:25,000 --> 03:15:31,000
So that I know we try the baseline, which one is the, you know, reference which tries the treatment.

1236
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:40,000
Any question here

1237
03:15:40,000 --> 03:15:52,000
Okay. So now let's move on to number 4 using the excel spreadsheet or Chi Scrap has determined if there's a significant overall association, you 2 problems that different views on the housing

1238
03:15:52,000 --> 03:16:02,000
situation right? So we are essentially doing the same thing. But now, instead of doing by age, but by housing right, so do it quickly.

1239
03:16:02,000 --> 03:16:16,000
The number is here. Where is the house?

1240
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:25,000
It's up a little bit so keep going up you go up right there.

1241
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:28,000
Oh, yeah, call me sorry. I had a hard time finding you just putting this numbers right in the table.

1242
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:39,000
Let's do it quickly. So the phone will now change

1243
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:54,000
Let's see that's first 2 emotional views, 2 to 9, 2 line, 4 1 2 1 30. right?

1244
03:16:54,000 --> 03:17:07,000
So the 3 type of housing now is the owner webinar and unstable, and let's say owner partner unstable.

1245
03:17:07,000 --> 03:17:12,000
So let's see this significant right we can also find all the key value.

1246
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:22,000
This tool will be significant by themselves, right so it seems like padding, or your your own house either opening it or running it.

1247
03:17:22,000 --> 03:17:29,000
We don't have last will be less abused i'm saying it, I see if it's a causal, but it's actually association.

1248
03:17:29,000 --> 03:17:36,000
Right. So, having your own house, either only or renting, it is less likely associated with less, you know.

1249
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:44,000
Abuse in your mental health right, which makes sense right and then the other 2.

1250
03:17:44,000 --> 03:17:49,000
You could do the other 2 i'm not going to do it which also correspond to back here right?

1251
03:17:49,000 --> 03:17:54,000
So they have their cause. racial, highly significant. They found out.

1252
03:17:54,000 --> 03:18:04,000
They they flipped the the numerator of the denominator. therefore they're obviously greater than one how all the rates are small one, But that's the same thing alright.

1253
03:18:04,000 --> 03:18:11,000
This is the automation. We just captain. Okay, So we did it.

1254
03:18:11,000 --> 03:18:17,000
And then again, we talk about this right because it's the separate call of the operation.

1255
03:18:17,000 --> 03:18:27,000
We we observe in our analysis so let's let's quickly, you know.

1256
03:18:27,000 --> 03:18:42,000
Go over the other 2. right? So if we do physical analysis, we got 1, 2, 6, one, a 6, 88 again as high as significant.

1257
03:18:42,000 --> 03:18:55,000
Again, the difference happens when you compare your own housing versus, you know, living with others on stable, right significantly lower than one, which is also correspond to this pause.

1258
03:18:55,000 --> 03:19:00,000
Ratio right? This is a gonna be large, that one.

1259
03:19:00,000 --> 03:19:05,000
And then, finally, sexual abuse I I believe is the same thing.

1260
03:19:05,000 --> 03:19:13,000
But let's just double tack 46 58, 43.

1261
03:19:13,000 --> 03:19:21,000
Yeah, it's highly significant this time. is that a little different right now.

1262
03:19:21,000 --> 03:19:23,000
It seems like when you compare with unstable housing.

1263
03:19:23,000 --> 03:19:32,000
The other 2 group has much lower. All racial right this time is not really having a home house.

1264
03:19:32,000 --> 03:19:39,000
Matter, or rather whether you have unstable housing. right?

1265
03:19:39,000 --> 03:19:43,000
So the other 2 is avers of beavers, and see, posts are significantly lower than one.

1266
03:19:43,000 --> 03:19:56,000
These one is all on one, but not nothing. So have your own house versus living with a partner Front doesn't really seem to make a difference, but rather compare with honest people how they make a huge difference which is what we see here.

1267
03:19:56,000 --> 03:20:06,000
Okay, this last significant. But this one is not right. I live with partner, friend versus having your home

1268
03:20:06,000 --> 03:20:19,000
Cool? any question, comment.

1269
03:20:19,000 --> 03:20:42,000
So I could write down right so for email no yeah for emotional and alright owner. Lander has lower, you know, off.

1270
03:20:42,000 --> 03:21:03,000
I'm done these other 2 groups right for sexual abuse which is really the unstable causing that higher awesome none.

1271
03:21:03,000 --> 03:21:12,000
The other 2 groups, so that's what you will find if you analyze the data and answer to this the same right.

1272
03:21:12,000 --> 03:21:15,000
The one showing table. 2 are the reciprocal of the ones we got in our strategy.

1273
03:21:15,000 --> 03:21:28,000
They're the same thing you just to change the baseline any questions so far

1274
03:21:28,000 --> 03:21:33,000
So because we find a strong association this time between how housing situation and the abuse right?

1275
03:21:33,000 --> 03:21:41,000
Do you think that association is causal? and if not right, what are other things like?

1276
03:21:41,000 --> 03:21:58,000
Could be confounded

1277
03:21:58,000 --> 03:22:14,000
Anyone

1278
03:22:14,000 --> 03:22:17,000
So you you think about what what kind of variable are posted?

1279
03:22:17,000 --> 03:22:26,000
Social is this 2 variable? We are studying

1280
03:22:26,000 --> 03:22:30,000
Well, I guess these are the typical kind of social economic variables.

1281
03:22:30,000 --> 03:22:35,000
We collect right, like you know, education income, right? all those things.

1282
03:22:35,000 --> 03:22:42,000
Morning, according to the the paper table, 2 looks like food.

1283
03:22:42,000 --> 03:22:59,000
Insecurity is has significant odds, ratio for all 3 ties of abuse, and also the Pre depression, Pesd.

1284
03:22:59,000 --> 03:23:04,000
All of them. These are this algorithms, you know, super hot, right way, more than one.

1285
03:23:04,000 --> 03:23:13,000
How do you associate it? yeah, They could also, you know, be component.

1286
03:23:13,000 --> 03:23:19,000
So again, just like, you know audio analysis we have done so far. there's so many variables when we study, you know.

1287
03:23:19,000 --> 03:23:24,000
Problem like this. there's so many variables could be tangled with with each other, right?

1288
03:23:24,000 --> 03:23:32,000
So how to really piece them apart require a lot more the main knowledge, not just the data, because we are not really doing any interventional study.

1289
03:23:32,000 --> 03:23:35,000
This is observational right? so you only know they are.

1290
03:23:35,000 --> 03:23:41,000
All of them are highly assigned. but we try is causing which is beyond what this data.

1291
03:23:41,000 --> 03:23:48,000
Second: answer: Require additional knowledge.

1292
03:23:48,000 --> 03:23:53,000
So for the final question. Right? Look at the table, 2, and there are so many divide on left and point 0 1.

1293
03:23:53,000 --> 03:23:58,000
Even after a tonic for multiple tapping they're still probably significant right?

1294
03:23:58,000 --> 03:24:02,000
So. what other significant risk factor that for emotional abuse?

1295
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:09,000
And if we were trying to address emotional views which one should you focus on and, you know, talk about it.

1296
03:24:09,000 --> 03:24:17,000
So first, which are the factors, such as emotional views which is the first column right, based on all of this was 3 stars right?

1297
03:24:17,000 --> 03:24:33,000
That's the one was left on point hold on so which one you think you want to address, and why

1298
03:24:33,000 --> 03:24:39,000
I I think that you know you can think about but personally I think all these are tangled right, one cause the other.

1299
03:24:39,000 --> 03:24:48,000
But you don't know which one so eventually you want to think about those on the upstream which Tent will cause others from your understanding on which you have control.

1300
03:24:48,000 --> 03:24:53,000
You can. You can basically intervene and makeup makeup.

1301
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:57,000
Make a chain right? Those are the things I I think, is worse but with now.

1302
03:24:57,000 --> 03:25:25,000
So anyone has any path

1303
03:25:25,000 --> 03:25:31,000
Maybe like the mental health aspect, looking at like the pressure Ptsd.

1304
03:25:31,000 --> 03:25:42,000
Childhood abuse, all 3, like mental health risk founders are very significant.

1305
03:25:42,000 --> 03:25:49,000
I mean to pick it back off that. and I I was thinking about those 2, and I was like prevent Ptsd right or depression.

1306
03:25:49,000 --> 03:25:57,000
But maybe we could, through the services to help people manage those right, cause the childhood abuse already happened.

1307
03:25:57,000 --> 03:26:07,000
But help people by with that better even than more resources to manage those.

1308
03:26:07,000 --> 03:26:10,000
Yeah, I agree with both of you. I I think number one.

1309
03:26:10,000 --> 03:26:18,000
Now this 3 has surprisingly high ratio, which are very strong factors, including security to some extent.

1310
03:26:18,000 --> 03:26:22,000
Also with agree with you what that already happened happen right.

1311
03:26:22,000 --> 03:26:25,000
You can. You can help those people, but you cannot change the path.

1312
03:26:25,000 --> 03:26:29,000
But, on the other hand, right you have gravad like how they'll be from happening in the future.

1313
03:26:29,000 --> 03:26:34,000
So you know many that is in the future. There are fewer people having P Ptsd.

1314
03:26:34,000 --> 03:26:38,000
Hopefully, right, and child would be so that's still house also like depression.

1315
03:26:38,000 --> 03:26:44,000
I mean if people are already in depression it's hard to to do a lot.

1316
03:26:44,000 --> 03:26:47,000
But you know, figure out the reason, you know, to to help with me.

1317
03:26:47,000 --> 03:26:54,000
Know how eventually, I think, reduce the the problems of mental health issues in the whole population.

1318
03:26:54,000 --> 03:26:58,000
We'll reduce you know a lot of these are down the road.

1319
03:26:58,000 --> 03:27:13,000
Yeah, any other calls

1320
03:27:13,000 --> 03:27:19,000
Okay, Yeah, It's time for lunch and it's my favorite day, Friday.

1321
03:27:19,000 --> 03:27:23,000
Thank you very much for speaking with me for 2 weeks and we have one more week to go.

1322
03:27:23,000 --> 03:27:28,000
So good news is that there's nothing to submit today if you want you can submit.

1323
03:27:28,000 --> 03:27:31,000
But post this, and this will be D. One Tuesday morning.

1324
03:27:31,000 --> 03:27:43,000
I have a great weekend, and see you on Monday morning.
