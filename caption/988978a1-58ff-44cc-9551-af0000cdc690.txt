1
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:16,780
Is not my right now that we got to start playing games like I do next.

2
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:25,499
So I really got to be just Sophie was a challenge for me to take all the are there due

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:38,220
to the injuries I talked about this but I was like wow I have the best experience.

4
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,830
The brothers are the heart. And I thought that's what it was like.

5
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:54,329
I knew I was going to go on the spot, but the consciousness and then just doesn't have what happened.

6
00:00:54,330 --> 00:01:07,500
So I just finished everything but like in a very like kind of life and I was like, I agree with you,

7
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:28,530
but I think they wanted me to draw the line from and you don't have to get vaccinated.

8
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:46,370
You don't you just try to make as patriotic as boss is an article in the taxi will be right just like I.

9
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:55,240
And really just so you're getting caught up on everybody's pain.

10
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:06,010
And I even started reading what I would consider it.

11
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:14,860
Just like Marilyn. I feel like.

12
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:20,700
I don't know, I don't.

13
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:31,440
I just try to go back and do it in the morning.

14
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:41,700
Is there a trip back to the final Stuart theory before we move on to decision making,

15
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,780
understand uncertainty and taking the individual demand curves that we derive last week

16
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:54,450
and saw how they were related to utility decisions and aggravated it up into a markman.

17
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,770
So we're analyzing outcomes sort of later in the course market level, you know,

18
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,880
sort of how individual demands and sort of these sums to more of an aggregate measure.

19
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:13,290
So I think it's something like the demand for groceries in the Ann Arbor metropolitan area, for example, marketing.

20
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:19,290
And so that takes all the individual demands of people who buy groceries in the river and adds the box.

21
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,809
So it's really not more complicated than that script to a graphical example.

22
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:32,480
And then one of the factors, problems which allow us to sort of let out a great example of individual market

23
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,150
analysis and we've already talked about the income elasticity of demand.

24
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,750
So today we're going to define the price elasticity of demand and the cross

25
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,290
price elasticity of demand being with respect to a change of the goods on price,

26
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,729
how much is demand change? And, you know, all elasticities are proportionate.

27
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,790
So we're saying for percentage change in price,

28
00:03:56,790 --> 00:04:04,290
what's the percentage change in one year after last price elasticity is just really are substitutes for compliments.

29
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,570
The issue of what happens to the demand for one year when the price of a different good changes.

30
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:17,010
So we talked about substitutes and compliments last week was sort of the prototypical examples being coffee

31
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:25,110
green or coffee and tea and coffee and cream would be compliments because we tend to consume them together.

32
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:31,710
So if one of them became more expensive, we would not only buy less of that one, but you would also buy less of the other one.

33
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:37,440
Because of to me, a cup of coffee is defined as black coffee with cream added to it.

34
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:45,660
If I'm going to drink less cups of coffee, I'm also going to be a prototypical example of substitutes would be coffee or tea.

35
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:52,680
Coffee became more expensive. I would buy less coffee and I would substitute towards tea, which is now relatively cheap.

36
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:59,540
So we're going to define then the price elasticity of demand is sort of a proportionate

37
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:04,820
measure of how strong complementarity or substitute ability between goods is.

38
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,870
Across price elasticity was close to zero. So those goods are essentially independent of each other.

39
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,220
Increases in the price of one of them doesn't really, really affect the assumption of the other.

40
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,069
Bigger a positive number it is, the stronger we'd say they're complementary,

41
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,520
the bigger a negative number that is, the more substitutable those goods are.

42
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:33,110
So that's kind of a roadmap for where we're going today from individual to market demand curves.

43
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:38,420
And then we'll talk about some of the own price and class price elasticity of demand.

44
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:49,940
And suppose we have a market made up of five people, five people in one household, and the product we're talking about as chocolate.

45
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:56,660
And we have some information about how much each of those individuals has the different prices.

46
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,110
And then literally all we have to do is sum up individual's demands at each price to get the market demand.

47
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:09,650
Now we are making an assumption you're making an assumption that within a market everybody faces the same price.

48
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:17,450
So we're assuming that if all of us go to bushes to buy our groceries this week, then the price of chicken,

49
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:24,320
the price of the price of broccoli, the price of tide pods, whatever else we're buying at the grocery store is the same for all of us.

50
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,200
So that way we can kind of aggregate the market demand by saying at that given price, how much do I buy?

51
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,930
How much do you buy, how much do you buy? And so on. Add them up.

52
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:41,180
If in fact we all face the prices, then it wouldn't make sense to add up our demands at a given price.

53
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:49,610
You know, if you went in and you paid $1 a pound for chicken and I pay $5 a pound and you pay $0.50 for broccoli and I pay $20 for broccoli,

54
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,649
then we kind of couldn't do this exercise of aggregate demand because that kind of

55
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:58,970
the thought process behind it is everybody in the market faces the same price.

56
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:02,330
If that price is $5, what do we buy?

57
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:11,150
So we add it up and we say, Well, if the planet costs $5 in this market, the total demand is the sum of what each of us individually buys at $5.

58
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:18,290
Then, if the price drops to four, we can do the same thing with summer drops four for all of us and say,

59
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:25,370
Well, how much more are we each going to buy at a price of four? And we add up those new numbers, then we get a second point over.

60
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,469
So here is that there are ten points on the market demand curve that is based on the individual price of one.

61
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:41,720
We get consumption of ten, five, six, 12 and a half and zero where one consumers essentially doesn't buy this product.

62
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,920
She's sort of in the market and she lives in Ann Arbor, but she doesn't buy groceries.

63
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:53,980
So the total is 33.5. So literally all we're doing is we're saying at a different price.

64
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:58,660
Different price. What happened is everybody in this market face that new price.

65
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,840
How much would they demand it? Add it up.

66
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,870
So graphically, you can take the numbers from the previous chart and say, well, what are those demand curves look like?

67
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,920
And it's kind of filling them out continuously. We've got a couple of them.

68
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:20,980
Our question came up last week. Does it have to be linear or they have to have some can they have some other shape?

69
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:29,110
They certainly. The numbers translated from the prior graph, we see that most of them have our curve.

70
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,380
So it's not an indifference curve to the man curve. How do you tell really quick if the graph is a demand curve or indifference curve?

71
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,830
I give you a graph and it looks like this. Yeah.

72
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:43,839
The X is exactly what's on the axis. So for an indifference curve.

73
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,500
What? We're on the access to goods.

74
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,970
Yeah. So the amount of good X,

75
00:08:48,970 --> 00:09:00,400
the amount of good Y or whatever the two goods are for demand curve is always going to be the quantity of one good or good x for on the x axis.

76
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,330
But it's going to be the price of that good price of good X on the y axis.

77
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:13,500
So kind of as you're graphing things, say, on an exam and a few weeks for graphing and indifference curve,

78
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,600
you should have the two different goods on the axis of your graphing and demand curve,

79
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,570
which should be the quantity of one good versus the price of that good.

80
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:28,300
So you can always just look at the axis and say, well, it looks like an indifference curve, so I should draw a budget constraint in here somewhere.

81
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,280
No, it's the demand curve.

82
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:39,120
So in that you can tell that the price is on the Y axis, the economists at the Square convention are always putting price on the Y axis.

83
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:42,220
When we draw demand curves, that's just the way it's done.

84
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:48,850
There's not a good reason for it. In fact, it's kind of illogical because normally you think of Y as a function of X.

85
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:55,640
What's the response variable here? What should be the Y variable quantity?

86
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,640
Because the person is choosing quantity. Exactly.

87
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:04,540
So if you're normal, mathematical conventions would actually flip these axes is normally you think of.

88
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:12,450
Functions. Y is a function of X and what's a function of quantity as a function of price.

89
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:18,150
Consumers, consumerism, taking the price the consumer is seen. So it's like the X variables, what the consumer is responding to.

90
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,910
They see the price, they choose the quantity.

91
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:30,209
But for some odd historical reason, economists have always graphic demand groups with the price on the Y axis and quantity of the x axis.

92
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:33,870
So we've got to flip the normal mathematical dimension there.

93
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:37,710
So I'm sure there's a reason for it, but I don't know what it is.

94
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:47,340
So if you take a particular price, we can start that same process of adding up the demand curves or graphically say what a price of five,

95
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:51,840
how much is the first consumer by two units? Second consumer buys one unit.

96
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:57,450
Their consumer buys 1.2. Fourth, Consumer rights 2.5.

97
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:01,680
But consumer demand is just vertical and zero.

98
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,959
So they really don't matter in a sense to the market to me.

99
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:13,170
And if we add up all those consumers, we see at a price of 51.2, the market demand curves in the price of five, one or two is 6.7.

100
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:22,500
So simple, kind of boring, but sort of conceptually, this sort of closes the loop.

101
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,460
We started with utility maximization for individual consumer,

102
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:36,330
and that told us how one consumer's demand is determined and we in fact derive the demand curve from the utility maximizing bundles by saying,

103
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:42,930
let's hold the person's income constant at a certain level. Let's hold the price of everything else constant at whatever level it is.

104
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,540
Let's hold the persons preferences constant.

105
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:53,960
And let's just imagine we're varying the price of gold X and we're tracing out then given the levels of all those other things held constant,

106
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,380
the background, how much quantity does the person demand at various prices?

107
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:05,490
So we saw at every point on the individuals demand curve is directly related to a utility maximizing bundle.

108
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,950
And then that allowed us to sort of interpret the height of the demand curve is

109
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:15,390
telling us something about how valuable each additional unit was to that consumer,

110
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,560
what's the most that our consumer would be willing to give up to get another unit?

111
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,930
Well, if they've already got three units in the height of the demand curve at a quantity of three is, say, $10.

112
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:33,120
Well, that means that most they would have paid for that third unit is $10, and they're only going to buy a fourth hundred, some price less than $10.

113
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:41,069
And this kind of just kind of closes that loop by saying, well, what are the market demand curves?

114
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:49,950
They're nothing more than individual demand curves and add up, which were nothing more than utility maximizing bundles translated into a demand curve.

115
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:58,020
So every point in a market demand curve similarly reflects some consumers saying, Yeah, I'm willing to pay $10 for that.

116
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:07,319
It's worth it. To me, that's how much I value that unit. So allows us to kind of take these sort of very, you know,

117
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:12,570
all that is a sort of a relationship between price and quantity to kind of give it some interpretation.

118
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,270
There are some consumer out there,

119
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:21,870
some particular consumer who bought this particular human at or would be willing to buy this particular unit at this particular price.

120
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,340
Therefore, it's worth it to them. It's part of their utility maximizing bundle.

121
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:33,360
They willingly would give up not much money to get that unit rather than keeping that money to buy something else with it.

122
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:47,360
I know the importance of it, that it sort of gives us a sense of, well, if we take the demand curve seriously, it reflects value to consumers.

123
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,990
Because it tells us what consumers are willing to pay as part of their utility maximizing bundles.

124
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:01,190
Okay. Price elasticity of demand. So we defined income elasticity of demand.

125
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:07,890
And we showed how well they could divide up goods into normal versus inferior.

126
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,670
So what's the income elasticity of demand for a normal good?

127
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:20,649
Range would have to be in the spirit of one of the normal issues greater than the necessity.

128
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:26,190
You're thinking ahead to the next question. So normal versus inferior is positive versus negative.

129
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:31,430
So normal just means that my demand moves in the same direction as my income levels.

130
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,080
I get richer, I buy more, I get poorer, I buy less.

131
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:44,880
If you're me and my demand moves in the opposite direction of my income, but then 0 to 1 would be a necessity and one above one would be a luxury.

132
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,170
So that's just sort of a subdivision of the normal goods into those two groups.

133
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:56,940
The necessity was once that if my income goes up, I buy more of it, but it doesn't proportionately keep up with my income.

134
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:05,790
I had a 10% raise, maybe about 5% more of it. So as I become richer, I spend a smaller share of my budget on it.

135
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,230
I do spend more dollars on it because I'm buying more, but it's a smaller share of my total.

136
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:20,459
My income doubled. I would not spend twice as much on food. So kind of food as an aggregate, that whole group of goods would be to me, a necessity.

137
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:26,650
I'd probably buy some more, but I wouldn't buy double, you know, particular type of food lobster.

138
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:31,020
It might be luxury worth my income. Double that more than double how much lobster I buy.

139
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,840
And therefore, lobster would take up an increasing percentage of my budget as I got richer.

140
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:42,540
So can I do the same thing with prices and get a proportionate response?

141
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:50,680
Now, we talked a little bit about why that's sort of a useful measure on income elasticity.

142
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,759
So we'll take certain units out of it. It's all percentages.

143
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:59,700
So it doesn't matter if we're measuring a person's income in dollars or euros or any other currency as well.

144
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:05,030
If they get 10% more in whatever income, whatever currency you want to measure it in.

145
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,620
So it's unit less. It's even more kind of obvious why unit less is useful for a price elasticity.

146
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:17,730
Again, we ask you the question until you tell me if this is a stupid question.

147
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:26,790
What's more responsive to a change in price? So $1 change in price, a candy the demand for candy bars or the demand for Ferraris?

148
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:35,100
It's a stupid question because those things are so incredibly incomparable.

149
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:42,030
And he said, well, wait a second, a $1 increase, the price of candy bars is like a doubling of the price, a $1 increase in the price of varieties.

150
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:49,710
Do you think anybody that's buying a Ferrari is going to be swayed by it or not based whether the price is $1, more or less.

151
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,320
So it's negligible. So that's basically a stupid question.

152
00:16:54,330 --> 00:17:00,480
Those goods are so incomparable that if you phrased it in absolute terms of units, $1 increase in price.

153
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:07,770
So that's a unit we're using for price. And then one Ferrari and one candy bar are the units we're using for outcomes.

154
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:15,360
That's not even a meaningful question, but let's flip it around to the elasticity.

155
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:26,460
If we thought in percentage terms, if the price of candy bars went up 10% and the price of Ferrari's went up 10%,

156
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,950
which one of those goods would have a bigger percentage decrease in quantity demanded?

157
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,890
I was that as obvious as the first question was? So that's a lot more meaningful question.

158
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:44,930
Questions we take to goods that are incredibly different. I hate the phrase apples and oranges.

159
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:52,010
I hate it because to me, apples and oranges are very comparable. They're both round fruits that I might have with lunch.

160
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:56,390
Those are really comparable goods, candy bars and Ferraris.

161
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:03,290
That's not comparable. And so we have two very, very different goods.

162
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:09,110
Now we can ask a meaningful question, which one of them is is more responsive to a change in its price?

163
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,410
It plausibly could be either one. We'd actually need to collect the data to find out.

164
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:20,830
Now, we probably don't really care much about caring about comparing candy bars to Ferraris,

165
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:29,559
but comparing candy bars to broccoli, comparing housing to food general price.

166
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:37,780
So if the price of housing went up by 10% and the price of food went up by 10%, which demand would be more responsive to that change in price?

167
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:42,430
Now, on a more meaningful question. The elasticity allows us to.

168
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:49,020
Even if you take the price change and standardize, there is a proportion.

169
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,630
So if one one of those goods is much more expensive than the other, well,

170
00:18:52,680 --> 00:19:00,420
we're not going to say a $1 increase in both is a dollar increase in Ferrari's was negligible dollar increase in candy bar prices massive.

171
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,170
But we could say in percentage, sure. But what if they both went up by the same process?

172
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:10,590
What would happen is that kind of standardize this for the fact that the absolute price is so different between different goods,

173
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:14,730
and it also standardize this for the fact that the units are so different.

174
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:20,720
An apartment is different than a shopping cart full of groceries.

175
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:31,940
Know how much what your the size of your apartment change? How much would the number of groceries you put in your basket change in percentage terms?

176
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:37,340
So we're taking all the units out of it. So it becomes a very useful measure for that reason.

177
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:43,720
So it makes sense that we're. And so that's sort of why we do elasticities.

178
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:51,310
So price elasticity of demand is just the percentage change in quantity divided by the percentage change in price.

179
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,919
So here we kind of all with the elasticity.

180
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:01,450
What we always have is the stimulus variable is on the bottom.

181
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,640
So the denominator, the response variable is in the numerator.

182
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:15,370
You know, always think stimulus response, but the price changes and the consumer change the price know the market change the price.

183
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:19,030
The consumer is responding to it. The consumer gets to customize their quantity.

184
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:26,740
So we're always putting sort of in quantities up top. So kind of your rule of thumb for an elasticity, it's always going to be a quantity.

185
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:34,990
It's going to be a quantity supplied by a firm, a quantity demanded by a consumer that's always in the numerator, that's always the response variable.

186
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:40,390
That's what the economic actor is choosing. The stimulus variable is what they're responding to.

187
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:50,620
Hey, I got a raise. Hey, prices went down. So things that happened that caused that change, the quantity or the denominator.

188
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:57,300
So as we said last time, we're going to assume that demand always slopes down.

189
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,930
In other words, the price elasticity of demand has to be negative.

190
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:09,900
A higher price is going to lead to a lower quantity. There are some incredibly rare exceptions to downward sloping demand.

191
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:18,590
It's so rare that some economists had to. They're actually experimental economists that were lab rats, believe it or not.

192
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:27,830
And they verify that there are certain certain circumstances where they could make the demand curve for a particular product slope up.

193
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:37,530
How do you do that with lab rats? They have a budget constraint. They probably have preferences, right?

194
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,970
And their preferences. That probably isn't too hard to believe.

195
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:48,770
So they have like a little rat wall and with mole rat money and credit cards.

196
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:59,760
So the way they did this experiment to say, well, there's two things that rats it's what their rats really like to drink.

197
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:01,469
And one thing they really don't like to drink.

198
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:07,230
So that's what they made the two gods, apparently liver rats really like root beer and they really dislike wine.

199
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:15,630
Nine water, tonic water. So the rat had two water bottles in its cage, one with root beer, one with tonic water.

200
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:23,400
Now, if you just filled those bottles and gave the lab rats an unlimited supply and let them pick what they would do, what would they do?

201
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:31,130
You drink red beer all day long and they would never touch the tonic water. That's because they have no budget constraint.

202
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:36,680
If you're literally refilling and refilling the bottles all the time and they can just go up to either one and it's equally far,

203
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,290
you know, one's on this end of the cage. One's on that end of the cage.

204
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:45,320
So what they did is they developed a mechanism that gave rats prices and income.

205
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:52,130
Prices were how many times they had to push a button below them or push the lever to get us to get a.

206
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,380
So if it's ten pushers, that's a higher price than two pushes.

207
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:06,880
The budget constraint is how many total pushes they had in a day before both of the levers deactivated that made the prices real.

208
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:11,620
So even if the rat doesn't mind pushing the button to get more root beer, I'll say they.

209
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:16,160
The price of root beer is really high compared to the number of total lever pushers they're allowed.

210
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:21,920
They're not going to get a lot of sips of root beer. So it turned out if you made these rats poor enough,

211
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:29,840
that if you gave them few enough lever pushers for the day relative to the prices of the two goods.

212
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,880
And if your was a lot more expensive, more lever pushers than quinine.

213
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:41,930
You could actually get them to drink more quinine if the price if you raise the price of quarantine.

214
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,380
And that's essentially because they need to thirsty. So wait a second.

215
00:23:49,430 --> 00:23:58,290
I really love this root beer, but it's so expensive and now I have so few lever pushes in a day that if you raise the price of tonic water,

216
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,890
which I'm drinking some of because I just I'm thirsty.

217
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:09,080
To the extent if I behave sort of what I call a normal way and say, well, I'm going to get less tonic water and more root beer.

218
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:17,270
But we are still so much more expensive, the tonic water that I end up being too thirsty.

219
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,230
Apparently if you give rats a few weeks, they can kind of figure all this math out.

220
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,210
It's kind of a cleansing. But the bottom line is we had to go to lengths like that.

221
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:34,490
To empirically verify that an upward sloping demand curve can exist.

222
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:41,060
So what does that tell us? Never think about an upward slope and demand curve again.

223
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:50,290
So the original. Story of an upward sloping demand curve was very similar.

224
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:56,859
But with humans it was the potato famine in Ireland in the 1840s that say there are two types of nutrition.

225
00:24:56,860 --> 00:25:01,450
Just to keep it easy, you can either have potatoes or you could have meat. It was the red beer.

226
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:10,330
Potatoes were really quite high water. Anyway, if I was in a low income household in Ireland in the 1840s, you know,

227
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:15,730
if I could freely pick what I wanted, I'd have a diet that was heavier on meat and lighter on potatoes.

228
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,990
And it turned out that potato famine made potatoes more expensive. Normally, I would say, well, then I'd buy less potatoes and more meat.

229
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:28,660
But if I was poor enough, meat was still so much more expensive than potatoes.

230
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,820
I said, Well, wait, just to get enough calories, I'm going to have to actually give up some of this expensive meat.

231
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:42,910
So I have more of my limited income left to buy the more not more expensive, but still cheap compared to meat potatoes.

232
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:49,690
So I had to rely more heavily on the good whose price has gone up because it was still even at the higher price,

233
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,830
a much cheaper source of calories than meat was. But.

234
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,890
So that's kind of the human example.

235
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:04,320
But if we have to go back to the 1840s for a human example and we have to elaborate experiments to get a current example,

236
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,670
we can essentially ignore the consumer price elasticity of demand will be negative.

237
00:26:09,690 --> 00:26:18,270
In other words, demand always slows down. That gives you a good clue if you calculate a price elasticity and you get a positive number.

238
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:23,110
You did what? Did a mistake.

239
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:28,330
Check your math. So whatever you're doing problem with such exam questions.

240
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:33,100
There often are ways to check your logic and say, Could my answer be right?

241
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:40,180
Or maybe must my answer be wrong? I promise you I will never give you an upward sloping demand curve.

242
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:48,790
If I give you an upward sloping demand curve, everybody gets 100% on that question, no matter what their answer is.

243
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,879
So therefore, if you assume that I've never give you an upward sloping demand curve and I ask

244
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,270
you to calculate a price elasticity of demand and you get a positive number,

245
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,070
you can immediately say, I must have done something wrong. Go back, check my math.

246
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:16,700
Now we can divide up goods into two groups, kind of like inferior versus normal for income,

247
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:21,230
and then we subdivide and normalize it to further category subcategories.

248
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:30,020
But for man, we have poor people. Since it has to be negative, we just can't put them into two groups those goods that are elastically demanded.

249
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:37,120
So price elasticity of demand of less than negative one finger is greater than one in absolute value.

250
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,720
For example, if the elasticity is negative two,

251
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:48,160
what that implies is that a 1% increase in price is going to induce a 2% increase in quantity demanded.

252
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:52,330
So that's a good that's very responsive to a change in price.

253
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:58,330
So you might think there are lots of good substitutes for this product.

254
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:10,639
If its demand falls that rapidly with price, that means what people are essentially saying is, you know what, at a higher price, forget this product.

255
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,240
I mean, buy a lot less of it because I can do something else with my money.

256
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:21,320
There are good substitutes. So is this likely to be, say, insulin for insulin dependent diabetic?

257
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:36,709
A person with diabetes is dependent on insulin. Probably my primary demand might be something like that and say I need I need insulin to feel good.

258
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:40,010
I need insulin to prevent major complications.

259
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,990
Ultimately, insulin to save my life. The price of insulin went up by 1%.

260
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,350
I probably wouldn't say, well, forget insulin.

261
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:53,100
I'll just put in a carrot and I'll be fine.

262
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:57,840
You know what? That is more likely, I would say, wow, the price of insulin went up by a percent.

263
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:01,800
I'm not going to change my use of insulin very much at all.

264
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:10,050
No, maybe I would a little bit. I might cut some of my doses or skip a dose if I'm feeling good.

265
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:16,709
And we know that people do change their insulin consumption when they face a higher out-of-pocket

266
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:21,540
price for the elasticity is probably eating more something like this than something like this.

267
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:28,469
So we call the inelastic. The demand is so inelastic we demand does not mean it does not respond to price.

268
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,790
It just means that demand is what responds less than proportionately to a change in price.

269
00:29:33,410 --> 00:29:36,930
It's only if the elasticity were literally zero.

270
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,320
But we say that that good is perfectly inelastic, demanded it's quantities independent of price.

271
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:51,030
So if I you know, if I would absolutely never, ever, ever, ever change the amount of insulin I use regardless of its price,

272
00:29:51,690 --> 00:30:01,410
that's implying that my income elasticity or my price elasticity of demand is absolutely zero, and I changed it a little bit.

273
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,809
We still say it's inelastic demand in this case,

274
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:14,490
very inelastic demand and that's really close to zero in elastically demanded unless is elasticity of zero doesn't mean the price doesn't matter.

275
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:17,880
It just means the quantity changes less than proportionately the price.

276
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:27,639
I think what might happen to my budget? What is the price of this?

277
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:32,110
Good. What else? This is insulin. Passive insulin goes up by 10%.

278
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:37,840
I'm obviously going to be spending more money on insulin is like the price went up by 10%.

279
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,820
It went up by a lot. My quantity only went down by a little bit by 1%.

280
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:49,720
So obviously price times quantity, my total spending on insulin is going to go up at the higher price.

281
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:58,240
That's good. I'm actually going to be spending less money on it when its price goes up because I'm substituting so aggressively away from it.

282
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:09,159
This goods price went up by 10%. I would buy 20% less and therefore price times quantity would actually fall at a higher price.

283
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,569
I'm literally spending less money on this. Good. Why? Because it's elastically demanded.

284
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,650
So at the higher price I more than proportionately cut my quantity.

285
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,659
So price times quantity. My spending on that good is going to fall here.

286
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:28,540
I'm only cutting my quantity of a tiny fraction of that change in price in terms of proportions.

287
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,990
So the higher the price is, the more money I'm spending on that.

288
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:40,150
Good. So the elasticity is going to tell us about what what happens to my spending on the product as it goes up, as the price goes up?

289
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,620
Am I going to spend more or less?

290
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:50,020
So it might be surprising the price goes up by actually spending less on that good, simply by buying such a much lower quantity of it.

291
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:56,740
So you can think of things with substitutes and some particular brand of pizza in Ann Arbor.

292
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,160
Maybe that's even bigger. Maybe that's even a negative five.

293
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:08,080
There's so many choices for pizza in Ann Arbor. If one of them were to raise its price and all the others didn't.

294
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:16,970
That one piece of lace would probably see a big falloff in consumer demand as consumers have lots of good substitutes.

295
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:21,110
There are 20 other places to get pizza and there are hundreds of other restaurants.

296
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:29,630
So there are very close substitutes. Different types of pizza. Somewhat weaker substitutes, but still substitutes.

297
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:36,020
All the other restaurants I could go to instead of having pizza in the first place and then even weaker substitutes.

298
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:40,900
Well, I could just cook more meals at home. There's lots of different ways I can get food.

299
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:44,710
There's lots of different ways I get restaurant food and there's lots of different ways I can get pizza.

300
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:50,470
So we probably expect that the elasticity of demand for one particular.

301
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:55,759
Syria is going to be very large, insulting.

302
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:05,780
We expect it to be very low. What are the substitutes? If I'm a diabetic and I'm insulin dependent, what could I do if I don't take insulin?

303
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:12,380
Clinically of any ideas, how do I manage my blood sugar without insulin or with much less insulin?

304
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:15,890
Not very well, right? Is there a clinician shaking you?

305
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,880
No, don't do that. That's a terrible idea.

306
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,030
I'm a person with diabetes and I'm insulin dependent would be a very,

307
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:33,080
very bad idea and have a price elasticity of demand of negative five because there aren't gazillions of good substitutes.

308
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:40,670
I can do things in know dietary to try to control my blood sugar a little bit, but those aren't nearly as effective.

309
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:45,260
There aren't as many other things I can do, and they're not very effective.

310
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:53,420
So generally for a good that's very inelastic demand and we expect it's something that has relatively few close substitutes.

311
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:07,040
So if I drew these two demand curves and asked, So which one of these would generally be more price elastic than the other?

312
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:14,940
Try pointing this one out.

313
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:21,010
Because if you think of. What is this telling us? This is telling us that the very steep demand curve.

314
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:27,880
Quantity doesn't change much. Quantity is only moving in a small range, even in price moves in this huge range.

315
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,150
So that kind of looks like an inelastic demanded good.

316
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:38,170
We had big changes in quantity or big changes in price only induce relatively small changes in quantity.

317
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:44,920
Here was the very flat demand curve. We got the opposite. What's the range of quantity is moving over huge range.

318
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:48,310
What's the range of price moved over to get that huge move in quantity?

319
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:52,480
Very small. So this is like this is insulin.

320
00:34:54,090 --> 00:35:00,719
This is cottage and pizza. So here we see price changes just a little bit.

321
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:08,460
And quantity, you know, really shoots out of price starts here of cottage industry absence price to here quantity is going to shoot way out here.

322
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:13,930
So that's a very elastic response. Yea.

323
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:20,140
Even if price drops by a ton, quantity is only going to move up by a little bit.

324
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:28,990
That's a very inelastic response. So it's kind of generally looking at those two demand curves and say this one is less elastic than this one.

325
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:43,070
I'm always paranoid about doing when I've got these graphs up and a marker in my hand is right near the screen.

326
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:51,560
So it's like, Oh, crap. It's a screen, not a whiteboard.

327
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,440
We saw some of that and it was not me,

328
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:03,800
but I should do better job of not like having a marker in my hand when I'm anywhere near that because I can't say it was never could be me.

329
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,590
How much of the screen cost just taken on my paycheck?

330
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:18,680
Must be a bad day of teaching, but you have a good story.

331
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:32,390
Imagine my economics professor did today writing all over the screen in his master's right.

332
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:41,030
So price elasticities can also change as a function of how long you have to respond to the price change.

333
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,770
You're sort of a classic example is gas.

334
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:53,330
So we've all seen in the last year and a half huge changes in the price of gasoline versus big increases, kind of an almost doubling.

335
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:58,790
And then it's fallen by maybe a quarter or so since the peak.

336
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:06,090
And so when gas prices first doubled. How did you make any changes?

337
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,470
Your consumption of gas? Most of you have cars.

338
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:15,570
The shaking your head. No, no.

339
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:28,650
What did you do? I stopped filling my take. Fred Flintstone like $20 instead of filling it all the way to $60 instead of the usual four.

340
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:33,150
But I think ultimately it doesn't change your driving license.

341
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,350
So is this car more a budgeting thing as opposed to actual consumption thing?

342
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:42,960
You used as much gas, but you fill it up more often and you didn't spend as much money.

343
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:48,580
Phillips Yeah, kind of didn't have a big hit on your budget any given day anyway.

344
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,890
Change anything? Yeah, my more.

345
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:58,860
I'm going to see. Okay, so take a little take a little extra time to direct drive to Costco and more.

346
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,639
I mean, I started Costco standing just being in the line behind.

347
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:13,800
Yes, but I made the huge mistake of going to Costco and I was going to go that day anyhow the day before a big predicted blizzard last year.

348
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:20,040
Why is the line so long? And it's always long here.

349
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,980
And then you go in the stores like, why are there so many people here? I said, Oh, the checkout line was like the back of the store.

350
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:28,890
I mean, as you go, you're going to be the one down at Celine.

351
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:35,310
It's like you go, you're always the producers, the back of the store, and there's like people in their carts lined up and produce the checkout.

352
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,620
And it's like, Oh yeah, there's a big blizzard tomorrow.

353
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:43,170
You know, I really didn't need to come here today, and I'm not here because I'm stocking up for the day.

354
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,499
I was going to go to Costco. That's the way this is a nice day.

355
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,910
That day. Did you leave? I ended up waiting out.

356
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:55,290
It was I was there. I didn't go down.

357
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,830
I did go to the store. I'm waiting on gas lines. Okay.

358
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:02,340
So less unnecessary out of town travel.

359
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:09,030
Okay, so you might change your out of town travel. What else might you do in the short run?

360
00:39:09,030 --> 00:39:12,689
Just very, very quick adjustment. The price of gas doubled today.

361
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:16,799
And what could you do this week or this month? To change wasn't the short run.

362
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,240
But I sold a car and bought a bike. Okay, so that's more of a long run example.

363
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,600
That's actually a great example of maybe a longer run effect.

364
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:29,070
You probably didn't decide to sell your car the day gas price doubled.

365
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:33,450
I never had this thought. I wasn't planning to sell my car and get traded for a bike.

366
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,750
The gas price doubled. I did it by 3:00 in the afternoon.

367
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:42,959
Probably not right after carpool or carpool.

368
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,100
Public transit. So if you happen to already live close to a public transit line that goes to places you want to go,

369
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,670
then maybe you would have driven at the lower price of gas for the convenience.

370
00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:01,470
But now you say, you know, I will take the bus or maybe you get together, hey, we're both go are both guilty candidates or you can we drive together?

371
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,660
And maybe if the gas was lot cheaper, you would have never thought of that and you just drove know I don't have to stop,

372
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:18,209
put you off, you don't have to pick me up and you have to talk to each other or you can keep everything together.

373
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:22,350
And then what you get at once, like luxury gas, right?

374
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:30,390
Whatever. Right. So you can combine some errands. So maybe Sunday is my grocery shopping day normally.

375
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:40,910
And on Wednesday I was going to go up to the CVS and now maybe I'll do both of those on Wednesday so they to make one trip that is combined rather.

376
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:48,840
But are these big things, these things you can do very rapidly, big things in terms of are they going to dramatically change your consumption of gas?

377
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:58,170
Yeah, they're moving around the edges now if you're lucky enough to have two vehicles and both of

378
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:02,280
them are not being used at this time and one of them is more fuel efficient than the other.

379
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:06,270
So that's an easy substitution you could make very quickly.

380
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:11,309
You already have those two cars if they're not both being used by household members at that time.

381
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:17,610
If the price of gas doubles, you're going to leave the big SUV in the garage and you're going to take the smaller R.

382
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,840
So that's something that some people can do in the short term. But what are you stuck with in the short term?

383
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,989
It's going to really determine your use of gas. What are the factors that you can't change so rapidly?

384
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:34,500
You already had one of them. What car you own in the first place.

385
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:41,220
Your commute to work, where you live and where you work. Okay.

386
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:49,459
So you picked an apartment location on a certain assumption about what's the commute going to be like?

387
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,900
What's the commute kind of cost me.

388
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:58,300
And if you'd known the price of gas was going to double, you might have either got an apartment that was closer to where you work.

389
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,880
You might have got an apartment that was closer to a bus line.

390
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:08,950
And maybe when you bought your car three years ago. And gas was a lot cheaper.

391
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:12,910
Maybe you would have bought a different car then if you would have known, but you didn't know.

392
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,900
So those are all things that I can change. But it takes some time.

393
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,909
You know, your lease is going to expire at the end of this year. You have to then make a decision.

394
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:26,080
Well, for my second year, am I going to stay or am I going to find a different place?

395
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:29,649
You said, well, even with moving in the middle of my master's program is a hassle.

396
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:35,020
I'd really rather just say you're going to graduate a year later, and at that point you sort of have to move.

397
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:43,360
At that point, it's the price of gas is $5 a gallon. That's definitely going to go into your calculus about,

398
00:42:43,750 --> 00:42:49,870
so where do I want to live relative to where I work, relative to where public transportation would?

399
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:58,210
You know, maybe you have a certain car now you weren't really thinking of replacing it, but eventually you are going to replace it.

400
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:00,370
When you do replace it,

401
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:07,029
if the price of gas is five or $6 a gallon or you'll pay a little more attention to that window sticker with the mileage near whatever,

402
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,470
if gas was $2 a gallon,

403
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:17,530
are you maybe a little more likely to buy a hybrid or an electric or a plug in hybrid if gas is $6 a gallon than if it's $2 a gallon,

404
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:23,920
you know, maybe you're going to replace that fuel guzzling car, maybe a little bit sooner.

405
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:27,250
You're not going to replace it today if the price of gas doubles today.

406
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,770
But maybe you would have kept that car another two or three years and now maybe a year or sooner you say,

407
00:43:32,770 --> 00:43:40,960
you know what, I can't stand pulled into the gas station twice a week and spending $100 for my big SUV.

408
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,190
So I would have kept it three years at the low price of gas.

409
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,460
Maybe I'll replace it in two years. Get not things you do overnight.

410
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,600
Those are things that can have major impacts on your use of gas.

411
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:58,660
Things you can do today are the little things you can move things around at the edges, like the combining the trips.

412
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:05,620
That's a great example of I would have done ERA errands on Sunday and Wednesday and I'll do all my errands on one of those two days.

413
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,530
So if we look at the price elasticity of demand for gas in the short run,

414
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:19,350
say over about give people only a month to adjust to higher price, it's about negative point one.

415
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,220
It's about like that for insulin example.

416
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:29,309
And I kind of think negative point one for the insulin example I is I know that's exactly the price elasticity of demand of insulin,

417
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:34,200
but typically for health care as a whole is about -0.15.

418
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:42,590
United States. So your insulin would probably be a little bit less, even less price elastic than health care as a whole.

419
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,730
So it's probably like 2.1 negative .05, some number that's not zero, that is very close to zero.

420
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:53,810
So gas in the short run is about negative point one.

421
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:59,870
10% increase in the price of gas only yields, maybe about a 1% increase since use.

422
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:08,060
Now, if you give people a couple of years to adjust, it goes to about negative point three to negative point four still in the inelastic range,

423
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:14,960
but much more elastic once things like where your apartment is and what kind of a car you drive.

424
00:45:16,350 --> 00:45:20,190
Become variables. In the short run, those are constants.

425
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:26,700
Those are fixed. Is anybody in this room going to move tomorrow if the price of gas doubles tomorrow?

426
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:31,200
Does anybody have a different car tomorrow? If the price of gas doubles tomorrow?

427
00:45:33,870 --> 00:45:39,060
But if I say the price of gas doubles and it stays that high or even higher for the next two or three years,

428
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,600
is that going to affect your decisions on vehicles and housing?

429
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:51,890
Yeah. It's still price inelastic even in the long run, even if you give people a couple of years to adjust,

430
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,379
but much more elastic, that in the short run is give me enough time.

431
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:01,940
I can affect the bigger things that affect my quantity of gas.

432
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:08,180
I can change those things that are fixed right now that I'm stuck with. I'm stuck with where I live and where I work.

433
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:11,450
I'm stuck with what vehicle I have from the perspective of this week.

434
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:16,960
Are these price and elasticities where market demand.

435
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:24,129
So kind of. Yes. Yes. But also, you can think of as consumer demand.

436
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:26,680
So that's the typical consumer within a market.

437
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:34,260
So if it's the average elasticity of the market level that simply reflects sort of different people will have very different elasticity.

438
00:46:34,270 --> 00:46:40,420
Some people will be much more responsive and willing to change or able to change, or other people are going to be much more stuck.

439
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:45,069
But it's sort of if it averages that, say, in the short run, at the market level,

440
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:49,810
that means the individual demands of the consumers that make up that market kind of average that.

441
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:53,500
But there's going to be definitely a wide range around that.

442
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:58,150
Does that make sense? Because the market is really just made up of the individuals.

443
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:03,580
So think of a market elasticity as just sort of a consumption weighted average.

444
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:08,710
You know, the big users get more weight in that. Sure.

445
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:12,370
So it's the consumption weighted average of the individual elasticities.

446
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:27,370
So probably the best way to think of market elasticity. So price elasticity is going to determine how total spending changes with price.

447
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,350
Let's go to the example with NPR, where if I have an elastically demanded goodness,

448
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,940
price goes up, I'm going to spend more money in elastically demanded good.

449
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:41,590
It's price goes up because I'm substituting so aggressively away from it, I'm going to spend less.

450
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:47,580
Kind of skip this slide because that's what we already sort of talk through with the examples.

451
00:47:47,930 --> 00:47:52,520
But what we'll do is we'll see a particular demand curve.

452
00:47:54,870 --> 00:48:01,400
In this case, the linear demand curve, we're going to make a point that the elasticity isn't the same everywhere on the demand curve.

453
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,910
The elasticity can vary depending what price we're talking about.

454
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,640
And there's a particular relationship that's going to be true for any linear demand curve.

455
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:27,790
You think of the area that box as my spending on this product?

456
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:33,940
Why is it my spending on this product? Well, at at the particular price, we'll call this P star.

457
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:40,060
I buy a Q star will total expenditure as P star times kim star.

458
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:46,420
What's the area of that box since this is the origin area, that box is going to be p star.

459
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:55,990
Times King star. Now, why did I pick this particular price to illustrate that that's actually going to be the largest expenditure on this good.

460
00:48:56,500 --> 00:49:01,900
If price is exactly at the midpoint between the origin and the price intercept.

461
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:11,510
So P star, I'll put a number on it. 25. And then quantity is at the midpoint between the origin and this intercept.

462
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:16,390
So a quantity of 50. So that's going to be an expenditure of 1250 dollars.

463
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:26,950
What if this good were a lot more expensive? What if there were $49, one, 49 and two here?

464
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:40,440
Quantity would be two. Inches the other direction.

465
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:45,990
Am I spending is a lot smaller. I'm only spending $98 on that.

466
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,350
Good. Similarly, what if it were really cheap?

467
00:49:49,350 --> 00:49:57,679
What if price for $1? Like a price of $1 to that demand curve.

468
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:06,540
I got a quantity of 98. Am I spending as, again, $98.

469
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,239
So and it's going to be sort of mathematically true for any linear demand curve.

470
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,090
And we're going to, for convenience, work with a lot of linear demand curves.

471
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:22,920
The spending is maximized at the midpoint of that linear demand curve sort of price that's halfway

472
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,569
between the origin and the price intercept in a quantity that's halfway between the origin.

473
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:32,070
And this quantity in our sense of quantity is 50 a price of 25.

474
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:43,250
At that midpoint. The price elasticity of demand is going to be exactly negative one.

475
00:50:46,270 --> 00:50:51,490
That'll be true for any linear demand curve. Now, let's say we were way up here.

476
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:59,980
We're way up in this part of the demand curve near the top of it. You think that would be a price elastic range or a price inelastic range?

477
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:11,980
So let's think about it. Is that inelastic? So let's go price start at the origin and go from price of 50.

478
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:17,860
The price of 49 in percentage terms, is that a big or a small decrease of price?

479
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:24,010
As small as a 2% decrease in price, the quantity rises from 0 to 2.

480
00:51:24,670 --> 00:51:32,680
Is that a big or a small percentage increase in quantity means effect undefined or dividing by zero?

481
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,260
I also look at it down here and say we're going from a price of one to a price of zero.

482
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:48,669
Is that a big or a small percentage decrease in price? Because 100% increase in price and quantity goes up from 98 to 100.

483
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:52,120
That's a small percentage increase in quantity.

484
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:00,790
I. Well, what was the elasticity going to be up here?

485
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:05,140
There's going to be a small percent decrease in price.

486
00:52:06,610 --> 00:52:10,030
It's going to yield a big percent increase in quantity.

487
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:23,350
So it's going to be very elastic. Down here is going to be a big percent decrease in price is going to yield a small percent increase in quantity.

488
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:32,460
So that demand curve is going to be very inelastic as we get down towards the bottom of the towards the quantity offset.

489
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:42,700
So the elasticity is actually changing as we move along the demand curve and flips from elastic to inelastic at the midpoint.

490
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:48,900
So we can't say, well, what's the elasticity of demand along this demand curve yet?

491
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:56,220
Well, at what price? And the price of 40 is going to be different than the elasticity in calculating the price of.

492
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:03,960
What is? Now we see how expenditures change.

493
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,120
It's the price is 50. I'm literally spending nothing on this. Good.

494
00:53:08,130 --> 00:53:12,390
Why? Because of their price. I don't demand any. I'm just out price of 50.

495
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:15,570
I don't buy any. So imagine sort of any good you buy.

496
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:18,600
So what's the highest price at which you'd buy any of this?

497
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:25,240
If price is any higher than that, you'd be spending nothing on it because you'd cut your quantity to zero.

498
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:33,790
So obviously then as I drop price, my spending is going to have to go up some range of prices.

499
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,990
Then once I get to the point where the elasticity was negative one,

500
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:46,390
my spending is maximized and if I continue to drop the price, I'm actually spending less on it.

501
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:53,320
Again, by definition, if they were giving it away, I wouldn't be spending on it because the P times Q has to be zero regardless of what Q is.

502
00:53:54,070 --> 00:54:02,139
My spending is kind of hill and hill is maximized at the midpoint of a linear demand curve.

503
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:05,290
So this is true for any linear demand curve. So it's kind of a.

504
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:13,890
That to be aware of. All right.

505
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:19,420
One more of Leicester City, and then we're down to fighting Leicester City until we talk about pretenses and supply.

506
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:26,320
Cross price elasticity of demand. So exactly the same as the price elasticity of demand.

507
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:32,100
Except for one thing. The price elasticity of demand.

508
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:46,659
It's a right a specific good in here. But if I had done it, it would be Q, X and X or it could be Q, Y and p, y, whatever the two goods are,

509
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:53,680
it's the same is we're talking about the response to that goods, phone price across price elasticity.

510
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:01,630
I'm talking about how the demand for one good changes when the price of some other goods changes.

511
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:09,300
And that's how we're going to distinguish substitutes and complement.

512
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:15,950
So as we talked about in the beginning, substitutes have positive across price elasticities, compliments have negative.

513
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:21,290
If we are going to literally have a zero across price elasticity, we call them independent goods.

514
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:52,480
We said, well, how large are these numbers? If this was positive .01 see other substitutes but they don't seem to be very strongly linked to

515
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:59,090
consumption of one of them really does not very much when the price of the other changes is this 4.5,

516
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:03,919
then you say, well, that's a pretty meaningful effect. You know, you get a 1% increase, another good.

517
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:07,960
I buy a half percent less of this good. Apple.

518
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:12,360
And similarly, if as if this was negative .01,

519
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:17,870
you'd say as pretty essentially independent these two good people whether it's

520
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:21,180
society and one of them the price of the other one doesn't really matter.

521
00:56:23,210 --> 00:56:27,710
But if this is a much larger number, it would. So let's think about this.

522
00:56:29,830 --> 00:56:34,310
Essentially, the question I had on class for Wednesday,

523
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:39,440
I do it today because I think sort of it's at night when I see it with the cross price elasticity discussion.

524
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:49,910
Occasionally there are policy proposals that come out every five or ten years to mandate the use of child safety seats in airplanes.

525
00:56:51,260 --> 00:57:02,610
So what is the current law or current and current FAA regulation on that Federal Aviation Administration sitting in your lap until stage two.

526
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:12,440
So any any child up to the age of two parents can buy a seat for that child and put them in a safe seat,

527
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:16,760
but they are allowed to simply not pay for the child and put the child in your lap.

528
00:57:19,190 --> 00:57:25,489
And every five or ten years, proposals come out and say, well, we really we mandate child safety seats in cars.

529
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:27,530
We really should mandate them in planes.

530
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:35,810
And I would argue that if you've got legislation, I'll get sort of cute names you can't possibly vote against.

531
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:42,170
Regardless of how hideous the legislation is, it always is named something that sounds like, Oh my God, I have to vote for that.

532
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:49,520
So if we had an honest name for this legislation, I would argue it's the Baby Killing Act of 2022.

533
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:58,790
Why would I say that's an honest name for legislation to mandate car seats receiving child safety seats in airlines.

534
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:05,360
It's like if there is like a plane crash, it's harder to for the baby, for Lucy.

535
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:12,820
So technical concerns. Maybe it isn't an effect just for engineering perspective, it's not an effective solution.

536
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:15,370
Actually, what I say it is an effective solution.

537
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:25,450
Charles Child Restrained is slightly more likely to survive a crash, but probably much more importantly, more likely to be safe in a turbulence.

538
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:33,250
So that because there are very, very, very few plane crashes, but there are a lot of turbulence events,

539
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,780
even climate change turbulence events are expected to go up like everything else.

540
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:45,969
So sorry to be pressing this morning, but yeah.

541
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:49,610
So, you know, if you've got a child that's restrained, think of the physics of it.

542
00:58:49,690 --> 00:58:55,120
The plane suddenly drops 1000 feet. Can the parent hold the child?

543
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:01,299
The inertia is that state. That's a dangerous event, not even involving a crash.

544
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:09,370
So let's say that clearly a child in a plane in a safety seat is, in fact safer than a child in a plane.

545
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:15,520
And mom and dad's lap get something. I thought I did so.

546
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:23,230
But I guess if you like, maybe this would be like an additional cost to either the airline or the consumer.

547
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:27,700
So they would choose to decrease the demand for flying if they have a kid.

548
00:59:28,070 --> 00:59:33,970
You know, so think about I know I have to say, I've got two parents and one infant.

549
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:40,240
I now have to buy three tickets if you mandate this rather than two.

550
00:59:40,570 --> 00:59:43,900
So it's a 50% increase in the price of air travel.

551
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:54,160
Now we're mandating the use of child safety seats under this proposal, conditional upon the parents choosing to take their trip by plane.

552
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:58,090
Are we mandating that the parents fly or say, you can?

553
00:59:58,330 --> 01:00:03,459
We're mandating child safety seats? And not only that, we're mandating that if you're going to go from Detroit to Los Angeles,

554
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:08,950
you're going to Detroit from to Memphis or wherever that you must fly.

555
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:16,180
Now, that's not part of it. We're mandating only that if you fly, you have to use a safety seat.

556
01:00:17,460 --> 01:00:20,620
You have to buy another ticket, but you didn't have to buy under current regulation.

557
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:26,230
What might parents do instead? I drive.

558
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:38,170
Okay, so it turns out that yes, technically a child in a child safety seat on a plane is safer than a child in mom and dad's lap on a plane,

559
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:46,030
but a child in mom and dad lab mom and Dad's lab on a plane is much safer than a child in a properly

560
01:00:46,030 --> 01:00:52,269
installed child safety seat in the rear seat of mom and dad's car is car travel is so much less safe.

561
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:58,270
The plane travel. So if we know about the cross price elasticity of demand between air and car travel.

562
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:10,160
We can predict, well, what would this proposal result in? So it turns out the cross price elasticity of demand bursts.

563
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:16,910
But. Estimated at about plus .36.

564
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,590
Okay. So substitute.

565
01:01:22,340 --> 01:01:27,050
So right there, we already know if we raise the price of air travel, there's going to be more car travel.

566
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:33,140
Turns out as cross price elasticities go, you know, 2.36 is actually a pretty big number.

567
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:38,570
So a benchmark is sort of zero. Was an independent good.

568
01:01:38,850 --> 01:01:45,739
So it's a 10% increase in air travel is going to be about 3.6% increase or 10% increase in air

569
01:01:45,740 --> 01:01:51,920
travel prices is going to yield about a 3.6% increase in trips taken by car rather than air.

570
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:57,200
And so in a typical year, we expect.

571
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,370
It's been estimated that the expected.

572
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:07,930
Life spent, lives saved by this mandate on planes as point three.

573
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:18,610
So point three canceled a typical year or so down to 2.3 per 100 million miles traveled by air.

574
01:02:22,850 --> 01:02:28,580
So for every 100 million trip miles traveled by air, this proposal would be expected to save 3/10 of a life.

575
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,780
However, because of this cost price elasticity of demand.

576
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:40,100
For every extra 100 million miles traveled by car.

577
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:46,639
11.5 additional fatalities and injuries.

578
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:51,140
Add to this as well. This is just talking about fatalities. So, in other words.

579
01:02:53,190 --> 01:03:04,260
Since kids are already so safe in a plane, even unrestrained, that making them a tiny, tiny, tiny bit safer is completely swamped.

580
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:13,380
By the increase in the price of air travel, by having the extra ticket that has to be bought rather than having the infant go for free,

581
01:03:13,830 --> 01:03:17,010
causing parents to say, you know what, we're going to drive instead of fly.

582
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:20,220
Now, maybe if we're going to Los Angeles, we're still going to fly.

583
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:26,910
But if we're going to Chicago, we're going to Nashville or Louisville or we're going someplace that's,

584
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:34,170
you know, in a 12 hour drive, maybe even Florida, going down to Disney World with the kids.

585
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:44,460
They will drive rather than fly. So that's why that terrible name is well intentioned.

586
01:03:45,390 --> 01:03:49,860
Technically, it's correct. Kids are safer, restrained in a plane than unrestrained in a plane.

587
01:03:51,270 --> 01:03:58,349
But people's behavior will essentially offset the safety gains people's behavior, saying, wait a minute, air travel is more expensive.

588
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:06,050
I'm going to drive instead. So since we're only mandating the use conditional on them flying, we're not mandating that trips above.

589
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:14,070
If we also mandated or any trip above a certain distance must be taken on an airplane that you're not allowed to drive if you have an infant.

590
01:04:15,930 --> 01:04:22,110
I don't think we're ever going to get that passed. That's always something you'd want to bring to Congress with a said, you know what?

591
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:29,940
We're going to prohibit families from driving more than 5 hours with a kid for for child safety reasons.

592
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:35,160
You think you got a chance of getting that passed? Talk about a nonstarter.

593
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:41,280
But unless you actually pass that, you're stuck with this cross price elasticity of demand,

594
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,890
meaning that this is kind of a bad public health policy as opposed to, you know, it sounds good.

595
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:57,540
You know, technically it's a good policy. Technically, the policy saves child lives, but behaviorally, people offset it more.

596
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:06,710
You know, going back to anti-lock brakes, which are now standard every car.

597
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:11,810
When they first came out was probably in the 1980s.

598
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,750
And whether you're like any new car feature,

599
01:05:14,750 --> 01:05:21,560
it's something that just a few cars put out or maybe even some of their models or some trim levels of their models.

600
01:05:21,570 --> 01:05:25,740
So it's something that initially nobody had and then a few people had it.

601
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:31,550
So insurance companies decided they wanted to encourage people to have anti-lock brakes in their cars.

602
01:05:32,270 --> 01:05:38,360
So they offer discounts. If your car was equipped with anti-lock brakes, you got, say, $100 off your car insurance for the year.

603
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,749
That's an incentive to get a car with anti-lock brakes. And then about three years later,

604
01:05:44,750 --> 01:05:49,309
they all dropped those discounts after they analyzed the data and they found

605
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:57,970
there was no difference in claims for various cars and not any cars matter,

606
01:05:57,980 --> 01:06:03,920
like brakes not work. From pure technical engineering sense.

607
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:08,510
There is something wrong with the anti-lock brakes technically. So these are all our cars.

608
01:06:08,510 --> 01:06:16,450
Have them now. They work exactly as designed. But people's driving behavior changed.

609
01:06:16,810 --> 01:06:19,990
So initially it was two things. One was people didn't know exactly how to use it.

610
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:24,490
You know, these people used to be told without anti-lock brakes you had to like feather the brake,

611
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:28,030
you know, like tap, tap, tap because you didn't want to lock your brakes slammed on the brake.

612
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:33,100
They would lock your wheels the lock. And if you're on ice or something, at that point, you have no control and you skid.

613
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:40,810
So the point of anti-lock brakes is to kind of do this tapping of the brakes at a rate thousands of times faster than you could do it as a human.

614
01:06:41,210 --> 01:06:47,470
It's technically how they work, but they take the brake to the threshold of locking the knees up front threshold, locking in these things.

615
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:50,380
So partly people still slammed on.

616
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:57,220
We're still trying to feather the brakes when they really should be slamming on them because the car is now doing that for you.

617
01:06:58,270 --> 01:07:02,320
But it was also partly a people became less safe in some decisions they made.

618
01:07:02,570 --> 01:07:06,250
So I got anti-lock brakes. So I don't have to worry so much about stopping on ice.

619
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:10,840
I'm going to be approaching this traffic light a little bit too fast.

620
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:18,240
And if the anti-lock brakes will stop my car. So technically they worked exactly as designed.

621
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:26,419
There is no technical flaw. The people's behavior changed partly because they didn't know how to use it and partly because they then became

622
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:30,260
a little bit more willing to take a risk because they thought the anti-lock brakes would bail them out.

623
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:38,900
I'd like you to go out on I-90 for an ice storm and you'll see the ditches filled with four wheel drive vehicles.

624
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:43,550
You don't see the ditches for the little Toyota Corollas. Why?

625
01:07:44,380 --> 01:07:48,260
It's like being on the southern market, right?

626
01:07:48,530 --> 01:07:54,920
It's not a four wheel drive vehicle isn't better on snow and ice than a Toyota Corolla with front wheel drive.

627
01:07:55,190 --> 01:07:58,580
But people with Corollas either stay home or they drive very carefully.

628
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:02,540
And people that make four wheel drive vehicles think they're invincible. Right.

629
01:08:03,230 --> 01:08:06,470
So the technology works perfectly. Right.

630
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:13,130
It's the humans that defeat its benefits. The technology's not for humans of life.

631
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:18,360
So it's kind of similar thing. We can mandate the technology.

632
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:23,590
The technology works not much because the air travel is so strong regardless.

633
01:08:24,190 --> 01:08:27,610
But it does work. But then you change people's incentives.

634
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:35,950
They respond to that change incentives in a way that ends up being a net negative for the policy.

635
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:49,830
So market demand, again, is just kind of sum of individual demands and literally is nothing more than that and say,

636
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:53,490
well, at a particular price, how much do all the people in the market buy?

637
01:08:53,610 --> 01:09:02,130
Literally just add it up. And we had elastic, perfectly elastic and elastic demand and goods.

638
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,680
So perfectly inelastic. The vertical demand curve would be a price elasticity of zero.

639
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:16,860
Inelastic would be between zero and negative one. So we begin absolute values of fraction.

640
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:24,030
The last stick would be less than negative one. Or if we're thinking of absolute values greater than one.

641
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:34,140
So the two were the five up here. And then we saw that with the linear demand curve that the elasticity depends on where you are.

642
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:42,059
There's a different elasticity at a different price, and the midpoint is always going to be where the elasticity is negative one,

643
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:45,510
and that will also be where expenditures are maximized.

644
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,840
If you think about that, it kind of makes sense that elasticity of negative one.

645
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:52,590
What that means is just so that marginal last little change in price,

646
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:59,760
the percentage increase in price was perfectly offset at a 1 to 1 rate by a decrease in quantity.

647
01:10:00,180 --> 01:10:03,360
So expenditure is approximately constant.

648
01:10:04,380 --> 01:10:11,220
So we're kind of thinking of that expenditures and still if we're tight, if we're right at the top of that hill at that midpoint.

649
01:10:13,260 --> 01:10:18,060
That's roughly flat expenditures. And the reason it's roughly flat is with the elasticity.

650
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:25,920
T equals negative one. That 1% increase in price is just perfectly offset by a 1% increase in quantity.

651
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:34,090
So expenditures are basically flat here at the top. Then got cross price elasticities.

652
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:38,570
Give us a precise way of defining substitutes and complements based on their sign.

653
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:43,210
Now we can also think about sort of how closely substitutable are to balance.

654
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:46,270
Is it a big number or is a small number?

655
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,399
How closely complementary are there? Were they close to independent?

656
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:59,450
The gross price elasticity is very close to zero. The price change in one go it doesn't influence is that there's a 20% increase in the price of salt.

657
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:05,210
Is that going to affect the demand for new cars? Probably not.

658
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:09,410
So those two goons are probably pretty independent of each other.

659
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:14,670
And if you buy a new car, you're not going to go, well, I really got to cut back on my salt consumption now.

660
01:11:16,790 --> 01:11:18,850
That's probably going to be a very, very close to zero.

661
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:28,610
Got a few minutes left so we can kind of do this is going to be useful because it's going to be very similar to one of your problem sets.

662
01:11:29,030 --> 01:11:35,410
It's going to have split up to do it. But she does have 10 minutes left for this kind of work, this problem together.

663
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:38,900
So that's from the new set of practice problems.

664
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:49,010
And we start on three consumer markets and we've got algebraic equations for sort of add them up to get a market demand.

665
01:11:49,010 --> 01:11:59,930
And it's going to let us see sort of one additional subtlety or nuance of adding up demand curves to get to a market demand.

666
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:07,490
So we've got three consumers right there.

667
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:31,110
Demand curves up kind of larger here. Thank you.

668
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:47,530
So again, we've got the convention. We draw demand curves with price on the Y axis.

669
01:12:47,540 --> 01:12:51,530
So if we don't put these in the standard form of the line, we're going to have to solve for P.

670
01:12:53,430 --> 01:13:02,520
So this one we can. And to appeal to both sides and subtract you from both sides.

671
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:15,330
One 1650 minus Q t over two.

672
01:13:16,180 --> 01:13:20,760
Okay, so let's graph that. So what does the first consumer demand curve look like?

673
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:31,100
We've got intercept of 50 on price access and that's going to be intercept of 100 on the quantity axis.

674
01:13:31,610 --> 01:13:39,080
The slope is negative one half, so. It's going to hit at 102nd one.

675
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:57,280
You do the same thing and say, well, for P equals 160 -2 to 40 like you need for me.

676
01:13:58,590 --> 01:14:08,500
Okay. So. Let's draw this person's demand curve for 40 and that will be 160.

677
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:22,670
We could do the same thing here. Five equals 150 minus Q so that will be 3041.

678
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:44,380
And so this one is going to be called. Yes.

679
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:52,840
And now let's think about adding these up into a market demand curve.

680
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:58,420
What are the market demand? B is at a price of 45.

681
01:14:58,420 --> 01:15:08,830
How would you have things up just conceptually? 45 for the price of vitamin C with that quantity will be at some.

682
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:15,200
I feel with one nuance is one nuance we're looking for here, the price of 45.

683
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:23,620
Who's actually buying the product? Just exactly that.

684
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:32,620
That was a light bulb just there because this person says, well, wait a second, our price of 40, I'm out this first price of 30, I'm out.

685
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:36,909
So if we really want to be complete about their demand curve, it's not just this line,

686
01:15:36,910 --> 01:15:45,310
but then it goes vertical along the axis at prices above 30, and this one goes vertical and price is above 40.

687
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:54,279
This one goes vertical prices above 50. If we literally just added up these equations blindly, well, the equation doesn't end at the axis.

688
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:59,170
It would keep going up here to negative quantities and this person would keep going up here.

689
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:05,620
So if we literally just added up the equations and then plugged in a price of 45,

690
01:16:05,950 --> 01:16:10,150
what we'd be doing is we'd be adding a positive quantity for this person,

691
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:16,480
some negative quantity for this person, and some negative quantity for this person by negative quantities.

692
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:23,650
So what we really ought to do is think well and price above 50, the market demand is actually zero.

693
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:28,360
You don't have to add up any equations because nobody's in the market.

694
01:16:29,590 --> 01:16:36,370
Prices that I all three of them tap out, say, I'm not interested in this product at a price of 45.

695
01:16:36,370 --> 01:16:42,820
Essentially, this person's individual demand curve is the entire market demand curve is they're the only one active in the market.

696
01:16:43,630 --> 01:16:50,980
The other two people are in the market, but they're just sitting it out and say, well, the price of 45, you know, it's so good.

697
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:56,870
I would buy at some prices, but not at that price. So prices above 50.

698
01:16:56,870 --> 01:17:00,920
Market demand to zero. Prices between 40 and 50.

699
01:17:01,490 --> 01:17:10,190
The entire market. Is the first person's demand now at prices below 40.

700
01:17:10,220 --> 01:17:17,629
All of a sudden this consumer jump said. So if we want the equation for the market demand curve at prices between 30 and 40,

701
01:17:17,630 --> 01:17:23,630
we need to add the equations of these two individuals because they're the ones that are actually active in the market.

702
01:17:24,710 --> 01:17:28,370
And then finally, at prices both 30 and below, this person jumps in.

703
01:17:28,970 --> 01:17:32,630
And so if all we do is to get the market demand curve as we blindly add it up,

704
01:17:33,890 --> 01:17:40,100
just if this was this plus this and we get some equation when we add those all up.

705
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:51,810
We would be correct at prices below 30. We'd actually have the wrong equation for the market demand curve at prices above 30.

706
01:17:53,190 --> 01:18:03,569
Between 30 and 40. We just have to have this person and this person and at prices above 40, up to 50 would say, well,

707
01:18:03,570 --> 01:18:08,940
the entire market demand curve is just this person's market demand curve because they're the entire market.

708
01:18:09,030 --> 01:18:13,500
They're the only ones active. They're the only one shows up at the store and leaves without anything.

709
01:18:15,670 --> 01:18:19,299
So the market demand curve isn't going to have since these are all linear curves,

710
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:24,460
it's going to have sort of three linear segments with kinks, kind of like you're saying, budget constraint on the first budget,

711
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:30,580
on the first problems that you're going to take to market demand curve with the can't get 40 and I can't get

712
01:18:30,580 --> 01:18:37,479
certainty as we're adding these people in and you have a problem and problem set to there's kind of just like that.

713
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:46,750
So we just did your homework. That's how I was on the practice problems as well.

714
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:51,600
So just a little is just a bring out this subtlety of, you know,

715
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:57,400
people jump in and out of the market based on the price and if we just blindly add up equations,

716
01:18:57,760 --> 01:19:03,640
what we're doing at some prices is we're adding in negative quantities for some people, which makes no sense.

717
01:19:06,340 --> 01:19:13,440
So really think of the person's demand curve as here's the segment where they're actually active in the market and they're buying somebody quantity.

718
01:19:13,780 --> 01:19:22,480
But there's also this segment where it's just ridiculous. Why would they buy zero at any price above $30?

719
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:30,160
All right. So next time we have our first student presentation on the sugar tax,

720
01:19:30,160 --> 01:19:34,930
so the rest of you have to read the articles in detail if you're not the presenter.

721
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:40,570
But I would have to take a quick skim through the Wednesday class.

722
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:55,990
So short articles, I think that's great for a host.

723
01:19:56,780 --> 01:19:57,520
Yeah, but then let's.
