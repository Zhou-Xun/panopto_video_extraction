2
00:00:06,611 --> 00:00:09,710
Another important concept
is that of sample size.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,283
To illustrate sample size, let's consider
that this population of M&Ms now is

4
00:00:14,283 --> 00:00:16,649
the population of American adult women.

5
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:19,130
And we're interested in our heights.

6
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,000
We're going to take different
sample sizes, small, medium, and

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,780
large, to think about what happens to the
estimate of the average height of American

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:30,560
woman in these different sample sizes.

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,150
If we take our small sample and
see the average height of American women,

10
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:40,884
we may find that the average height is
5'3", and ranges from 4'9" to 5'11".

11
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:43,614
Our standard deviation of
the average height, or

12
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:49,050
a measure of dispersion around
that average, is 4.2 inches.

13
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:53,270
Now, if we take a bigger sample,
a medium sized sample,

14
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:59,580
we might find that our average height
is 5'3", it ranges from 4'9" to 5'11",

15
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,960
and the standard deviation is 3.4 inches.

16
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:11,640
An even larger sample of women, we may
find that our average height if 5'4",

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:20,020
and it ranges from 4'10" to 5'11", and
our standard deviation is 3 inches.

18
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:23,690
You can see, here, how the different
sample sizes affect the estimate and

19
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,600
the precision around the estimate.

20
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,810
Here we have graphs, or histograms,
which are bar charts of the frequency of

21
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:34,740
heights, showing that, as our sample size
increased, our estimate of the average

22
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,320
American adult woman's height of 5'4"
was closer to that population value.

23
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,060
Our precision around that
estimate got smaller, and

24
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:49,590
you can see that there's nice bell-shaped
curves as the sample size increases.

25
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,800
So as the sample size increases,
you get a better estimate and

26
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,280
greater precision around that estimate.

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,570
So when you are evaluating
a public health study, stop and

28
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,510
think, how many subjects or
things were included?

29
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:06,660
Is the sample of adequate
size to have valid results?

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:10,670
We wanna think about the sample size
in order to critically evaluate

31
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,801
the size of the study and
the validity of the results.
