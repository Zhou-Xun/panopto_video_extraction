1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,610
Time out. You just come on. The police brokerage firm.

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:22,859
Hello, everyone. I know from your instructions that one of the screaming birds will go over some

3
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:28,050
questions from the money as point of view that people were kind of unclear about.

4
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,250
First is the gold standard, which is using these standards.

5
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:45,070
This can be from a PCR test or other thing considered just be standard in a field that shows disease or negativity.

6
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:53,290
When you have your screening test and you set it up on the website or Google boxes or.

7
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:57,960
And that can be just like being in prison or not home.

8
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:01,410
It has to be harder.

9
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,720
You can see in Box A, you will have the true positives where the screening and the gold standard both agree.

10
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,620
And where the screen is very, very positive.

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,880
But you truly do not have the disease. That's where you get the false positives and the.

12
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,590
From negative screening with true disease.

13
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:37,160
We have not seen with the false negatives and in the you have your true negatives or the screening and your disease status are both negatives.

14
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:50,730
For sensitivity. This is defined as the ability of a test to correctly identify those you have visiting that you can see.

15
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:54,840
The denominator is important when calculating sensitivity.

16
00:01:56,010 --> 00:02:01,620
You consider all of those that have disease by the gold standard as your denominator.

17
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:12,579
So you're taking how many true positives you have and dividing that by how many and truly have disease or specificity.

18
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:16,980
You do the same thing for the known disease category by your gold standard.

19
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:23,060
Is the ability of a test to correctly identify those who do not have disease.

20
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,380
It will be the proportion of not disease persons who are identified as not disease by the screening test.

21
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,430
And that will be Vox's billion de is the denominator and the numerator is back to your true negatives.

22
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:50,790
For. In TV and PPV, you're going to have your predictive values, which is what they stand for.

23
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,160
The test is positive. The probability is that the patient has the disease has been tested negative.

24
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,230
The probability that the patient does not have the disease. Those are what you're calculating using this.

25
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,980
So your denominator for positive predictive value will be to consider all those who screen positive.

26
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:19,990
So you add up A and B, and then you see how many were truly positive out of all of those who screened positive.

27
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:27,360
And that will give you your positive predictive value or negative predictive value.

28
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,630
You do the same except for the negative screening.

29
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,630
So you're denominator in C plus D, all of those who screen to negative.

30
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:42,090
And then you see what proportion your true negatives are out of those.

31
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:47,950
So it will be overseen plus the going by this table so.

32
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,520
In summary, for sensitivity of those who are deceased,

33
00:03:55,630 --> 00:04:07,500
boxes may be seen according to the gold standard is the proportion who are truly positive and were identified as positive by the screening test.

34
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,160
Or specificity of those who are disease free.

35
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,000
According to the gold standard for gene editing,

36
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,110
the Class B specificity is the proportion who are truly negative and identified as negative by the screening to.

37
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:36,140
Or positive predictive value on those who tested positive according to the screening tests.

38
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:43,580
Foxes may possibly be the proportion who are truly positive and might pay.

39
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,730
Negative predictive value is the same for the negatives of those who screen negative.

40
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:59,520
According to the screening test, success c plus mean this is the proportion who are truly negative vs.

41
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:08,370
Can refer back to those for the formulas and the tables that are you remember

42
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:15,299
the top three have your true to the end by the gold standard input desired.

43
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:23,370
You set up your screening test and then this relationship will work pretty much every time.

44
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,639
And now for 23 reviews. For the questions.

45
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,790
One through five will refer to the following.

46
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:48,320
If the Gators wanted to evaluate the use of a short survey assessing influenza like symptoms as an effective screening test for acting.

47
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:59,960
In January 2017, the researchers tested the Use for the Symptom survey among 500 students living in the University of Michigan residence halls.

48
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:10,930
Survey findings were compared with the gold standard influenza determination by PCR matched the screening test characteristics result.

49
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,750
Users generally set up a 2.3 cable as seen on the previous slide.

50
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:29,310
So this past June, 390 students reported no influenza symptoms to these 390 screened negative.

51
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:35,030
Since they are reporting this. And that is your test on the survey.

52
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:39,680
And tested negative PCR your gold standard.

53
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,300
So these two things agreed. So not sure. True negatives.

54
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:56,340
92% of students with PCR defined influenza reported influenza symptoms on the survey.

55
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,290
So you're seeing sensitivity here. If you go back to the formula.

56
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,590
The ambiguity in. Well.

57
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:34,059
Okay. Sensitivity.

58
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,720
You have a reason to frequency.

59
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,610
That is what you should find if you sat through to your table and read the statement here.

60
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:58,690
Three of the 497 students had reported no influenza symptoms on the survey and did not have

61
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:07,739
a PCR to find influenza and would be negative predictive value indicating all of those.

62
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:11,370
That screen was volunteers.

63
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:27,930
Information for 20 students reported information gleaned from the survey but did not occur April five in London when the false the.

64
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:40,660
You can see here the screen positive for truly negatives in false positives in the.

65
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:51,110
Of the 500 students in the study, 18% have easier to find employment.

66
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:57,330
You're part of the total population. How many have you?

67
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,710
Honorable mention, the percentage of this multiplier is 590.1 H.

68
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:15,490
Question six and seven, please refer to the following alert.

69
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,850
X is a chemical company in which workers are exposed to a dangerous chemical.

70
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:25,430
Long term exposure among workers to this chemical can lead to vascular problems.

71
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,649
Alert exports to remote swamps to monitor levels of exposure to this chemical

72
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:36,390
among its workers and reassign them to different jobs if levels are too high.

73
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,760
Until now, the only way to monitor the chemical was drawing blood samples.

74
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:50,220
A costly procedure. This would also be the gold standard and one which workers did not want to undergo monitoring.

75
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,700
The company had just come out with a kit to measure breakdown products of the toxin in the urine.

76
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,280
This would be a screening test to kind of replace the blood test.

77
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,660
The test would be less costly and more acceptable to the world.

78
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,640
Alert X experts to evaluate the screening properties of the new urine.

79
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:21,030
Your assumptions are that 500 people will be screened so that your total population through disease is defined by your

80
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:29,910
gold standard high toxin levels in blood and the positive screening test is defined as urine values above a couple.

81
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:39,040
If you set this up, you have 100 watts, high levels of toxic environment.

82
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:46,740
Those are those who screened positive. If you have high levels of toxin by urine and blood.

83
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,030
On your true positive screen occupations.

84
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,450
400 have low levels of toxin by urine.

85
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:08,030
So those are the ones who screened negative. And 350 have low levels of toxins in my urine and lot of those are your true negatives in might the.

86
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:26,640
To calculate the sensitivity you use the previously seen formula using box a word, box a C and you should get 50% because all of those numbers are.

87
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:37,110
Or specificity of the urine test using the formula D or being one to the.

88
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,930
And you come up with 87.5% in these numbers and this table.

89
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:53,710
Four Question Agents in Public Health Practice Developing a highly sensitive screening test.

90
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:05,360
It comes at the expense of specificity before a given population results and an increased number of false positives and the number of true.

91
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:14,700
Trading some of your ability to detect. The negatives for capturing more of the positives.

92
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:22,320
Would you also lump in some of the some people who are truly positive in that group?

93
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,160
That is reliable. Also necessarily be precise.

94
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:41,930
It doesn't necessarily have to be accurate because you can be accurate and have the same target over and over, but it's still the wrong target.

95
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,419
But on a serious disease can be treated if it is caught early.

96
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,520
It is important to have a test of high sensitivity. True.

97
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:04,480
You want to make sure you get all of the true positives in the exam end up testing falsely positive.

98
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:09,340
You will be let off once you go in for further testing.

99
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,780
Okay. Now for our next engaged learning, you can find this under the week for materials.

100
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,710
This may take the rest of the class period.

101
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:32,100
Or it would take about 30 minutes or so that you can work in groups of yourself or however you feel comfortable,

102
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:41,591
and we will go over it once you're done. Yeah, I guess I.

103
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:16,230
you can time obviously that with her case law as I assume you already know 11 studies in an earth cohort with a little bit of hygiene,

104
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,910
regular and irregular toothbrushing was used as the screening tool for the absence or presence of General Black,

105
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,450
which was verified through the gold standard of internal.

106
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:37,490
I mean, what was number one, given that the screen questionnaire asked about the frequency of daily toothbrushing,

107
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:43,700
regular or irregular response when it was used as a positive screen for dental demand.

108
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,620
Yeah. We're going to do your regular version.

109
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,540
And mostly because we would expect more. General Motors.

110
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:09,750
You would not think about how to shoot using inferior regularity from table or in

111
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:17,169
front of her to go to table data from the table or to appropriately label row,

112
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:25,950
row and column headers and after your table should look something like this would rather.

113
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,869
So you get your numbers, you see the prevalence of dental plaque.

114
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,700
You have a total population of 415 people.

115
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:50,339
But had. For the frequency of daily toothbrushing.

116
00:15:50,340 --> 00:16:00,210
You have 875 people you brush regularly and a few hundred and 47 who is not in the road totals for those three.

117
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:07,680
For those who do have class by the gold standard.

118
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:18,020
We have 123. And to have that and your regular brushing and 290 to.

119
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:34,370
We have regular brushing and. You get the next three boxes, we just use some traction to kind of figure out what the totals would be.

120
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:46,560
For those choosing you, subtract 123 from 247 and see that 124 people have your regular brushing and no plan.

121
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:56,410
Extreme positive, but there were truly negative. And the same as with regular brushing.

122
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:00,730
You're not have five feet, which are your true negatives?

123
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:06,750
We have 875 -292 to get to 583.

124
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:13,080
We got those to give your column total and then you can see that.

125
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:24,750
Towards the bottom along that road, add up to 1122 and the whole further column on the right also rises after that.

126
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,090
And you can verify that at the top of the table. And you see that this is current.

127
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,830
That is how many people you have. And your total population.

128
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,820
Skip ahead the words bunch for number three using your two by two table for

129
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:52,670
regression to calculate sensitivity and specificity and provide interpretation.

130
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,010
This table. We will calculate sensitivity to be 123.

131
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,180
Divided by 415. And then convert that to a percentage.

132
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:16,470
So you have a 29.6% sensitivity.

133
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:18,900
That is where you want to.

134
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:32,350
The interpretation among the 415 Brazilian children of the birth cohort study with clients identified by clinical exam 3009.

135
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:41,960
29.6% would be incorrectly identified as having dental implants by a report of irregular brushing.

136
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:52,980
So this is the screening test correctly identified, 29.6% of the victims truly have no plans.

137
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,640
For specificity. We refer back to the formula for before.

138
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:05,680
And your calculation is 583 divided by 707.

139
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:16,180
The man is overseeing the. In 2.5%.

140
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:29,650
So your interpretation is among the 707 Brazilian children of the birth cohort study were not identified by clinical exam in 2009.

141
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:40,840
82.5% would be correctly identified as having no plaques by a report of clinical brushing regular.

142
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:57,360
Full outlook on the predictive value and negative predictive of any misinterpretation.

143
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:15,840
They were once again using this table in your formulas for calculating positive predictive value as 130 divided by 247% or 49.8%.

144
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:32,130
So you interpret that. Of the 247 Brazilian Children River cohort study with maternal reports of irregular rushing in 3009.

145
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:38,900
49.8% actually had dental files on clinical exams.

146
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:47,870
In other words, those with irregular brushing a positive test to the daily toothbrushing screening.

147
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:52,760
Hiding 49.8% chance of having.

148
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:59,390
Reinterpretations might seem long, but it's important.

149
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:08,039
You have to watch where and when your interpretation is correctly.

150
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:14,450
Specify which thing you're talking. Four negative predictive values.

151
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:21,120
The positive predictors. Have 183 divided by 875.

152
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,880
You can see at your table. That's what you. 583.

153
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:36,500
Your true negatives divided by your road. Totally. And that is going to give 66.6%.

154
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:51,410
So earning that of the 875 children and Bieber's cohort study with maternal reports of regular toothbrushing in 2009.

155
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:58,500
In 6.6% did not have dental plaque on clinical exam.

156
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,600
In other words, those where you live.

157
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:11,110
I have a 56.6% chance of not having dental work.

158
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:18,960
No. For number five.

159
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,140
The strengths and weaknesses of the screening test.

160
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:37,699
A variety of answers were acceptable, but some of the main strengths of the questions were administered to the mothers,

161
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,480
so they had to be feasible and simple and inexpensive.

162
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,500
It is very important that the screening be feasible or nobody is going to do it.

163
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,030
And this also addresses an important public health problem of early high prevalence.

164
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:07,190
And it has serious consequences. With children to develop abscesses and other infections, sepsis and things like that.

165
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,860
And a weakness you can probably see from the constellation.

166
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:24,650
It has a relatively low sensitivity, which will be something like 49.6%.

167
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:30,010
And they were all positive predictive value 30%.

168
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:46,979
For number six if the prevalence of genital doubled in this population is sensitivity,

169
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:54,780
specificity and positive predictive value for the screening question, then expected to increase, decrease or stay the same.

170
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:05,870
For this one, only positive predictive value would increase because you're increasing the number of true positives

171
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:13,430
like a which you go back to the calculation and you can see this is playing out in different numbers.

172
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:23,230
But basically sensitivity and specificity would not change based on the long term population

173
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:30,690
population because the test is still going to have the same review of barriers idea.

174
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,869
So how prevalent something is in the population?

175
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:47,710
The test is still the test. Positive predictive value will increase more sample size than your true positive currently.

176
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:08,839
When you walk through Cordelia, we're reminded to design regular toothbrushing brushing once per day or more as compared to twice per day.

177
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,470
Or what would be the impact on sensitivities?

178
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:26,890
What about specificity? You want. The.

179
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,420
You're working through the bottom of this.

180
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:45,710
In this picture, you will be increasing your number of true negatives and decreasing your number of true positives.

181
00:25:46,880 --> 00:26:04,220
If you do this. It really all comes back to setting up your table current points and then using your

182
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:12,760
formulas and trying to understand what it is telling you that you can see in the box.

183
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:19,190
A is where the true positives are not going to be increasing by moving people down.

184
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:28,430
And on the right, you're moving people into the which will increase your true negatives.

185
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:44,570
This is a permanent question because people are saying these are the same people just living with more loss.

186
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:51,790
You're not increasing the toll you're leaving the country is.

187
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,190
And then our last line is that.
