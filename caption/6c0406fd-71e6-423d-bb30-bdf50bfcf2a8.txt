2
00:00:06,221 --> 00:00:10,061
Another important issue in critically
evaluating public health studies,

3
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:13,120
is practical versus
statistical significance.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,210
Studies are generally published
when the results are interesting,

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:19,230
which is usually marched
by a small P-Value.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:23,495
When you start an experiment,
you generally set up two hypothesis.

7
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:26,900
One, which is called the Null Hypothesis,
is that there is no effect or

8
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,810
no difference between groups.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:32,290
The other hypothesis is called
an Alternative Hypothesis, and

10
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:34,230
that's where we say what
we think we'll see.

11
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,962
That there is a difference between groups,
there is an effect of some sort of size.

12
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:42,610
The P-Value, is the probability of
obtaining a result as extreme as the one

13
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:46,420
you've observed or even more extreme,
given that the null hypothesis or

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,890
that there is no effect is true.

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,420
Another way of saying this, is that
the P-Value measures the consistency of

16
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,180
the data that you have
with the null hypothesis.

17
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,700
So, studies are generally
found to be interesting and

18
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,880
statistically significant
if the P-Value is small,

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:06,310
because it's unlikely that you'd see
that event if there was no effect.

20
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:10,585
While statistical significance and
the P-Value is important, there's many

21
00:01:10,585 --> 00:01:14,617
controversies over the use of the P-Value
and the weight that we put on it.

22
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:17,457
There are few disadvantages
to using the P-Value,

23
00:01:17,457 --> 00:01:21,338
including the fact that it is not a good
measure of the size of an effect.

24
00:01:21,338 --> 00:01:24,729
It actually mixes the estimate
of the measurement and

25
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:31,080
it's uncertainty, and it's strongly
determined by the sample size.

26
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,350
To show that P-Value is strongly
determined by the sample size, we have

27
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:40,010
three graphs here that compare the average
height of women between American women,

28
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:44,180
shown in yellow, versus women from
the Netherlands, shown in orange.

29
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,240
The average height of an American
woman is five foot four,

30
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,520
whereas the average height of a woman
from the Netherlands is five foot seven.

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,880
If we do one experiment, where we
take ten women from each group and

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,310
compare their average heights,
we see a lot of overlap.

33
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,000
In fact, there's so much overlap that we
can't find a statistically significant

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,788
difference between the average
heights of these women.

35
00:02:04,788 --> 00:02:07,320
Our P-Value is 0.30.

36
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,789
If we take bigger samples, so now say we
take 30 from each group, and we compare

37
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:16,294
the heights between them, we do find
a statistically significant difference.

38
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:19,681
Here, our P-Value is .001.

39
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:24,412
If we take even bigger samples,
so now 100 women from each group.

40
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:27,372
Our P value is 2 to -12.

41
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:32,690
So that our P-Value has gotten much, much
smaller as our samples have gotten larger.

42
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:35,890
But the average difference between
these two groups has stayed the same

43
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,290
the entire time.

44
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,960
The height five foot four
versus five foot seven,

45
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,880
is always the same between the two
populations, three inches.

46
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:46,010
And we have no information
about that from our P-Value.

47
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:48,290
Due to the disadvantages pf the P-Value,

48
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,020
many advocate use a confidence
interval instead.

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,510
The confidence interval
includes both estimate and

50
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,770
the uncertainty around the estimate.

51
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:59,690
A confidence interval, is a random
interval that includes the true parameter

52
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,990
in a given proportion of samples.

53
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:04,940
This graph shows an illustration
of confidence intervals.

54
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,610
There are 100 here shown by the bars.

55
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,490
The circles in the bars in the middle,

56
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:12,990
show an estimate of the average
value of the measurement.

57
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,290
The population average is denoted by 0,
the dotted line.

58
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:21,750
You can see that in 95% or
in 95 out of 100 of these bars,

59
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,630
it includes that true value of 0.

60
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:28,750
But in five of them that are colored,
it does not include that true value.

61
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,010
So as you can see, the graph explains the
definition of a confidence interval and

62
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,770
shows us that a confidence
interval includes more information

63
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,090
than the P-Value.

64
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,760
So confidence interval gives
us a measure of the effect.

65
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:45,452
The measure of the effect is important in
terms of, is it actually practically or

66
00:03:45,452 --> 00:03:46,970
clinically meaningful.

67
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:51,654
Practical significance, is important to
remember besides statistical significance,

68
00:03:51,654 --> 00:03:54,610
because will the effect that
we see make any difference or

69
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,913
any change in what we do.

70
00:03:55,913 --> 00:03:59,637
Think about a study, if it finds
that a treatment, statistically,

71
00:03:59,637 --> 00:04:04,280
significantly lowers blood pressure by
one millimeter of mercury, that's great.

72
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,910
It's statistically significant but
is probably not practically significant.

73
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:11,660
We probably wouldn't wanna
put that treatment to use,

74
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,248
just to lower blood pressure
by that small amount.

75
00:04:15,248 --> 00:04:18,450
So a P-Value is connected to sample size,
and

76
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:21,830
doesn't tell us a lot about
the measure of the effect.

77
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,570
Instead a confidence interval,
tells us about the estimate and

78
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,160
the uncertainty around it.

79
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,860
So when you're critically
evaluating studies, stop and

80
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,380
think, what is the effect?

81
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,100
What's the size of the effect?

82
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,700
Is that statistically and
practically meaningful?

83
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:38,443
Will that actually change practice?
