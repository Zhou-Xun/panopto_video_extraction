1
00:00:00,040 --> 01:19:26,265
[CROSSTALK] I'm sure you'll be funny.

2
00:00:04,635 --> 00:00:06,228
>> [LAUGH].

3
00:00:06,228 --> 00:00:07,310
>> I don't know about accurate.

4
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:11,630
>> [LAUGH].

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,559
>> Here's a little pointer for you.

6
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:19,245
>> My [LAUGH.Its a little.

7
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:20,677
>> It is.

8
00:00:20,677 --> 00:00:22,111
>> It's really for my cat but.

9
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:24,791
>> It works, It does work.

10
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:26,385
Yeah.

11
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:27,149
>> [LAUGH].

12
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:30,130
>> I lost my real one, but this one works just fine.

13
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:35,550
All right, I think we'll go ahead and get started now,

14
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:40,880
so just to let, we're still grading the first exams.

15
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,593
I'll probably be another week before I get that done,

16
00:00:45,593 --> 00:00:50,220
so you can expect it hopefully next week at this time.

17
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,056
There long so we'll see, so this is excitingly the first

18
00:00:55,056 --> 00:00:59,711
of a series of guest lectures that we have in the class.

19
00:00:59,711 --> 00:01:06,010
Although you do have me on Thursday again, so don't get too excited but,

20
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:11,700
so I'm really excited to introduce Sharon Kardia who is a longtime

21
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,700
sort of friend, mentor colleague, former boss of mine.

22
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:20,574
She is trained in human genetics and statistics,

23
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:24,725
she is a leader in the field of genetic epidemiology,

24
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:29,261
specifically in cardiovascular disease hypertension.

25
00:01:29,261 --> 00:01:34,045
She does some epigenetic and she also has research into some of the ethical,

26
00:01:34,045 --> 00:01:36,540
legal and social issues of genetics.

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,222
And so today she's going to talk about eugenics, sort of some of

28
00:01:41,222 --> 00:01:45,991
the past history of eugenics and also its present application and

29
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:50,090
a study that she works on with with some faculty in LSNA.

30
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,783
She has been in the past the chair of the department and

31
00:01:53,783 --> 00:01:57,821
the senior associate dean of our school of public health.

32
00:01:57,821 --> 00:02:02,694
So we're very lucky to have her, I did post a couple of readings that

33
00:02:02,694 --> 00:02:07,241
are more related to the sort of the present pieces of eugenics.

34
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:12,229
And then Sharon asked me to post another reading which is optional which is

35
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:15,870
the part reading that covers some of the past pieces.

36
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,310
So I'm gonna turn it over to her but

37
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:23,117
are there any questions about class related stuff before I do that?

38
00:02:23,117 --> 00:02:27,140
>> Okay.

39
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:32,063
>> So this is an awfully early time of the day to talk about something as big as

40
00:02:32,063 --> 00:02:32,890
eugenics.

41
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:36,460
So I'll start easy and then we'll get weird and

42
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,640
then we'll come back the easy and then we'll go back to weird.

43
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,980
Sorry, there attendance sheet,

44
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,102
just go ahead and pass >> [LAUGH]

45
00:02:44,102 --> 00:02:46,230
>> Around Simon, thank you.

46
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:51,766
So maybe I'll start with a simple thing,

47
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:56,370
like how I even got into this area.

48
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,932
So like many of us,

49
00:02:57,932 --> 00:03:03,695
the sort of I'll call it dreams of what we're gonna do when we grow up,

50
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:08,800
starts in middle school, high school, elementary school.

51
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,946
So for me it was ninth grade biology and 13 and

52
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:20,070
we're doing this incredible series where we are dissecting little baby pigs,

53
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:24,748
we are looking at the molecular biology of the cell,

54
00:03:24,748 --> 00:03:28,040
which at that time period was new.

55
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,920
So, I mean the cellular mechanics,

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,436
this is back in the Jesus is back in the 70s anyway.

57
00:03:37,436 --> 00:03:38,681
>> [LAUGH].

58
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:45,340
>> And we had this practice of watching Jacob Baranowski films once a month.

59
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:51,511
And Jacob Baranowski was a scientist who was also somebody who was clearly wanting

60
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:57,350
to tell the world about the humanist values of science, why do we do science?

61
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:02,041
And there was one on genetics where he's standing in

62
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:07,051
Mendel's garden and he walks through, why would a monk

63
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:11,870
actually be interested in understanding genetics?

64
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,917
And very eloquently sort of walks through what was the mind

65
00:04:16,917 --> 00:04:21,861
of Mendel as he is moving through his first experiments,

66
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:27,629
his second experiments in understanding what is breeding true and

67
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:31,150
what is sort of mixed hybrids look like.

68
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,694
And then he takes us through all the ways in which it

69
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:42,380
influenced domestication of plants and animals.

70
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:47,265
Human beings are where they are today, because of our ability to,

71
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:51,104
even if we didn't understand the laws of genetics,

72
00:04:51,104 --> 00:04:55,902
we could figure out how to select the best from, a certain grain or

73
00:04:55,902 --> 00:05:00,615
a certain livestock and have it multiply because without food,

74
00:05:00,615 --> 00:05:05,801
without agriculture, you can't actually sustain civilizations.

75
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:06,825
You just can't and

76
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:10,604
there are great examples if you're a person who likes history, where

77
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:15,250
civilizations got too big, that could no longer feed themselves and they collapse.

78
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:19,248
And so he's walking through this and has a little 13 year old,

79
00:05:19,248 --> 00:05:22,600
I'm like, yeah, wow, genetics is everywhere.

80
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,782
And then he says, you as a scientist in the making,

81
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:31,746
have a responsibility to make sure that this great knowledge

82
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:35,740
does not go wrong and I'm like, yeah, what?

83
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:39,643
And he then takes us into the eugenics area, and

84
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:44,524
he ends the whole production by standing in Auschwitz where

85
00:05:44,524 --> 00:05:49,404
he's saying look this principle has to be tended you have to

86
00:05:49,404 --> 00:05:54,401
be aware because Auschwitz didn't start as a single thing.

87
00:05:54,401 --> 00:05:59,615
It started as an idea 40 years before that said we could use

88
00:05:59,615 --> 00:06:06,630
these same principles of selecting people as we might have a plant or an animal.

89
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:11,451
And certain people should not exist and other people should, and

90
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:16,380
they made it into a scientific discipline that lasted 40 years.

91
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:24,410
And the 40 years actually got its start in the U K and in America.

92
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:29,438
So I have the series of the animals of eugenics that are sitting

93
00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:33,910
on my shelf that are 1905, 1910, 1915.

94
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:39,305
It was human genetics in its day there wasn't human genetics

95
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:44,510
there was only eugenics that's what human genetics was.

96
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:49,053
And I have texts that show people that are using eugenic

97
00:06:49,053 --> 00:06:54,290
principles to figure out taxation models, policy what should

98
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:59,240
happen to women of childbearing age who are intelligent.

99
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:02,758
So they shouldn't allow be allowed to work after 23 If they're intelligent,

100
00:07:02,758 --> 00:07:04,240
they should be reproducing.

101
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,165
So laws got started so there's a way in which you and

102
00:07:08,165 --> 00:07:12,365
public health, more so than any other discipline have

103
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:17,140
a responsibility to keep your eyes open to what is happening.

104
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:22,070
Because most of the genetics that is being done,

105
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:27,601
both in medicine or in agriculture is looking at a small

106
00:07:27,601 --> 00:07:32,920
sort of scale public health looks and populations.

107
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:37,232
Your job is to tend to the health of populations that

108
00:07:37,232 --> 00:07:41,840
means its policies as well as its applications.

109
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,758
And this is one of these things where people look at,

110
00:07:45,758 --> 00:07:48,940
it says couldn't happen today.

111
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,888
Well, it happens today we've already made choices

112
00:07:53,888 --> 00:07:57,390
about who should, be okay to abort.

113
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:02,375
For instance, there's a lot of prenatal testing that happens right now because

114
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:06,697
we've made a judgment around what is an okay life to have or to serve and

115
00:08:06,697 --> 00:08:09,061
what is not an okay, but like heaven.

116
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:12,805
I'm not making any judgments It's just a sense

117
00:08:12,805 --> 00:08:17,600
of we are practicing things and eugenics snuck up on people.

118
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,763
It wasn't like some diabolical scientists went, ha ha,

119
00:08:20,763 --> 00:08:22,720
we're going to take over the race.

120
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,117
They just thought that this was the right thing to do, and the reason why I asked,

121
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:34,385
Jen to put up the paper that I did is that the Public health Service,

122
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:39,183
in United States started, at the turn of the last century and

123
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:42,601
really sort of, it's a uniform service.

124
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:47,561
It was designed to sort of bring the best of the science of public health into

125
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,831
the populations.

126
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:52,484
And when it started, it only had two offices,

127
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:57,640
one infectious diseases and immunization and one on eugenics.

128
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:04,543
So the Public health service of this country started with eugenics and

129
00:09:04,543 --> 00:09:10,627
the only reason that it came out of fashion was World War Two and

130
00:09:10,627 --> 00:09:14,270
the atrocities of that time period.

131
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,541
And what the scientific community did and

132
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:23,150
that includes public health is they dropped eugenics as their label and

133
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:27,770
hustled their way over to human genetics.

134
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:31,030
Did the science change all that radically?

135
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:36,288
Not really, It took a while to undo that and

136
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:42,590
is it still in the background collective mindset?

137
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:47,429
You only have to look to today's politics to see it

138
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:52,041
playing out things around race, ethnicity and

139
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:56,883
people's background genomes being contorted,

140
00:09:56,883 --> 00:10:00,130
contested, used against them.

141
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:04,564
You name it, what we know from genetics,

142
00:10:04,564 --> 00:10:13,200
if we were really using science is that we are 99.9% the same in our genomes.

143
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,865
That is astonishing now, we're only 99.1%,

144
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:22,727
the same with chimpanzee, [LAUGH] so

145
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:27,770
we're also quite tied to the animal kingdom.

146
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:33,155
But really there's there's a huge amount that we can learn

147
00:10:33,155 --> 00:10:39,040
just by watching human behavior with the power of genetics.

148
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,081
And I'll end if I have a little bit of time with just a slight exercise of

149
00:10:44,081 --> 00:10:50,040
what would it look like today if we use the power of the genetics that we have.

150
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:55,241
And so I'll pose some questions there, but I already sort of covered some of

151
00:10:55,241 --> 00:11:01,120
the parts of genetics that frames eugenics and this concept that genetics is not new.

152
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,002
We've been using genetic principles for

153
00:11:04,002 --> 00:11:08,785
10,000 years since the basically the advent of agriculture.

154
00:11:08,785 --> 00:11:13,319
So people have a sense of it, even if they don't know it, so

155
00:11:13,319 --> 00:11:18,312
don't think that like genetic literacy is necessary in order for

156
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:21,880
populations to really get genetic concepts.

157
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,332
We have an understanding of them that goes way back and

158
00:11:25,332 --> 00:11:29,245
this whole piece of selective breeding that I talked about,

159
00:11:29,245 --> 00:11:33,481
a domestication that's been happening for thousands of years.

160
00:11:33,481 --> 00:11:38,982
And this actually is one of the main call it philosophical

161
00:11:38,982 --> 00:11:43,453
underpinnings for things like genetics, but

162
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:48,650
we should select the best, the issue is what is best?

163
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:54,711
How do you select and what if we have another value system?

164
00:11:54,711 --> 00:11:59,081
This is really about feeding and taking care of human populations,

165
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:02,780
what about a different set of values for human genetics?

166
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:07,596
Ones that actually have to do with honoring the differences and the diversity

167
00:12:07,596 --> 00:12:12,340
of people on the planet because it's like diversity of plant species.

168
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,717
If we were a monoculture, we will be in trouble both from what we eat or

169
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:20,740
for what we do and who we are.

170
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:24,163
This sort of concept of domestication and

171
00:12:24,163 --> 00:12:29,345
selective breeding that we sort of see in the livestock was what

172
00:12:29,345 --> 00:12:34,540
was really coming into play in the beginning of eugenics.

173
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:40,006
So Francis Galton was the individual who coined this term eugenics and

174
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:43,730
really put it out as a whole scientific method.

175
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,236
It was a method of improving intellectual, economic and

176
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:50,668
social levels of human beings by allowing differential

177
00:12:50,668 --> 00:12:54,780
reproduction of superior people and sterilization of the unfit.

178
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:59,196
That was the public health program and

179
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:04,164
there's all sorts of issues with this, so

180
00:13:04,164 --> 00:13:09,560
what might be one scientific issue with this?

181
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:16,411
So not philosophical Well, what are, yeah, go ahead.

182
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:22,408
>> [INAUDIBLE].

183
00:13:22,408 --> 00:13:29,012
>> That's right there is no actual scientific genetic basis for

184
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:33,980
intelligence, economic and social levels.

185
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,340
Those are culturally inherited they're not genetically inherited.

186
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:43,235
So it's a big, disconnect between what was

187
00:13:43,235 --> 00:13:48,810
the goal of this and the science underneath of it.

188
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,951
And I'll be the first one to tell you that we're living in an incredible

189
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:56,264
time period where the human genome has been sequenced and

190
00:13:56,264 --> 00:13:59,940
were able to measure millions of mutations on people.

191
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,353
And we're doing associations with hundreds of thousands

192
00:14:04,353 --> 00:14:07,061
of subjects from across the world.

193
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:14,090
And there's a lot more hype around the genetics than there is actual there there.

194
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:20,261
And okay, so I think another thing that I want to sort of point

195
00:14:20,261 --> 00:14:27,532
out in this transition from the 1800's to 1900's, is that.

196
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:31,370
This is where this whole concept of genetic determinism,

197
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:34,680
it sort of is given legs and starts to walk around.

198
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:38,175
So genetic determinism is this concept that something is

199
00:14:38,175 --> 00:14:41,980
genetically determined and it stays that way, it's fixed.

200
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:46,069
And you can see that people are mostly taking, I think,

201
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:50,768
their experience with physical traits and sort of saying,

202
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:54,438
well look, it's breeding like Mendel's peas.

203
00:14:54,438 --> 00:14:59,689
Now, it's actually much more complicated than that It's not one gene,

204
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:00,920
it's many genes.

205
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,108
And very little of what is in the called

206
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:13,750
human phenotype is actually genetically determined.

207
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:18,793
This is also a time period where eugenics is organizing into committees and

208
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:19,690
societies.

209
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:24,365
So any time that a body of sort of scientific prowess

210
00:15:24,365 --> 00:15:29,041
starts to organize its committees and societies,

211
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:33,090
it's gathering its power to move forward.

212
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,171
And it's not necessarily a bad thing.

213
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:39,097
We've got committees right now that are focused on identifying what

214
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:42,355
are the best preventative services people should have?

215
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:47,230
A colonoscopy, a mastectomy, whatever and on what time periods?

216
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:52,649
But the I'll call it the symptoms of what sort of goes

217
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:57,840
wrong at the public health and population level.

218
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:03,152
It has to do with whether or not things are being organized around certain,

219
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:05,358
I'll call a key initiatives.

220
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:10,610
In the end of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s when recombinant DNA

221
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:17,010
became a thing, people started to organize around using recombinant DNA technology.

222
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,361
And what were they organizing around?

223
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:23,641
They were organizing around at both the scientific use and the public use.

224
00:16:23,641 --> 00:16:27,330
That's how we got genetically modified foods.

225
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:32,134
Right, so we've got similar things that are happening now around

226
00:16:32,134 --> 00:16:34,130
some other technologies.

227
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:39,620
One of them is the CRISPR CAS 9 which is a gene editing technology.

228
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:45,060
So the piece that I think was amazing to me when

229
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:53,100
I started to look into this was just how much propaganda there was.

230
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,637
So it's where you see the CDC signs around wash your hands,

231
00:16:57,637 --> 00:17:00,200
cover your nose when you sneeze.

232
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:05,021
Eugenics was a campaign and they had things like this is l eugenics,

233
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:08,090
is the self direction of human evolution.

234
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,868
You can do it.

235
00:17:09,868 --> 00:17:15,245
Or they were putting together what does it come from?

236
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:19,606
The roots of the human tree or the anatomy of the biology, the anthropology,

237
00:17:19,606 --> 00:17:24,922
that we're using statistics, biography, genealogy, sociology, medicine, surgery.

238
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:28,655
All of this is this great science coming up and

239
00:17:28,655 --> 00:17:33,285
allowing us now to really self direct human evolution.

240
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:38,334
Okay.

241
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:41,340
People spin stuff all the time.

242
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:46,920
Do not be sheep.

243
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:51,760
Most of us are mostly worried about our own economic social standing.

244
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,211
Can I pay the mortgage, can I pay the rent?

245
00:17:54,211 --> 00:17:56,300
Can I have a car?

246
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,900
Somebody else will figure this out.

247
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,327
Well, you guys actually have to be the other people.

248
00:18:02,327 --> 00:18:07,436
That either in a moment when things look like they're going in a weird way,

249
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:09,240
say, can we take a pause?

250
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,749
I'm not sure I feel good about this, you guys will all be in positions of power and

251
00:18:14,749 --> 00:18:19,448
authority when you sort of move from this moment into your sort of more

252
00:18:19,448 --> 00:18:22,551
professional lives, I could guarantee it.

253
00:18:22,551 --> 00:18:28,260
There's not a Michigan grad that I don't see in some position of authority.

254
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:34,960
So you are the people that have to carry this awareness.

255
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,273
So it just was such a, like a tree eugenics draws its materials from

256
00:18:41,273 --> 00:18:48,760
many sources and organizes them into a harmonious entity.

257
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,851
You could just see where people like you, maybe 100 years ago.

258
00:18:51,851 --> 00:18:55,271
I'd be yeah, doing this.

259
00:18:55,271 --> 00:18:57,629
What was it really trying to do?

260
00:18:57,629 --> 00:19:01,733
It was better breeding, it was separating fit and unfit,

261
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:06,943
It was classifying and controlling and it was improving the human stock.

262
00:19:06,943 --> 00:19:11,823
It was just one step over from the livestock approach.

263
00:19:11,823 --> 00:19:13,276
When I talked about,

264
00:19:13,276 --> 00:19:17,396
there was the Eugenics Office in the Public Health Service,

265
00:19:17,396 --> 00:19:22,915
Charles Davenport was the board of Directors, the American Eugenics Society.

266
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:29,990
Then started in 1929, but this was also one of his babies as the Secretary and

267
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:34,660
Resident Director of Eugenics Office in 1910.

268
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:38,370
Where there's clearly the functions.

269
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:42,733
It's just like the essential functions of public health he's listing here to serve

270
00:19:42,733 --> 00:19:46,851
eugenical interest in the capacity of repository and clearing house to build up

271
00:19:46,851 --> 00:19:50,190
an analytical index of the inborn traits of American families.

272
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:53,575
To train field workers to gather data of eugenical import,

273
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:58,316
to maintain a field force actually engaged in gathering such data to cooperate with

274
00:19:58,316 --> 00:20:02,200
other institutions and with the persons concerned with eugenics.

275
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,193
To investigate the manner of the inheritance of specific human traits,

276
00:20:06,193 --> 00:20:11,168
to investigate other eugenic factors such as mate selection, differential fecundity,

277
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:15,380
which is fertility, differential survival and differential migration.

278
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:22,887
And to advise the concern ecumenical fitness of proposed marriage.

279
00:20:22,887 --> 00:20:31,060
That one just gives me the creeps [LAUGH] So, and to publish results.

280
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:36,435
So, [LAUGH] why I am trying to creep you out is that there will

281
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:44,468
be things like this and we will just pass right by them will be, yeah, that's okay.

282
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:49,889
Proposed marriage is another the molecular

283
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:55,170
parallel to this is the prenatal testing.

284
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,680
That is done to then select children or not.

285
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:04,650
And I used to be more neutral in some ways about prenatal testing is gonna okay.

286
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:09,457
But then I had an interaction with a graduate student of

287
00:21:09,457 --> 00:21:14,367
mine who had just gotten pregnant and she came up to me and

288
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,338
said, are there ways to tell the hair color,

289
00:21:18,338 --> 00:21:22,760
eye color, intelligence and weight of my child?

290
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:27,590
And I just got the- >> [LAUGH]

291
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,182
>> You're not that student.

292
00:21:28,182 --> 00:21:29,384
>> You are not that student.

293
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:32,254
And she said my husband wants to know.

294
00:21:32,254 --> 00:21:34,860
And I was so creeped out.

295
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:42,410
I was why would you want to know that when you are a month pregnant?

296
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,510
It just sounds really bad.

297
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:53,010
And again, I mean we have all these biases because of our cultural norms.

298
00:21:53,010 --> 00:22:03,010
I mean how many of us would want a short fat dumb ugly kid?

299
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:08,595
[LAUGH] And there's no parent in the world who has a child, even if they

300
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:14,010
have all of those characteristics that doesn't love that child.

301
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:19,241
We're in a an intellectual mindset when we do this.

302
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:23,977
We're not in a heart centered human mindset when we make those kind

303
00:22:23,977 --> 00:22:25,337
of judgment call.

304
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:30,857
And I've spoken for a long time at different venues about how if we could

305
00:22:30,857 --> 00:22:37,300
actually tolerate differences, we could use some of this technology quite well.

306
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,821
But we can't tolerate differences.

307
00:22:38,821 --> 00:22:42,240
We can hardly tolerate our brothers and sisters.

308
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,950
[LAUGH] I'll never, I don't tell you that story.

309
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:51,859
>> [LAUGH] >> Anyway, they had this propaganda

310
00:22:51,859 --> 00:22:55,731
out in state farms, state farm,

311
00:22:55,731 --> 00:23:00,311
state fairs that were in the farmland.

312
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:04,259
So here was a light that went off every 16 seconds and

313
00:23:04,259 --> 00:23:09,020
it said every 16 seconds a person is born in the United States.

314
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,300
This is the fitter families contest of the Eastern States.

315
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,632
This light flashes every 7.5 minutes,

316
00:23:16,632 --> 00:23:24,072
cuz every 7.5 minutes high grade person is born.

317
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:28,255
Well, they are basically, this is like the 1%.

318
00:23:28,255 --> 00:23:32,480
So in the United States, which will have the ability to do creative work and

319
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,839
be fit for leadership.

320
00:23:33,839 --> 00:23:38,209
About 4% of all Americans come from within this class.

321
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:42,760
And then they had contests like the best horse or cow.

322
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,470
What was the best family?

323
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:51,200
Now, you'll notice the configuration of this best family.

324
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,040
[LAUGH] They all look like dad even though,

325
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,790
[LAUGH] They are different ages.

326
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:06,218
So they all look like businessmen, clearly all white.

327
00:24:06,218 --> 00:24:10,556
I don't even know, I mean, this time period, this could also be another male.

328
00:24:10,556 --> 00:24:14,940
Because men wore dresses and frogs up until a certain age.

329
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,820
So it could be this woman is great because she has given rise to all of these men.

330
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:26,337
So it's just a weird social construct that they're placing on top of this.

331
00:24:26,337 --> 00:24:28,451
And this is another one.

332
00:24:28,451 --> 00:24:36,260
So this was judged to be the most perfect baby in the Panama Canal.

333
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,061
What is going on here?

334
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:41,360
[LAUGH] I mean?

335
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,373
[LAUGH] So I mean we are just naturally predisposed to place

336
00:24:46,373 --> 00:24:52,020
our biases on top of things, even if it doesn't make any sense.

337
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,046
And people spent time, so human geneticists used to go looking for

338
00:24:57,046 --> 00:25:01,174
families and understanding both the families of the,

339
00:25:01,174 --> 00:25:04,880
they call them the American family of geniuses.

340
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,127
So what is this?

341
00:25:06,127 --> 00:25:09,430
This is mechanical skill and artistic temperament.

342
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:12,760
And they're mapping these all along this family.

343
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:17,524
So artists, mechanical boat

344
00:25:17,524 --> 00:25:21,920
designer, really crazy.

345
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:30,050
Well this whole thing after a while leads up to national and state-based laws.

346
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:34,919
So really only takes about 20 years before we have the Immigration Act,

347
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:40,440
which restricted immigration from the Southern and Eastern European countries.

348
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,151
we had marriage laws so that enacted who could marry who.

349
00:25:46,151 --> 00:25:50,500
And certainly it prohibited marriages by social misfits.

350
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,450
They're using these terms.

351
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:56,050
It also created sterilization laws.

352
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:58,327
There was a Supreme Court case,

353
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:05,520
Buck vs Bella talk a little bit in which it made sterilization compulsory.

354
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,450
Not just like you could.

355
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:14,372
It was actually compulsory for the genetically unfit.

356
00:26:14,372 --> 00:26:24,172
Who's genetically unfit at this time period?

357
00:26:24,172 --> 00:26:24,751
[LAUGH] Take your best.

358
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:31,260
Yes, use all of the stereotypes of who and the United States would be socially unfit.

359
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,569
These would be people without education, these would be individuals

360
00:26:35,569 --> 00:26:40,537
who are sexually promiscuous, these would be individuals who are immigrants,

361
00:26:40,537 --> 00:26:44,351
who can't navigate the system or who are bucking the system.

362
00:26:44,351 --> 00:26:49,480
And we'll go through, there is a lot of geographics to this.

363
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,039
So in the Appalachians where there are these communities that

364
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:58,159
are not really invested in moving up the social ladder,

365
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,960
they're more invested in their communities.

366
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,648
These individuals were at risk if the public health

367
00:27:06,648 --> 00:27:10,480
service came in, and it was it was a mess.

368
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,326
As we have CDC reports today, there were

369
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:20,892
reports that came out from the Washington DC.

370
00:27:20,892 --> 00:27:27,354
The Government Printing Office in 1911 on things like the Immigration Commission

371
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:36,150
showing a relationship between immigration and insanity.

372
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:42,460
I have some of these, and you're happy to come and look at them at any time.

373
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:47,337
This Immigration Act of 1924 which was designed to help the immigration

374
00:27:47,337 --> 00:27:48,800
of Italians and Jews.

375
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,843
It's scaled that number of immigrants from each country and

376
00:27:52,843 --> 00:27:56,270
the proportion indicated in the 1890 census.

377
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,999
So they're using some demographic principles here to make decisions on what

378
00:28:00,999 --> 00:28:02,760
should happen in that law.

379
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,790
And it's set quotas on the number of people from each of these areas.

380
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:12,860
Basically ending the greatest era of immigration in the US history.

381
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:16,644
It was based also on a hierarchy of who and

382
00:28:16,644 --> 00:28:21,430
this was another piece of that sort of propaganda,

383
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:25,910
who was okay to come from Europe and who was not?

384
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:29,360
So the German British Scandinavian French and

385
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,260
even the polish Austrian, I'm not exactly sure.

386
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:39,281
I mean, that's a very small subset [LAUGH] And then they have near Eastern and

387
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:44,010
then they've got the Irish Spanish and Italian down here.

388
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:48,230
So how did this then manifest socially?

389
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:54,012
Most of the jokes are from that time period are around the,

390
00:28:54,012 --> 00:28:57,793
the Irish, Spanish and the Italian.

391
00:28:57,793 --> 00:29:02,148
But this is just crazy.

392
00:29:02,148 --> 00:29:05,380
They are ranking native whites by foreign parentage.

393
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:11,021
So you can see with what is happening today,

394
00:29:11,021 --> 00:29:16,358
it's just a different framing of the same

395
00:29:16,358 --> 00:29:21,555
human compulsion to rank order people.

396
00:29:21,555 --> 00:29:25,763
The other thing is that these marriage laws,

397
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:31,078
it was illegal to mayor to have interracial marriages and

398
00:29:31,078 --> 00:29:38,360
people got outed in the newspaper, if man believed white weds negro woman.

399
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,916
So this is in 1921, I have an entire book that human genetics,

400
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:51,371
it's a huge genesis made on interracial marriages in Virginia.

401
00:29:51,371 --> 00:29:55,062
It was a public health kind of mindset of,

402
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:59,870
we are gonna understand who has this disease.

403
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:04,885
And they're mapping it in the weirdest of

404
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:13,494
ways as if they are discovering an outbreak of interracial marriages.

405
00:30:13,494 --> 00:30:16,250
This is what a sterilization form looked like.

406
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:20,739
So this was a state sanctioned, so state departments of health,

407
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:22,380
were in charge of this.

408
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,141
And it was pretty simple.

409
00:30:24,141 --> 00:30:29,526
It was, here's the order for sexual sterilization sort of like who,

410
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:34,638
so upon the petition of blank, the superintendent of whatever was

411
00:30:34,638 --> 00:30:40,207
that state upon consideration of the evidence introduced at the hearing

412
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:45,134
of this matter, the board finds that the said inmate is insane,

413
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:51,270
idiotic, imbecile, people minded or epileptic.

414
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:55,202
So these are not real things for the most part.

415
00:30:55,202 --> 00:30:58,679
The epileptic is, but

416
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,354
these are all character judgments.

417
00:31:04,354 --> 00:31:09,893
And by the laws of heredity is the probable potential parents

418
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:15,107
of socially inadequate offspring likewise afflicted,

419
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:19,870
not a very big form or investigation.

420
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:24,684
And any idea how many people were

421
00:31:24,684 --> 00:31:29,680
sterilized in this time period?

422
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,863
>> No. >> Why do you?

423
00:31:30,863 --> 00:31:38,886
Take a guess.

424
00:31:38,886 --> 00:31:44,603
So there's probably a 100,000 or more, then some estates more than others.

425
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:48,606
And I'll show you some of the work in California that we've done to even

426
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:49,870
identify who.

427
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:54,195
But that's a nuts program.

428
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:58,182
This is the family stock of a woman sterilized in the state of Maine.

429
00:31:58,182 --> 00:32:01,870
And the reason was hereditary feeble mindedness.

430
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:06,546
So here they're mapping just like the mechanic, the artistic, the boat,

431
00:32:06,546 --> 00:32:12,170
insane moral, feebleminded, alcoholic, neurotic and a sex pervert.

432
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:17,170
And [LAUGH], it's okay.

433
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:20,521
This is what most of us do when we look at this.

434
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:25,154
And I put it up here because we've done a lot

435
00:32:25,154 --> 00:32:29,403
better in terms of the biomarkers and,

436
00:32:29,403 --> 00:32:35,197
call it the measurement, of some of the phenotypes,

437
00:32:35,197 --> 00:32:40,992
but it doesn't mean that we have a correctly inferred

438
00:32:40,992 --> 00:32:46,060
the quality of life for certain individuals.

439
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:51,164
So at one point in time, I was working with a woman from

440
00:32:51,164 --> 00:32:56,043
the American Deafness Association that was trying

441
00:32:56,043 --> 00:33:00,809
to stop the abortion of deaf children because they

442
00:33:00,809 --> 00:33:05,701
don't see that as a disease, it's a difference.

443
00:33:05,701 --> 00:33:13,070
And they actually kind of value their family units.

444
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:15,967
But the American Pediatric Association and

445
00:33:15,967 --> 00:33:21,170
other medical bodies were like, wait a second, no, it's a defect.

446
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,970
So we should get rid of this.

447
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:26,697
So there should be no more deaf people?

448
00:33:26,697 --> 00:33:31,270
Who makes that decision?

449
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:35,350
Actually, our institutions push people.

450
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:40,979
And we push them in ways that don't necessarily allow for

451
00:33:40,979 --> 00:33:46,971
this difference in human characteristics and capacities.

452
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:51,400
There's been a longstanding conversation around

453
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,035
Down syndrome because of the way in which individuals

454
00:33:56,035 --> 00:34:01,170
with Down syndrome clearly have more medical issues.

455
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:07,282
But they also provide a view into what the human spirit does.

456
00:34:07,282 --> 00:34:11,683
Anybody who has ever worked with the Special Olympics or

457
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:16,456
with children with disabilities it strips away some of the,

458
00:34:16,456 --> 00:34:22,447
I'll call it the veil of self importance and makes a clear prioritization of

459
00:34:22,447 --> 00:34:28,670
what does it mean to be a human on the planet that is enjoying being here.

460
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:33,453
So we already are doing it.

461
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:37,400
Buck vs Bell was what started the sterilization.

462
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:41,364
Carrie Buck was a 17 year old from Charlottesville, Virginia.

463
00:34:41,364 --> 00:34:44,710
And she was picked to be the first person to be sterilized.

464
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,590
Carrie had a child that was not married.

465
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:55,870
So this was considered to be one of the things that was wrong with her.

466
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:59,377
And so that's why they had to sterilize people.

467
00:34:59,377 --> 00:35:03,770
They could have children out of marriage.

468
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:08,446
Okay, her mother was already a resident at an asylum,

469
00:35:08,446 --> 00:35:13,745
which probably means her mother probably had Carrie before.

470
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:19,166
And there were lots of reasons that people went to asylums.

471
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:23,070
A lot of the time it was because they couldn't cope.

472
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:26,570
There was the social anxiety of that day.

473
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:30,636
And this is not an easy time period.

474
00:35:30,636 --> 00:35:33,470
The modern conveniences are not there.

475
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:37,659
People are suffering from a lot of infectious diseases.

476
00:35:37,659 --> 00:35:39,600
And they don't have medical care.

477
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:45,073
And it's driving many of them into, I'll call it behaviors that were,

478
00:35:45,073 --> 00:35:48,841
I'll call it adaptive in their communities, but

479
00:35:48,841 --> 00:35:53,470
not necessarily from an institutional point of view.

480
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:57,297
So you can see your mother shared the hereditary traits of people mindedness and

481
00:35:57,297 --> 00:35:59,270
sexual promiscuity.

482
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:03,320
So not following the monogamous trends.

483
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:07,669
Those who believe that such traits were genetically transmitted,

484
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:12,477
Carrie fit the laws description of a probable potential parent of socially

485
00:36:12,477 --> 00:36:14,670
inadequate offspring.

486
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:19,370
And so legal challenge was then put forth on Carrie's behalf.

487
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,270
It did not work.

488
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:25,220
So they had a lot of different witnesses that came to the Supreme Court.

489
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,370
This is Supreme Court case.

490
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:33,226
This is not a local, this is the Supreme Court case where people are testifying

491
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:38,170
around immorality, prostitution, untruthfulness and syphilis.

492
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:43,104
So that period of time people are considering syphilis to be one

493
00:36:43,104 --> 00:36:48,145
of the things or one of the reasons why she should be sterilized.

494
00:36:48,145 --> 00:36:51,612
These people belong to the shiftless, ignorant and

495
00:36:51,612 --> 00:36:56,870
worthless class of antisocial whites of the South.

496
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,540
They're not pulling any punches here.

497
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:04,218
This is Fox News [LAUGH].

498
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:08,836
Or was it MSNBC, or

499
00:37:08,836 --> 00:37:12,307
any of these?

500
00:37:12,307 --> 00:37:16,191
So then they brought in Arthur Esterbrook from the Eugenics Record Office.

501
00:37:16,191 --> 00:37:18,597
This is the public health service.

502
00:37:18,597 --> 00:37:21,370
And he testifies against Carrie.

503
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,873
He and a Red Cross nurse are examining Carrie's baby, and

504
00:37:24,873 --> 00:37:30,670
concluded that she is already below average and not quite normal.

505
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:37,347
So relying on these comments, the judge concluded that Carrie should be

506
00:37:37,347 --> 00:37:43,155
sterilized to prevent the birth of other defective children.

507
00:37:43,155 --> 00:37:46,264
It's Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes,

508
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:51,254
his words and his opinions about the facts of Carrie's case and

509
00:37:51,254 --> 00:37:56,650
her deficient mother that historians pull out over and over again.

510
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:01,489
Because it's this kind of approach where people in power within

511
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:05,432
institutions make judgments like, it is better for

512
00:38:05,432 --> 00:38:10,991
all of the world of instead of waiting to execute degenerate offspring for

513
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:15,652
crime or to let them starve for their imbecility, society can

514
00:38:15,652 --> 00:38:21,370
prevent those who are manifestly unfit from continuing their kind.

515
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:26,270
Three generations of imbeciles are enough.

516
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:31,540
So when you wonder how do we get to the eugenics

517
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:37,169
that led to World War II, it's this.

518
00:38:37,169 --> 00:38:42,928
And if you do any of the study of World War II, the historic ends actually think

519
00:38:42,928 --> 00:38:48,528
that if it wasn't in Germany, there was more of this sentiment in France.

520
00:38:48,528 --> 00:38:52,520
France could have been the locus of the World War II.

521
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:57,251
It was really just through an accident that Hitler was the one

522
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,710
who found the opening and moved forward.

523
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:08,144
This was something that was permeating the European as well as the US.

524
00:39:08,144 --> 00:39:13,270
So this doesn't just happen in isolation.

525
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:17,550
All right, so now I'm gonna take a time check.

526
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,846
>> Where are we at?

527
00:39:18,846 --> 00:39:21,767
>> 9, 10, we have 40 minutes.

528
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:22,584
>> 1 minute.

529
00:39:22,584 --> 00:39:24,492
>> 40 minutes.

530
00:39:24,492 --> 00:39:26,797
>> Okay, the lab or?

531
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:27,904
>> No, no, it's perfect.

532
00:39:27,904 --> 00:39:31,331
I'm just gauging how many stories I can tell.

533
00:39:31,331 --> 00:39:37,226
And so last year, Alex Andrew Stern talked

534
00:39:37,226 --> 00:39:42,150
about work that she's been doing.

535
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:45,823
Both Shaven Harlow and I have been working with her,

536
00:39:45,823 --> 00:39:51,502
trying to help her basically use the history expertise with epidemiological and

537
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:55,430
human genetics expertise to better understand eugenic

538
00:39:55,430 --> 00:40:00,050
sterilization in California from a demographics point of view.

539
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:04,888
And she took it into sort of digital storytelling in order to

540
00:40:04,888 --> 00:40:06,450
make it more real.

541
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:12,990
In 2007, Alexander discovered that the California Department

542
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:18,850
of Mental Health actually had in a file cabinet microfiche and

543
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:22,585
copies of the sterilization records.

544
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:29,470
And it's just been sitting there, nobody really knew about it.

545
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,471
She got a tip from somebody who had heard her talk in

546
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:37,770
a public health department that it was just like, yeah, we have those.

547
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:43,726
So she was like, my gosh, what we need to in order to look at this?

548
00:40:43,726 --> 00:40:46,725
And she wrote a grant, and

549
00:40:46,725 --> 00:40:51,502
did a little investigation of this area.

550
00:40:51,502 --> 00:40:54,647
And set out basically to look at the patterns and

551
00:40:54,647 --> 00:40:58,870
experiences of institutionalized sterilization.

552
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,986
That's when she called Shaven Harlow and I and said,

553
00:41:02,986 --> 00:41:08,870
we've got this public health resource, how do we capitalize on this?

554
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:16,200
So we said, well, there's a long history of the relationship between eugenics and

555
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:21,481
population control that is able to sort of be pulled in here.

556
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:26,941
And you can sort of see here people are aggregating as a part

557
00:41:26,941 --> 00:41:31,860
of these eugenic sort of fairs and things like that.

558
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:36,900
And we could take an approach of just looking at California or we could look at

559
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,881
other states in the US and see whether or not there are other repositories.

560
00:41:41,881 --> 00:41:50,377
It turns out that California haven't been sort of identified and categorized.

561
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:52,480
And we'll show you some of the results soon.

562
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,429
But North Carolina, they had found those, and

563
00:41:56,429 --> 00:41:59,893
they were putting those into databases.

564
00:41:59,893 --> 00:42:03,570
That's interesting.

565
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:07,220
>> There are others in the Virginia.

566
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:10,053
And see, there was one other one,

567
00:42:10,053 --> 00:42:15,723
I think it might have been in South Carolina where people went back and

568
00:42:15,723 --> 00:42:21,817
they actually did reparations to these family's brothers and sisters.

569
00:42:21,817 --> 00:42:24,637
Or even some of the people that were aware.

570
00:42:24,637 --> 00:42:30,309
If you look at this as a public health program, this is a pretty typical

571
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:36,200
public health program where 80% of the states have got the same laws.

572
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:41,830
This is by 1935, the ones that are dark are the ones with bills pending.

573
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:46,770
So these were written in the midst of passing these laws for sterilization.

574
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,344
And it's like any public health program,

575
00:42:49,344 --> 00:42:55,070
it starts with a few that it sort of spreads, and then it just keeps going.

576
00:42:55,070 --> 00:43:01,942
So when people actually looked at the data on who had been sterilized,

577
00:43:01,942 --> 00:43:06,146
California, by and large, has the most.

578
00:43:06,146 --> 00:43:10,401
And Virginia, North Carolina, Michigan for

579
00:43:10,401 --> 00:43:15,070
reasons I have no idea it's fourth.

580
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:18,769
No idea what was going on in Michigan.

581
00:43:18,769 --> 00:43:20,862
So we went and got this data set.

582
00:43:20,862 --> 00:43:24,290
And we put it into REDCap.

583
00:43:24,290 --> 00:43:29,734
So basically, this is what the patient records looked like.

584
00:43:29,734 --> 00:43:35,071
And it's nothing more than what you would find on any sort

585
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:40,421
of population health in the state department of health.

586
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:44,020
It's personal history, family history, clinical legal provisions.

587
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:47,309
And really all it's representing is,

588
00:43:47,309 --> 00:43:52,202
what do you need to know in order to do something to people?

589
00:43:52,202 --> 00:43:56,341
So I love this one legally signed and prepared.

590
00:43:56,341 --> 00:43:58,580
And are they filed at the institution?

591
00:43:58,580 --> 00:44:00,614
So it's like, are we keeping track of this?

592
00:44:00,614 --> 00:44:04,843
Was in one of the boxes.

593
00:44:04,843 --> 00:44:08,670
Anyway, it was not a hard thing.

594
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:12,589
All we had to do was to take that information and

595
00:44:12,589 --> 00:44:17,818
categorized basically what the sterilization form sort of,

596
00:44:17,818 --> 00:44:23,246
where it was, what real number, what document, what county,

597
00:44:23,246 --> 00:44:28,574
was it a narcotics hospital, was it some other institution and

598
00:44:28,574 --> 00:44:31,817
the year approved by the department.

599
00:44:31,817 --> 00:44:36,153
Then did a demographic analysis, some institutional analysis.

600
00:44:36,153 --> 00:44:39,748
Looked at some life tables to figure out whether or

601
00:44:39,748 --> 00:44:46,070
not any of the individuals that have been sterilized were still alive.

602
00:44:46,070 --> 00:44:48,241
So that's a demographic analysis.

603
00:44:48,241 --> 00:44:50,581
That's a pretty cool analysis.

604
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:52,528
So you have to look at the life tables and

605
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:56,304
actually calculate what is the probability based on the sample of whether or

606
00:44:56,304 --> 00:45:01,883
not they're still alive, based on their, Their birth year and

607
00:45:01,883 --> 00:45:08,194
then we looked at some other things like bias in the last name.

608
00:45:08,194 --> 00:45:14,223
So here are the institutions and the sterilizations.

609
00:45:14,223 --> 00:45:17,106
So there were a couple like Sonoma and

610
00:45:17,106 --> 00:45:22,885
Patton that we're much more aggressive and then here is the time trends.

611
00:45:22,885 --> 00:45:25,801
So in the 20s and then it kind of flattens out and

612
00:45:25,801 --> 00:45:29,870
there's a few more that you can see actually, this is World War II.

613
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:34,520
This is 1935 through 1944,

614
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:39,320
and then it drops off when the eugenics

615
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,970
kind of era starts to be questioned.

616
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:48,624
The number one diagnosis is Feebleminded,

617
00:45:48,624 --> 00:45:53,916
then Dementia, Psychosis, Manic Depression.

618
00:45:53,916 --> 00:46:01,685
Anybody ever worked with people that are not educated?

619
00:46:01,685 --> 00:46:05,066
So it can appear people minded.

620
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:09,796
It can appear like you can't communicate.

621
00:46:09,796 --> 00:46:16,223
It really actually, these are probably not real diagnoses.

622
00:46:16,223 --> 00:46:21,083
These are probably differences in class and

623
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:27,000
education, immigration, language differences.

624
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,386
Okay, so pacific colony in and of itself was of

625
00:46:31,386 --> 00:46:36,109
interest to Alexandra because of its location and

626
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:40,381
the way in which it became a kind of a hotbed for

627
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:45,892
sterilization requests and in particular Mexican origin

628
00:46:45,892 --> 00:46:52,190
records indicate more of predominant Mexican American biases and

629
00:46:52,190 --> 00:46:56,700
the percentage of people that are sterilized.

630
00:46:56,700 --> 00:47:01,866
So this is not, if you look at 25,, all the way through.

631
00:47:01,866 --> 00:47:07,272
This is not the fraction of the population

632
00:47:07,272 --> 00:47:11,136
that they are in this colony.

633
00:47:11,136 --> 00:47:16,058
So this is a clear sort of ethnic bias that is sort of playing out

634
00:47:16,058 --> 00:47:19,570
through the hands of the superintendents.

635
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:24,542
And so we we wrote a paper in the American Journal

636
00:47:24,542 --> 00:47:28,894
of Public Health and basically asking for

637
00:47:28,894 --> 00:47:33,371
Carol California to redress the issues and

638
00:47:33,371 --> 00:47:40,731
the individual sort of sterilization survivors and their families.

639
00:47:40,731 --> 00:47:45,771
The wild thing is that, so Alex is very good at using the history and

640
00:47:45,771 --> 00:47:51,351
the science and so she actually was working with the state legislature and

641
00:47:51,351 --> 00:47:57,386
a bill got put before the Legislature and it didn't get voted on this past year.

642
00:47:57,386 --> 00:48:02,512
So she is going back and trying to use this to see

643
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:10,273
if she can get some families to be compensated or at least recognized.

644
00:48:10,273 --> 00:48:13,669
Just in case you ever want to do something like this,

645
00:48:13,669 --> 00:48:18,236
the way in which we did it was use the life tables from this time period.

646
00:48:18,236 --> 00:48:22,075
These life tables provide basically an estimation

647
00:48:22,075 --> 00:48:26,181
of the probability that somebody who is, let's say,

648
00:48:26,181 --> 00:48:31,374
20 survives to 21, 21 survives to 22, 22 survives 23.

649
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:34,542
And you can actually use that probabilistic distribution.

650
00:48:34,542 --> 00:48:39,803
And it's it's a very cool technique to be able to figure out whether or

651
00:48:39,803 --> 00:48:45,885
not a birth cohort, whether or not individuals about likelihood of surviving.

652
00:48:45,885 --> 00:48:51,943
And they then where they could went to the state life tables for

653
00:48:51,943 --> 00:48:55,323
California whether they could and

654
00:48:55,323 --> 00:49:00,697
then basically just kept sort of deep deeply going in.

655
00:49:00,697 --> 00:49:07,733
Just wanna go through the swears the number.

656
00:49:07,733 --> 00:49:11,974
Okay so you had 19,498

657
00:49:11,974 --> 00:49:16,750
between the ages of 7 and 70.

658
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:21,772
Seems kind of weird that you would do somebody 70 years old,

659
00:49:21,772 --> 00:49:27,190
estimated 831 alive today and their average age would be 87.

660
00:49:27,190 --> 00:49:29,460
These people are bad.

661
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:33,013
Okay so the states by and

662
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:37,988
large are not all that interested

663
00:49:37,988 --> 00:49:42,794
in this, as you would imagine.

664
00:49:42,794 --> 00:49:47,591
It's bad press doesn't look good for the Department of Health.

665
00:49:47,591 --> 00:49:52,521
And most of them actually when they did some kind of legal sort of

666
00:49:52,521 --> 00:49:58,199
reparation it started with we'll say something nice will apologize and

667
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:01,733
then it would take like three or four years for

668
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:06,598
them to do some kind of financial compensation to the family.

669
00:50:06,598 --> 00:50:10,089
So you don't start with the whole thing.

670
00:50:10,089 --> 00:50:14,409
You ask for a small step at the institution stage and

671
00:50:14,409 --> 00:50:18,339
then you keep working is the moral that story.

672
00:50:18,339 --> 00:50:21,859
They then took this into an ethnic bias report,

673
00:50:21,859 --> 00:50:25,822
a white paper that they are working to get published.

674
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:30,926
They went to the census tracts in order to figure out the census data.

675
00:50:30,926 --> 00:50:34,480
This is what census data looked like up until about the 40s.

676
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,754
It was hand done by people, but

677
00:50:36,754 --> 00:50:41,312
you could look at the the sort of race and ethnicity category.

678
00:50:41,312 --> 00:50:45,964
And so they looked everybody up on the census in order to identify

679
00:50:45,964 --> 00:50:48,558
what their ethnic background was.

680
00:50:48,558 --> 00:50:52,312
We had institution, age, sex, hispanic ethnicity.

681
00:50:52,312 --> 00:50:56,986
They used Poisson regression to estimate the rates of sterilization.

682
00:50:56,986 --> 00:51:01,600
And this is what allowed them to actually see whether or

683
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:05,424
not there was a substantial, ethical bias.

684
00:51:05,424 --> 00:51:12,022
I love this because again, this is using kind of, epidemiological principles.

685
00:51:12,022 --> 00:51:16,617
This is one of the tables that sort of shows the difference

686
00:51:16,617 --> 00:51:21,503
between the Spanish and non Spanish surname individuals and

687
00:51:21,503 --> 00:51:26,305
for instance, what were,, some of the age differences.

688
00:51:26,305 --> 00:51:30,897
They were younger over some of the justifications that looked like

689
00:51:30,897 --> 00:51:34,997
they were pretty similar in terms of sexual delinquency and

690
00:51:34,997 --> 00:51:38,605
petty crime were two reasons why people would be they

691
00:51:38,605 --> 00:51:42,876
were easy to identify reasons our people will be sterilized.

692
00:51:42,876 --> 00:51:48,862
The petty crime piece for me is so weird, you would be sterilized for petty crime.

693
00:51:48,862 --> 00:51:53,822
That's like shoplifting.

694
00:51:53,822 --> 00:51:58,851
So I think the only other thing that I would say is that

695
00:51:58,851 --> 00:52:04,567
there was a clear sex by ethnicity bias of this was much heavy

696
00:52:04,567 --> 00:52:11,447
handed her with the men that were a Spanish ethnicity than the overall.

697
00:52:11,447 --> 00:52:17,209
And when we actually then calculated the potential rates, the rates for

698
00:52:17,209 --> 00:52:22,702
the Spanish surname, men and women versus the non Spanish surname.

699
00:52:22,702 --> 00:52:27,655
You can see we're talking about a three times different sort of

700
00:52:27,655 --> 00:52:30,843
increase in rate per 1000 per year.

701
00:52:30,843 --> 00:52:35,570
So a threefold bias in a public health

702
00:52:35,570 --> 00:52:40,152
program that is this significant?

703
00:52:40,152 --> 00:52:45,352
And I think, it was sort of a fabulous interdisciplinary

704
00:52:45,352 --> 00:52:50,240
study that allowed us to sort of pull it all together.

705
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,989
This is just the age distribution.

706
00:52:52,989 --> 00:52:57,023
And so now I want to take you into another thing that so

707
00:52:57,023 --> 00:53:01,793
while we might get loud about the numbers and the processes and

708
00:53:01,793 --> 00:53:06,213
Rosan regression, how do you make this real for people?

709
00:53:06,213 --> 00:53:10,894
And it's a whole lot of digital storytelling that I actually think to

710
00:53:10,894 --> 00:53:16,155
the health behavior, health education and health literacy does well with.

711
00:53:16,155 --> 00:53:21,049
So there's only been one person in the history of that

712
00:53:21,049 --> 00:53:26,818
sterilization after the initial Supreme Court that basically

713
00:53:26,818 --> 00:53:32,276
filed suit against California and her name was Sarah Rose.

714
00:53:32,276 --> 00:53:37,600
Garcia, so she was in a family on the on the borderlands and

715
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:45,117
Alex put together her story because it was just it was kind of an incredible story.

716
00:53:45,117 --> 00:53:50,277
So you can go to actually this cemetery where both Sarah and

717
00:53:50,277 --> 00:53:53,873
her daughter, Andrea are side by side.

718
00:53:53,873 --> 00:53:59,945
And Andrea was the individual who was sterilized and

719
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:07,675
in part she was sterilized because of Sarah's family situation.

720
00:54:07,675 --> 00:54:13,559
So this is a time period where there's no birth control.

721
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:16,360
Most families are large so she,

722
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:21,770
Sarah has nine children born between 1921 and 1938.

723
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:27,830
Her husband dies from an infectious disease basically

724
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:34,293
from working in a difficult environment and he gets sick.

725
00:54:34,293 --> 00:54:39,163
She's well known as a loving family member.

726
00:54:39,163 --> 00:54:43,258
She's got a big family, she's a worker and she's a protector.

727
00:54:43,258 --> 00:54:49,010
But the fact that her husband has died and she's on this borderland

728
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:54,464
makes her susceptible to the I'll call it judgment of others.

729
00:54:54,464 --> 00:54:59,502
And when her oldest daughter basically is sort

730
00:54:59,502 --> 00:55:04,410
of picked up because of sexual promiscuity,

731
00:55:04,410 --> 00:55:12,693
my guess is that it was just kind of regular teenage or young adult activity.

732
00:55:12,693 --> 00:55:17,440
She's got nothing to do but this isn't okay and

733
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,433
she tries to appeal it and it doesn't go very far.

734
00:55:22,433 --> 00:55:27,132
But at least she did because she felt like as a mother she needed to

735
00:55:27,132 --> 00:55:28,882
protect her daughter.

736
00:55:28,882 --> 00:55:33,699
And the daughter had been so they're committed by juvenile

737
00:55:33,699 --> 00:55:38,624
authorities and basically she was just sterilized anyway.

738
00:55:38,624 --> 00:55:42,355
They buried her close to her mother because this is a tight family.

739
00:55:42,355 --> 00:55:47,622
But this sterilization record basically they had asked for

740
00:55:47,622 --> 00:55:53,633
Sarah's the mother's consent and Sarah was like no not giving it.

741
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:58,457
And it just didn't, it didn't really matter.

742
00:55:58,457 --> 00:56:00,975
So why is this important?

743
00:56:00,975 --> 00:56:04,237
It's important because it tells the story of a family.

744
00:56:04,237 --> 00:56:10,245
So this individual Andrea is not just an anonymous person.

745
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:15,210
She's got lots of brothers and sisters and she's got lots of nieces and

746
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,698
nephews though she's got no children of her own.

747
00:56:18,698 --> 00:56:26,188
And it just it has this huge impact of well what happened to your sister?

748
00:56:26,188 --> 00:56:28,669
Well this is what happened to my sister.

749
00:56:28,669 --> 00:56:34,541
And what does it do to your relationship to where you are living or

750
00:56:34,541 --> 00:56:37,387
to your other family members.

751
00:56:37,387 --> 00:56:41,567
And some of it is certainly going to reenact the trauma.

752
00:56:41,567 --> 00:56:45,383
But other pieces of it is, it becomes healing for

753
00:56:45,383 --> 00:56:50,139
the other family members and it sort of ties it all together.

754
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:51,939
Okay.

755
00:56:51,939 --> 00:56:53,443
Questions?

756
00:56:53,443 --> 00:57:03,323
Before we sort of take a major left turn you more.

757
00:57:03,323 --> 00:57:04,384
>> Yeah.

758
00:57:04,384 --> 00:57:09,704
>> I think you

759
00:57:09,704 --> 00:57:16,210
mentioned.

760
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:23,138
So if you think about the way in which the mortality at different ages,

761
00:57:23,138 --> 00:57:27,836
so the probability that like a 21 year old will

762
00:57:27,836 --> 00:57:32,548
live to be 22 is like 99.8, 22 to 23.

763
00:57:32,548 --> 00:57:38,768
>> It's about the same as you get up into the thirties and forties.

764
00:57:38,768 --> 00:57:42,667
Then it starts to whittle down to about 95.

765
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,579
Then if you get into the 50s and 60s,

766
00:57:45,579 --> 00:57:50,646
it starts to whittle down into the the low nineties and into the 80s.

767
00:57:50,646 --> 00:57:55,441
And by the time you're in your 70s and 80s now, it's getting to be

768
00:57:55,441 --> 00:58:00,173
something like a 60% chance that you'll make it to the next year.

769
00:58:00,173 --> 00:58:04,815
And by the time you're 87 the chance if you live to be 87 that

770
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:09,473
you're going to make it to 88 starts to be about one in three.

771
00:58:09,473 --> 00:58:14,339
And it's that probability distribution that is now being over laid and

772
00:58:14,339 --> 00:58:15,320
calculated.

773
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,540
So it's accumulated questions.

774
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:29,400
>> Yeah.

775
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,662
>> We should get so does that have

776
00:58:33,662 --> 00:58:38,273
any effect on how people today?

777
00:58:38,273 --> 00:58:45,293
So, my guess is that it does both good and bad, right.

778
00:58:45,293 --> 00:58:50,977
>> So, the, I don't want to put this.

779
00:58:50,977 --> 00:58:58,600
So it's not unusual in a society that has so many sort of stratification ins for

780
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:03,338
the individuals in power to feel good about other

781
00:59:03,338 --> 00:59:07,976
institutions that keep them in power, right?

782
00:59:07,976 --> 00:59:09,618
>> Right. >> And that for

783
00:59:09,618 --> 00:59:13,648
those individuals who are not in power,

784
00:59:13,648 --> 00:59:20,877
let's say that there are the individuals who would be most likely to be,

785
00:59:20,877 --> 00:59:25,757
put into the juvenile system or, be available.

786
00:59:25,757 --> 00:59:30,922
I'm gonna say for the pipeline, and we actually practice in the United States

787
00:59:30,922 --> 00:59:35,552
right now, the pipeline into these institutionalised situations.

788
00:59:35,552 --> 00:59:38,967
They are anti State Department of Health.

789
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:43,179
And so, within any sort of community society,

790
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:50,883
we're going to have these gradations based on social educational positional class.

791
00:59:50,883 --> 00:59:57,350
So we've got them all over and are different in our different institutions.

792
00:59:57,350 --> 01:00:03,419
Okay genome editing.

793
01:00:03,419 --> 01:00:07,034
Anybody know about the CRISPR studied CRISPR.

794
01:00:07,034 --> 01:00:09,428
It is a wild technology.

795
01:00:09,428 --> 01:00:11,973
That is a wild technology.

796
01:00:11,973 --> 01:00:18,076
And I'm gonna, how many don't know about the CRISPR?

797
01:00:18,076 --> 01:00:20,243
How many people don't raise their hand?

798
01:00:20,243 --> 01:00:24,698
[LAUGH].

799
01:00:24,698 --> 01:00:25,898
You should phrase it differently.

800
01:00:25,898 --> 01:00:31,842
So I pulled this from the Harvard Medical School personal genetics education

801
01:00:31,842 --> 01:00:36,970
project because I was looking for a nice graphic on the crisper.

802
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:42,833
But actually what I found was this fabulous five minute discussion.

803
01:00:42,833 --> 01:00:48,208
So this is why I would like you to do just five minutes with whoever you're sitting

804
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:53,287
next to, imagine that you've been offered a deal from a genomics company.

805
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:57,175
You can get a free genome sequence and analysis of all your DNA.

806
01:00:57,175 --> 01:01:01,745
That includes a report of your ancestry traits at a medical profile.

807
01:01:01,745 --> 01:01:06,255
The medical profile tells you about the diseases for which you have a low risk of

808
01:01:06,255 --> 01:01:09,685
getting and also those that you have a high risk of getting.

809
01:01:09,685 --> 01:01:10,808
Are you interested?

810
01:01:10,808 --> 01:01:13,567
Why or why not?

811
01:01:13,567 --> 01:01:19,027
So that's one then, the second one for the 1st 100 volunteers.

812
01:01:19,027 --> 01:01:23,614
The company is offering to correct several of the disease

813
01:01:23,614 --> 01:01:26,684
related genes found by the analysis.

814
01:01:26,684 --> 01:01:31,568
Imagine this were a very new procedure approved by the government for safety,

815
01:01:31,568 --> 01:01:34,308
but without a great deal of long term study.

816
01:01:34,308 --> 01:01:39,184
Would you volunteer for this added service to edit your

817
01:01:39,184 --> 01:01:42,585
genome to get rid of those mutations?

818
01:01:42,585 --> 01:01:44,952
Okay.

819
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:47,730
You have five minutes, please.

820
01:01:47,730 --> 01:09:06,029
Are you interested in this?

821
01:09:06,029 --> 01:09:07,187
>> All right.

822
01:09:07,187 --> 01:09:11,776
So, this is 2018 and

823
01:09:11,776 --> 01:09:17,460
I'm pretty sure by 2025,

824
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:21,403
this will be a thing.

825
01:09:21,403 --> 01:09:26,113
All right, so are you interested,

826
01:09:26,113 --> 01:09:29,884
who's interested in this?

827
01:09:29,884 --> 01:09:31,669
Yeah, okay, we got a couple.

828
01:09:31,669 --> 01:09:35,040
Yeah, all right,

829
01:09:35,040 --> 01:09:39,896
so why are you interested?

830
01:09:39,896 --> 01:09:43,502
Just kind of interesting because it's about like when they added in that,

831
01:09:43,502 --> 01:09:46,206
they may not have studied a lot of it for a very long time.

832
01:09:46,206 --> 01:09:50,732
Like if at least about it, they can watch and see if there is more research that

833
01:09:50,732 --> 01:09:54,510
seems to be following the same pattern and then make a decision.

834
01:09:54,510 --> 01:09:57,987
Like you don't need to pay attention to that information.

835
01:09:57,987 --> 01:09:59,292
>> That's true, that's true.

836
01:09:59,292 --> 01:10:02,014
So how many would go ahead, I'm sorry, I know.

837
01:10:02,014 --> 01:10:05,855
>> I'm interested in part one, part 2.

838
01:10:05,855 --> 01:10:08,048
>> It's okay.

839
01:10:08,048 --> 01:10:11,173
>> So I like that.

840
01:10:11,173 --> 01:10:13,207
>> Have the same feelings.

841
01:10:13,207 --> 01:10:16,937
So what is it about part 1?

842
01:10:16,937 --> 01:10:19,394
The free genome sequence?

843
01:10:19,394 --> 01:10:22,822
That is interesting to you.

844
01:10:22,822 --> 01:10:23,911
What does it feel like?

845
01:10:23,911 --> 01:10:26,320
Is there like my looking at your own genome or

846
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:28,676
having somebody else look at your genome?

847
01:10:28,676 --> 01:10:30,028
What's in there?

848
01:10:30,028 --> 01:10:32,173
That's that's one of the big questions.

849
01:10:32,173 --> 01:10:37,586
I think many of us have had, what's in that genomic information?

850
01:10:37,586 --> 01:10:40,211
What's happening.

851
01:10:40,211 --> 01:10:44,714
So I was just checking, Jen said she went over some of this.

852
01:10:44,714 --> 01:10:46,079
It's like a prophetic.

853
01:10:46,079 --> 01:10:49,428
>> People could see like their life unraveling and

854
01:10:49,428 --> 01:10:53,540
if it's not looking good, it could be like an impending.

855
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:59,114
Yeah, so having any impending doom scenarios in mind,

856
01:10:59,114 --> 01:11:05,532
what would be your worst nightmare to see inside of your genome?

857
01:11:05,532 --> 01:11:07,214
Everybody's got like fears.

858
01:11:07,214 --> 01:11:10,910
But what's your worst fear?

859
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:15,564
All of this world have some fear of a I gonna die or something.

860
01:11:15,564 --> 01:11:17,966
Okay, so how you're gonna die?

861
01:11:17,966 --> 01:11:23,600
Okay, dementia or Alzheimer's, brain is a very important organ to me.

862
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,682
I don't want to lose that other ones.

863
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:30,625
Like maybe your family is not who you would be that would be tense.

864
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:38,158
So that would [LAUGH].

865
01:11:38,158 --> 01:11:43,152
Yeah, other things, what are other diseases you don't want?

866
01:11:43,152 --> 01:11:44,383
Yeah.

867
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:49,064
>> Huntington's.

868
01:11:49,064 --> 01:11:50,128
>> Yeah.

869
01:11:50,128 --> 01:11:55,328
But you can't do any long prolonged sickness and illness uninsurable.

870
01:11:55,328 --> 01:11:57,329
Yeah.

871
01:11:57,329 --> 01:12:00,162
Huntington's, that's a nightmare for most of us.

872
01:12:00,162 --> 01:12:01,405
Other ones.

873
01:12:01,405 --> 01:12:07,499
Early heart attacks,

874
01:12:07,499 --> 01:12:13,913
cancers, shortness,

875
01:12:13,913 --> 01:12:17,126
diabetes.

876
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:21,230
So it's a relatively small list.

877
01:12:21,230 --> 01:12:27,949
It sounds like I mean big like in terms of the impact, but small.

878
01:12:27,949 --> 01:12:33,176
So what if you thought

879
01:12:33,176 --> 01:12:38,700
about your children?

880
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:41,617
What else is in your genome?

881
01:12:41,617 --> 01:12:46,152
One of the, one of the things that I think amazes many people that

882
01:12:46,152 --> 01:12:51,024
have access to the whole genome sequence is just how many deleterious

883
01:12:51,024 --> 01:12:53,805
mutations human beings are carrying.

884
01:12:53,805 --> 01:12:55,772
So you're carrying dozens of that.

885
01:12:55,772 --> 01:12:59,809
But it only manifest that's why the auto so

886
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:06,555
more recessive is a mechanism by which the alil stay in the population.

887
01:13:06,555 --> 01:13:12,545
And it's only in rare occurrences that they sort of show up as a pair and

888
01:13:12,545 --> 01:13:18,048
give rise to a child that has these inborn errors of metabolism.

889
01:13:18,048 --> 01:13:23,283
But there are thousands of these inborn errors of metabolism,

890
01:13:23,283 --> 01:13:28,022
I think right now, the estimate is something like 10 or

891
01:13:28,022 --> 01:13:32,668
12,000 genetic diseases that manifest within,

892
01:13:32,668 --> 01:13:37,628
let's say, the first five years of life and we carry them.

893
01:13:37,628 --> 01:13:40,393
So are all of those bad?

894
01:13:40,393 --> 01:13:42,860
Would you correct those?

895
01:13:42,860 --> 01:13:47,530
So some of what is kind of also important here is how

896
01:13:47,530 --> 01:13:52,214
you think of what a gene does what our teams doing.

897
01:13:52,214 --> 01:14:00,136
The idea jeans are like widgets in the machine, right?

898
01:14:00,136 --> 01:14:03,495
So while we might talk about the BRCA one or

899
01:14:03,495 --> 01:14:07,056
two, have you guys talked about, not yet.

900
01:14:07,056 --> 01:14:10,401
You guys have a favorite gene yet.

901
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:14,711
So my favorite gene is a Bowie.

902
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:19,717
I studied that as a graduate student, in the heart disease space at the time period

903
01:14:19,717 --> 01:14:24,814
when it was found to be associated with Alzheimer's and people were like, no way.

904
01:14:24,814 --> 01:14:28,114
And then it's like, yeah it is.

905
01:14:28,114 --> 01:14:36,232
And it has it has a cool structure in terms of its a little variation.

906
01:14:36,232 --> 01:14:39,667
So there are three major protein forms

907
01:14:39,667 --> 01:14:44,499
that are associated with two different mutations and

908
01:14:44,499 --> 01:14:50,200
the form that is the one that is associated with Alzheimer's.

909
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:57,579
The epsilon for that actually is the ancestral Leo found in chimpanzees.

910
01:14:57,579 --> 01:15:02,913
And it is not the most prevalent or common Leo.

911
01:15:02,913 --> 01:15:08,279
So what it must have happened is that inside of the evolution of human kind,

912
01:15:08,279 --> 01:15:10,078
the variation in April.

913
01:15:10,078 --> 01:15:11,769
We started very early.

914
01:15:11,769 --> 01:15:15,406
Every population on the planet basically has these forms.

915
01:15:15,406 --> 01:15:20,232
And it was basically the non Alzheimer's form

916
01:15:20,232 --> 01:15:24,823
the ε three that is the most frequent to Leo.

917
01:15:24,823 --> 01:15:29,579
So anyway, this would be a one that I think many,

918
01:15:29,579 --> 01:15:33,062
many people would want to correct.

919
01:15:33,062 --> 01:15:38,385
But what happens when you correct something?

920
01:15:38,385 --> 01:15:45,277
You are changing the way it is functioning in the biology of the cell, right?

921
01:15:45,277 --> 01:15:50,860
So, the mutations that might be associated with further

922
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:58,319
disease later on in life actually are functioning in yourselves as a thing.

923
01:15:58,319 --> 01:16:03,679
So what happens when you go in and

924
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:09,240
change the genome, once the last

925
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:14,015
time you did brain surgery?

926
01:16:14,015 --> 01:16:16,456
If you were a brain surgeon,

927
01:16:16,456 --> 01:16:22,479
what would you want the characteristics of that surgery to look like?

928
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:25,964
You'd want it to be precise, right?

929
01:16:25,964 --> 01:16:30,915
You would want to actually the correction to be at the minimum

930
01:16:30,915 --> 01:16:35,769
that you needed to do in order to have the maximum benefit and

931
01:16:35,769 --> 01:16:38,796
you wouldn't want complications.

932
01:16:38,796 --> 01:16:43,839
So part of why I sort of put this up here is that if you are going to

933
01:16:43,839 --> 01:16:50,435
be in charge of programs, let's say around gene editing that are part of newborn

934
01:16:50,435 --> 01:16:55,585
screening programs, let's say in the Department of health.

935
01:16:55,585 --> 01:17:00,145
What do you need to know about the way that

936
01:17:00,145 --> 01:17:04,447
the genome operates in human beings?

937
01:17:04,447 --> 01:17:10,367
What is your relationship between your science and the real now?

938
01:17:10,367 --> 01:17:16,678
Like can you really conceptualize a genome and a nucleus and 50 trillion cells?

939
01:17:16,678 --> 01:17:20,651
You are 50 trillion cells, some of us more than others.

940
01:17:20,651 --> 01:17:24,022
But that's about the estimate.

941
01:17:24,022 --> 01:17:29,545
And those cells are differentially expressed like the jeans and

942
01:17:29,545 --> 01:17:35,692
my eyes are not the same genes expressed that are in my light skin cells.

943
01:17:35,692 --> 01:17:38,267
There's some overlapping but

944
01:17:38,267 --> 01:17:43,821
they're not the same genes don't function as little time bombs.

945
01:17:43,821 --> 01:17:48,937
The breast cancer gene is not sitting there waiting until you're like what,

946
01:17:48,937 --> 01:17:51,231
this person's 40 now on my way.

947
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:56,544
It is actually a cellular function that over time has

948
01:17:56,544 --> 01:18:02,239
gunk up the the metabolism to the point or fragility.

949
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,805
So DNA fragility.

950
01:18:04,805 --> 01:18:09,881
So when we correct something, how well are we doing it?

951
01:18:09,881 --> 01:18:14,122
And what do you know about mitosis?

952
01:18:14,122 --> 01:18:16,120
How good is mitosis?

953
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:19,557
How good are we at replicating DNA.

954
01:18:19,557 --> 01:18:23,719
So the number one thing I try to get individuals

955
01:18:23,719 --> 01:18:28,630
like you that are sort of sitting in classes like this,

956
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:33,223
thinking what are the unintended consequences and

957
01:18:33,223 --> 01:18:39,560
what would you need in order to be convinced that this is an okay thing?

958
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:42,737
And part of it should be the lack of social bias.

959
01:18:42,737 --> 01:18:49,501
It shouldn't be just available to the 4% that we talked about.

960
01:18:49,501 --> 01:18:55,513
And it shouldn't be towards traits that don't have a genetic basis.

961
01:18:55,513 --> 01:19:00,018
And what would you need as a scientific proof that this is okay and

962
01:19:00,018 --> 01:19:01,191
you would do it.

963
01:19:01,191 --> 01:19:05,696
Number one thing I would say if you're not willing to

964
01:19:05,696 --> 01:19:10,317
have it done on you, I would not suggest it to others.

965
01:19:10,317 --> 01:19:13,829
Just say, all right, thank you.

966
01:19:13,829 --> 01:19:20,620
[APPLAUSE].

967
01:19:20,620 --> 01:19:22,527
>> Note to self.

968
01:19:22,527 --> 01:19:25,352
>> Yeah, for sure.

969
01:19:25,352 --> 01:19:26,265
>> Thank you.
