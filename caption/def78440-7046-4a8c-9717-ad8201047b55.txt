1
00:00:00,336 --> 00:00:05,256
This is the Canvas Course and Accessibility Checklist Workshop.

2
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:12,456
My name is Joanna Kovacevich. I work on the instructional services team here at the School of Public Health.

3
00:00:12,456 --> 00:00:15,876
My official title is Instructional Technology Consultant.

4
00:00:15,876 --> 00:00:35,566
So my role and existence is to consult with you faculty GSIs on things such as canvas and the other tools we offer for instruction.

5
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:43,546
So before we begin, just some Zoom housekeeping items, I have made the life transcript option available.

6
00:00:43,546 --> 00:00:50,656
If you would benefit from that, you should have a live transcript button in your Zune toolbar at the bottom of the screen.

7
00:00:50,656 --> 00:01:00,726
And if you click that, you can view an automated transcript, either in a subtitle or in a transcript side panel.

8
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:09,876
For questions during the session were a real small group, so please feel free to unu your microphone and ask questions at any time,

9
00:01:09,876 --> 00:01:16,146
just remembering that you will be included in the recording if you're sharing your webcam while you're asking your question,

10
00:01:16,146 --> 00:01:21,966
your video will also be captured in the recording. You're also welcome to utilize the chat at any time.

11
00:01:21,966 --> 00:01:26,076
I have my chat window here in my line of vision,

12
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:34,416
I'm going to ask you not to use the phrase hand function only because I have a hard time noticing that.

13
00:01:34,416 --> 00:01:50,496
So while I'm screen sharing and focusing on my screen, so I'm going to ask you to feel free to unmuted or use your chat.

14
00:01:50,496 --> 00:01:57,156
Our agenda for today, I'm going to introduce a literal checklist of items,

15
00:01:57,156 --> 00:02:06,096
and this list was compiled of things we know faculty have on their mind that need to be updated for a new semester.

16
00:02:06,096 --> 00:02:16,686
But I also inserted some things that those of us on the instructional side would like instructors to be thinking about when creating their new course.

17
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:22,806
So I'm going to give you that link to that checklist. We're going to talk about some new features of canvas.

18
00:02:22,806 --> 00:02:29,346
Since I have you here, we may as well review some new features that became available over the summer.

19
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:34,926
And if you maybe took a semester off or something, you may not be aware.

20
00:02:34,926 --> 00:02:41,106
And then from there, we're going to open it up. I'm going to show some lesser known tools.

21
00:02:41,106 --> 00:02:46,236
And then I'm also going to count on you all to use the chatter on mute to indicate if there's any

22
00:02:46,236 --> 00:02:52,926
items in the list that you would like more information about that you would like to see demonstrated.

23
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:58,576
Please feel free to do that. So let's get started.

24
00:02:58,576 --> 00:03:08,746
I'm going to put a link in the chat, and this is a link to a Google document and it's going to ask you.

25
00:03:08,746 --> 00:03:11,386
The first step is going to be make a copy,

26
00:03:11,386 --> 00:03:20,266
so if you're logged in to a Google account and it shouldn't matter if it's your Michigan or if you're in a personal Google Drive account,

27
00:03:20,266 --> 00:03:29,506
it should give you a button to, say, make a copy. From there.

28
00:03:29,506 --> 00:03:39,666
You're going to have a document titled Copy of Canvas Course Checklist.

29
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:48,876
And just for your own organizational purposes, I'm going to invite you to go up to the file menu.

30
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:54,606
And you can rename that maybe with a course name in case you want to make multiple

31
00:03:54,606 --> 00:03:59,526
copies and have multiple check lists for different courses you're teaching,

32
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:05,706
and then you can also use the file menu to move this Google document into a folder.

33
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:13,016
So if you have a folder that you use to organize documents for your course and you want to move it there.

34
00:04:13,016 --> 00:04:16,087
Please feel free to do so. If not, it's just going to be at the sort of in the list from the my drive.

35
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:31,917
So the very first link is how to ask us, get help if you run into anything you have questions about in this list.

36
00:04:31,917 --> 00:04:37,687
This is going to open a basically a contact form to reach out to the instructional

37
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:42,097
services team so that we can get back with you and answer any questions about campus.

38
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:49,077
You have the very first item in here is to see what's new.

39
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:57,687
And so I just want to briefly mention some of the new things we have, and I kind of have these in reverse order.

40
00:04:57,687 --> 00:05:07,797
There's now in speed greater if you speaker, there's now a comet library, so if you find yourself using giving the same feedback over and over,

41
00:05:07,797 --> 00:05:18,237
you can now sort of save those and reinsert them over and over without having to copy paste or maybe save a word, doc.

42
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:23,187
I have a little video in here that demonstrates how it works.

43
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:27,447
There's a new assignment tool called Student Annotation Assignment.

44
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:36,837
So as the instructor, you would actually attach a document, you would enable it as a student annotation type of assignment,

45
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:42,597
upload a document that you want students to annotate and then they will be given,

46
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:50,417
if you've ever graded in speed greater where it lets you see a preview of the document and comment on it.

47
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:56,537
That's basically the view students get. They get to annotate and then submit that way.

48
00:05:56,537 --> 00:06:02,527
So it's interesting, I would say in my practice with this.

49
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:08,157
It's a great feature, I would recommend setting up a.

50
00:06:08,157 --> 00:06:12,777
No stakes assignment that students can practice using this feature.

51
00:06:12,777 --> 00:06:25,737
It's not 100 percent intuitive, and I hope to be able to add some resources here of like what to give your students so they know how to use the tools.

52
00:06:25,737 --> 00:06:35,037
So going back as of winter semester canvass changed the submit assignment button text to say start assignment,

53
00:06:35,037 --> 00:06:44,667
so not a huge deal unless you have specific instructions somewhere telling students to use the submit assignment button to upload their work.

54
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:52,457
So, again, even though this is our assignment, it's really the submission step.

55
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:58,397
You may have may or may not have noticed that the file previews have changed,

56
00:06:58,397 --> 00:07:08,627
so when you're attaching articles and readings for your students, how those are viewed are a little bit different as of winter semester.

57
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:18,617
And now there is an actual download icon next to the documents so that they don't have to first see a preview of the document in order to download it,

58
00:07:18,617 --> 00:07:24,167
they can download it directly without having to preview it first. So there's a video here.

59
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:32,207
If this doesn't make any sense, you're not sure what I'm talking about. You can review the video, of course, availability dates.

60
00:07:32,207 --> 00:07:34,517
I added this here because we run into this a lot.

61
00:07:34,517 --> 00:07:44,687
When there's a student who needs to finish assignments in order to have an incomplete changed into a letter grade,

62
00:07:44,687 --> 00:07:53,267
you you would need to change the default course of date settings in that canvass site.

63
00:07:53,267 --> 00:07:58,427
There also may be courses where you want them to submit something before the semester actually begins,

64
00:07:58,427 --> 00:08:09,587
depending on how your program or this course runs. So you would need to specify those date ranges because otherwise it's working within the boundaries

65
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:19,677
that the basically the University of Michigan fall semester dates allow students to submit work.

66
00:08:19,677 --> 00:08:29,007
There's now one webcam option on a file upload assignment, so basically you could kind of take a picture of your scratch work.

67
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:44,757
It's awkward here to hold it up, but it does work as a submit your scratch paper, maybe with your with the assignment homework.

68
00:08:44,757 --> 00:08:49,947
Going back to a new another speed greater feature is now a reassign option,

69
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:58,407
you can basically have a reassigned button which will push the assignment back to the student, letting them know they need to resubmit.

70
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:05,367
So here's a video to see how that works. You may have noticed a new immersive reader button in the upper right corner.

71
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:15,317
This is an accessibility tool, and I encourage you to try it in your own course to see how your course pages.

72
00:09:15,317 --> 00:09:24,227
Read for a student who would be sort of listening with a screen reader, and then there are some other items.

73
00:09:24,227 --> 00:09:28,247
These are the last two items. So feel free to scroll through this.

74
00:09:28,247 --> 00:09:33,557
Bookmark this. I will continue updating this throughout the year.

75
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:43,937
One feature that they didn't really make a video for anything is in the left hand global navigation menu and canvas this blue bar.

76
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:51,017
There's a help button when I click on that campus has started adding release notes.

77
00:09:51,017 --> 00:09:59,157
So up above are actually help resources on how you can get help using canvas, but below that they've actually added released notes.

78
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:05,897
So if you want to stay up to date, you should have an instructor roll release note here.

79
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:08,637
And it's a lot of it can be a lot of stuff to sift through.

80
00:10:08,637 --> 00:10:19,567
So I try to sort of cull that list down to things that are relevant to instructors and add them here.

81
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:24,607
I have some very basic beginning of the semester,

82
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:35,047
you've got your you're ready to jump into your canvas site items such as combining multiple sections into a single canvas site.

83
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:43,057
This is a request we see a lot. And this is something that the instructor, if you would like to, you can do this on your end.

84
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:48,607
So when you are the faculty member assigned to maybe a lecture session and

85
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:53,827
then discussion sessions and you want them merged into a single canvas site,

86
00:10:53,827 --> 00:10:59,057
you can do this. And so if you follow this link.

87
00:10:59,057 --> 00:11:05,017
It is using a U m, of course, manager tool, so these walk you Wikipedia the instructions.

88
00:11:05,017 --> 00:11:12,227
And then if that if you run into any issues, our team would be happy to assist.

89
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:18,487
When I jump back to the top of the chrysalis, I'm going to switch this to viewing for easier.

90
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:31,817
You can import content from a previous semester. On your course homepage, the very top button on the far right, or if your canvas window is small,

91
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:37,447
this right hand panel over here is going to go round down to the bottom of your screen.

92
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:42,157
But the very first button is in port existing content.

93
00:11:42,157 --> 00:11:53,497
This is going to let you know you won't have this mess of copies that I have, but you'll be able to select the content type of copy a canvas course.

94
00:11:53,497 --> 00:12:01,907
Type in the ID number of your last year, last semester course.

95
00:12:01,907 --> 00:12:09,737
And instead of copying all content, I actually select specific content because there's a couple of things I don't want to bring over.

96
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:14,777
I don't need to bring over announcements from last year.

97
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,207
In fact, I don't I would just want those removed.

98
00:12:17,207 --> 00:12:24,227
I don't want those to accidentally be sent out to students if I forget to remove them and publish the course.

99
00:12:24,227 --> 00:12:28,937
So I remove that. And then I also click the adjust event and do date.

100
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:41,607
Now you can ask Canvas to shift the dates. Or just simply clear them and I will set them after the import is complete.

101
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:56,277
So you would do these steps in your new course, so your fall twenty one site, your empty site, because it's going to be an import process.

102
00:12:56,277 --> 00:13:05,517
Once you import all those assignments and you need to sort of set the due dates again, I want to show you a newer feature.

103
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:13,277
So here in the assignments panel. I'm just my window in the upper right corner.

104
00:13:13,277 --> 00:13:20,747
There are three dots, and every time you see three vertical dots, that's basically a more options menu.

105
00:13:20,747 --> 00:13:28,157
So I'm going to click to expand that. And the first option I have is edit assignment dates.

106
00:13:28,157 --> 00:13:34,827
This is a batch assignment date, Ed.

107
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:46,527
And so I can set the due date for each assignment. If I want to restrict the availability of the assignment, maybe for an exam,

108
00:13:46,527 --> 00:13:55,707
I only want students to be able to see it the day of the exam, I could set and available from date, I might have more restrictions.

109
00:13:55,707 --> 00:14:06,037
Anything that doesn't have available from or available until students will be able to see a beginning at the start of the semester.

110
00:14:06,037 --> 00:14:09,907
And submit at any time, basically, which is fine,

111
00:14:09,907 --> 00:14:23,747
and if they but the due date will flag anything that comes in after the due date, it will flag that for you in your great book.

112
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:29,177
So you would go ahead and set those and then use the save button at the top,

113
00:14:29,177 --> 00:14:36,527
say you do import everything and like all course content from a previous semester.

114
00:14:36,527 --> 00:14:41,447
I could come through and select all these assignments or maybe I tried to use the shift dates,

115
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:50,937
but I I've decided to change my schedule up a little bit. I can select the checkboxes for each assignment, use the batch, edit button.

116
00:14:50,937 --> 00:15:02,617
I could try the ship dates again or remove them. And I can remove the due dates, the availability dates are both and click, OK.

117
00:15:02,617 --> 00:15:14,007
And then the save button from their. So I'm saving mine, but that is available to you.

118
00:15:14,007 --> 00:15:20,927
So I have the instructions sort of written out of step by step instructions are helpful to you.

119
00:15:20,927 --> 00:15:32,777
I have a question, please. I have imported my previous canvas course and it all works smoothly and all the gates got adjusted just fine.

120
00:15:32,777 --> 00:15:40,337
All that stuff sort of a nuance, you think. But if you go back to your screen that showed all your assignments there before you edited it,

121
00:15:40,337 --> 00:15:45,617
I guess they might be a different screen than it was in green. It was the one where it shows all year.

122
00:15:45,617 --> 00:15:51,017
Yes. So my assignments are all there, but they're in the wrong order.

123
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:55,757
And it just bothers me because I'm going like, OK, assignment at one like yours is on the board and stuff like that.

124
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:59,267
I feel like like why can't I just drag and drop these around?

125
00:15:59,267 --> 00:16:04,847
And apparently there's no feature that allows me to change the order of is the way those appear.

126
00:16:04,847 --> 00:16:07,937
So are you aware of any way that those can be moved around it?

127
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:12,077
Just intuitively, I just want to see an assignment one before assignment three, you know what I mean?

128
00:16:12,077 --> 00:16:19,637
So it's like slightly and I'm going to grab one of my annotation features that I like here.

129
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:24,177
Every assignment in this list has these little dots.

130
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:30,527
That's right. OK. And that is what's going to let you those are basically grab your hand.

131
00:16:30,527 --> 00:16:35,317
Oh, OK, OK, OK, well, OK.

132
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:40,897
And if by chance your mouse is acting funky, sometimes my mouse gets a little oversensitive.

133
00:16:40,897 --> 00:16:49,507
If you come all the way to the right again to the three more menu, there is a move to uh huh.

134
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:53,287
That's going to let you reach around, OK.

135
00:16:53,287 --> 00:16:56,947
Perfect. Exactly. This is a manual way. Yeah.

136
00:16:56,947 --> 00:17:01,027
OK, that's perfect. I didn't grab. All right.

137
00:17:01,027 --> 00:17:10,327
And I don't know if you're using assignment groups the way I have here groups or something you would use if you have a weighted gradient.

138
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:15,277
I can also I also have these grab handles with the groups. Yeah.

139
00:17:15,277 --> 00:17:16,447
Yeah.

140
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:28,207
And then I could also say, well the perusal reading really I, I prefer to count that in the participation grade, I can actually move them from groups.

141
00:17:28,207 --> 00:17:38,437
OK, perfect. Thank you. One thing to keep in mind is the adjustments you make on this page are really for your own view.

142
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:45,097
The way you organize assignments is not necessarily the way students see it by default.

143
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:52,657
And it's tricky. And it's a little frustrating because if you're trying to tell students where to find something, it may not exactly be one for one.

144
00:17:52,657 --> 00:18:01,297
So this student view button in the upper right corner can really be helpful to see your course the way your students see it.

145
00:18:01,297 --> 00:18:08,207
And in fact, the icon is a pair of glasses. Put student glasses on.

146
00:18:08,207 --> 00:18:14,687
So it defaults to a show by date and it splits things into upcoming assignments, and for me,

147
00:18:14,687 --> 00:18:22,537
because I'm using a practice course, a sandbox site, and I have assignments that don't have any due dates.

148
00:18:22,537 --> 00:18:26,587
It's undated assignments if.

149
00:18:26,587 --> 00:18:37,027
I would need to switch this into show by type in order to see the view, the way my instructor sees it or the way I rearranged it.

150
00:18:37,027 --> 00:18:44,627
So just a heads up for you, and you're welcome to share that with your students and let them know.

151
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:49,757
That these two views are available at the bottom on this pink bar.

152
00:18:49,757 --> 00:19:03,017
I have the ability to leave student view and switch back into my instructor at.

153
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:07,787
One thing that may be relevant, depending on whether you are your course,

154
00:19:07,787 --> 00:19:17,297
is based on looks similar to this, that is based off of the instructional services template.

155
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:29,587
We have our template has a page and then links to different pages where you can organize the content for each week.

156
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:37,657
Where you can put some of this information, this was a welcome video I recorded from the instructor side,

157
00:19:37,657 --> 00:19:46,357
a link to four students to introduce themselves and four week to and a link to the assignment.

158
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:51,247
And so this is these links are just jumping them over to different areas of canvas.

159
00:19:51,247 --> 00:19:59,917
But I've compiled everything into a certain page so that students are ready for week one.

160
00:19:59,917 --> 00:20:07,537
One thing I want to just make you aware of, you're updating a page like this for the new semester.

161
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:18,637
You can come to the edit button. And I just offer this tip because some of our links have dates in them, dates that need to change,

162
00:20:18,637 --> 00:20:23,617
and if you come in here and change the date, you're going to run into a bit of an issue.

163
00:20:23,617 --> 00:20:29,587
It's going to say, nope, I don't have a page with that name, but here's a fresh, clean page.

164
00:20:29,587 --> 00:20:35,257
So what I would suggest, actually, if you're using dates, so if you're using week one, week two,

165
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:40,927
week three, and that's how your pages are titled, you likely won't run into this issue.

166
00:20:40,927 --> 00:20:49,097
But if these said, you know, August twenty eighth, September 1st, actual dates, I would run into quite an issue.

167
00:20:49,097 --> 00:21:09,827
So I would suggest deleting these. And then reinserting them, sorry, I would delete these, go to the pages area.

168
00:21:09,827 --> 00:21:13,607
All pages, and then you're going to see your list of pages.

169
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:27,157
So if this said, you know, September 1st. I could come over here and edit it, change the date, and then now it's ready to reinsert onto the home page.

170
00:21:27,157 --> 00:21:36,287
So that may not make sense now, but if you run into this while you're editing.

171
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:40,357
This update, homepage links.

172
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:50,107
It's sort of my how to to do that, so it says to prevent the creation of duplicate content pages, we recommend the following steps.

173
00:21:50,107 --> 00:22:03,227
I've put them in order that I would suggest. Performing those steps.

174
00:22:03,227 --> 00:22:13,827
Are there any additional questions that you have so far?

175
00:22:13,827 --> 00:22:23,117
Feel free to post them in the chat or on mute, a couple of other items I do want to sort of showcase.

176
00:22:23,117 --> 00:22:40,497
But I definitely want to hear what's on your mind and. If we're addressing what you came for today.

177
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:42,477
You're addressing what I came for,

178
00:22:42,477 --> 00:22:54,267
but I do have a question that's a little bit different when you were talking about the assignment dates and whatever, you mentioned that.

179
00:22:54,267 --> 00:23:04,047
That the site is based on the University of Michigan semesters when my course is actually a nine month course from September to May,

180
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:13,137
so, well, I needed to adjust those dates and every single one in order to make sure that it doesn't shut off or something, you know?

181
00:23:13,137 --> 00:23:20,157
Yeah, that's a great question. Let me show you how you can check what your course is set to do.

182
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:27,327
So by default, any course that is, students register through the registrar's office.

183
00:23:27,327 --> 00:23:32,517
Those courses have been set to a fall. Twenty, twenty one term dates.

184
00:23:32,517 --> 00:23:37,137
But for instance, I have this canvas six course that I use all the time.

185
00:23:37,137 --> 00:23:44,127
And it's but it's not tied to the registrar system in the course menu of each canvas course

186
00:23:44,127 --> 00:23:48,927
is a settings button and it's a menu item that's only available to instructor students.

187
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:59,707
Don't see this. And the first tab is, of course, details tab, and that will tell you what term your canvass site is set to.

188
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:11,557
So I would suggest checking that, OK, because if it is set to a specific date such as fall twenty twenty one,

189
00:24:11,557 --> 00:24:18,247
then yes, we would need to make changes to that. Actually you would be able to make changes to that.

190
00:24:18,247 --> 00:24:23,287
I just need to use the no term of option like you have here.

191
00:24:23,287 --> 00:24:30,007
So you may not as an instructor, you may not have the option to change this to new no term.

192
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:36,547
I have that option because I have some administrative privileges on my campus account.

193
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:44,017
But. Right. What you would be able to do is right below the term information is participation settings.

194
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:59,067
By default. These are set to term. But you would have the ability to change them to course and set specific course start and end dates.

195
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:03,267
So that's how you can double check to see if your course is going to run into any issues.

196
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:09,907
OK, great. Thank you. You're very welcome.

197
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:15,397
All right, we have a question in the chat. Are there new features and functions with respect to discussion rooms?

198
00:25:15,397 --> 00:25:18,187
I'm concerned that will be end up going virtual again.

199
00:25:18,187 --> 00:25:24,487
I agree with you and I want to have my course ready to do in class exercises in the virtual Zoome environment.

200
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:29,031
Any suggestions would be appreciated? Yeah, great question.

201
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:47,138
but in terms of things that you could build in canvas, you, of course, have your Zoome menu.

202
00:25:47,138 --> 00:25:51,948
But there are a couple of things that we can structure in advance from the start,

203
00:25:51,948 --> 00:26:00,488
a couple of tools that you might consider using that will prevent that from being such a disruptive change.

204
00:26:00,488 --> 00:26:06,758
So if you're using it from the beginning, even in the in-person environment, it'll be less of a disruption.

205
00:26:06,758 --> 00:26:14,138
If when we go to remote and I am going to switch at the bottom of the checklist,

206
00:26:14,138 --> 00:26:21,298
I actually sort of featured some try something new with some of the tools we have.

207
00:26:21,298 --> 00:26:24,148
Earlier this week and will be running another session next week,

208
00:26:24,148 --> 00:26:31,438
our tools for engagement and collaboration, we have a the School of Public Health License,

209
00:26:31,438 --> 00:26:40,258
a tool called Yellow Dog, which creates for more, which allows for more interactive discussion than, say, the canvas discussion board.

210
00:26:40,258 --> 00:26:48,898
And so these would be asynchronous discussion posts that allow you to in fact,

211
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:54,688
I can even just maybe even just open up the environment so you can see what it looks like.

212
00:26:54,688 --> 00:27:02,608
It's created to be a social media looking environment and it has a point system attached to it.

213
00:27:02,608 --> 00:27:09,988
So as students contribute, hey, I ran across this article about what we were reading about this week.

214
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:14,038
When they share things like that, they earn points for that.

215
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:24,568
So participation points. If other students in the class leave a comment on that article or even give it a thumbs up with the reaction,

216
00:27:24,568 --> 00:27:32,578
that student also earns points for basically having something that was worthy enough that other students read.

217
00:27:32,578 --> 00:27:36,688
And so it's a collaboration tool to get students interacting with each other.

218
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:45,388
Now, if you have a discussion, maybe a weekly discussion, items you could consider instead of using the discussion board,

219
00:27:45,388 --> 00:27:51,488
trying them here and see how that works, hashtags similar to Twitter and other social media environments,

220
00:27:51,488 --> 00:27:56,578
there's hashtags so that things can be categorized. There's also,

221
00:27:56,578 --> 00:28:01,378
what are these called these topic tags that you as the instructor can create in

222
00:28:01,378 --> 00:28:08,448
advance for different topics that students can attach when they post something.

223
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:14,238
Maybe a week one, you talk about this, so you create tech for that the week, too,

224
00:28:14,238 --> 00:28:18,228
we're talking about focusing on another topic and maybe create a tech for that so

225
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:24,768
that throughout the semester students can reference back to content and topics.

226
00:28:24,768 --> 00:28:36,158
From the past semester. You can add poll questions. You can also record videos, Yelinek has been used for some poster sessions,

227
00:28:36,158 --> 00:28:43,508
so if you have end of semester projects or mid-term projects, they could be shared here and people could comment on them.

228
00:28:43,508 --> 00:28:47,588
So it's just created to be a more engaging tool.

229
00:28:47,588 --> 00:28:51,938
And the point system creates some accountability of you're in there.

230
00:28:51,938 --> 00:29:01,928
It also has fantastic reporting tools to see what students are participating and how much.

231
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:02,918
That was very helpful.

232
00:29:02,918 --> 00:29:11,408
I just and I don't want to divert you from your your agenda, but still, is there a course schedule or a training schedule already on Yellow Dog?

233
00:29:11,408 --> 00:29:22,658
I'll look it up. We sure do. OK, let me jump too, on the.

234
00:29:22,658 --> 00:29:29,618
I'm going to send you to the School of Public Health Events calendar, where we have our upcoming training sessions.

235
00:29:29,618 --> 00:29:35,968
OK. The one where we talked about Yellow Dog.

236
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:46,308
Is not on this list, my apologies, but there is still one for tools, for engagement and collaboration.

237
00:29:46,308 --> 00:29:52,908
We have another tool, and then also you can see a clip of a video from the training session we ran last week.

238
00:29:52,908 --> 00:29:59,088
If you jump to this try Yellow Dog, you can sort of play a video.

239
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:03,468
And if it helps, it's a 20 minute segment from the training this week.

240
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:10,878
But you can play increase the speed of the playback to listen to it a little faster if you'd like.

241
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:13,968
Here's a link to that yellow tech community I just showed you.

242
00:30:13,968 --> 00:30:19,848
If you wanted to try it, we have a practice environment and then a handout of how to actually set this up.

243
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:25,798
And then our team is absolutely available to help us set up.

244
00:30:25,798 --> 00:30:31,828
Great. Thank you for all that. Absolutely. Just while I'm here, I'll point out another tool perusal.

245
00:30:31,828 --> 00:30:37,138
It's a shared annotation tool for articles you upload.

246
00:30:37,138 --> 00:30:41,188
So, again, there might be pros and cons of using one tool over another,

247
00:30:41,188 --> 00:30:54,838
but these perusal can be set up as a reading assignments and students can go in and sort of leave comments, notes, questions about the readings.

248
00:30:54,838 --> 00:31:02,698
And so both of these yellow and perusal tools are things to get students talking about the material with one another.

249
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:10,528
Not always instructor driven, but there are great ways for the instructor to go in and in yellow dig,

250
00:31:10,528 --> 00:31:18,828
for example, an instructor can go in and award additional points for a great post, things like that.

251
00:31:18,828 --> 00:31:23,208
And then in that training session, we also talked about utilizing people everywhere.

252
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:27,018
This is another school of public health only tool.

253
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:36,558
It's not university wide. Perusal is University Wide and Yellow Dog is School of public health only.

254
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:43,848
There is a training session called Preparing for your remote students.

255
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:51,108
It will be aimed at balancing courses where you're teaching in person,

256
00:31:51,108 --> 00:32:01,548
but you have students that are not physically present who are participating asynchronously.

257
00:32:01,548 --> 00:32:09,678
And we will likely talk more about Zoome utilizing Zoome and utilizing that discussion time.

258
00:32:09,678 --> 00:32:18,028
So that's another session that's on that event's calendar coming up this month in August that you can check out.

259
00:32:18,028 --> 00:32:30,528
Any other questions that I can make sure I hit on in the last 20 minutes?

260
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:43,418
I will go ahead and talk about a couple of other lesser known tools, but please feel free to drop anything in the chat.

261
00:32:43,418 --> 00:32:53,198
We will have a session about utilizing a tool called Panopto for your in class sessions,

262
00:32:53,198 --> 00:33:03,128
Panopto is loaded on to all of the classroom computers at School of Public Health so that you can have the slides you're sharing.

263
00:33:03,128 --> 00:33:11,138
There's microphones available that have some pretty good range pick up so that you can capture those class meetings.

264
00:33:11,138 --> 00:33:17,228
If your class is fully in person, that can be helpful review for students.

265
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:26,348
And then we are looking at a situation where students may need to drop off because they are sick, they need to quarantine, they need to isolate.

266
00:33:26,348 --> 00:33:35,198
But also the scenario where you need to capture that lecture material for students who will be viewing it asynchronously after the fact.

267
00:33:35,198 --> 00:33:42,458
We're going to have training sessions on that. And registering for that is also in this School of Public Health Events calendar.

268
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:53,188
It's called Classroom Recording with Panopto. But one thing you can do in advance is go ahead and enable Panopto recording's the tool in your

269
00:33:53,188 --> 00:33:59,518
canvass site so that when you're finished recording in the classroom and stop that recording,

270
00:33:59,518 --> 00:34:08,038
it's going to immediately upload and process and it's going to start in your canvass site, which is fantastic.

271
00:34:08,038 --> 00:34:12,068
Makes it easier for you.

272
00:34:12,068 --> 00:34:23,118
There's also a student facing analytics tool that we'd highly encourage you to consider using, it is called My Learning Analytics.

273
00:34:23,118 --> 00:34:29,648
It was built here at the University of Michigan in a collaboration between its teaching and learning,

274
00:34:29,648 --> 00:34:39,318
school of Information and the School of Education. And you can enable this from your core settings in the navigation tab.

275
00:34:39,318 --> 00:34:45,528
It provides three reports for students to monitor their own progress.

276
00:34:45,528 --> 00:34:54,888
One, they can see resources accessed, meaning any documents that are in the files area, such as articles you have,

277
00:34:54,888 --> 00:35:05,208
it's going to show them how many of they how many documents and files they viewed and it's going to allow them to see you.

278
00:35:05,208 --> 00:35:10,668
Well, how do I compare to the students who are who currently have an A in the course?

279
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:15,138
What have. Is there anything they've looked at that I haven't looked at?

280
00:35:15,138 --> 00:35:20,838
Is there anything they're studying that I'm not studying? Assignment planning is another tool,

281
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:29,898
students can see how all the grades are going to what the scores of all the assignments and how that's going to work towards their final grade.

282
00:35:29,898 --> 00:35:35,828
And so they can make plans to know what they need to achieve.

283
00:35:35,828 --> 00:35:39,888
They can set a goal score. Maybe they're not shooting for an aim.

284
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:46,008
Maybe they're really going to work hard to get a B and they can kind of make a plan.

285
00:35:46,008 --> 00:35:47,808
I do have a video,

286
00:35:47,808 --> 00:35:55,698
a link to view a video of the tool of how to set this up and give you a little bit more information and you can see what these reports look like.

287
00:35:55,698 --> 00:36:14,158
The third one is a great distribution tool that allows students to see their placement in sort of the the curve of how all students are performing.

288
00:36:14,158 --> 00:36:23,378
I'm going to move on to a really fantastic tool that is tucked away and hidden in canvas, and this is a link validator.

289
00:36:23,378 --> 00:36:30,848
So we often copy our core sites from semester to semester, and sometimes there's broken links,

290
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:40,658
maybe there's a link to a YouTube video that's no longer available or there is a Web page, but that organization revamped their website.

291
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:45,098
And so that's a dead link. Now, it's no longer going to do the right thing.

292
00:36:45,098 --> 00:36:50,288
And this tool is going to help you catch those things before your students get to them.

293
00:36:50,288 --> 00:36:58,238
And it creates a problem and a time crunch. It takes very little time to run this.

294
00:36:58,238 --> 00:37:01,768
And so you would go to the settings menu.

295
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:12,688
And in fact, I can demonstrate this settings menu, very helpful tool, the settings menu, again, on the right hand side,

296
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:16,468
if you don't see this menu along the right hand side,

297
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:23,338
it's probably collapsed to the bottom because the window is too small to hold all of these frames.

298
00:37:23,338 --> 00:37:31,058
I'm going to click validate links in content. And start link validation.

299
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:37,268
The nice thing about this is it sort of saves the report until I run it again.

300
00:37:37,268 --> 00:37:43,128
So if I run this search.

301
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:51,568
So in my course, it found seven broken links. So these are things I'm going to want to look at,

302
00:37:51,568 --> 00:38:02,128
the top title is going to tell me where in the course this item is related and then the next item is going to show me the exact link.

303
00:38:02,128 --> 00:38:07,168
Now, the exact link may not always be helpful because it's telling me it's broken.

304
00:38:07,168 --> 00:38:19,348
But what I can do. Let's see. Week for. Article discussion, so I can click on week for.

305
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:26,048
And locate. Yeah, locate. The broken items.

306
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:32,528
If you run into anything on here that you need help with again, please reach out to instructional services.

307
00:38:32,528 --> 00:38:37,238
We'd be happy to help you solve this here. Yeah, this almost just looks like so nice.

308
00:38:37,238 --> 00:38:42,518
There's just code hidden in the code that's not working.

309
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:47,918
But I would encourage you to try this out. I have a question about that.

310
00:38:47,918 --> 00:38:57,938
So what is it? Check checking, so let's say for week three, I have some references and I've pasted in different references with you URLs.

311
00:38:57,938 --> 00:39:04,538
And one of those could be broken. I understand. But what if I'm posting let's say while, for example, my syllabus,

312
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:11,138
my syllabus is a word document or LPF and it has links to all sorts of stuff, is it checking those as well?

313
00:39:11,138 --> 00:39:15,968
The content of the document? Checking those. Yes, right. So it's the content of stuff.

314
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:22,058
I've actually put in canvas in some form directly into canvas.

315
00:39:22,058 --> 00:39:25,478
That's exactly right. So that links are in campus.

316
00:39:25,478 --> 00:39:37,988
It is not scanning the documents that are in canvas and syllabus is actually a really great example because again, we reuse our syllabi.

317
00:39:37,988 --> 00:39:43,028
We tend to reuse our syllabi and sort of copy them forward and update them.

318
00:39:43,028 --> 00:39:48,338
But I have come across many syllabi that are linking out to resources,

319
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:57,048
student resources that are broken due to just the School of Public Health website redesign.

320
00:39:57,048 --> 00:40:02,188
So I would encourage you to go through those and check them.

321
00:40:02,188 --> 00:40:14,398
On the syllabus, update your syllabus link information, I did put a link to the heights where there is a syllabus, there's a syllabus template.

322
00:40:14,398 --> 00:40:22,258
This will take you to the faculty page. But there's also a it'll give you sort of a template syllabus to the courses you teach.

323
00:40:22,258 --> 00:40:28,788
But there's also departmental templates available in the faculty resources area.

324
00:40:28,788 --> 00:40:43,818
And so those should have the updated links or the old links removed.

325
00:40:43,818 --> 00:40:49,248
All right, with about ten more minutes, let's see, I do want to talk about accessibility with you.

326
00:40:49,248 --> 00:40:54,648
Do it. So I will go ahead and jump to that.

327
00:40:54,648 --> 00:40:59,988
So this tool is going to scan similar to the link validator,

328
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:10,998
this is going to scan the content that is in canvas for Web accessibility against Web accessibility standards.

329
00:41:10,998 --> 00:41:14,558
And so I hope to flesh this out a little bit more.

330
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:24,788
I have a video demonstration and this demonstration is by a team at Penn State, so if you view this, it's very detailed, which is fantastic.

331
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:34,568
But if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us instead of any contact information that might be shown in that video.

332
00:41:34,568 --> 00:41:40,928
I'm going to go to the home and I have this tool, you do it enabled in my menu here,

333
00:41:40,928 --> 00:41:49,698
but you can turn it on in any of your core sites from the settings menu navigation.

334
00:41:49,698 --> 00:41:56,498
And you would located here in this very long list of tools that are not available.

335
00:41:56,498 --> 00:42:06,998
And it's a good time to maybe do a little shopping and see if there's anything you want to look at, such as the library links that are available.

336
00:42:06,998 --> 00:42:09,278
When you locate it, it's already enabled in mine,

337
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:18,048
so I'm just going to use one of the other disabled tools clicking on this three dot menu will allow you to enable it.

338
00:42:18,048 --> 00:42:22,458
Which will jump it up to the top list of tools,

339
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:29,988
which is basically the tools that you have available to students that create this course menu to the left,

340
00:42:29,988 --> 00:42:37,488
once it's in the menu, you could rearrange it. However, this menu is exclusively available to you as an instructor.

341
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:51,308
Students won't see it at all. So now that it's in my menu of available tools, I just need it up here so that it appears in the menu and I can use it.

342
00:42:51,308 --> 00:43:01,558
I'm going to scroll all the way down to the bottom of this very long list and click save to make sure that saves it in the menu.

343
00:43:01,558 --> 00:43:09,748
And so this tool was developed at the University of Central Florida and there is a button here that says, what did you do it look for?

344
00:43:09,748 --> 00:43:18,208
And when you click on that, it's going to give you a summary of the actual Web accessibility items that it's checking for.

345
00:43:18,208 --> 00:43:23,508
And so these are really great things to become familiar with.

346
00:43:23,508 --> 00:43:28,188
Scanning options lets you check what items you want.

347
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:33,918
You do it to scan for, but similar to that link validator in my files area,

348
00:43:33,918 --> 00:43:38,298
it's not going to be able to scan the documents that exist in my files area.

349
00:43:38,298 --> 00:43:42,378
That would be incredible, but it's not able to scan those.

350
00:43:42,378 --> 00:43:49,468
So I'm just going to go ahead and uncheck that. It's going to show errors and suggestions,

351
00:43:49,468 --> 00:43:55,108
so errors are things that are actually making your site inaccessible for someone

352
00:43:55,108 --> 00:44:00,788
using a screen reader or using some sort of assistive software suggestions.

353
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:05,608
There are things that are not inaccessible, but they could be better.

354
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:11,368
And so errors and suggestions again are listed and you can review all of them under this.

355
00:44:11,368 --> 00:44:24,148
What did you do it look for? And then you would hit scan this course depending how much content you have in your course.

356
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:28,678
If you have a lot of content, it's going to take a little bit of time to scan everything.

357
00:44:28,678 --> 00:44:39,328
It works relatively quickly, though, and a lot of our content exists in the files area and it won't be able to do anything with that anyway.

358
00:44:39,328 --> 00:44:47,248
The tab over here is Vue Old reports, and I ran a report yesterday just to see how it would go.

359
00:44:47,248 --> 00:44:53,518
Actually, let me go ahead and just do a fresh scan and then there's also an option to include unpublished content.

360
00:44:53,518 --> 00:44:58,348
I'm going to say, no, I don't need the unpublished content.

361
00:44:58,348 --> 00:45:07,888
So you do need to stay on this page while you do it scans the course content so you can't close this, but maybe if you use a dual monitor,

362
00:45:07,888 --> 00:45:14,758
you can open another browser window to check your email or do something else while you're waiting for this to come up.

363
00:45:14,758 --> 00:45:21,238
So this is a quick summary of the issues that appeared insufficient text color, contrast with the background.

364
00:45:21,238 --> 00:45:26,938
That's a big one for people with vision impairment. Alternative text should not be the file name.

365
00:45:26,938 --> 00:45:39,208
I need to add substantive, substantive alternative text to an image so that someone using screen reader tools can make sense of what my images.

366
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:46,258
So those are things that are errors. I'm not accessible, not meeting web standards.

367
00:45:46,258 --> 00:45:56,548
Suggestions, link, text should be descriptive, image elements should have an alt attribute, so that's another alt tag.

368
00:45:56,548 --> 00:46:04,498
And some of this, I think it's really great to start making yourself become familiar with one, the Web accessibility language.

369
00:46:04,498 --> 00:46:12,948
But you do it also has some language to itself. And so we're going to see more details about these.

370
00:46:12,948 --> 00:46:21,148
So this is the summary. But over on the left, I would have a list of areas that had errors or suggestions.

371
00:46:21,148 --> 00:46:31,878
And so it looks like my pages area is really where my errors are, but could also be assignments, quizzes, things like that.

372
00:46:31,878 --> 00:46:41,178
The really nice thing about this is I can view what it's talking about, so this is saying insufficient color contrast.

373
00:46:41,178 --> 00:46:45,038
It's going to give me a preview. Oh yeah. Bright purple.

374
00:46:45,038 --> 00:46:49,758
Oh, that was not a good text color choice. I don't know why I did that.

375
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:56,398
If you are a TML person Teche person, it'll actually show you the code.

376
00:46:56,398 --> 00:47:02,178
I'm going to close that to collapse it, but there's a you fix it button.

377
00:47:02,178 --> 00:47:11,898
That's going to let me pick a new color right here, and it's going to make that change for me.

378
00:47:11,898 --> 00:47:20,868
So replace foreground color, it's going to let me pick a new color here, so I'm just going to go with black.

379
00:47:20,868 --> 00:47:25,408
I don't know why I try to be fancy. I'm just going to go with black.

380
00:47:25,408 --> 00:47:39,158
And so now it's remove that flag, let me go back to show here in ratio invalid and it's looking at a color contrast ratio.

381
00:47:39,158 --> 00:47:43,528
So that one would work. That one doesn't work.

382
00:47:43,528 --> 00:47:49,808
All right, so I'm going to go with black that is removed and submit.

383
00:47:49,808 --> 00:47:58,378
Good done. So it basically creates a checklist of things to fix.

384
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,038
So, again,

385
00:47:59,038 --> 00:48:09,148
we will be more than happy to help you look at make corrections or answer questions about the items that might appear in your you do report.

386
00:48:09,148 --> 00:48:19,108
But again, we just it's another way that we can help make our courses ready for student use.

387
00:48:19,108 --> 00:48:24,238
One thing I wanted to link in here and I'll need to go back and link in here was I don't know if any of you

388
00:48:24,238 --> 00:48:32,898
saw the report that was released in the winter by the Rock'em Graduate School that had survey feedback.

389
00:48:32,898 --> 00:48:34,518
I'm not going to be able to find it in time,

390
00:48:34,518 --> 00:48:46,218
but it talked about that their survey respondents of students who had disability issues and requested accommodations,

391
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:56,358
but there was a set of students that said, I don't actually have a disability, but I really benefit from the accommodations and things that are done.

392
00:48:56,358 --> 00:49:03,048
So things like that alt text, things like captions on videos, those help everyone.

393
00:49:03,048 --> 00:49:10,638
And so the name of the tool, the acronym stands for Universal Design, Online Inspection Tool.

394
00:49:10,638 --> 00:49:22,698
You do it. And so it's not that universal design of it really makes it a better experience for everyone.

395
00:49:22,698 --> 00:49:31,288
All right, in the last four minutes, so you should have a copy of this document to use as a resource.

396
00:49:31,288 --> 00:49:35,788
After this session, I'm going to send you a copy of this recording,

397
00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:43,888
I'm going to send you the link to make another excuse me, another copy of this checklist for the future, if you would like.

398
00:49:43,888 --> 00:49:52,258
And then our contact information, of course, if there's anything we can assist with as you're working to set up your course,

399
00:49:52,258 --> 00:50:01,428
some things that are on the list that we didn't talk about was scheduling zoo meetings in canvas, adding rubrics to your assignments.

400
00:50:01,428 --> 00:50:11,868
Setting up the grade book, organizing your course menu, going into that settings, navigation tab and organizing items.

401
00:50:11,868 --> 00:50:18,328
One thing we are suggesting for this year.

402
00:50:18,328 --> 00:50:23,038
Starting now is a record and share a course tour.

403
00:50:23,038 --> 00:50:32,188
We've actually developed a template script for you and when your course is finished, you've finished setting it up.

404
00:50:32,188 --> 00:50:39,118
What we would invite you to do is go switch it into student view and do a Panopto recording.

405
00:50:39,118 --> 00:50:44,078
And we have instructions on how to do that. A recording that says, hey, welcome, everybody.

406
00:50:44,078 --> 00:50:50,068
I just want to show you where to find the course content in my site.

407
00:50:50,068 --> 00:50:59,908
Overwhelmingly one of the biggest comments students have when we survey them about how well or how easy it is to use canvas,

408
00:50:59,908 --> 00:51:07,318
either positively or negatively. They tend to comment on the organization of the course materials.

409
00:51:07,318 --> 00:51:11,758
It was easy to find things. I knew exactly what we had to do every week.

410
00:51:11,758 --> 00:51:16,588
I knew when things were due. On the other hand, students definitely let us know.

411
00:51:16,588 --> 00:51:20,068
I don't know why the instructions can't be linked into the assignment,

412
00:51:20,068 --> 00:51:30,448
or it was really difficult to find the materials when everything was mixed together in the files area or, you know, things like that.

413
00:51:30,448 --> 00:51:35,428
The course organization is really critical for your students.

414
00:51:35,428 --> 00:51:43,558
And so just taking three minutes to say, here's where the syllabus says we're going to talk more about it on the first day of class.

415
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:52,978
Your assignments are going to be here. I have PowerPoint and readings available here to showing them how you set up your course,

416
00:51:52,978 --> 00:51:58,168
because going back to that student feedback, they said every instructor does it differently.

417
00:51:58,168 --> 00:52:01,708
And I really struggled to figure this one course out.

418
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:14,268
And so this is one thing we can help them be a little less stressed about, and so we've got instructions there that you can use.

419
00:52:14,268 --> 00:52:20,838
All right, any questions before we close out, I want to thank you all for coming.

420
00:52:20,838 --> 00:52:27,318
I want to encourage you to check out our other training sessions that are coming up also on that event's calendar.

421
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:32,418
So most of these sessions are by our School of Public Health Instructional Services team.

422
00:52:32,418 --> 00:52:35,838
But I do have a link to the teaching and learning.

423
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:42,528
Can the summit that's coming up, where they're going to talk about some tools that I don't even know about yet, such as this.

424
00:52:42,528 --> 00:52:46,178
Listen and learn student names with name coach.

425
00:52:46,178 --> 00:52:56,528
They're going to show us how to add linked in learning content into your canvass site, so maybe you're using an Excel Excel for some things.

426
00:52:56,528 --> 00:53:01,928
But hey, if students need to see how they don't know how to do this function and excel,

427
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:09,938
maybe link them to a LinkedIn learning video where they can learn how to do it in preparation for an assignment.

428
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:16,448
And then it's developed a way to merge your Zoome recordings into the My Video Tool,

429
00:53:16,448 --> 00:53:21,218
which is integrated into canvas, so I'm looking forward to learning about that.

430
00:53:21,218 --> 00:53:26,258
Anything we can do to make it easier to save and archive those Zoome meeting those

431
00:53:26,258 --> 00:53:37,188
class recordings so that they're viewable for students would be very beneficial.

432
00:53:37,188 --> 00:53:42,408
I have a question. So are those it's teaching and learning, is that summit.

433
00:53:42,408 --> 00:53:46,488
Is there a link to that on your speech events calendar?

434
00:53:46,488 --> 00:53:49,008
It sure is, yeah. OK, good, thanks. Yep.

435
00:53:49,008 --> 00:53:58,018
I have it listed as the canvas summit and it's next week from one to five, but each of the sessions is about 20 minutes.

436
00:53:58,018 --> 00:54:02,688
So they're going to sort of rapid fire go through all the different tools. OK, that sounds great.

437
00:54:02,688 --> 00:54:09,248
Thank you. All right, I want to thank you again for coming, I'm going to stop the recording, but you have addition.

438
00:54:09,248 --> 00:54:12,653
If you have additional questions, I would be happy to answer those. I'm going to have to jump off now, but thank you very much.
