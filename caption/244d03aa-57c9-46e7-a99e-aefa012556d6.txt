1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:11,280
Yeah. I was going to say. All right, guys, I'm going to start over last night on my and other topics.

2
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,870
I'm sure I'd like to talk to you about this image.

3
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:25,180
All right, guys, I know we're going to have a lot of people out today because of Michigan is hurting and I know some of us in the lab.

4
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,100
So it's going to be kind of a tight, busy day. But let's get started.

5
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,360
So the camera came on. In theory, Panopto should be doing its thing.

6
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:44,700
Yeah. So today we're going to start the second part of the class, which is going to be our systems based pathology.

7
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:51,659
So look at that. Made it through gem pap already. I know this kind of this tends to be, I think a difficult time of the semester.

8
00:00:51,660 --> 00:01:00,330
This is when things really start getting really busy. So I hope everyone's hanging in there and I know and things are going well with the midterm.

9
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,800
I haven't really had any questions or concerns, but please let me know if there are issues.

10
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,850
And don't forget that it's due on Monday at 10 a.m.

11
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,430
All right. Okay. So today we're going to do liver.

12
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:21,210
I did want to mention I have started to get some questions already as people are planning their end of the semester for the final exam,

13
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,830
just in terms of timing. So this is from your syllabus on our campus site.

14
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,770
The final exam will be on December 9th, which is actually our last day of class.

15
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,830
Because we're a Friday only class. We don't have an assigned exam time during the regular exam period.

16
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,530
And rather than kind of structure with everyone's different final exams, we're just going to do it the last day of class.

17
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,580
The way that's going to work, this one is going to be on canvas.

18
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,570
Short answer and short essay.

19
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,640
I have to correct all these in a very compressed period of time so it will be on canvas.

20
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:05,240
It is an exam that is generally designed to be a two hour exam, but I'm going to give you the entire day of December 9th.

21
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,690
So it's going to have a period of time where it's open probably from 10 a.m., our start of our class time until 8 p.m.

22
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:19,650
So like the eight hour time period. No, that's ten hour, ten hour time period of that day.

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,350
So the exam itself is designed to take 2 hours, but you have like an eight hour window during which it's open.

24
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,600
And the way that works in canvas, I can set it up so that there's a timer.

25
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,640
When you open the exam for the first time, your eight hour clock starts ticking.

26
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,090
If you work a little bit on it, close it, close the window, put it away.

27
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:48,809
The timer continues on and then it's going to automatically submit because I have a kind of stop time of 8 p.m.,

28
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,870
so it'll automatically submit at 8 p.m. regardless.

29
00:02:52,290 --> 00:03:00,569
So the idea is the exam is designed to take 2 hours. You have that entire day so that allow you some flexibility for those in 717.

30
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:06,210
There is no 717 class that day, so you won't have that interfering aspect.

31
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,230
So during that day you'll find, you know, your 2 hours of time to take the exam.

32
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,500
You can take a little break, look at it again and turn it in. So basically it's all confined within that day, December 9th.

33
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,830
And if you have any conflicts with that day,

34
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,420
you just want to let me know because I can potentially offer it earlier in the same week under the same conditions.

35
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,580
Okay, so that's for the final. I am started at questions as I know people are planning.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,389
You know, they're into semester and travel schedule. All right.

37
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:40,380
Any questions about that at this point? All right.

38
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,380
So let's talk liver. Okay.

39
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:54,110
So we spent the first half of the class talking about general pathology.

40
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:03,230
So we talked about how everything in pathology is basically tissue injury, body response, which is inflammation and outcome,

41
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:10,290
which is either regeneration of the epithelium of the tissue that was there before or repair by scarring by fibrosis.

42
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:18,050
We talked about that entire process and we talked about the sort of aberration of a regenerative response that is neoplasia.

43
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,629
So we have our basic tools for pathology.

44
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:28,520
And now what we're going to do in the second part of the class is look at some key organ systems for toxicology the whole time to every organ system.

45
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:35,810
We're going to review a little bit their structure function and then apply that basic sequence of events.

46
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:41,120
What does the liver look like in the face of tissue injury? What does it look like when it has an inflammatory response?

47
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:42,590
What does it look like under repair?

48
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:51,169
So we're going to apply our general understanding of pathology to each organ system, because we're starting our organ system discussion today.

49
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:57,940
That generally takes a little bit of time to get in the swing of it because the liver is a pretty important system for toxicology for the liver.

50
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,520
We're going to do this in two sessions. We're just going to do structure function today.

51
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,250
There's a little bit of pathology at the end, but the main part of our pathology discussion for liver will be next week.

52
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:12,229
So you can kind of get used to how that works. And then we'll do kidney and lung.

53
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:18,469
I think I have in one session some of the structure and pathology on the same day for those not the same pace each other,

54
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,490
but each system will have one day for everything and then neuro gets a little complex.

55
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,820
So I split that up into two at the end. So that's kind of how it works.

56
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:36,500
So for those that see, unfortunately, we're lacking a screen today, the screen appears to undergo some sort of accident.

57
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:41,269
So hopefully you'll be able to see sufficiently.

58
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,810
I hope it gets fixed by next week because that's when we have some really good histo slides.

59
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,600
All right. But thinking about liver.

60
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:54,800
So the liver, as I said, is an important organ in toxicology in particular, and has a number of different functions.

61
00:05:55,700 --> 00:06:00,800
So some of them are obviously already probably know about, like its Newt, its role in nutrient metabolism.

62
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:08,000
So the liver receives the blood from the intestine and is responsible for extracting nutrients from that intestinal blood.

63
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:16,129
So it has a substrate blood supply from the intestine as part of its role in extracting nutrients.

64
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:19,640
It also plays a role in regulation of blood glucose.

65
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,640
Glucose, as you know, when we talked about biochemistry,

66
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:30,050
it's a major energy molecule in the body that gets broken down during glycolysis and later in oxidative phosphorylation.

67
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,570
So the liver is important in regulating whether glucose goes into a storage state

68
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,770
or whether it's actually metabolized or mobilized in the blood to the tissues.

69
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,780
And then the liver is also important for excretion and recycling of body metabolites.

70
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:52,520
So it plays a role in recycling certain amino acids, in recycling and metabolizing fats.

71
00:06:52,700 --> 00:07:01,370
It has a large kind of organizational and metabolism role in nutrient in the body's handling of nutrients.

72
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,540
So that's a major role for the liver. And we're going to talk about that today,

73
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:13,880
mostly in the context of how the structure of the liver reflects that blood flow and that distribution of nutrients.

74
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:18,620
So we have a little discussion of blood flow coming up in other roles of the liver,

75
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:26,690
particularly important to toxicology or its role in detoxification of zero biotics and also endogenous toxins.

76
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,620
So excessive of nutrients or excessive metabolites,

77
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:37,820
but certainly a role in the detoxifying detoxification of compounds that are taken in from the outside.

78
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,570
So again, we'll see how that looks in terms of the structure of the liver.

79
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:47,149
The liver functions to form bile and to excreted into the intestine.

80
00:07:47,150 --> 00:07:56,600
So as we'll see, bile has a role in digestion and also in excretion of metabolites and of xeno biotics.

81
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:04,880
And then finally, the liver has a large role in protein synthesis, and there are a number of different proteins for which the liver is responsible.

82
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:09,650
So that's kind of the overview of what the liver does. Here's a little bit of anatomy.

83
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:18,410
So the liver, as you probably know in human anatomy, is located mostly in the upper right quadrant of the abdomen.

84
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:25,549
It stretches across a little bit, but it's kind of pushed over to the right there as a in the human as opposed to the mouth.

85
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:32,330
Those who did in 717, the necropsy lab last week saw this in the mouse delivers a little bit more centrally located.

86
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,610
So it still has the same basic lobes, but it's a little bit more in the center of the abdomen.

87
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:46,760
And although they have a slightly different shape between the human and mouse, the basic lobular structure of the liver is very similar as it is in.

88
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:53,699
Most species. So there's a large right lobe in the human and the gallbladder is situated.

89
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:59,410
So it's kind of cleaved at the bottom and the gallbladder is situated right at the base of that kind of cleaved spot in the right low.

90
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:05,170
And in the mouse liver, the right lobe or the right medium lobe, we should call it in.

91
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:09,520
The mouse is actually more has a more pronounced cleavage spot.

92
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:13,090
And then the gallbladder is again focused right in that middle portion.

93
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,760
The gallbladder is not present in all species.

94
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:23,290
So the gallbladder, as we'll see when I show you the tract, is a storage vat for bile.

95
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:30,790
So it stores the bile being made in the liver and then excretes that to the intestine periodically, usually after there's been a meal.

96
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:36,010
So when you need the emulsification effect of bile, but you can live without your gallbladder.

97
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,040
If gallstones are some issue, you can have your gallbladder removed,

98
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,799
your hepatocytes are still going to make bile and it's still going to be excreted via the bile duct.

99
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,530
It's just going to be more of a slow, continuous excretion rather than the periodic excretion with the gallbladder.

100
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:57,280
And some animals don't have a gallbladder like the rat, for example, interestingly, does not have a gallbladder, although the mouse does.

101
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:03,280
Okay. There's also a left lateral lobe in the human end in the mouse.

102
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,270
And then if you flip the liver sort of over and look at the back side of it,

103
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:11,290
you have a number of smaller lobes that are kind of lobular like a little bit differently,

104
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:19,359
but can basically be divided into the county in the quadrant lobes in the mouse and have some slightly different names.

105
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,190
But the basic structure of those two large lobes in the front and then some smaller ones in the back,

106
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,540
the vascular supplies are really important concept to understand in terms of the liver.

107
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:40,120
So the liver has two basic vascular supplies in terms of blood coming in, and one is substrate blood.

108
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:44,500
So blood that the liver is going to work on in terms of extracting its nutrients.

109
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:48,730
And the other is oxygen supply. So how does this work?

110
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,750
So in terms of blood supply, going into the liver,

111
00:10:53,050 --> 00:11:01,000
the oxygenated blood feeds into the liver from the hepatic artery, which ultimately is a branch off of the aorta.

112
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:08,290
So the red tubing here in the diagram is oxygenated blood from the heart and the aorta.

113
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:15,250
So obviously the liver needs that. So the hepatocytes and all the other functional cells can remain well oxygenated.

114
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:22,870
But the liver is also receiving input. Blood via a vein from the intestine sets the portal vein system.

115
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:29,349
So the portal vein is a main major vein leading from the intestine that takes all the blood that has received

116
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:34,660
nutrients from the intestine and that's going to be distributed to the hepatocytes for them to work on.

117
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:44,500
And then both the oxygenated blood and the blood in the vein, which is deoxygenated,

118
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,740
are actually going to pool into a small sinusoidal system, which I'll show you in higher magnification in a minute.

119
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:56,770
So those two bloodstreams are going to merge and then both at that point they're all be deoxygenated blood,

120
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,310
both will exit the liver via the vena cava and ultimately that takes the blood back to the heart.

121
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:13,150
Okay, so the exit tract, there's essentially one exit and then the entry tract, there are two streams of entry.

122
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,510
So that's kind of looking at it on the organ scale.

123
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:25,870
If you were to take a slice of the liver sort of anywhere in here, you have to imagine all of these all of these systems feeding in like a tree.

124
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,900
So as they enter the liver, they get smaller and smaller branches.

125
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,810
So depending on where you slice whatever, you might have different sizes of each of those vascular structures.

126
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:43,510
So if I take a random slice of liver, you'll see that the parasites themselves are arranged in a lobular fashion and the center.

127
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:49,329
So you can kind of draw an imaginary line that looks a little bit like a hexagon around one of the and call that

128
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:56,380
a lot of your show that a little bit more clearly in a minute but the lobular is arranged around a central vein,

129
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,330
which is the smallest branch that leads to the vena cava.

130
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,050
So the center of this is the exit tract. Exit tract.

131
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:11,170
So all the blood is flowing into the center of the lobular and then all the central veins pull to lead to the vena cava.

132
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:16,390
So the center part is the exit blood and then the blood is entering, I think have this marked.

133
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:21,220
We'll get to that in a minute. The blood is entering from the periphery of this globule.

134
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,630
So at each point of the hexagon, there's a little tripod structure.

135
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,850
And two of the that the structure that has there are the hepatic arterial branches,

136
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:35,740
the oxygenated blood and the portal vein piercing the blood flows towards the center.

137
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:41,330
And then in between all these vascular structures, we have the things that are drawn in pink here.

138
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,600
Those are the hepatocyte cords. So those are arranged in the little lines, the hepatocyte.

139
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:52,410
They're making bile and the bile is blowing the opposite direction towards the portal triads.

140
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,100
So I'll show you that again in higher magnification in a moment.

141
00:13:56,370 --> 00:14:00,990
But the bile flow is towards the portal triads, where it's collected into bile duct channels,

142
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:06,120
and ultimately that flows to the bile duct and to the gallbladder.

143
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:13,620
So the gallbladder, again, is a storage vat off the bile duct, and ultimately it's all going to empty into the intestine.

144
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:20,630
Okay, that's big picture. So this is that lobular organization.

145
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:26,190
So this is the thing that just drew central or I just showed you central, the hexagon shape.

146
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:32,339
That's kind of a morphology base or a shape based way of looking at the liver.

147
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:37,350
But you can also look at it from a functional aspect and you can consider it rather than

148
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:42,990
being this hexagon as a little diamond where the middle part is actually the portal triads.

149
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,690
So that's called Ace in our organization.

150
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:53,640
So both are legitimate ways of looking at the liver and kind of applicable to different, I don't know, different purposes.

151
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,060
But the lobular is a hexagon centered on the central vein.

152
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:06,209
That was the first way the liver was described, and that was actually based on descriptions of a pig liver, which has a really well-defined labial.

153
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,380
There's a lot of connective tissue in the pig liver, so you can almost see the line of the hexagon,

154
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:17,790
other livers in other species, or that less obvious at the if you're thinking about it as a lobby at the edges.

155
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:25,470
So at each of the points of the hexagon is where you're going to see the profile of the portal triad, which has our three structures.

156
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:35,070
And then, as I said, you can also consider the liver functionally in terms of an easiness where the edges of it are the central thing,

157
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:41,610
and the middle portion is the portal triad. And that is useful because if you think about the oxygenation state,

158
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:48,510
the highest oxygenation state in the liver coming in from the hepatic artery is going to be nearest to the portal vein.

159
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:54,330
Okay. So in toxicology and in pathology, we often call that zone one.

160
00:15:54,900 --> 00:16:00,150
So that's referring to the oxygenation state. That's the highest oxygen concentration in the liver.

161
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:05,489
And then as the blood flows towards the central vein is dispensing to the hepatocytes,

162
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:12,460
more and more oxygen is extracted and the lowest oxygenation concentration is in zone three near the central theme.

163
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:18,000
So we have an oxygen gradient along the assonance.

164
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,520
So that was like a little pie shaped, two dimensional view.

165
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,280
If you think about the liver as a three dimensional structure, so this is kind of a medium magnification.

166
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,410
These little yellow things are rows or cords and parasites.

167
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,120
Almost looks like a kind of old layer cake or something.

168
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:44,390
So if you take a chunk of liver, this structure around the central vein, so there's a central vein.

169
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,580
This is a lobular. Okay, so this is one labial and it's surrounded.

170
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,019
So this both in the middle of the central vein and then at the edges we have the green thing,

171
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:57,770
which is the bile duct system and the red thing, which is the hepatic artery.

172
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:00,950
And then our portal veins and these kind of curve around the labial.

173
00:17:01,310 --> 00:17:04,160
So again, at the periphery are those ace in our structures.

174
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:10,550
And then if I were to take a slice through the middle of this thing, right, and look at it from the top down.

175
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,640
So Matt and I did that and put it here. This is what it would look like as a two dimensional structure.

176
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,010
You're getting my information, sir. And this is actually a pig liver.

177
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,110
So here you can almost see I mean, it's not as perfect as a cartoon, but you can see these kind of lines.

178
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:34,049
That's connective tissue, that's fibrous connective tissue around the vascular structures and in the pig,

179
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,380
for whatever reason, those are really kind of prominent.

180
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:42,150
And this was the first species that we used to describe liver structure.

181
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:49,830
But in other species, those you just see the vascular profiles and they're not as obvious lines, okay, sets to the lobby level.

182
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,460
So now imagine here's my top down view.

183
00:17:53,850 --> 00:18:00,030
Imagine I take a thin slice here and let's look at that in terms of the cellular organization.

184
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:06,270
All right. So this is what that thin slice might look like in terms of cellular organization.

185
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:17,400
Okay. So over at the right hand side, I have my portal triad and it's called a portal triad because there are three main structures.

186
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,000
There's a vineyard emanating from the portal vein system.

187
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,200
So it's the portal. Daniel That's the intestinal blood, the substrate blood.

188
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:31,110
There is a hepatic arterial which is a small branch, ultimately from the hepatic arteries.

189
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:34,590
That's my oxygenated blood. And then there's a bile duct jewel.

190
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,570
And that's kind of the end point of where all the bile is pooling.

191
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:47,310
So these two vascular structures are going to ultimately merge together into a vascular structure called a sinusoidal,

192
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:51,990
which is like a small capillary that flows between the cords of hepatocytes.

193
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,570
And all these little square things are hepatocytes. They're kind of a roughly cuboid type of epithelium.

194
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:03,780
Okay? And then that blood is going to pull together and end up in the central thing.

195
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,179
So this gives us our zone.

196
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:13,860
So zone one is nearest the portal, the portal triad.

197
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,799
Sometimes we call that a Perry ace and our location or a parent portal location zone two or the

198
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:25,290
middle zonal area is kind of medium oxygenation and zone three near the central vein is low oxygen.

199
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:33,060
So this is our direction of blood flow. And in the meantime, so there are there are our hepatocytes.

200
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:41,540
The hepatocytes are making bile which is just oozing into the space between hepatocyte cause and flowing towards the bile duct jaw.

201
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:48,780
So blood and bile flow are opposite in the liver. And then there's our oxygen gradient, our oxygen concentration.

202
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:55,450
Okay. So what does the what do these structures look like?

203
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,020
Histologically How can we recognize a portal triad versus a central theme?

204
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,740
So there's our cartoon again and here's the actual structure.

205
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,220
This is from a mouse liver looking at a portal triad.

206
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,840
And these can be different sizes in the liver, depending on where. Remember, it's like a tree.

207
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,530
So as they are kind of closer to the stem of a tree, trees.

208
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,690
We have more of a trunk, don't they?

209
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:22,630
As it gets closer to the trunk, it's going to be larger profile or have smaller ones and the smaller areas of the labial.

210
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:27,610
But basically the portal vein is usually the largest structure in the portal triad.

211
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,670
It's a thin, smooth muscle wall, so it can potentially be collapsed if you're looking at it, you know,

212
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:40,130
post mortem because it doesn't have a lot of pressure in the system, but it's a thin, smooth muscle wall and maybe partially collapsed.

213
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,770
Usually the largest structure, the hepatic artery on the other end is a much other hand has a much thicker,

214
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:50,290
smooth muscle wall, but it's usually much smaller. It may or may not.

215
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:56,920
It usually doesn't have much blood in it compared to the portal vein. But here's the hepatic artery and it can be almost hard to recognize.

216
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,900
But these are smooth muscle cells around it and little endothelial cells of the inside.

217
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,000
And depending on where you're looking, you might have a couple like a few of these, but there shouldn't be too many.

218
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:13,140
So depending on that pathologic state, so that's hepatic artery, thicker, smooth muscle wall, smaller profile.

219
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,460
And then the things that are lined by cuboid epithelium are the bile duct channels.

220
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:26,800
Okay? And you can sometimes have multiple of those if there is too many that can be indicative of a pathologic condition.

221
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:30,880
But those are the three basic structures. Okay.

222
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:39,670
You might notice if you're looking carefully that there are some other structures here like these, these I don't talk about too much.

223
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:47,080
These are actually lymphatics. So everywhere where you have a hepatic or you have an artery in a vein, there's usually a lymphatic,

224
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:57,909
which is a endothelial line structure that collects extracellular fluid pool that and brings it back first

225
00:21:57,910 --> 00:22:03,040
to the lymph node and eventually through something called the thoracic duct back to the circulation.

226
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:10,780
So it's sort of a thin walled endothelial lining system that parallels the vasculature.

227
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:19,600
It doesn't have blood in it, but its role is to reabsorb fluid, extracellular fluid from the tissue and bring it back ultimately to the circulation.

228
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,079
Okay. On the way it passes through lymph nodes.

229
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:29,050
So it's also a major source for antigen presenting cells to present antigen, you know, in the immune system.

230
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,730
But these are lymphatics.

231
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:38,020
They're not really considered part of the portal triad in terms of of important functional structures, but they're always there.

232
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:43,600
And a lot of times if they're not, you know, a lot of times they're collapse.

233
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:49,090
You don't really notice them. So I just mentioned them because they are there, in case you're wondering what those structures are.

234
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:54,160
But from the standpoint of this class, for the most part, we're usually going to be talking about these three other structures.

235
00:22:54,670 --> 00:23:02,410
Okay. So I want to try out three things. Central vein, on the other hand, has one structure and there it is at higher magnification.

236
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:08,230
Looks like the portal vein, but you'll know that it's the central bank that doesn't have anything else around it.

237
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:19,389
Okay, that's so vain. Thin walled, thin, smooth muscle. And then this image shows you that at low magnification you can already get the sense you

238
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:23,910
can orient yourself in the liver because there you see something that's one structure.

239
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:29,410
So, you know, that's the middle right of the globule. And then at the edge of it here is like a bunch of structures.

240
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,899
So here's the essence. So this is a mouse liver.

241
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,100
It doesn't have as much connective tissue as a pig.

242
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,850
But here is another structure with a lot of things that one's really hard to see because I saw bile duct still there,

243
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:46,990
but you can kind of get the sense here's my hexagon, right?

244
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:51,940
So the central main is easy visually, you know, that there's sort of a lot of structure around that.

245
00:23:52,780 --> 00:24:01,570
Okay. So that can be important to orient yourself and will be important when we think about where pathology is located in the liver.

246
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:06,490
Okay, so what about bile secretion? Here's a little diagram again.

247
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:09,820
We already talked about the blood flow.

248
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:19,600
I told you that the hepatocytes make bile. So there is a picture of our hepatocytes and show a little green dot between them.

249
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,970
So when the hepatocytes make bile, they actually excrete it into a small space.

250
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:30,550
Well, it does not line by separate cell or anything. It's just a space between the adjacent hepatocytes.

251
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,490
And that's called the bile panel. Nicholas Or the kind of like look at them in plural.

252
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,709
And then those are going to kind of pull to a common structure.

253
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:44,940
But there's no nothing. The line here, there's no vascular structure, anything.

254
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:49,550
It's just space between hepatocytes. And eventually it makes its way to the bile duct.

255
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:58,070
The. Donald Duck. Jaws is our line by biliary epithelium and those are from the same tissue stem cells as hepatocytes.

256
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,000
So essentially the bile duct channels are just a continuation, right, of this row of hepatocytes.

257
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:10,760
And right at the junction of these two types of cells, typically there are tissue stem cells there.

258
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:17,420
So the same tissue stem cells can differentiate and either go to form the biliary epithelium or the hypothesis.

259
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:24,920
Okay. So essentially we have nice cord of cells secreting bile and it all accumulates here and enters the filter system.

260
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:32,070
Okay. Secretion, here's an electron micrograph of that little bile calculus.

261
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:38,400
And essentially this is one hepatocyte and the cell wall of it on the side, and that's the other one over there.

262
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,820
So these are tight junctions of the cells are closely attached.

263
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:49,650
And then the space in the middle with these little cellular projections, this is the biochemicals that's just excreting into a space between cells.

264
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,170
Anytime. All right.

265
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:58,680
So we did Oregon blood flow to Oregon.

266
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:05,180
We talked about how the lobular looks. Talked about the structures that low magnification, central vein versus portal triad.

267
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:10,980
Talk about everything was organized. What are the constituent cells within the liver and what do they look like?

268
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:15,360
So the hepatocytes obviously are the liver epithelium.

269
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:19,680
So this is the parenchyma or the functional main cell type of the liver.

270
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,580
They make up some 60% of cells by cell number, but because they're relatively large, they make up about 80% of the liver volume.

271
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:39,250
And because they have a large functional demand, as we talked about at the beginning, they are rich in many organelles, including mitochondria,

272
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:49,680
which have energy production, but also smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which as we'll see, is the site of some of our phase one metabolizing enzymes.

273
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:58,710
Also, they have a lot of rough air and Golgi Golgi apparatus which pertain to their role in protein synthesis and metabolism.

274
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:08,720
Okay, so hepatocytes got a cuboid epithelial cell, but a little bit more or less kind of very defined cuboid of sort of more polygonal, I guess.

275
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:14,370
Usually they have a pretty large cytoplasm, but also a pretty good sized nucleus.

276
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,400
And the nucleus is usually pretty speckled, pretty heterochromatin,

277
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:24,959
because there are different areas of it active and inactive at most times that the parasite's biliary epithelium is very similar.

278
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,970
Remember same origin cell but has a little bit less epithelium.

279
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,690
It's going to be located predominantly in those portal triad areas.

280
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,760
Well, that smaller cell cuboid, a little bit less cytoplasm,

281
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:49,530
the endothelium are the cells that line the capillary structures or the sinusoidal between the hepatocytes.

282
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:57,389
So in that cartoon that I showed you between the cords of the parasites, there's a vascular structure that's lined by endothelium.

283
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:00,540
So simple squamous epithelium, just like we talked about before.

284
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:05,400
In the liver, though, the endothelial cells are kind of always a little bit leaky.

285
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,190
So we talked about how endothelium can become leaky when there's inflammation in the liver.

286
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,979
The endothelial cells are always a little bit leaky.

287
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:21,180
It's a fenestration epithelium and that facilitates absorption of nutrients from the blood so that easier for things to get through,

288
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,570
easier for things to flow into the endothelium as it's modified.

289
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:32,880
But it does leave the liver vulnerable to toxicants, to microbes that might be floating up from the gut.

290
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:39,780
So it's a little bit of a sign of vulnerability. So as we'll see the next cell are going to talk about showing in the next page,

291
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:49,530
it needs to have an innate immune cell kind of hovering around to protect the liver in case like a bacteria or something and gets

292
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:55,080
the bacteria or something comes up from the gut or in case there's particular material that should not be entering the cells.

293
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:02,430
So there are resident macrophages, clean up cells in the body and the cells that are some of those first responders.

294
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:07,350
Remember we talked about in acute phase of inflammation, we have onsite first responders.

295
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:12,509
So the liver has a number of resident macrophages in the vicinity and they have their own special name,

296
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,610
which are Cooper cells, but really they're just tissue resident macrophages.

297
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,820
So those are group four cells.

298
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:25,769
And then there are some other cells that are located in a virtual space between the liver, between the hepatocyte and the sinusoidal.

299
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,800
And they're important in repair. I'll talk about those in just a second.

300
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:33,370
But let's look at the Cooper cells, which are the resident macrophages of the liver.

301
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:43,830
So again, here's my hepatocyte cord. Here's my little blobby looking green, kind of like does this kind of space at the bottom is the sinusoidal.

302
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,580
So this is the vascular space. Remember where all that blood is kind of pooling.

303
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:52,770
These black pink cells are the endothelial cells lining the vascular space.

304
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,910
Okay? And they're they're drawing them in their little holes. They're leaking. Here they are.

305
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:03,360
And then the Cooper cells, the resident macrophages, actually crawl like little aliens or something.

306
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:07,650
They crawl along inside of that sinusoidal space.

307
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:13,560
Okay, so they're in the vascular space just kind of crawling though along the endothelium.

308
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:18,780
And that's an important that's a good place for them to be because this is going to be the site of vulnerability.

309
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,170
Right? The bacteria from the gut are ascending to the liver.

310
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,820
So that's the cartoon here is the actual histologic picture.

311
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,260
So it's obviously never as pretty as in the cartoon. But here is one cord.

312
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:39,930
This is a sinusoidal space and drawing along and there's a Cooper cell, Cooper cells, phagocytosis, almost everything.

313
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,560
And so a lot of times they'll end up with pigment in their cytoplasm.

314
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:50,400
So depending on what they phagocytosis. So this is one that has a lot of yellowish pigment, could be white perfusion.

315
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,760
That could be maybe some human. CITRIN Could be something from or what have you.

316
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:59,300
But anyway, sometimes the Cooper cells have a little bit of yellowish pigment,

317
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:04,460
but you them because they they're large, they have a lot of cytoplasm and they're in that sinusoidal space.

318
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,380
COOPER Cells are macrophages.

319
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,930
This is the other cell type of importance here. I walk over to my diagram again.

320
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:23,480
So here's the same diagram. Here's my endothelial cells, here's the vascular space, and then here's the hepatocyte.

321
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:33,290
This is a virtual space. I mean, it's drawn big in this little cartoon, but this is a virtual space between the endothelium and the hepatocytes.

322
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:41,630
It's called the Space Odyssey. I don't know who to say was, but the space is named after, so space of to say.

323
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:51,040
And then this cell also looks kind of like an alien. But this cell is crawling along or situated in the space of to say this is the satellite cell.

324
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:59,870
Satellite like a star or Ito's cell. So all the names that are correct, probably satellite is more preferred now.

325
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:06,380
This is a cell that in its quiescent state stores, vitamin A, which is a fat soluble vitamin.

326
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:12,170
So the cell looks kind of like an ADIPOCYTE. So when it's not active, it's almost hard to even tell.

327
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:17,090
It's there. It has a nucleus that's pushed off to the side and they'll just look like a little fat.

328
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:21,220
Vacuole just kind of randomly situated so you can get special stain out.

329
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,740
But this is a solid cell cell itself, still itself.

330
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,870
So when nothing's going on, you almost ignore them with your eye because they're just so nondescript.

331
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:36,980
But if the liver undergoes damage, these cells become activated and act like fibroblasts.

332
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:45,590
They differentiate. They start to produce collagen, and they actually serve the role of fibroblasts in that scarring or that fibrosis function.

333
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,909
So they're very important in conditions like cirrhosis,

334
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:56,660
where you have a lot of scarring in the liver and they're responsible for some of that called excess collagen effect.

335
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:05,750
And I think I drew in here. So this is just an example of one that's less activated in the very clear cytoplasm because of all the fat.

336
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:17,420
So stellate cells. And then finally, I already told you a little bit about the oval cells, which are the hepatic biliary stem cells.

337
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:21,139
And the cartoon is a little bit easiest to understand where they are, because,

338
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:25,880
again, if nothing's going on, you can't really see them unless you special stain.

339
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,890
But this is the cord of hepatocytes.

340
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:36,530
These are the this is the bile duct, the differentiated biliary epithelium and the oval cells there in kind of a virtual or virtual,

341
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:41,630
but a connecting space called the canals of. And essentially, that's the site of all the cells.

342
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:47,390
So there are quiescent cells there that don't divide unless there's a stimulus.

343
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:51,740
So in their resting state, they're undifferentiated tissues themselves.

344
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,220
They're situated near the portal triads at that junction.

345
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:01,520
And they're usually in a parent unless they're proliferating, which they do in response to severe injury.

346
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:09,710
So remember we said in the liver, the liver has two choices where the cells can proliferate,

347
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,060
a mature cell can reenter the cell cycle and proliferate in the face of damage.

348
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,880
Or if you have more damage than can be accommodated by that, you can have differentiation of tissue stem cells.

349
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:25,850
Okay, so these are the oval cells. When they are proliferating, you can start to see a lot of them in that area.

350
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:35,540
And so you'll start to see other cells that you can't quite slot as hepatocytes or as biliary epithelium and kind of the visual that people tell you,

351
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:40,430
which depends whether it works for you or not, is that it looks like a train track.

352
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,870
So allegedly, these little oblong cells kind of like a train track.

353
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:55,130
See that, right? Squint a little bit. So those are oval cells and they're not going to be visually obvious unless there is a stimulus.

354
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:59,870
And later, I'm going to show you kind of some examples of that. Okay.

355
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:04,220
So this is kind of that same cartoon, but adding in those other two cells we talked about.

356
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:08,330
So here's our sinusoidal space. Here's our four cell crawling along the inside of that.

357
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:15,260
That's our first responder cell. Here's our satellite cell, which they've drama blue, yellow, fat droplets, which cool.

358
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:26,300
In that virtual space, the space of to say and then this is just showing you the name of that space where the Ito cells are located.

359
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:35,240
All right. So that's kind of the big picture of how the liver is structured and that blood flow.

360
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:40,610
So the blood flow relates to its role in metabolizing portal blood.

361
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:46,490
The portal blood is coming up from the intestine, and that's going to be the substrate plate upon which the liver works.

362
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,330
Another function liver, obviously, is detoxification is.

363
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:53,990
You know, biotics and endogenous toxins. So we'll talk about that now.

364
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,270
So this is something, I'm sure, at least from your talks courses you've had before.

365
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:03,020
But in terms of a basic xeno biotic metabolism overview,

366
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:09,829
if you consider substances that are lipophilic in general, those are less reactive and poorly soluble.

367
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,590
So they pose a problem for excretion from the body.

368
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:23,690
So one role of metabolite or one way of dealing with them is to utilize enzymes that are considered phase one or functional izing enzymes.

369
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:34,340
And usually this involves reaction, oxidative reactions or hydrolysis reduction reactions that have the function of exposing polar groups.

370
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:40,190
Okay. So it's taking something that's hydrophobic or lipophilic and poorly soluble and

371
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:45,260
exposing polar groups on the substance to make it a highly reactive intermediate.

372
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:54,170
Okay. So now it's an electric file. It wants to combine with something and hopefully that's not going to be something damaging to the cell.

373
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:58,340
But one thing that the body can do is use a conjugating enzyme.

374
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:09,950
So phase two metabolizing enzyme like a cell transferase found something like that to add on a soluble subgroup to that area of reactivity.

375
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:14,060
Okay. So that is a phase two or a conjugation reaction.

376
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:19,310
So phase two enzymes fall into that category. So that's a broad overview.

377
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,590
And then the effect of that is to make substances more soluble so that they can be eliminated.

378
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,360
Usually when we're talking about the liver via the urinary system.

379
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:34,700
So usually they're going to enter the blood and travel to the kidney and exit through the urinary system.

380
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:38,569
Or potentially you could have substances that are secreted in the bile like

381
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:44,300
a lot of glutathione conjugates are secreted in bile and exit via the bile.

382
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:51,430
So that's kind of the chemical view of what happens.

383
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,820
Remember that in real life, even though we call it phase one and phase two, not all substances go sequentially through both.

384
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:03,980
You can have substances that already have sites that are amenable to conjugation.

385
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,090
So they don't require any phase one metabolism at all. They're just conjugated to something.

386
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:16,130
You can have substances where if it's a drug, you need to have phase one metabolism in order to make it active.

387
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:21,230
So they are phase one metabolism actually activating a compound and then it combines with something in the body.

388
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:29,420
Alternatively, you can have a drug that's inactivated by phase one capitalism, and either of those are are amenable to conjugation.

389
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:34,370
Or you can have substances that require neither and can be excreted unchanged.

390
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:41,410
Okay. So remember, even though we call it phase one or phase two, just understand that that's talking about that chemical diagram.

391
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:46,760
It doesn't necessarily mean that everything follows that pathway in terms of the liver.

392
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,940
The liver has many abiotic metabolizing enzymes.

393
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:59,420
As far as phase one enzymes, the two most common in the liver are cytochrome p450 is or flavin containing mono oxygen cases.

394
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,920
So when we talk about phase one enzymes in the liver, most of the time we're talking about cytochrome p450,

395
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:10,850
but there are a number of other ones and then there are also a large number of conjugating enzymes in the liver.

396
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:18,020
So let's look at so from Q4, 50, very important enzyme for toxicology.

397
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:21,890
So this is a molecule that has a core of him.

398
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:32,960
So very similar structure to hemoglobin and heme has an iron center iron three plus that can bind oxygen to be an enzyme enzyme that binds oxygen.

399
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:38,330
And then in cytochrome p450, this structure is bound to an amino acid chain.

400
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:43,580
Okay. This is not just one enzyme type.

401
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:49,310
This is essentially a superfamily that consists of more than 50 families in subfamilies.

402
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,800
And the three.

403
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:58,490
So when you look at the the way this is drawn, you might remember the family is the first number and then there's a subfamily and then a gene number.

404
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:02,570
So there are different isoforms within each family.

405
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:08,150
So the three main cytochrome p450 metabolizing families and humans are cytochrome.

406
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,460
All right. So one, two and three.

407
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:17,000
And then within each of those categories, there are different isoforms, and different people have varying proportions of each.

408
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:28,430
Okay. So for clinically utilized drugs, a lot of times we'll know which one of those families is most involved in its metabolism.

409
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:33,740
So that can relate to the amino acid chain that's found and how well the enzyme binds the drug.

410
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:41,930
And then further, we can also know that which isoform or which subfamily or which gene is most effective at metabolizing a drug.

411
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:53,120
So as you can imagine, your particular composition of cytochrome p450 isoforms has a lot to do with how efficiently you metabolize a drug,

412
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:58,550
which can either mean that it's more effective for you, like if it's a drug that needs to be activated to function.

413
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:04,550
Or it can mean that that drug has a really short half life because you're metabolizing it really quickly and excreting it.

414
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:10,640
So that can underlie a lot of the variability in individual response to drugs.

415
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:19,150
Yes there is. So cytochrome p450 is are enzymes that can bind to many different substrates.

416
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,720
They don't tend to be super specific. It's not like one isoform, one drug type of thing.

417
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:34,219
So there's broad overlapping, substrate binding and kind of a downside to that is that predisposes these isoforms to competitive inhibition, right?

418
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:39,320
So that happens with drug interactions when we're taking a particular drug that's metabolized

419
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:45,650
through a cytochrome cytochrome isoform and then another drug that should be metabolized that way.

420
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,889
But you've already saturated all the activity. Okay,

421
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:56,780
so you can have competitive inhibition or drug to drug interactions and that can again have an effect on the half life or the activity of a problem.

422
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,480
And then further cytochrome p450 is our transcriptional regulator typically.

423
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:09,469
So they're relatively easily induced or inhibited. So if you have a high demand in the liver for phase one metabolism,

424
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:16,940
the parasites are going to ramp up production of cytochrome p450 and you're going to have expansion actually of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum,

425
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:22,940
which is where these compound, these isoforms live and hepatocyte is going to get a little larger as it gets more active.

426
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:31,049
So the site is just kind of an overview of what we just talked about that different frequencies or

427
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:38,280
different prevalence is of particular cytochrome p450 isoforms can affect your response to a drug,

428
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:45,570
can affect your ability to either benefit from the drug if you're looking for drug activity or your ability to eliminate it.

429
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,239
So there's a lot of when you're trying to understand how a drug is metabolized,

430
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,120
this is important to know on how effective it will be for a patient and also for interspecies differences.

431
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,110
This is a slide that's over reviewing where in the cell these compounds are located.

432
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:14,040
So the top diagram is showing you it's not a huge fan of this diagram, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which is the location for most CYP complexes.

433
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:18,240
This diagram kind of makes it look like the rough air that puts these little bumps on it,

434
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,020
but they're actually shown to be oxidase reductase complexes so the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the major site for

435
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:36,120
P450 is in the liver and p450 is are usually found in combination with or as a as a combination of protein structures.

436
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:44,580
So there's an any any CYP 450 reductase that passes electrons to the active portion of the molecule,

437
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:51,500
which is the actual portion that oxidizes substances. So smooth and a plasma reticulum main site.

438
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:56,110
So that's in the cell. We're in the liver.

439
00:43:56,120 --> 00:44:00,290
Is that most likely to happen? So we already talked about our oxygen.

440
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:04,549
Great. And we said that oxygen is highest in zone one p450.

441
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:14,390
Content in contrast is actually highest in the zone three hypothesis of a higher concentration of cyp3a4 fives

442
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:22,730
in the smoothie are of hepatocytes and that zone three area conjugating enzymes obviously will go backwards,

443
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:31,550
but conjugating enzymes are actually higher concentration particular for the defilement closer to the portal zone.

444
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:42,080
So it's on one. Okay. So that's great in terms of being able to act as an antioxidant for things that are coming up through the portal, try it.

445
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:47,210
It's also helpful because you have a lot of oxygen concentration here so it can help with reactive oxygen species.

446
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:51,860
But can you think of a vulnerability for the liver in terms of zero biotics?

447
00:44:52,850 --> 00:44:57,710
So what area of the liver do we commonly seen necrosis or cell damage?

448
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:05,640
What would you think with this? What zone and why.

449
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:18,660
What do phase one enzymes do? We think we'll do phase one enzymes do that we just talked about 90 seconds ago.

450
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:22,160
They make the molecules. Yeah, they make molecules more reactive.

451
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:32,240
So if we have a compound that requires activation for its toxicity, this is going to be an area of vulnerability.

452
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:38,629
And like, if I'm in a cell, what can I do? If I have phase one metabolism, it's functionalized.

453
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:43,610
Now I have this electrode file rolling around ready to bind to my DNA or proteins.

454
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:52,260
So like what would the cell do to counter that? What would the South do to counter that?

455
00:45:52,290 --> 00:46:01,050
What's the next step in metabolism? Conjugating right conjugating and then so ideally you just conjugate it and then excrete it.

456
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,160
But because we have a dearth of those enzymes here very quickly,

457
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:11,670
if you have a high biotic load, zone three in the liver is highly vulnerable to toxic injury.

458
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:18,660
Okay, so zone three necrosis, if you see that in the liver, one potential explanation.

459
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,870
I mean, you can't see the drugs in your eyes, but one potential explanation,

460
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:27,690
knowing this functional aspect of the liver is toxicant related injury like oxidative damage.

461
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:35,820
What's another vulnerability of those zone three hepatocytes in terms of something that could cause some damage?

462
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:42,010
Looking at the side. Has to do with a gradient.

463
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:48,190
What do you think we're. Well, oxygen cells to utilize for.

464
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:53,560
Exactly. So hypoxia. Right. You know, whether it maybe a vascular disease or something.

465
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:59,139
And everybody's kind of low. This is the area already that's at a dearth of oxygen.

466
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:03,510
So anything that that compounds that hypoxia. This is also the area of the liver.

467
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,200
We have first start to see hypoxic injury. So a lot happens in zone three.

468
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:16,270
So we'll talk about that a bit more next week. In Zone one, there are different vulnerabilities.

469
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:21,580
Zone one is vulnerable to toxicants that don't require metabolism for their activity.

470
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:25,540
So like heavy metals actually often hit zone one.

471
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:28,780
As far as if they're ingested, there's ingestion exposure.

472
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:33,730
Zone one is where they tend to accumulate highest, accumulate in the nucleus, accumulate in the cell.

473
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:43,150
So the organization of the liver and where these enzymes are located can kind of relate and give you a clue.

474
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:48,490
When you're looking at the liver, you're seeing damage. Can I help you figure out what might be a potential cause?

475
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:54,310
Okay, so it's great. It's important to know of my time. All right.

476
00:47:54,310 --> 00:48:00,940
Let's watch this part. Okay. So there is kind of the overview slide with all our different gradients are two structures.

477
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:05,560
Recognize the thing with three stuff, one single so you can recognize it a little magnification.

478
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,020
Understanding zones. Understanding the blood flow versus blood flow.

479
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,820
So your overview slide. Okay.

480
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:17,560
So let's see if we can just do the bio one before we take our little break.

481
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:25,360
So that's kind of overview organization, the liver in terms of its relationship to blood flow and to detoxifying enzymes.

482
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:29,230
What about its other function of bile acid formation and excretion?

483
00:48:30,130 --> 00:48:33,450
So bile function. Bile functions.

484
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:36,460
The two main ones are to emulsify lipids.

485
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:45,940
So as biles excreted into the intestine, it's going to break up lipids into smaller kind of microns, which are going to make it easier to digest.

486
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:55,299
I have here kind of the picture of a large amount of bile being extruded from the end of the common bile duct into the duodenum,

487
00:48:55,300 --> 00:49:00,520
which is the upper portion of the intestine. So bile functions to emulsify lipids.

488
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:04,960
It also is excreted into the intestine, just past the stomach.

489
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,370
You might know or remember that the stomach has a very acidic page.

490
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:13,060
It does that for a reason. As part of digestion, the stomach.

491
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:18,580
But that can be damaging to tissue. And so once you enter the intestine, you want to buffer that.

492
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:27,070
You get back to a neutral value. And bile actually acts as a buffer and brings the page of the duodenum, the small intestine, closer to seven.

493
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,569
And then finally,

494
00:49:28,570 --> 00:49:40,360
bile is also kind of a highway where it's important for the excretion of metabolism or metabolites or other aspects of sort of body turnover.

495
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:48,220
So bilirubin, which is the end product of hemoglobin metabolism, so that's involved in red cell turnover,

496
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:52,960
cholesterol is excreted in bile and other metabolites are excreted in bile.

497
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:58,570
And then, of course, toxins, particularly those that are conjugated to things like Good Gouda final.

498
00:49:59,470 --> 00:50:05,050
Okay, so those are its functions. Here is kind of a list of the many components of bile.

499
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:13,050
I kind of underline the ones that are most important for us in this course, but those are that's some of the functions of bile.

500
00:50:14,170 --> 00:50:20,020
And then this is how it kind of works in a big picture in terms of entero, biliary circulation.

501
00:50:21,550 --> 00:50:28,630
So primary bile acids are made in hepatocytes in the liver and they have a pathway where they're made from cholesterol.

502
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:32,860
So you're making a bile acid and typically it's first and conjugated.

503
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:37,540
So that makes it a little bit less soluble. That makes a little bit harder to excrete.

504
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:47,380
So in order to excrete bile acids, they are typically conjugated in the liver, the primary bile acids, two amino acids, usually taurine or glycine.

505
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:51,790
So those are conjugated bile acids, bile acid and an amino acid.

506
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:58,030
And together those are referred to as bile salts. So it's going to get excreted from the liver.

507
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:07,900
It can sit in the gallbladder for a while, but ultimately exit the belly, retrieve the other common bile duct into the proximal small intestine.

508
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:11,860
So this one is the first portion of the small intestine. Pass the stomach.

509
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:16,720
Here comes the bile. It's going to do its two major functions there of emulsifying, fats and buffering.

510
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:22,690
So now we have bile present and then something interesting happens.

511
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:27,660
So this is an energy heavy process.

512
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:33,820
So the liver doesn't want to have to keep conjugating these bile acids all the time and making the bottles energy demanding process.

513
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:44,080
So what's kind of a recycling system that can reuse components of those bile salts, gut bacteria and the distal small intestine can form?

514
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:50,319
So a couple of things happen. Gut bacteria and the distal small intestine can act on those primary bile acids to form

515
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:55,120
secondary bile acids so they can take off hydroxyl groups that can D conjugate them.

516
00:51:55,690 --> 00:52:02,680
And the bacteria do that for their own benefit because that helps them utilize components of the bile or the bile acids for their metabolism.

517
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:10,500
And then some proportion of those secondary bile acids or of unaltered primary bile acid.

518
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:18,410
So just the total bile acid pool, a large proportion of those are actually reabsorbed in the distal small intestine.

519
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:23,710
So in the ilium, which is just before the large intestine, and those are trafficked in the blood back to the liver.

520
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:30,829
Okay. So that's the liver recycling before it gets excreted, recycling the important components back to the liver.

521
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:33,910
So that works out great from the standpoint of recycling.

522
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:39,110
But evolutionarily, the liver didn't realize it was going to have to deal with so many with zero biotics.

523
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:41,800
So that has a downside in some instances.

524
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:50,260
If you have a tightly bound xeno biotic because that internal biliary circulation can mean that the xeno biotic persists in the body longer.

525
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:57,710
Okay, so if you have a bile. Excreted xeno biotic attached to a bile salt or bile acid, I should say that's reabsorbed.

526
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:06,290
That can increase the half life of that component. That's a common means by which heavy metals actually persist in the body longer term.

527
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:09,770
So that can be a problem from a toxicology standpoint.

528
00:53:10,670 --> 00:53:18,700
Did you have a question? Yeah, I'm coming to one. So at what point is the portal vein from the intestines go into the liver?

529
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:22,460
And is that before or after the bile comes back through the liver?

530
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:27,980
And if so, after how to develop it back in the liver through a vein system.

531
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:35,390
So the first part, you said, at what point does the portal blood from the intestine get to the liver for filtration?

532
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:41,389
Okay. So all of the so there's small blood vessels lining the intestines.

533
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:49,340
That's like the capillary system. All of the blood from the intestine ultimately pulls to the portal vein.

534
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,060
So the portal than being the trunk like an upside down tree, the trunk of the tree.

535
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,059
So there are smaller branches lining the entire intestines.

536
00:53:56,060 --> 00:54:00,800
So anywhere this all happens, it's going to go to the portal vein and get to the liver with that.

537
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:05,530
Does that that's your question? Yeah, that's the first part. And where does the bile come back through?

538
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:10,920
Does it go through that, um, that root system the same way the yeah.

539
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,659
The in terms of reabsorption, yes. Same system.

540
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:18,889
So it's just going to get absorbed just like nutrients would. So it's all through the same system.

541
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:26,870
So it's coming back in through the portal, blood entering the candlestick alive, and the hepatocytes will just snap up what they want from it.

542
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:30,200
And the whole thing starts again.

543
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:37,910
One point to that. So there are have you guys heard of portal shunts for systemic shows?

544
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:47,180
So there are genetic or congenital anomalies where people have a poorly formed portal vein system or sometimes you can have an acquired version of it.

545
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:56,930
In that case, the portal blood from the intestine can bypass fully or partially the liver and go directly to the vena cava back to the heart,

546
00:54:56,930 --> 00:55:05,089
which is a bad situation. So animals or people who have congenital portal systemic shunting usually are very small and

547
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:09,110
stunted because they're impaired in some of the nutrient metabolism that should take place.

548
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:14,180
And they're highly vulnerable to toxicants because it bypasses that normal system.

549
00:55:14,630 --> 00:55:18,830
So we'll get that port, that pathology. It's sort of related to the way the structure is supposed to work.

550
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:24,229
Okay. So the vast majority of bile acids are in fact reabsorbed and go to the liver.

551
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:28,340
I said that contributes to the increased half life of some xeno biotics,

552
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:37,430
but only 10% or so of bile acids are actually excreted via the feces, and that can also have some effect on pathology.

553
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,810
So it's more of a kind of looking at the chemistry of bile acid formation,

554
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:53,690
looking at primary bile acids at the top and how those can be metabolized by dehydrated solution of back by bacteria into secondary bile acids.

555
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:58,250
So these are secondary bile acids. So that can happen in the distal intestine.

556
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:07,430
If these secondary bile acids get to the colon, these two substances themselves are carcinogenic to colonic epithelium.

557
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:16,700
So if they remain in the colon for long periods of time and are absorbed by colonic epithelium, that can potentially contribute to carcinogenesis.

558
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:24,830
So depending on the type of bacteria you have in your intestine and how well they d conjugate.

559
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:30,680
So if you have bacteria that produce more of these, right, that's a carcinogenesis risk factor.

560
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:37,190
And this is part of the importance of staying regular retention time.

561
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:46,370
So fiber, we know fiber promotes fiber promotes excretion in the colon, low fiber diet,

562
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:52,580
you have longer retention time, both of digest and also of these secondary bile acids.

563
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:56,480
And that also is a risk factor for carcinogenesis.

564
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:00,979
Okay. Okay.

565
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:07,220
So that was the interim biliary circulation. This is just a word about entero, biliary interactions.

566
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:16,740
So as we were just talking about bile acids, get reabsorbed via the portal system, goes back to the liver and then bile itself can actually be.

567
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:23,060
So it's going to go back into the parasites. They're going to attach it to something else and gets excreted back into the can articular system.

568
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:27,650
The contents of bile can be modified so things can be absorbed.

569
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:35,480
Things can be excreted by receptors that are on the surfaces of either hepatocytes or biliary epithelium.

570
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:39,330
So this word collegial. So just a fancy word for biliary epithelium.

571
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:44,780
So some receptors on the surface of these cells have to do with uptake.

572
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,800
They might be pulling substances out of the bile. Others have to do with excretion.

573
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:55,640
So there are some that are related that are kind of suited to a large number of drug substrates for excretion into bile.

574
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,799
And the composition of those receptors on your individual hepatocytes or Pileggi

575
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:05,600
sites can influence things like how well you excrete drugs into the bile.

576
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,980
So you don't necessarily have to know.

577
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:14,780
You don't have to know these, like what all these stand for and know the particular function of these for the exam.

578
00:58:14,780 --> 00:58:24,830
No, though know, however, that there are receptors on hepatocytes and biliary epithelium that absorb or excrete material from bile.

579
00:58:25,370 --> 00:58:31,940
So the differential composition of those receptors can influence the composition of bile and your response to antibiotics.

580
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:40,339
So it's an active process and bile content gets modified depending on things like the receptor concentration,

581
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:44,600
which also can be induced or decreased in some ways.

582
00:58:45,290 --> 00:58:51,260
And that entero biliary receptor composition actually differs between humans and mice.

583
00:58:51,590 --> 00:59:01,160
Think of a higher magnification side of that. So that can also be a mediator for species related differences in the response to Xeno Biotics.

584
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:11,420
So for example, those multidrug receptors that I talked about that are related to excretion of certain but certain zero biotics in humans,

585
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:14,840
there is a higher level of expression of those on hepatocytes,

586
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:23,330
so humans are more able to secrete MDR substrate Zener biotics than mice who have very little of those particular isoforms.

587
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:30,080
So that can result in increased susceptibility of mouse hepatocytes to certain drugs.

588
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,860
And so that's a good thing to know of.

589
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:40,519
I'm testing as the antibiotic in a mouse and I know that it's excretion involves this isoform when I interpret my animal results,

590
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:44,040
if I see hepatocyte toxicity that might influence, you know,

591
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:48,710
how much weight I put on that in terms of the translated ability to human, does that make sense?

592
00:59:51,020 --> 00:59:55,160
All right. Let us take a tiny break there so I can have some water.

593
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:01,970
You guys can take a bale break and then we'll finish up liver and then I'll show you a couple of pretty pictures to end the session.

594
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:16,690
All right. So let's take a five minute break. With due diligence.

595
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:21,350
The recent point about registrations.

596
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:29,170
So as you know, supposed be going anywhere.

597
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,380
Yeah. And I still have.

598
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:40,519
Oh, yeah. Everything is okay.

599
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:46,840
Yeah. She's my business person is saying yes, she is lying to me.

600
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,919
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

601
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:56,590
I mean, they're just an example. Yeah.

602
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:05,280
Yeah. I learned a lot from you.

603
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:08,890
Oh, yes, I did that. Oh, yeah.

604
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:14,000
Yeah. And have tried to get more, but I like, just, you know.

605
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:21,770
Yeah, I maybe I could use yesterday, about Wednesday for now.

606
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:26,719
And you know, they are Elasticsearch, which is cool.

607
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:34,970
Yeah. Yeah. Don't hesitate to say this more like why not?

608
01:01:35,210 --> 01:01:38,800
Yeah, sure. But, yeah, you know, I.

609
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:45,510
I just. I think there are actually spiders extracted.

610
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:51,890
Yeah. Whenever they want to be. Yeah. Yeah. Because, you know, I have an assignment for yourself, but more than anything.

611
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:57,750
Yeah, yeah. No, it's easier. You feel like I have one?

612
01:01:57,840 --> 01:02:01,229
Yeah. I mean, it's not like our mean. Yeah, I know.

613
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:05,370
Like, it's hard to plan something, but so often we can actually see what happens.

614
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,920
Yeah. It's not like it was not the. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

615
01:02:09,930 --> 01:02:13,800
You're aware, like, idea of this kind of like whatever.

616
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:17,180
That is not what it really was. Yeah.

617
01:02:17,550 --> 01:02:29,220
Okay. Yeah. I do think it's a really good for families, like a real tradition in the past.

618
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:33,180
When you had the witnesses.

619
01:02:33,210 --> 01:02:36,910
Yeah. Or something. Yeah, it's. It's.

620
01:02:37,110 --> 01:02:41,490
It's weird. It's just something that is interesting.

621
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:48,780
So you can just look this up. They were very different to very many locations.

622
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:55,800
There's a lot of previous studies that are critical to U.S. cause,

623
01:02:57,390 --> 01:03:08,610
whereas such as like before and also like you can use it like, yeah, I can show you and all of that kind of stuff.

624
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:15,880
So every time like, you know, bigger and there's a lot more in like just added to your timetable I think it's even.

625
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:25,390
Because I usually do this basically in Excel. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

626
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:28,930
You travel that and you get directly linked to the Philippines.

627
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:32,280
It will be like an axis. And then you can just press.

628
01:03:32,690 --> 01:03:36,900
Yeah. I mean, this is like. Yeah.

629
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:45,120
Yeah. Yeah.

630
01:03:45,290 --> 01:03:49,250
Maybe I should probably freshen up on that. I'll make this.

631
01:03:49,670 --> 01:03:52,670
Okay, so. So I send out articles.

632
01:03:53,070 --> 01:03:57,280
Yeah, that's what I want you to feel like, you know?

633
01:03:57,570 --> 01:04:06,110
Yeah. Yeah. So that places like, with it's very sort of like in preparation for you.

634
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:10,190
You're. You have. Yeah.

635
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,880
Yeah, yeah. Is it different expectations?

636
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:27,000
Yes. Yes. There is a lot of people like how you get your Android based services.

637
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:38,690
And I fully support what he did. That has been a few times I've tried to sell like having like this for myself and really.

638
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:44,400
So these are all I would love to know what it's like having.

639
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:47,550
I think. I think.

640
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:56,920
Yeah, I think it's. Need help getting there.

641
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:07,360
Yeah, well, now, I mean, I after I got a question about the exam.

642
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:10,900
Okay, let me just say one thing.

643
01:05:11,230 --> 01:05:14,320
I think I want to buy you some food for this one.

644
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:21,880
I know. This is so great for you.

645
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:25,510
Yeah, this is very good.

646
01:05:25,910 --> 01:05:30,399
I agree. I think you can create that question.

647
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:35,770
You will be correct. Okay. Yes, yes, yes.

648
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:39,340
Okay. I yeah, I can do that.

649
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:44,010
Yeah. Yeah. The Yeah.

650
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:56,680
Year or but this semester of us manufacturing the area and I do, I, I do like cancer research all the time.

651
01:05:56,680 --> 01:06:02,990
So I. And does anyone through that recognize that?

652
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:10,570
All right, guys. Yeah, I'm going to pick it up again so that we can get out on time.

653
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:16,620
So it's like, so and so. Yeah, I was down.

654
01:06:17,350 --> 01:06:22,780
All right. Okay. Yeah. So I'm going to finish up with our discussion of liver functions.

655
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:32,950
So I put all these other one last one to talk about for our purposes is protein synthesis, which you've already kind of alluded to a little bit.

656
01:06:33,540 --> 01:06:41,020
Um, the liver, as I told you, has a large amount of rough endoplasmic reticulum as well as the smooth and the plastic reticulum.

657
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:46,210
The rough and the passive reticulum is important in its role as a protein synthesis factory.

658
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:51,520
Also, the Golgi apparatus, which modifies and packages some of the proteins,

659
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:59,440
basically divide it and divided it into four main categories of proteins that are made by the liver.

660
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:04,960
There are others, but these are four main ones of importance. So first coagulation factors.

661
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:09,700
So we kind of alluded to this a little bit when we talked about acute inflammation.

662
01:07:10,090 --> 01:07:18,040
We talked about how if a vessel is damaged, you know, if a vessels damaged and there's hemorrhage,

663
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:24,009
there's a process of clotting that involves an enzyme cascade and formation of fibrin cross links.

664
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:30,850
And that's essentially what a clot is. And that takes place through a series of enzymatic reactions on a substrate.

665
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:37,840
So first you have platelets come in and form a have a primary cognitive response which just agglomeration of platelets

666
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:45,700
to the area and that provides a substrate for subsequent enzymes to perform sequential reactions leading to fibrin,

667
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:50,830
clotting and many of the coagulation factors involved in this cascade.

668
01:07:50,980 --> 01:07:58,630
Almost all of them are made in the liver, as well as many of the proteins that are involved in dissolution of the clot.

669
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:07,210
Right. Because as we repair, eventually we have to remove that clot and that will allow for regeneration.

670
01:08:07,690 --> 01:08:10,210
Okay. So coagulation factors are made in the liver.

671
01:08:11,410 --> 01:08:17,800
So if you have liver failure, one potential sign of liver failure is actually increased tendency towards hemorrhage,

672
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:22,240
partly because of the failure or the decrease in the level of these coagulation factors.

673
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:31,240
Many carrier proteins for nutrients are made in the liver, which makes sense because as you absorb materials from the portal circulation,

674
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:33,340
if they're going to go out into the circulation,

675
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:39,850
many of them are best handled by a carrier protein that can help target them to their ultimate target tissue.

676
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:44,800
So those are things like albumin, which is kind of a great general purpose protein.

677
01:08:45,010 --> 01:08:50,620
It's a high molecular weight or a relatively high molecular weight, and that's bound to a large number of hormones.

678
01:08:51,610 --> 01:08:56,050
Things like Billy Rubin and albumin also binds many heavy metals and drugs.

679
01:08:56,890 --> 01:09:01,780
So albumin is one have to globin is involved in binding hemoglobin.

680
01:09:01,780 --> 01:09:09,220
So again when you have breakdown of red cells have to globin is involved in the transport of hemoglobin from those broken down red cells.

681
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:17,050
TRANSFERRIN is a really important one. Transferrin actually is also involved in in the acute phase response.

682
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:24,250
It's related to iron transporter port and it can actually bring iron to locations like the bone marrow.

683
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:30,100
Remember we talked about how iron can get sequestered if you're in the presence of an infection,

684
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:33,579
for example, because microbes can utilize iron to grow.

685
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:42,100
So one strategy for the body in face of an infection is actually to sequester iron, to kind of protect access from microbes.

686
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:46,000
So anyway, so carrier proteins are made by the liver.

687
01:09:46,270 --> 01:09:53,080
And again, if liver function is decreased, this can impact your ability to transport these substances around the body.

688
01:09:55,540 --> 01:10:03,579
Acute phase proteins, which I talked about, are proteins involved in transport of materials around the body or proteins that

689
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:08,380
are involved or upregulated or downregulated in the acute inflammatory response.

690
01:10:08,890 --> 01:10:15,610
So albumin, major carrier, protein and transparent actually get downregulated liver.

691
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:23,349
So that promotes sequestration of iron and also decreases the liver's ability to mobilize other nutrients and components around the

692
01:10:23,350 --> 01:10:30,610
body because the liver is busy making the pro-inflammatory acute phase proteins to deal with whatever injury it's being faced with.

693
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:34,540
So you can actually look at levels of acute phase proteins,

694
01:10:34,870 --> 01:10:40,900
whether they're positive or negatively regulated, and sort of assess the pro-inflammatory state.

695
01:10:41,380 --> 01:10:47,080
So some of these are used as markers of inflammation, like CERP is C-reactive protein,

696
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:56,170
which is another type of transport protein that's increased in the setting of inflammation that's often used as a biomarker of inflammation.

697
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:05,020
And then in terms of its function and metabolism, the liver produces trans emanations,

698
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:09,850
which are proteins that are in the cytoplasm of the liver, of the hepatocytes, I should say.

699
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,870
And their job is amino acid metabolism.

700
01:11:14,500 --> 01:11:19,990
So they're involved in shifting different functional groups from one type of amino acid to another.

701
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:23,139
So again, this is part of the recycling mechanism of the liver.

702
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:29,060
So that can move things around and conserve energy or conserve the backbone of some of these amino acids.

703
01:11:29,650 --> 01:11:33,100
So the Trans Am and ACS have them labeled here as one and two different.

704
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:44,559
Trans Am and ACS are involved in converting one amino acid to another in making glucose metabolites from and from portions of amino acids.

705
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:50,650
So it's involved in glucose generation, actually from glucagon, which is the storage form of glucose.

706
01:11:51,490 --> 01:11:56,740
So as part of that system, this is a means of regulating gluconeogenesis.

707
01:11:57,310 --> 01:12:06,520
And then because the system can both recycle within the liver but also can generate nitrogen products that are excreted,

708
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:09,970
it's also involved in the regulation of nitrogen excretion.

709
01:12:10,690 --> 01:12:19,120
So again, and big picture, the Trans Am and ACS are involved in both the conservation of amino acids and nitrogen and also in the excretion.

710
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:25,570
And they have its signaling functions as well. So these are some cytosolic trans emanations.

711
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:29,590
You might recall these if you did the lab last week.

712
01:12:29,980 --> 01:12:32,470
These are in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes.

713
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:40,690
So if you have damage to a hepatocyte and the cell breaks open, the cytosolic enzymes actually then get absorbed into the blood.

714
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:47,530
And so one biomarker of liver hepatocyte damage is an increased level of Trans Am and ACS in the blood.

715
01:12:48,070 --> 01:12:53,500
So these are actually utilized particularly as acute measures of hepatocellular damage.

716
01:12:54,430 --> 01:12:59,520
Okay. All right. So I should to my overview slide again there.

717
01:12:59,970 --> 01:13:07,110
So that was liver function talked about metabolism talked about blood flow, the differential flow of blood and bile.

718
01:13:07,140 --> 01:13:13,350
Talked about oxygen gradients. We talked about detoxifying enzymes in there, their location in the liver.

719
01:13:14,250 --> 01:13:22,230
We talked about bile acid formation and excretion and enter a biliary circulation and its role in xeno biotic metabolism.

720
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:27,030
And we talked about the importance of the liver and protein synthesis and how damage to

721
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:31,950
the liver can affect things like our ability to transport nutrients around the body,

722
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:36,750
our ability to perform coagulation and the response to inflammation.

723
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:40,620
Okay. So that's kind of our overview of liver function.

724
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:46,350
Liver, very important. Any questions related to structure function?

725
01:13:48,350 --> 01:13:56,220
All right. So there is the typical quiz related to liver function in canvas.

726
01:13:56,990 --> 01:14:00,470
So that one is due at the usual time.

727
01:14:01,810 --> 01:14:05,990
Oh, hold on a second. But so next week, we're going to kind of.

728
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:12,080
Now that we understand the liver and how things look, we alluded to, you know, some areas of the liver that might be more affected by pathology.

729
01:14:12,440 --> 01:14:15,890
But next week, we'll look more specifically at pathology.

730
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:20,860
So we're going to have to remember all that history stuff that we learned at the beginning of the class.

731
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:26,560
So this is kind of a couple of pictures I'm going to show you to kind of translate between our general things that we learned,

732
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:30,500
hypoplasia, hypertrophy all those things and see how that might look in liver.

733
01:14:30,530 --> 01:14:33,830
So these are mostly just little pictures worth a thousand words.

734
01:14:34,310 --> 01:14:37,730
Next week, we'll do it more in the context of a particular toxicant.

735
01:14:37,940 --> 01:14:46,580
Okay. These are some nice resources. The A.P., the national toxicology program, has a great lesion atlas.

736
01:14:46,790 --> 01:14:50,699
This one has multiple organs, not just the liver. And then they actually have one.

737
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:56,660
That's just the liver. This is a great example. Like if you're reading, I don't know, paper, it talks about a mouth lesion in the liver.

738
01:14:56,960 --> 01:15:02,420
This usually gives you a nice visual of what they are. Okay, so here's a normal liver.

739
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:11,050
And we talked about this mouse. What's that thing? You know it.

740
01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:18,520
It's only two choices, right? What's the one structure thing that's usually located centrally?

741
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,430
Yes, that is the central bank, then wall.

742
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:27,480
And it's one thing. So that's the center of our lobby.

743
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:32,440
Right. So you can kind of mentally make your lobby. And so then this obviously is the portal.

744
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:39,010
Triad has three things. What's this thing stretched out compared to that on the what's this thing?

745
01:15:40,630 --> 01:15:46,930
Yeah, I can see your lips moving and I can read lips. So I see that Michael shared portal, a portal vein with us.

746
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:51,520
Is that good? Portal vein, thin wall vascular structure.

747
01:15:51,910 --> 01:15:55,960
That's going to be hard to see. Let's start with this one. What's this thing?

748
01:15:56,380 --> 01:16:06,650
Little cuboid or self? What are the three things that's that looks at the train tracks is very good, but there are actually not the train tracks.

749
01:16:06,650 --> 01:16:07,400
But that's very good.

750
01:16:07,510 --> 01:16:15,860
Well, no, this is this is the hard part about the pathology that you have to make mistakes to do it because you're training your eye.

751
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:24,470
Is that the bile duct that is the bladder but the train tracks is a good answer because remember, the the stem cell for those are the older cells.

752
01:16:25,010 --> 01:16:31,530
So way back in its evolution, you're kind of right because those cells did come from the older cells, but they have similarities.

753
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:37,280
You just train your odyssey, the similarities. So this part, this one is like kind of stretched out depending on the orientation.

754
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:42,230
This is another good reminder that we're taking a three dimensional structure and making it two dimensional.

755
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:47,240
Because if I cut this like this, right, this would be circular.

756
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:54,560
If I kept this like this, it would be circular. So you have to kind of remember the 3D thing and that helps you kind of orient.

757
01:16:55,070 --> 01:17:00,559
So a portal vein, bile duct and this is kind of a terrible image.

758
01:17:00,560 --> 01:17:08,000
There's a little here's actually here's one. This is a hepatic arterial here, but I show you that in higher magnification.

759
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:13,999
And then these are all our cords, right? These are the parasites, the vocal cords, and then the can click.

760
01:17:14,000 --> 01:17:17,540
Here are the sinusoidal. There's not much blood in them.

761
01:17:17,540 --> 01:17:22,400
They're very narrow. So they're the white spaces between the hepatocytes heading towards that central vein.

762
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:29,360
So that's liver. Here's a nice close to you. It shows you this easier central vein of normal hepatocytes around a central vein.

763
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,480
Well, here's the liver looks all funky. What is this structure?

764
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:36,830
This kind of dayglo technicolor. But what's the structure?

765
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,649
So there is a central virgin, see? All right, so those must be hepatic sites.

766
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:48,740
What's one of them? So weird? If you had to think back to the basic adaptive changes that we talked about.

767
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:55,400
Things, bigger things, smaller things, fewer. What's funky about these are parasites compared to what I showed you before.

768
01:17:58,330 --> 01:18:07,710
There are larger. Right. What's our what's our pathology word for cells that are larger tissues, the larger hypertrophy?

769
01:18:07,740 --> 01:18:12,600
Good. Very good. So this is central lobular.

770
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:16,800
This is the center of the globule. So in pathology, central lobular.

771
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:21,840
Around the center. Or you could call it zone three, central lobular hypertrophy.

772
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:31,710
So these are hypertrophic cells. And then you can even get more specific if you want it to tell you that this has a big nucleus.

773
01:18:31,920 --> 01:18:36,420
So there's another word for that, Carol, meaning chromatin, Kerry, or mentally?

774
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:41,880
The cell itself is also big site of Begley. But for our purposes, hypertrophy.

775
01:18:43,050 --> 01:18:46,830
And one common reason for this, this is around the central vein, right?

776
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:52,670
So this is zone three. Zone three, where we have our increased p four fifties.

777
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:57,510
One really common finding for toxicology studies is zone three hypertrophy.

778
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:07,260
And it's because these guys are ramping up their p450, they're inducing p450 so that smooth endoplasmic reticulum is getting larger.

779
01:19:07,530 --> 01:19:11,550
So the cytoplasm is expanding. Okay, really, really common finding.

780
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:15,420
There's another funky thing here. This guy. This guy.

781
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:20,370
Oh, my God. So you doing this? And here's another one, two nuclei.

782
01:19:21,870 --> 01:19:27,420
That is poly me. This animal basically has multiple chromosome sets in one cell.

783
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:31,590
So this is a cell that was getting ready to divide and didn't quite make it, just stopped there.

784
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:35,540
That's also really common when the liver is sort of ramping up.

785
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:45,450
It can have an increased rate of proliferation or it's inducing enzymes and it's just kind of doing it so fast it can't catch up with itself.

786
01:19:45,900 --> 01:19:48,270
Mice are super, super prone to do that.

787
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:55,740
And as mice age, they get they make more mistakes and they can't or they don't always completely divide the cells.

788
01:19:56,160 --> 01:20:00,840
So poly quality in the in the liver of mice is a really common aging finding.

789
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:07,500
So it's kind of taken as a consolation. This is telling us that this liver is busy, it's responding to something.

790
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:10,530
It's doing something. Okay, I did that.

791
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:14,820
Here's another kind of lower magnification view. This also shows you the differences.

792
01:20:15,660 --> 01:20:22,890
You know, every time you do an HD, these depending on like how long the stain has been in the stain or there are some kinked horrible changes.

793
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:28,200
So you can't completely rely on color like one engineer I do one day can look a little bit different.

794
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:34,379
So color helps you, but you don't want to put too much stock in it. Central being larger of parasites.

795
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:39,480
This is central lobular hypertrophy again and a lot of times it's easier to see if you're at

796
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:44,760
this sort of lower magnification view because you get a better sense of the distribution.

797
01:20:45,390 --> 01:20:48,630
Here's three things. This is a portal triad. These cells are smaller.

798
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:52,070
Here's a central. Davis is bigger. The cells. Okay.

799
01:20:53,850 --> 01:21:00,650
Which at the time. Sorry. So this is just more zone three hypertrophy and then this is a higher magnification.

800
01:21:00,660 --> 01:21:04,830
This is a little bit better stain for showing it. Here's one of those hepatocytes.

801
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:10,650
Here's the nucleus. The bluish step is the rough endoplasmic reticulum because that has some RNA in it.

802
01:21:10,770 --> 01:21:13,290
Right. So it's pulling some of the hematoxylin.

803
01:21:14,040 --> 01:21:23,100
The smoothie ah has proteins in it as well, but it doesn't have that rough ribosomes so it's going to just be pink.

804
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:30,780
And so the cytoplasm is actually expanded. I can't see the smooth air, but it's expanded because there's been induction of some of the.

805
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:35,190
Ah so that's a really common reason for zone three hypertrophy.

806
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:39,000
Well here's a good one, here's a liver also has something funky going on.

807
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:43,950
So like where, where is where in the liver is this thing looks kind of different.

808
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:53,850
What's that? What's the structure? Is it three things or is it one thing three?

809
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:58,560
It's three things. So that's a portal triad, right? And so that means this is our central theme.

810
01:21:59,190 --> 01:22:02,640
Right. And then I have a little square which helps you out.

811
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:09,090
And then it's terrible on the whiteboard, but the square is kind of expanded here.

812
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:13,320
But like looking at this picture here, I see lots of chords.

813
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:19,530
It's the literature, pretty much. I see hepatocyte nuclei. Right. And then here, everything's fine.

814
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:22,800
Everything's normal. Doo doo doo doo doo wop. And now I get here.

815
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:28,680
So that's. Sorry. This looks so terrible on the way forward, but just kind of squint a little bit.

816
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:33,899
I get here, what's going on here? Think of those basic changes.

817
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:38,280
What are the cells look like? It's better on the screen.

818
01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:48,390
What do you think of the nuclei? This area, that area should move up.

819
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,880
They're kind of condensed. Maybe not. It was the word that we learn for condensed.

820
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:59,970
Right. And then the cytoplasm is getting kind of granular, kind of more pinkish, hyper eosinophilic.

821
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:07,110
It's hard to say because, like, you can't it's hard to see because you can't always see the borders of these individual normal parasites.

822
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:15,060
But these individual cells like this one is actually swollen. So these cells are swollen, they're hyper eosinophilic, they have a condensed nucleus.

823
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:19,140
So putting all together what process is going on here.

824
01:23:20,220 --> 01:23:23,990
So I have to work two things.

825
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:27,510
So now we're going to decide which one is it? I heard apoptosis and necrosis.

826
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:32,670
What's the difference? Which ones controlled and which ones are control necrosis?

827
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:36,149
Because this is uncontrolled and apoptosis is controlled.

828
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:39,330
It's an individual cell decision, so to speak. Right.

829
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:45,240
So looking at a tissue section, we have a lot of cells affected here.

830
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:51,900
Right. Which one of those processes is more likely to affect sheets of cells like that necrosis?

831
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:56,640
Right. Because otherwise you have to imagine that all these individual cells decided to close at once.

832
01:23:57,330 --> 01:24:03,570
Okay. So low magnification sheets of cells with those features of cell death, most likely necrosis.

833
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:10,649
Okay. So this is central lobular or zone three necrosis, right?

834
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:16,590
Cell death. So this is our tissue injury phase. We don't have a lot of inflammation or anything yet left yet.

835
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:20,969
Zone three necrosis. Think about we. You know what we just talked about?

836
01:24:20,970 --> 01:24:25,260
The blood flow, everything in the liver. What are two potential reasons that I could be having?

837
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:31,800
Zone three cell death necrosis, lack of oxygen because that's our low oxygen area.

838
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:39,910
Or maybe that that was this mouse later I talked to kids.

839
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:47,220
So again, five toxicants. Yeah, high toxicants. Like maybe it's overwhelmed its ability, it's drained, it's conjugating enzymes.

840
01:24:47,640 --> 01:24:53,040
And this is the area where we have low conjugating enzymes, high p450 activity.

841
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:59,070
So we know it's a vulnerable area. So the structure or this focus or the location of pathology is helping us a little bit.

842
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:05,040
That's an across central lobular multifocal so that we're talking about next week.

843
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:08,939
This is a morphologic based on how this thing looks.

844
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:12,690
Morphology means form morphologic diagnosis.

845
01:25:12,990 --> 01:25:16,080
The morphology is necrosis. It's telling me where it is.

846
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:21,750
It's telling me it's multiple girls in different areas. This is not the same as cause, right?

847
01:25:22,170 --> 01:25:28,650
So we figure it out. The tissue told us something and then we use our other information to know cause.

848
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:34,770
Right, so pathology. This is a morphologic diagnosis and we use all of our information to get the mechanism.

849
01:25:36,390 --> 01:25:41,340
Oh, that's my thing. Oh, look how busy the site is. So the normal liver is in the lower right corner.

850
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:47,249
And this, you know, you can kind of say, okay, I guess this is the liberalism structures up here.

851
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:57,239
This account kind like a parasite, but there's always stuff going on. So what is this most likely that the black arrow is pointing to the red things?

852
01:25:57,240 --> 01:26:01,319
Scarring. Good thought.

853
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:06,299
So scarring is going to look kind of pinkish. And this is kind of a low magnification view to show it.

854
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:09,300
But scarring is going to look more pink, more of a pale pink.

855
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:12,689
This is pretty red. What's the oth?

856
01:26:12,690 --> 01:26:16,230
And there's not a lot of nuclei in here. What's the other then.

857
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:21,600
What's the other thing. That's red I guess in between the red blood cells.

858
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,899
So these are expanded but usually we don't notice them, right.

859
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:29,129
Because they're circulate, they're percolating through this whole thing. So it's just one cell at a time.

860
01:26:29,130 --> 01:26:34,690
This is like they've fallen out of those sinusoidal.

861
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:40,110
So this is just hemorrhage, okay? Hemorrhage by definition, blood outside of the vessel.

862
01:26:41,790 --> 01:26:47,160
Thinking back to our histology here, we have a bunch of just cells kind of peppered on the tissue.

863
01:26:47,190 --> 01:26:51,030
What's that process of there? Inflammation.

864
01:26:51,030 --> 01:26:54,839
Very good. Like swarm of bees or cement through pepper on the side.

865
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:59,850
So there's our basic things hemorrhage, inflammation thrown on top of this poor, injured liver.

866
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:06,809
Oh, no. Here's another letter with some things going on so you can kind of get the sense and here's your distribution again.

867
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:13,290
Here's some hepatocytes, but there's these big vascular spaces are very clear, distinct vacuoles.

868
01:27:13,290 --> 01:27:26,559
What do you think's happened in there? So vacuole when we talked about tissue injury could be two things vacuoles in the cell.

869
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:29,860
When you have hypoxia, your dysregulation of your sodium,

870
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:37,540
potassium pump and your dysregulation of water so you can have hydrophobic chains, water, valuables, and then everything shuts down.

871
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:41,440
You decrease your protein production, your metabolism. So what's the other type of vacuole?

872
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:46,210
Lipid? Yes, lipid. And how can you visually tell the difference?

873
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:55,660
So cells are aqueous, right? Mostly. If I drop a lipid into water, is it going to just disperse?

874
01:27:55,660 --> 01:28:04,390
What's going to happen? Yes. Are together. So lipid vacuoles are very discrete and clear water vacuoles are like kind of fuzzy.

875
01:28:04,480 --> 01:28:06,190
So these are lipid vacuoles.

876
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:13,750
So this is it can be very big referred to just as lipid vacuoles or lipid doses we call this or steatosis just a pathology word.

877
01:28:14,230 --> 01:28:17,230
So we have some distribution of lipid and then we have this.

878
01:28:17,230 --> 01:28:21,310
So here's all the different stuff that we have. This thing, everything's just washed out.

879
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:29,459
Here's a Harvard. What's that? Talk your way through it.

880
01:28:29,460 --> 01:28:34,740
Like just kind of tell me what's going through your thought process of what it could be, what's missing?

881
01:28:38,440 --> 01:28:44,200
What you think, Tiffany? I think it looks like you want to say something. What's missing? Yes.

882
01:28:44,200 --> 01:28:49,660
There's no nuclei as very pink, so there's a lot of cells.

883
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:54,040
They have very eosinophilia, swelling, necrosis.

884
01:28:54,490 --> 01:29:01,870
It's necrosis, right? Yep. So like that visual recognition in your head, you're kind of walking through that process.

885
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:07,120
It's just training your eye to, like, learn the many appearances of all the processes that we talked about.

886
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:11,409
So this is this is the liver that has necrosis and it has steatosis.

887
01:29:11,410 --> 01:29:19,420
So it's an injured liver. Right. Remember we said that Steve Ptosis are lipid factors can be one manifestation of an injured cell.

888
01:29:19,780 --> 01:29:24,310
These cells are beyond repair. Their dead liver is having an issue necrosis.

889
01:29:24,670 --> 01:29:29,620
Oh here's a good one. This you've got little arrows pointing at cells here.

890
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:36,850
So here's a bunch of hepatocytes. Nice big nuclei here, some nuclei talking, and then it's pointing at these cells it's got on there.

891
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:48,629
Who wants to tell me what those cells are like? Hypnotic nuclei, and then these parasites are kind of touching their little friends.

892
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:55,950
Right? What's this cell doing? Shrunken up and it's pulled away from all its little friends.

893
01:29:56,280 --> 01:30:02,040
This is a shrunken cell with a pick, not a nucleus. And what else is distinct about the distribution?

894
01:30:04,220 --> 01:30:09,710
Well. Right. Yeah. So this is a single cell.

895
01:30:09,980 --> 01:30:17,000
And in pathology, it's kind of stupid. The pathology term for this and tox path is single cell necrosis.

896
01:30:17,330 --> 01:30:23,540
Just because we like to make it really different, difficult to interpret. That's actually not why it's because technically able ptosis.

897
01:30:23,540 --> 01:30:27,110
In order to say that definitively, you have to have evidence of CAS base induction.

898
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:32,240
Your eye is not like, you know, an immunohistochemical device or biochemical instrument.

899
01:30:32,270 --> 01:30:38,000
So the pathology word for this, when you read this in a talks paper, we call it single cell necrosis.

900
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:42,770
But usually what the pathologists trying to say is it has the morphologic form of apoptosis.

901
01:30:43,100 --> 01:30:47,510
Okay. So you're distinguishing that from those sheets. It's kind of annoying.

902
01:30:48,390 --> 01:30:52,670
I took my time. Almost did. Okay. Oh, look at this one.

903
01:30:52,910 --> 01:30:56,300
So these arrows are pointing to something funky and weird.

904
01:30:57,200 --> 01:31:02,300
What's the point? You can post it best here. Good idea what those cells are doing.

905
01:31:05,170 --> 01:31:10,090
Yeah. So those are mitotic figures. So this actually is the condensed nucleus.

906
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:15,010
You know how the nucleus forms the spindle. So you have the lining up of the chromosomes in the middle that it pulls apart.

907
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:18,759
You actually see that cell starting to pull apart. The cell hasn't lined up yet.

908
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:23,530
It's getting there. So if you have a liver that's been injured and it's proliferating.

909
01:31:23,710 --> 01:31:29,770
Right. So we have cells reentering the cell cycle. One thing that you'll notice is a higher mitotic index.

910
01:31:30,340 --> 01:31:35,250
So you can actually count these like count the number of mitotic mitotic figures per field,

911
01:31:35,530 --> 01:31:40,840
and that will increase in the face of regeneration or hyperplasia or of response to injury.

912
01:31:41,260 --> 01:31:48,940
So these are mitotic figures. Liver with an increased mitotic index and that might go along with some of these other things that we're seeing.

913
01:31:49,390 --> 01:31:53,170
Right, because the liver that's necrotic is going to have inflammation and then the

914
01:31:53,170 --> 01:31:57,250
other cells are going to proliferate to try to replace the damaged tissue.

915
01:31:58,630 --> 01:32:06,820
Oh, the famous one. Train tracks so nobody gets hit.

916
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:11,680
So this is oval cell hypoplasia. So this this is a really messed up liver.

917
01:32:12,610 --> 01:32:18,190
Usually you don't see these cells and it kind of looks a little bit like inflammation, but there's a little bit more bigger oblong nuclei.

918
01:32:18,760 --> 01:32:26,650
So this is over cell hyperplasia. So this is our liver's other alternative for regeneration, mobilizing tissue, stem cells, great drugs.

919
01:32:27,400 --> 01:32:32,500
Here is that at low mag. So the normal liver that liver has had a lot of issues.

920
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:41,220
It has some hypertrophy, it has some in the arm. Looks like maybe this within a particular is enlarged and it has a ton of overall hyperplasia.

921
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:44,440
So that's probably a more chronic lesion. That's some chronic study.

922
01:32:46,120 --> 01:32:53,620
So lots of things can happen. This is a term that you'll sometimes see that tries to group it in in a toxicology study,

923
01:32:54,550 --> 01:32:58,840
because a lot so far I've just identified individual processes.

924
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:03,910
But as you can imagine, when you have recurrent injury, all these things can be happening at once.

925
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:10,900
And depending on the stage of the lesion in different areas of tissue, you'll have some necrosis, you'll have some repair.

926
01:33:11,470 --> 01:33:15,070
So toxic hepatol pithy. The word hepatol apathy.

927
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:19,090
The Papo part just means something wrong. So that word is kind of silly.

928
01:33:19,330 --> 01:33:23,540
Hepatol apathy just means something wrong with the liver. Toxic hepatitis C.

929
01:33:23,560 --> 01:33:31,330
Hepatitis B, which is hard to say, refers to a constellation of liver injury, the injury related lesions.

930
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:42,010
So if I'm reading a study, I might not want to list and score all the individual things if I think it's part of the same process.

931
01:33:42,490 --> 01:33:45,639
Right. So if I treated with a compound, all these things are happening.

932
01:33:45,640 --> 01:33:49,660
I know they're all part of the same thing based on my knowledge of the biology of it.

933
01:33:50,020 --> 01:33:58,400
So I might just say these findings, this liver shows toxic hepatol apathy and it's mild versus moderate versus severe.

934
01:33:58,420 --> 01:34:04,900
So I might read just that, or maybe I'm doing a specific study looking at the role of inflammation.

935
01:34:05,260 --> 01:34:11,980
Then I might break it out into all these different morphologic diagnoses because maybe I'll have an intervention that just affects inflammation.

936
01:34:12,590 --> 01:34:18,400
Okay. So you can consider on a lesion level and you can consider on a little bit bigger level depending on the need of the study.

937
01:34:21,370 --> 01:34:25,990
Okay. That's more talks. Look at that liver. So much going on there, but we're not gonna worry about that too much right now.

938
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:33,850
And then finally in the rodent liver, if you've had injury and the cells are have a higher level of turnover,

939
01:34:34,270 --> 01:34:39,330
so they're getting bigger, they're getting smaller and things are changing.

940
01:34:39,340 --> 01:34:43,030
You're having a stimulus in the liver that affects the metabolism of the cells.

941
01:34:43,510 --> 01:34:54,520
One early change that we commonly see in rodent livers in particular are these foci of cellular alteration, which is a lovely ambiguous term foci.

942
01:34:54,520 --> 01:34:59,469
So there are alteration or scales which are vocal differences in staining.

943
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:06,879
And I'll show you an example in a minute what they look like. It's a different in this difference in the staining quality and sometimes the cell size

944
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:11,710
and essentially represents an area of hepatocytes that have some metabolic alteration.

945
01:35:12,910 --> 01:35:19,270
And they're important because they can potentially be the first indication of a pre neoplastic change.

946
01:35:19,930 --> 01:35:23,140
So it represents these cells are doing something different metabolically.

947
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:29,800
And if that stimulus continues, potentially this is an area or this is a liver that could give rise to neoplastic change.

948
01:35:30,880 --> 01:35:37,810
Okay. Yeah. Here's the problem for you that know is that part of the story, is that a separate issue?

949
01:35:38,080 --> 01:35:44,650
That would be a separate lesion. So polyp Apocalypto is a different lesion than foci of cellular alteration.

950
01:35:45,100 --> 01:35:48,280
But if I have so poorly deployed,

951
01:35:48,280 --> 01:35:59,650
it usually happens when you have an increased level of hepatocyte proliferation and maybe there's some aberration of the process.

952
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:03,570
So that can happen in the context of a toxicant exposure.

953
01:36:03,610 --> 01:36:09,270
So if I have foci of cellular alteration, I might expect to also see an increase in polyp.

954
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:17,770
Okay. And then both of these lesions, as the rodent ages, it gets less efficient at metabolism and gets less efficient at that cell division.

955
01:36:18,070 --> 01:36:21,730
So both of these lesions can actually be seen in aged rodents as well.

956
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:25,479
So remember when we talked about cancer, a cancer cancer's a lesion of aging.

957
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:29,170
And so you accumulate problems in the cells as you go.

958
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:37,090
So in an age, or at least in premium plastic as well, or if I exposed to a toxicant, I can induce their appearance earlier in the animal's life.

959
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:42,220
Okay. So these can be spontaneous or exposure induced and they are named.

960
01:36:42,310 --> 01:36:47,709
These are weird things. They're name by their staining properties. So oops, I won't look at that.

961
01:36:47,710 --> 01:36:52,990
Now that's just the the digitized out of the mouse liver lesions shows you lots of pictures these.

962
01:36:53,800 --> 01:36:57,510
So here's a little area I mean at the face of it, this liver looks kind of fine.

963
01:36:57,520 --> 01:37:01,540
It doesn't have a lot of like enlargement or anything. But you can kind of get the sense that there's bluer.

964
01:37:02,030 --> 01:37:06,700
Like here. Right. But they're not it's not like altering the overall shape of the liver.

965
01:37:06,700 --> 01:37:11,630
It's it's just a tutorial change. This is called a Basil Philip focus of cellular alteration.

966
01:37:12,570 --> 01:37:16,340
These are a little mysterious. We don't always know exactly what's happening metabolically.

967
01:37:16,340 --> 01:37:20,160
They're these might be cells that, for instance, have ramped up protein production.

968
01:37:20,420 --> 01:37:24,020
So the cytoplasm is a little bluer because they have more ribosome or RNA there.

969
01:37:24,980 --> 01:37:28,080
So here's a close up is flick focus of stellar alteration.

970
01:37:28,490 --> 01:37:36,680
If you were able to view this in black and white or like ignore the color, the parasites look about the same, but it's distinctly their of focus.

971
01:37:37,070 --> 01:37:41,840
And here, conversely, we have an eosinophilic focus of cellular alteration.

972
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:50,910
Maybe this guy has more smoothie. Ah, and for some reason it's just affecting the parasite's nervous globules that the eosinophilic focus.

973
01:37:51,890 --> 01:37:57,950
Some of these stain higher with GST would look good about us transferase.

974
01:37:57,950 --> 01:38:02,660
So it's just indicative of a metabolic alteration of focus.

975
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:08,060
There it is. You're looking cells and then this one is called a clear cell.

976
01:38:08,150 --> 01:38:12,139
And usually these have alterations of glucose metabolism.

977
01:38:12,140 --> 01:38:17,850
So they have more glucagon, which appears as this kind of vascular appearance to the cytoplasm.

978
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,100
So that's a clear cell focus.

979
01:38:20,240 --> 01:38:28,310
So if you see those written about in a mouse study, those are foci of cellular alteration that can sometimes be perennial plastic changes.

980
01:38:30,300 --> 01:38:35,730
Speaking of neoplastic, here is a gross image of a liver with a very defined, altered area.

981
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:39,570
So there's a mass in this liver. This is an adenoma.

982
01:38:40,110 --> 01:38:43,349
So when we talked about neoplasms, we talked about benign versus malignant.

983
01:38:43,350 --> 01:38:48,310
Benign tumors are localized. So they get to us. They kind of push the adjacent tissue aside.

984
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:53,520
They don't go anywhere. And here's a historic image of an adenoma.

985
01:38:53,640 --> 01:39:00,830
This looks kind of like that clear cell thing. But unlike the clear cell focus, this is actually altering the adjacent parenchyma.

986
01:39:00,840 --> 01:39:08,880
So it's expanding. It's kind of being very disrespectful to the boundary cells and it's compressing the adjacent liver.

987
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:15,000
These can be very hard in some cases to distinguish just from foci of cellular alteration,

988
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:20,790
because depending on how I mean, this is a very obvious one, but the cells themselves don't look that different.

989
01:39:21,360 --> 01:39:23,880
But here it's just showing an area of compression.

990
01:39:24,510 --> 01:39:30,120
So there's some gray zone between, you know, you might have some discrepancy between what you call these lesions.

991
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:35,549
That's the adenoma. And then this liver well, this liver has a lot of problems.

992
01:39:35,550 --> 01:39:42,480
And this well, but let's distinct a little bit more kind of smooth, inching into the adjacent liver parenchyma.

993
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:46,799
So this is a carcinoma which is a malignant tumor which can locally become

994
01:39:46,800 --> 01:39:51,720
invasive or can invade vasculature or lymphatics and spread to alternate tissues.

995
01:39:52,380 --> 01:39:54,600
And this is an example of a carcinoma.

996
01:39:54,600 --> 01:40:00,870
So instead of the normal sinus slides, the liver cells forgot how to line up nicely, and they're forming these sort of balls.

997
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:04,260
Sometimes they even make a little easiness or a glandular looking structure.

998
01:40:04,590 --> 01:40:10,530
So these are trabecular or thickened cords. The liver has lost all its ability to form its normal structure.

999
01:40:10,920 --> 01:40:17,370
There are no normal vascular structures in those areas, so the altered morphology tells you that it's a neoplasm.

1000
01:40:19,190 --> 01:40:24,470
There's just a higher magnification of those trabecular I reckon.

1001
01:40:24,530 --> 01:40:29,120
I saw some paper I did a little long time ago,

1002
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:37,669
so in a mouse study you can often have like if you have a neoplastic stimulus, you can often have a progression.

1003
01:40:37,670 --> 01:40:45,650
Remember our multistep progression where later, as a study goes on, you'll have more and more areas of foci of cellular alteration,

1004
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:52,430
more and more areas of hyperplasia out of the study goes on long enough you might start to see some animals with adenomas and carcinomas.

1005
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:58,699
Okay, so if you have a substance that's carcinogenic, you would expect that there's a little bit of a progression of those.

1006
01:40:58,700 --> 01:40:59,600
And in fact,

1007
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:08,930
that is sometimes used in carcinogenicity studies as part of the preponderance of evidence as to whether a compound is carcinogenic or not.

1008
01:41:09,860 --> 01:41:13,970
So carcinogenicity studies, two year studies in rodents.

1009
01:41:14,090 --> 01:41:19,340
And part of the problem is that at that age, just by aging, mice are going to have some spontaneous tumors.

1010
01:41:19,670 --> 01:41:25,370
So sometimes it can be difficult to figure out whether it's a spontaneous tumor or a compound related lesion.

1011
01:41:26,060 --> 01:41:30,560
So if you have early in the study or like looking at the overall study,

1012
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:38,960
if you have an increase in hyperplastic lesions and sort of a tapering increase in benign and malignant neoplasms,

1013
01:41:39,380 --> 01:41:43,880
that's sort of evidence of a progression is used as evidence of carcinogenicity.

1014
01:41:44,420 --> 01:41:49,940
We can see we're looking here, but if you have basically nothing as far as hyperplasia and you have a couple of

1015
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:56,930
mice late in the study with a neoplastic layer of it with a neoplastic lesion,

1016
01:41:57,470 --> 01:42:01,670
and you don't see that progression, that's less likely that it's compound related.

1017
01:42:01,940 --> 01:42:07,220
See if to kind of look at the overall progression and it can get really equivocal and hard,

1018
01:42:07,310 --> 01:42:14,240
especially if you have a shorter study because maybe you just have hyperplastic lesions and then everything else is kind of equivocal.

1019
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:17,540
That gets really difficult to interpret and you might not be able to fully interpret it.

1020
01:42:18,980 --> 01:42:22,520
All right. So that was the picture's worth a thousand words,

1021
01:42:22,520 --> 01:42:27,860
just kind of a warm up to try to make that transition between what we learned, you know, for the different lesions.

1022
01:42:28,190 --> 01:42:34,040
And then next week, we're going to put that into play in livers from animals that were exposed to particular

1023
01:42:34,040 --> 01:42:37,700
toxicants and see if we can put it together and understand the whole story on that.

1024
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:40,550
All right. Good job, guys.

1025
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:50,120
Um, for those of you in 717 today, I hope you hope everyone can get there and make sure you grab some water, take time to grab something to eat.

1026
01:42:52,220 --> 01:42:55,880
It'll all be fine. It'll all be fine, right? Yeah.

1027
01:42:56,360 --> 01:43:00,180
All right, let's find last week the reason why. We may find out who's out there.

1028
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:04,070
You can find out. Yeah.

1029
01:43:04,250 --> 01:43:09,050
Just let me know.

1030
01:43:12,890 --> 01:43:16,670
Yeah. Make fun. Plans for February. No, I haven't yet.

1031
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:20,180
Oh, yeah, yeah, I have. Yeah.

1032
01:43:21,110 --> 01:43:25,060
Unfortunately, the cells don't care that much.

1033
01:43:25,090 --> 01:43:39,250
The break is happening. And I mean, it just seems like so many parents are just like, you know,

1034
01:43:39,290 --> 01:43:52,010
if I can get there with grandkids like that over here, like, I haven't been able to do that at all in my life.

1035
01:43:52,820 --> 01:43:56,110
Like, I seem like the right one.

1036
01:43:56,690 --> 01:44:04,310
Well, I'm sure my questions for the exams are even just like around them.

1037
01:44:05,420 --> 01:44:08,110
Like, you go to this super, this school.

1038
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:17,180
Shouldn't you just want us to, like, list the two teachers that your church did you want us to, like, go say on our in batches gross stuff.

1039
01:44:17,720 --> 01:44:30,650
And I just I just don't think we know as long as you have them tied to like which one, which thing they represent, right.

1040
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:36,409
Oh yeah. And then for the nick versus one, do we need to identify which type of necrosis you're just in?

1041
01:44:36,410 --> 01:44:41,149
It is like I think you're probably on the right track. Okay, you had a right.

1042
01:44:41,150 --> 01:44:48,960
And then I was like, oh, yeah, oh, oh, you will die.

1043
01:44:49,760 --> 01:44:53,000
Oh, so again, for this one three times and I didn't need to name it.

1044
01:44:55,850 --> 01:44:59,360
Yeah. Yeah that one just name them you know the that.

1045
01:44:59,690 --> 01:45:05,290
But I think that's just to make sure it wasn't like missing something that wasn't perfect.

1046
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:09,290
Thank you. You're not going to answer that? Yeah, yeah.

1047
01:45:09,290 --> 01:45:12,949
Just try to get there early. I know there's a line.

1048
01:45:12,950 --> 01:45:21,450
I remember there was like a bouncer outside the door. Can I use my lab for?

1049
01:45:21,570 --> 01:45:26,030
Led by my regular lab coat? I mean, you sure can if you're comfortable.

1050
01:45:26,730 --> 01:45:31,580
Like, I mean, unless you're, like, really sorry, you know, you're probably not going to get to do it.

1051
01:45:32,510 --> 01:45:36,790
I don't know. I bring up your mental mean. What should I do? Is I just. I'm so happy.

1052
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:41,720
Yeah. I mean, we have large, sort of white reusable lab coats.

1053
01:45:41,720 --> 01:45:45,680
Like, you're certainly welcome to use one of ours if you don't want to get like if you can bring if I get gunk on it.

1054
01:45:45,680 --> 01:45:49,969
Yeah, you're like, oh, there's one here that fits me because we have a laundry bin for hours.

1055
01:45:49,970 --> 01:45:53,540
You're certainly welcome to use one of ours if you want to carry around. That's great.

1056
01:45:53,540 --> 01:45:56,600
Thank you. Like a variety of a variety of sizes. Yeah, right.

1057
01:45:56,960 --> 01:46:00,110
Great. Thanks. Did you get out here okay? Yeah.

1058
01:46:00,590 --> 01:46:04,940
Are you leaving for. Would you consider something just like standing in front of this?

1059
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:11,730
You know, here's my phone. Oh, God. Why don't you start the fire and try to do anything?

1060
01:46:11,750 --> 01:46:17,059
I'll be okay. And nothing. Everything. Our time goes so well.

1061
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:25,580
I start I to five years, but it would be 11 p.m. on Friday, which would be like noonish here.

1062
01:46:25,820 --> 01:46:36,800
Okay. Yeah. And so I was wondering if you would consider essentially shifting the window up to like Friday night and go into basically.

1063
01:46:36,810 --> 01:46:43,370
So basically if people I don't want you to be taking an exam while you're doing international travel, I don't think that's like good for anybody.

1064
01:46:44,030 --> 01:46:51,620
So like basically if people can't accommodate December 9th, I'm looking for you to identify a day prior to that, but you can take the exam.

1065
01:46:51,830 --> 01:46:53,750
Yeah. It's like when you're leaving on the night.

1066
01:46:54,920 --> 01:47:01,280
Oh, well, I'm still shopping around for that week, but I'm thinking, like, maybe that once maybe that Wednesday or Thursday.

1067
01:47:01,370 --> 01:47:05,540
So maybe the 8 to 20 hour flight, an 11 hour time difference.

1068
01:47:06,890 --> 01:47:09,910
So I mind taking out of that.

1069
01:47:10,310 --> 01:47:17,160
I'd really prefer you to take it before you leave. Yeah. So if it's possible for you to look at your schedule, I'd even.

1070
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:24,229
I mean, I like making people take exams on the weekend, but even a good prayer, the Friday prayer is December 2nd.

1071
01:47:24,230 --> 01:47:28,040
We do have class that day and then the third and the fourth are the weekend.

1072
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:34,190
And then we go into that final week, you know, the end of which is the ninth, which is when the exam is taken.

1073
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:38,809
I really would prefer that people if you can't make the exact exam period that you take

1074
01:47:38,810 --> 01:47:45,500
it prior to that and I really don't want I really would strongly prefer not to take it.

1075
01:47:46,310 --> 01:47:51,410
We can't address any connectivity issues at that point. You're going to be jetlagged, you're not going have your best performance.

1076
01:47:51,410 --> 01:47:56,780
And then we're like running into a time crunch. So I would really prefer if you can't make the ninth to take it before then.

1077
01:47:57,020 --> 01:48:04,299
Okay. So whether that's the third, the fourth, the fifth, because I mean, all it is, it's like a canvas window of openings.

1078
01:48:04,300 --> 01:48:11,030
So you can look at your schedule and figure out when in that time, prior to the ninth, you can take it and just let me know.

1079
01:48:11,480 --> 01:48:17,480
We can have your window of time then, because then it makes it most even equivalent to everyone else.

1080
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:22,910
Does that make sense? Okay, so. So it sucks because it moves the time up.

1081
01:48:22,910 --> 01:48:26,470
So you have to be more conscious of like your study time, your prep time, right?

1082
01:48:26,510 --> 01:48:29,840
But I mean, if you're keeping up with doing the quizzes and everything,

1083
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:34,700
you should be fine because the material like histo Cruz is just kind of a fun thing.

1084
01:48:34,700 --> 01:48:38,120
The material for the exam actually ends the week prior to that.

1085
01:48:38,150 --> 01:48:41,330
Okay, do you know what I mean? Like December 2nd, my sister who's it's really fun.

1086
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:45,499
It kind of helps you for the exam because it helps you, like, figure out the process of looking at things.

1087
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:48,709
But nothing on his diplomas is really exam stuff.

1088
01:48:48,710 --> 01:48:54,620
So whatever. Let's week prior to that, that'd be actually Thanksgiving is the week prior to that.

1089
01:48:55,070 --> 01:49:02,330
So the last class thing that's covered in the exam is November, whatever the November is prior to Thanksgiving.

1090
01:49:02,420 --> 01:49:09,770
Okay, you know that. So that's the end of the exam things you actually have that whole period of time until Thanksgiving and through his the study.

1091
01:49:10,070 --> 01:49:15,350
Yeah so like even if you took it the third which is a Saturday, it's not like you've had some study time that makes sense.

1092
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:18,640
Okay, so why don't you look at those days? Just let me know which one works for, you know?

1093
01:49:18,830 --> 01:49:21,950
Thanks for being, like, really good. Thank you to.

1094
01:49:40,140 --> 01:49:53,770
Fi. 530.

1095
01:49:54,520 --> 01:50:03,240
That was cut out of your. When you heard what I was hearing.

1096
01:50:04,090 --> 01:50:46,470
Yeah. You're not.

1097
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:24,150
We're not. I know.

1098
01:51:30,840 --> 01:51:36,220
There's. Right.

1099
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:58,530
I. One.

1100
01:52:02,930 --> 01:52:27,250
My life has been. You know, I did admire you for being incredibly the only person I know.

1101
01:52:27,530 --> 01:52:34,540
And I know.

1102
01:52:35,660 --> 01:52:49,260
I know what I said. I know you just like and you know you don't know anything about all in your life.

1103
01:52:58,460 --> 01:53:02,580
The. I know that.

1104
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:13,280
I love your friends. Yeah, exactly.

1105
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:19,130
Yeah, I know. And I would.

1106
01:53:19,620 --> 01:53:22,010
My wife and.
