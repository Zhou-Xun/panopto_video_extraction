1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:12,790
So I've updated the schedule for September.

2
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,080
So the rescue dates are filled, as you can see here.

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:27,400
So I have either a paper and questions or a background paper and a lecture.

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:38,950
So that schedule is filled out for the rest of the month of September and then for other dates.

5
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:48,000
So I filled it once, so I filled in the all but two days in the month of November where you signed up to give your presentation.

6
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:53,370
So that was really convenient to get them all in the month of November.

7
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:04,500
Then quits. So I mentioned that there's going to be a quiz on Friday and it's going to open up on Friday and it'll be due on Sunday.

8
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:12,090
There'll be ten questions. There'll be some multiple choice. There'll be matching fill in the blank short essay, that kind of thing.

9
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,100
You can use your notes. The point of this is to reinforce, to make you become more familiar with this terminology.

10
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,370
Okay, so think of it as that, something as reinforce reinforcing the terminology.

11
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:33,930
I'm not trying to get here. Okay. So that will appear on canvas.

12
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,310
Yes. The bill was the 16th. Is it to update?

13
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:51,610
It's due on the Sunday after. Okay.

14
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:59,380
So today we're going to be talking about adaptive immunity.

15
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:16,850
So just to kind of summarize, we were talking about the innate immune system, talked about some barriers to the external environment.

16
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:25,010
And I gave you an example of how Vitamin E played an important role in bolstering that barrier defense.

17
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:34,970
And I talked a little bit about the innate immune response involving resident cells like macrophages, neutrophils.

18
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:40,010
I talked about the antimicrobial peptides that was reinforced in the Vitamin D lecture.

19
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:48,259
And but I also mentioned there were a number of limitations with the innate immune response and that it's not specific that you

20
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:59,210
have no memory of a particular pathogen that you may have been infected with and that it can cause significant collateral damage.

21
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:08,150
The adaptive immune system is quite a bit different, and I'm just going to be walking through the basics here this morning.

22
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:16,700
Feel free to stop me any time. And on the the follow up or the next paper we're going to be talking about,

23
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:29,540
the Wolfberry paper is going to kind of reinforce the adaptive immune response in regard to responses to an influenza vaccine.

24
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,400
So that's an interesting paper published in the Journal of Nutrition.

25
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:42,560
So for today, I want you to understand the specificity of the adaptive immune system,

26
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:47,720
our immune response, and just basically describe what being T cells do.

27
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:58,670
And then you should be able to explain the adaptive immune system that provides specific immunologic memory to specific pathogens.

28
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:03,770
And then at the very end, we're going to talk about hypersensitivity responses.

29
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,780
So hypersensitivity responses involve both the innate and adaptive immune response.

30
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:16,160
And it's something when we talk about allergy that you're going to need to understand as well.

31
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:23,360
All right. So let's get started and let's start with this big picture where we have the innate immune response.

32
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,470
You have pathogens, adhere to the epithelial surface.

33
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,530
And then we talked about some mechanisms of host defense that you have the normal flora, the skin,

34
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:40,940
the local chemical factors, and then within the lung and in the gut to some other tissues,

35
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:48,530
to some extent, you have resident phagocytes when there's a breach in the epithelial barrier,

36
00:04:48,530 --> 00:04:52,010
for whatever reason, in this case, it's a cut in the skin.

37
00:04:52,490 --> 00:05:00,110
The pathogen can get inside the tissue and you have an induction.

38
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,870
And this wound healing response, you have a greater ability to produce antimicrobial peptides.

39
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:14,780
You have local phagocytes, and there's a macrophage right here that resides within the skin here.

40
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:23,120
And then you have a complement that's coming from the blood that can leak out when you bleed in response to a cut.

41
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,989
They're breaching this barrier and you have complement proteins that can destroy that pathogen, too.

42
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,160
So you've got a lot of things to defend yourself against infection.

43
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:39,799
And some of the time it's enough. A lot of times it's not enough.

44
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,730
You need another response to not only defend yourself against that infection, but subsequent infections.

45
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:55,399
So the next caption goes to what's going on in terms of the local, local response, and there's a lot more going on here.

46
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:01,610
So you have complement, cytokines, chemokines, other cells being recruited to the site of infection.

47
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:07,879
Here's some more macrophages you'll get neutrophils in here on the extent of the cellular

48
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:14,209
recruitment will be in response to how much activation of the tissues that occurs there.

49
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:23,930
And it could be equivalent to the amount of bacteria perhaps that you had gotten to the infected site,

50
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:32,749
whether blunt trauma or trauma, you can recruit immune cells in response to danger signals.

51
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:38,630
These are things that leak out of the cells that can initiate an immune response.

52
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:45,350
And all of this leads to an activation of the adaptive immune response.

53
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:55,370
So here's this dendritic cell that I keep mentioning, the Langerhans cell lines increase in regard to a dendritic cell that lives in your skin.

54
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:06,410
And it's collecting antigen. It's always collecting antigens and it's going to drain it's going to migrate to the to the lymphatic system.

55
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,430
And it's going to initiate this adaptive immune response so that later on in the infection,

56
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:19,490
if it's not completely cleared, you can recruit other cell types in here.

57
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:25,670
Here's a t cell coming in and the T cell is going to help the macrophage do its

58
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,560
job and killing pathogens by secreting cytokines that enhance that response.

59
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:36,650
Here are some antibodies that have come in. So the antibodies are produced by B cells,

60
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:47,570
and those B cells can migrate to this particular site and produce these antibodies that help clear the pathogen.

61
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,310
So this is just a cursory overview of the lymphatic system.

62
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:07,329
So very quickly, your body is perfused with the circulatory system,

63
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:13,270
but associated with the circulatory system where you have veins in arteries all over your body.

64
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:20,350
You also have these banks and the lymphatics essentially function to drain extracellular fluid.

65
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:28,149
And that fluid that's produced all over your body drains into lymph nodes that are all over your body.

66
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:34,630
So you have some larger lymph nodes, your adenoids in your tonsils within your oral pharynx.

67
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:39,910
So there's a lot of antigens draining into those particular lymph nodes.

68
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:53,530
And then you have lymph nodes throughout your body associated with your gut, associated with your salt over the surfaces of your skin.

69
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:00,700
So the lymphatic system is like a tree or roots actually draining it to these lymph nodes.

70
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,560
And then you have other types of structures that are also play an important role

71
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:11,290
in sampling fluids that are coming into the body through the lymphatic system.

72
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:19,090
And even the blood and the cells that reside in those structures are looking for antigens that they recognize.

73
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,770
So some other structures you have spleens you have prior to patches,

74
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:33,090
you have mucosal associated lymphatic tissue that's in your gut, that's in your respiratory tract.

75
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:42,690
And all of these tissues, these lymphatics, all of this, this system leads to activation of the innate immune response.

76
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,900
And then all the immune cells arise from the bone marrow.

77
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:54,000
So you have primary and secondary lymphoid organs and the primary lymphoid organs.

78
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,200
What they do is it's a sac where lymphocytes differentiate and mature.

79
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:05,890
The lymphocytes would be B cells, T cells and natural killer cells for the purpose of their class.

80
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:14,340
There are other types of cells which we won't get into the innate lymphoid cells that we won't get into that level of detail.

81
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:20,940
So in the bone marrow, you have all immune cells are derived from the bone marrow.

82
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,080
It's also a sign of B-cell maturation.

83
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,990
So if something goes wrong with your bone marrow, either it's producing not enough immune cells or too much immune cells.

84
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:34,620
There's something going on in the bone marrow that's problematic.

85
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:49,700
And I should also add that as you age, your ability to produce immune cells when your bone marrow declines.

86
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,770
Then you have the thymus. The thymus is another primary lymphoid organ.

87
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,060
It's a large organ that sits in your upper chest.

88
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,420
It's a place where activated T cells go to and mature.

89
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:17,910
So it's a different site for this subset of lymphocytes to go to and mature after they've seen an antigen.

90
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,360
So that's the primary lymphoid organs.

91
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:32,010
Next is the secondary lymphoid organs, and their function is to track antigen too, and to allow an initiation of the adaptive immune response.

92
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:39,450
So you have the spleen, lymph nodes and these structures that are known as mucosal associated lymphoid tissues.

93
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:51,880
So your spleen has a collection of lymphocytes distributed throughout it,

94
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,760
and it's the way that your body collects antigen that's circulating in your blood.

95
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:10,540
And it can be anything usually in the form of a pathogen, but it can be something in the form of an allergen that can stimulate an immune response.

96
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:18,850
The other important function that your spleen performs is that it collects senescent or old red blood cells and clear them from your body.

97
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:30,960
A red blood cell will last 120 days, and after they start to age, they'll express certain surface markers and cells within your spleen.

98
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,620
Recognize that? Clear them out.

99
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:44,230
So the lymph nodes are local, secondary lymphoid organs, and they they recognize things draining from various mucosal surfaces.

100
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:53,229
The structures are highly organized and it's they form these points of conversion within convergence,

101
00:12:53,230 --> 00:13:01,180
within the lymphatic system, and then finally have mucosal associated lymphoid tissue.

102
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:10,540
So these are they function the same way as lymphoid organs do or lymph nodes do, except they're a bit bigger.

103
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:22,120
These would be your tonsils, your adenoids and your appendix, which is the mucosal associated lymphoid tissue within your large intestine.

104
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:32,800
And then you have other structures like this within other epithelial surfaces, like in your lung as well.

105
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:45,010
So when I'm talking about the adaptive immune system, I'm referring almost exclusively to the lymphocytes.

106
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:54,340
And this response to a challenge is specific.

107
00:13:55,270 --> 00:14:04,180
So you have a specific antigen, and an antigen is anything that gives rise to an activation, an immune response.

108
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:14,950
So you have an immune response that occurs in response to a particular antigen, and the response takes a few days to occur.

109
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:22,450
So, for example, if you're immunized or you're exposed to an advantage in the response may take

110
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:26,950
4 to 7 days before you have any evidence of an adaptive immune response.

111
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:34,890
Antibodies or something like that. It's it's specific.

112
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:44,850
So the adaptive immune response is going to respond to a very particular antigen,

113
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:53,400
and you'll have memory of that particular antigen for weeks, months, years, and in some cases, decades.

114
00:14:56,510 --> 00:15:04,760
And then the way this specific recognition of antigens occurs is that you have this large

115
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:10,250
pool of naive lymphocytes and they're circulating in your bloodstream and your system,

116
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:16,400
and they express receptors for a very specific antigen.

117
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:25,879
So you have a huge repertoire of these types of cells and only those lymphocytes

118
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:31,130
that empower and then encounter an antigen that matches their specificity.

119
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:39,710
Those cells will proliferate and differentiate. The ones don't don't ever find the engine that they can recognize eventually die off.

120
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,940
So this is the process of clonal selection.

121
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:58,070
And I have a cartoon or of an illustration of this. So even even though it's this year, 2008, the 2022 illustration is exactly the same.

122
00:15:58,340 --> 00:16:02,840
Okay. So here you have the colonial selection theory.

123
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:11,510
You have a single progenitor cell that gives rise to a number of different lymphocytes with different specificity.

124
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:20,330
So the different colors and the different shapes on these receptors will only recognize a particular antigen.

125
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:33,170
And because you don't want your immune system to recognize self tissues, you eliminate those lymphocytes that are auto reactive.

126
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:40,730
So these lymphocytes that recognize self antigens will be eliminated.

127
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:48,080
And that gives you a pool of mature, naive lymphocytes.

128
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,740
So they haven't seen a foreign antigen yet, but they're mature lymphocytes.

129
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:02,130
And here you have three of them. And then these cells are circulating in the blood, and all of that exists.

130
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:11,180
This one particular cell type recognizes this foreign antigen and the others don't recognize and antigens.

131
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:19,730
So they they die off by a process of programed, programed cell death called a but ptosis.

132
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:35,300
And they're gone. And you're left with one particular cell type that proliferates and differentiates in response to this antigen.

133
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,040
And the these are effector cells.

134
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:49,640
They, they work to eliminate the antigen that they recognize could be a pathogen, could be something else.

135
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:57,830
And these are the cells that are remaining after the initial process of of clonal selection.

136
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:12,770
Okay. So that's that's what I mean by specificity and maturation and differentiation of a specific lymphocyte through this clonal selection process.

137
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:21,680
So you have a huge repertoire of lymphocytes that can recognize a particular antigen.

138
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:33,590
People who have diseases that reduce the population of lymphocytes will have a smaller repertoire of these immune cells.

139
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:37,910
So there it's possible that they might respond a little bit.

140
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,740
Um, their response to a particular antigen might be delayed because of that.

141
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:46,100
And that happens with aging and other types of diseases as well.

142
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,460
So this is just a description.

143
00:18:54,470 --> 00:19:03,770
Yeah. Go ahead. Sorry. There was things like die die offs that they don't recognize before you meet those.

144
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:11,620
Like the daily Greek. Every year you're constantly producing cells with different conditions.

145
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:15,189
Specificity. Yeah, you would.

146
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,540
You would have to get them again. You'd have to generate them again. Yeah.

147
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:34,300
So the process of maturation occurs in both and lymphocytes that eventually become

148
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:40,040
B and T cells and their natural killer cells and other types of lymphocytes.

149
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:46,330
And I'm not going to go into here, but here you have a small resting lymphocyte here.

150
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:54,560
This is an electron micrograph. And as I said, again, the most recent textbook with this figure has the same figure.

151
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,880
Even though this is from 1999. Okay. So here's the resting lymphocyte.

152
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:02,570
Here's a cell that is starting to differentiate.

153
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:09,970
It's still a precursor of V and T cells, but it's as you can see, there's some big changes going on here.

154
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:14,030
So the site of the size of the nucleus is changing here.

155
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:19,100
And the density of the components within the nucleus is also changing.

156
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:25,970
And under the right growth conditions, that lymphoma is going to become an effector B cell.

157
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:37,750
And in this case, it's a cell that makes lots of antibodies and effector T cells and there are different classes within those populations.

158
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,450
So you have a plasma cell that makes antibodies.

159
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:44,600
That's all they do. And then you have a memory cell.

160
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,670
And those are the cells that persist for weeks, months, years.

161
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:56,900
And they remember a specific antigen could be to a vaccine, could be to a pathogen you've seen before.

162
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:05,530
Okay. There are two different basically two different types of plasma cells.

163
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:10,750
We talk about other subclasses, but T cells.

164
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:15,310
There are lots of different kinds of T cells, at least nine different types.

165
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:23,290
I'm just mentioning three of them here, a cytotoxic T cell, a helper T cell, and you have memory T cells as well.

166
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:31,450
So yes, specific antigen specificity through this plot process of differentiation and maturation.

167
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:37,930
And then you have memory. All right. And these are the cells that are going to stick around for weeks, months, years.

168
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:48,980
So everybody in the School of Public Health, let's hope, gets vaccinated, right?

169
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:57,590
So you get a vaccine. What happens? How long does it take for you to have antibodies in your blood after you get vaccinated?

170
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:09,230
Well, there is a specific antigen that you're vaccinated against and there's this lag period.

171
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:17,630
So your body's processing that at that vaccine that you've been given could be just one antigen, could be a bunch of different antigens.

172
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:25,010
So the flu vaccine they give you may be three different three different strains of of the antigen that

173
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:31,580
they think is going to be predictive of the strain of influenza virus that's going to circulate.

174
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:39,830
So so it takes 4 to 7 days before you start to see a response here and the response here.

175
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:42,260
So antigen and here's the response.

176
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:51,170
And the response is in the form of antibody titer or how much antibody in micrograms per milliliter in serum occurs.

177
00:22:52,670 --> 00:23:00,770
So here's the lag period. You get recognition, differentiation, maturation, proliferation,

178
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:06,650
and then you have plasma cells that are producing antibody and it rises to a certain point.

179
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,930
And when that antigen is no longer present at high quantities, that antibody titers starts to decline.

180
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:23,070
Now different antigens have different potencies to produce this response,

181
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:31,680
and there are different things you can put in to a vaccine that can prolong that response or increase the antibody production,

182
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:38,639
the vaccines that are out today, or the new vaccine, the RNA vaccine.

183
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:50,430
For SARS-CoV-2, the antigen is actually produced by the cells that take up the RNA.

184
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:55,080
So the Moderna vaccine, the cells take up the RNA,

185
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:03,870
your cells process that that RNA is converted to a spike protein and that spike

186
00:24:03,870 --> 00:24:08,550
protein is recognized as foreign and you have an immune response against it.

187
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,300
So it's specific in this case to just the stands.

188
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:28,939
So let's have let's say you have an exposure to two different antigens, A and B now that will elicit an immune response,

189
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:38,940
giving you a higher antibody titer in a shorter period of time and you get a higher amount of the antibody because you've been vaccinated there.

190
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:44,240
At the same time you're presented with antigen B in this case,

191
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:53,720
it has to go through the same lag period to produce the antibody titer that you had with the generic.

192
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,170
So it's it's a specific response.

193
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:07,640
There's initially 4 to 7 days required to respond to that particular antigen, but the next time you see it, there'll be a greater response.

194
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:20,899
So the life of the effector cell, in this case A plasma B cell, it's limited to the presence of the antigen.

195
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,200
And once that aging goes away, the antibody titer declines.

196
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:36,190
So the cells are now that the antigen has this lower in concentration undergo programed cell death and some cells will persist.

197
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:39,550
And those would be the memory cells, the memory B cells in the memory T cells.

198
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:44,530
And then the second exposure you have the shorter lag period.

199
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:52,960
Okay. So any questions up to this point about how this process occurs?

200
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:59,710
No review for for many of you. All right. So what kind of antibiotics you're getting?

201
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:07,570
Well, let's just talk about antibiotic structure. You have variable domains and consent domains.

202
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:15,040
And these are the antigen binding sites shown here. This is the variable domain that's going to be specific for a particular antigen.

203
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:20,950
And then you have heavy chains and light chains of the antibody structure.

204
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:31,570
And the different details within the structures are important because they can form different structures.

205
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:41,680
So in the back of your throat, you have these cells that are always cranking out antibody, and it's in the antibody primarily in the form of IGA.

206
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:52,450
So it's a dimeric molecule or two of these antibodies are hooked together at the base or the FC portion of the molecule.

207
00:26:53,080 --> 00:27:03,850
So there's this J chain and their hope together, and this is a very effective antibody structure and clearing surface antigens.

208
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:12,410
You also have the ability in the initial immune response to form it again.

209
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:18,760
So this is a pandemic structure where five of these antibodies are stuck together.

210
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:25,100
And notice how the heavy chain is a little bit different than what you see in the 88.

211
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:32,920
And the difference in the heavy chain affects its ability to form these larger.

212
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:45,920
In this case, a pandemic structure. And. So when we talk about antibodies in serum, we're talking about a humoral immune response.

213
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:53,810
Back in olden times, we had humors described fluid, including serum and blood.

214
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:57,470
So we talk about humoral immunity. We're talking about antibodies.

215
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:04,310
So the antibody is also is a B cell receptor.

216
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:14,510
So not only one of these beings thinks B circulating in blood will be attached to B cells, and then it's a B cell secreted in blood.

217
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:20,990
The concept domain can be bound to by cells, and the variable domain recognizes the antigen.

218
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:32,420
And you have an incredible capacity to produce different kinds of B cells that produce specific antibodies.

219
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:38,360
So ten to the eighth power, a different specificities.

220
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:49,250
So this is an incredible repertoire of B cells that can produce specific antibodies against specific antigens.

221
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:57,170
And the same clonal selection process is going on in that B cells that produce these antibodies.

222
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,370
So here are the different types of antibodies.

223
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:10,050
GM That's the first one that's produced. It can form that pandemic structure.

224
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:15,030
Its specificity or its affinity is very good.

225
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:20,910
It's over another few days or a few weeks.

226
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:28,410
You produce better antibodies that have a greater affinity for the engine and that's in the form of IgG.

227
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:38,820
IGA is the subclass of the antibody that's produced mucosal surfaces, the saliva,

228
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:45,150
the fluid within the bronchial tissues, within the digestive tissues.

229
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,900
And then you have this antibody that mediates allergic responses.

230
00:29:51,900 --> 00:30:00,060
Itchy immunoglobulin E is responsible for responses that are needed.

231
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:08,640
So you can have this time of year an allergy against pollen, certain pollen that's produced.

232
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:15,960
And what your body has done now has identified antigens and pollen as a pathogen.

233
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:23,880
And exposure to that for a long period of time leads to the production of this itchy molecule.

234
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:33,120
And that, you know, that there are cell types that can respond to this that are particularly problematic.

235
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,290
The mast cell that I mentioned last time. So mast cells can mediate.

236
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:47,970
These are tissue cells. They do granulation and the receptor that they have to recognize antigen is this itchy molecule.

237
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,559
And they this response can be really profound.

238
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:58,470
And we'll talk a bit more about this when we get to the hypersensitivity part at the end.

239
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:12,450
And then there's IgG bound to B cells. It's not the function in regard to B cell activation and perhaps systemic inflammatory responses.

240
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:17,070
So these are just some basic descriptions of the different types of antibodies that you have.

241
00:31:19,050 --> 00:31:26,010
All right. So let's put this in the context of a tissue now.

242
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,570
So here's a polymeric agar.

243
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:38,550
It's transported into the gut lumen through the epithelial cells at the base of the crypts.

244
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:47,430
And you have lots of these cells within your gut that's producing these idea molecules.

245
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:53,280
So here's the polymer agar, that dimer structure,

246
00:31:53,580 --> 00:32:04,740
two antibodies stuck together by this g protein and they become incorporated in the fluid that coats the surface of the epithelial cells in your gut.

247
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:14,880
And they can bind to bacteria, they can bind to toxins now so that they never interact with the cells that line your gut.

248
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,670
So if you have an inability to produce these antibodies,

249
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:35,969
if you have an inability to produce enough mucus or you have a discontinuation or a rupture

250
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:42,049
of these tissues where the toxins or the bacteria can get through the epithelial surface,

251
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:46,320
that's really problematic and it can cause a really profound inflammatory response.

252
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:53,700
So people who study Crohn's disease, which is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gut,

253
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:03,659
are studying these types of interactions in the gut to see this response impaired in that particular disease.

254
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,590
And if it is, can we do something about in the form of of treatment?

255
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:18,930
So the next slide gives you a summary of all of the different types of interactions antibodies perform

256
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:27,900
or functions that they perform in regard to eliminating either toxins or pathogens from your body.

257
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:31,739
The very first is bacterial toxin.

258
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:37,710
This could be a toxin that's shared from bacteria that could be on the surface of bacteria.

259
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:46,590
You have antibodies that recognize that toxin. It can be found too by the antibodies here and neutralized.

260
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,760
And they're taken up by other cell types here.

261
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,249
It's taken up by a macrophage or just secreted in the fluid from your body.

262
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:59,970
And that way it never interacts with the tissues and causes any damage.

263
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:10,010
Here's another example. And where you have bacteria that you've seen before and you have antibodies against them.

264
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:19,850
So they bind to the surface of the bacteria and this aids in their elimination by the macrophage now can more avidly phagocytosis bacteria.

265
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:29,180
The macrophage expresses receptors for these antibodies and it leads to rapid ingestion and elimination of that pathogen.

266
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:39,670
And then finally you have the bacteria now that's in the blood, and then you have these complement proteins.

267
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:48,400
They can coat the surface of the pathogen. And through activation of the antibody and complement system,

268
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:56,020
you have a greater capacity to not only phagocytosis this organism, but to life them as well.

269
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:04,330
So these are just some examples of how antibodies eliminate toxins and they can eliminate microorganisms from your body.

270
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:14,470
So if you were to see SARS-CoV-2 and you've been vaccinated, you would have a similar type of an elimination process occurring.

271
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:28,440
However, when those antigens on the surface of that pathogen changes a little bit, the specificity thing is important.

272
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:33,880
Your ability to clear the pathogen through these mechanisms is going to be impaired.

273
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:46,750
So with a change in the structure of the spike, protein makes the antibodies that we produced in response to the vaccine less effective.

274
00:35:48,130 --> 00:36:01,240
You don't get as sick with the SARS infection, but you might not end up in the hospital as a consequence of having at least some protection.

275
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:07,010
So that's the B-cell, that's antibodies. What about T cells?

276
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:15,300
Well. T-cells are important for a number of reasons.

277
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:22,200
They can help your innate immune cells clear intracellular pathogens.

278
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:27,570
And I'll give you an example. The example would be tuberculosis, and I'm going to show you that here in a minute.

279
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:35,370
And they also can secrete cytokines and activate B cells to give you a better humoral immune response.

280
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:51,570
So when we talk about T-cells and their function in immune system, we're referring to cell mediated immunity.

281
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:59,999
And it's the cell mediated immunity that's important against viral infections like SARS-CoV-2.

282
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,620
And you'll see how these cells play an important role in viral infections here in a moment.

283
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:10,190
You have at least nine different types I'm just going to introduce to.

284
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:19,920
There's the cytotoxic t cell. So if you don't have immunologic memory against the virus, how do you defend yourself?

285
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:32,510
Well, the virus can bind to a receptor on the surface of the cell at being epithelial cell could be a lymphocyte, it could be a nerve cell.

286
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:40,919
It could be all kinds of different tissues. So the viruses have, through evolution,

287
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,680
have found their way into different hosts and they've been able to hijack receptors that

288
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:52,950
do something else and get inside the cell and use the cell's machinery to replicate.

289
00:37:54,030 --> 00:38:01,890
And the way you defend yourself against this is that you recognize that something's wrong with these cells and you kill them.

290
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:06,989
And that's done with the cytotoxic t cell. They'll have a cell surface marker on them.

291
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:13,530
This cluster of differentiate eggs. So cytotoxic t cells are CD positive.

292
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,949
And then you have these helper T cells there. They have that CD4 marker on them.

293
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:25,240
And you can have different combinations of CD4, CTA, positive, negative and so on.

294
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:33,580
But what helper T cells do is they make cytokines, and the cytokines are important for host events.

295
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:38,290
They can initiate and enhance the innate immune response,

296
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:48,940
or they can cause a provoke promote a more severe allergic response depending on which cytokines that they produce.

297
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,500
th1 or two get to that detail here in a minute.

298
00:38:57,030 --> 00:39:05,970
So this slide summarizes and not very much detail what happens and when your cells get infected with the virus.

299
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:07,680
So there's a virus.

300
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:21,660
The virus has this protein coat and here's the viral nucleic acids, the DNA RNA virus, whatever the case, and your cell becomes infected.

301
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:27,750
The virus has figured out a way to get inside the host cell by binding to a receptor.

302
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:43,140
It's taken up. That cell now starts to produce proteins that will assemble into new viruses and to prevent other cells from being infected.

303
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:54,240
This infected cell will present an antigen on its surface that's recognized by the same toxic T cell that will come along and kill that infected cell.

304
00:39:55,790 --> 00:40:03,800
So here's an electron micrograph of some viruses now adhered to an epithelial surface or cell.

305
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,690
And here is a virus infected cell here and here, some cytotoxic T cells.

306
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:17,090
Here's one here that's recognizing that there's something wrong with this cell and it's going to kill it.

307
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:28,200
So that's what cytotoxic t cells do will help.

308
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:34,769
What do helper t cells do? They help your body eliminate pathogens.

309
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:38,580
And in this example, it's mycobacterium tuberculosis.

310
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:44,340
So TB which was which still is a huge problem globally.

311
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:55,770
So in this country, we've been able through mostly public health measures, to nearly eliminate tubercle disease, tuberculosis.

312
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,250
It was very, very common not long ago.

313
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:04,710
So here is the macrophage now.

314
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:13,530
It has tuberculosis within it. And to divert kilos, this bacteria can escape the killing mechanisms within that macrophages,

315
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:20,940
and they can live inside the cell and not be detected by the immune system.

316
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:33,540
So the macrophage is going to express on the surface those proteins and they're going to be associated with this MHC complex.

317
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:41,010
And we'll talk about that in detail later. And the way the T cell recognizes is that this cell has tuberculosis in it,

318
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:52,559
is that it bears a receptor that through which it's presented with antigens from the mycobacterium tuberculosis and that th1 cell is

319
00:41:52,560 --> 00:42:01,350
going to secrete this th1 cytokine interferon gamma that helps the macrophage do a better job in killing that intracellular pathogen.

320
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,960
So here is an electron micrograph. This is actually a stained section of tissue.

321
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,400
And the red stain is the tuberculosis bacteria.

322
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:26,250
And this is the same or another section of tissue now where the T cells have produced interferon, gamma and eliminated.

323
00:42:26,790 --> 00:42:32,760
You don't see any red stain anymore or very little of it in that particular tissue section.

324
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:45,380
So how does the T-cell interact with these antigen presenting cells when they have this MHC class molecule,

325
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:57,530
major of histocompatibility complex and there are fragments of the bacteria that form these antigens,

326
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:04,610
they're peptide fragments and they're bound to that MHC class molecule and they bind to the T cell receptor.

327
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:10,549
And you have two different types of MHC class molecules.

328
00:43:10,550 --> 00:43:17,960
You have a misfit class one and MHC class two. So with MHC class one, all cells express this receptor.

329
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:28,100
So any cell can get infected with the virus. Any cell can produce a foreign antigen or an antigen that doesn't look right and it can be

330
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:35,660
expressed in the cell surface and then recognized by the cytotoxic T cell and eliminated.

331
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:41,270
The other type of then may see class receptors,

332
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:50,990
class two And these are expressed by what's known as professional antigen presenting cells, dendritic cells, B cells and macrophages.

333
00:43:52,730 --> 00:44:01,070
So they're displayed, um, they can be derived from pathogens that are degraded inside the cell or taken up by B cells.

334
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,650
Okay. So here's the cartoon.

335
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:13,340
There's an example of this MHC class one molecule presentation virus infected cell.

336
00:44:13,850 --> 00:44:19,580
The cell starts to make viral proteins and then endoplasmic reticulum.

337
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:35,960
Your cell makes these MHC class one molecules that present this antigen now on the surface of the cell and that cell now can be recognized and killed.

338
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:46,040
So here's the cytotoxic t cell that recognizes that foreign protein presented through this MHC class one molecule, it shouldn't be there.

339
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:54,970
So it kills that virus infected cell. And then here are a couple of other examples.

340
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:59,200
And this time, it's not a virus infected cell.

341
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,560
It's a macrophage that kills bacteria.

342
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:11,950
And the bacterial antigen is presented on its surface, presented to T cells, the T cells going to produce cytokines.

343
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,910
That's going to help that macrophage do a better job killing that bacteria.

344
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:27,160
But the last example here is that B-cell B-cell receptor is the antibody, and the antibody recognizes those antigens.

345
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,310
The antigens are internalized, degraded,

346
00:45:30,970 --> 00:45:39,130
and that a small portion of that molecule is associated with this MHC class T molecule presented on its surface.

347
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:46,000
And now that T cell can come along and activate that cell, and in the case of a B cell.

348
00:45:46,060 --> 00:46:00,600
It's going to produce a lot more antibodies. So so antigen presenting cells, they present antigens to t cells through this class two molecule.

349
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:05,430
And the types of professional antigen presenting cells are dendritic cells like

350
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,240
that Langerhans cell in the surface of the skin that I showed you earlier,

351
00:46:09,870 --> 00:46:12,750
macrophages can do this and B cells can do this.

352
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:23,129
There are helper t cells and of cytotoxic T cells, and they have in general a couple two classes that are lots of other T cells.

353
00:46:23,130 --> 00:46:29,580
But just for the purpose of introducing these cells to each one or two to the th1

354
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:38,730
cytokines i l interferon gamma il2 and there some others they help with host events.

355
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:47,400
The th2 cell produces cytokines that stimulate b cells to proliferate secrete more antibodies,

356
00:46:48,030 --> 00:46:54,749
and the cytokines that do that are I'll four or five and 30 and should be 13,

357
00:46:54,750 --> 00:47:04,000
not ten while ten is a cytokine but it doesn't do it does not help a B cells produce more antibody.

358
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:13,860
Sorry about that. So here's a cartoon that summarizes that two different types of T cell function,

359
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:23,729
that's one and the th2 again it's each one cytokine recognizes that foreign antigen presented by that macrophage.

360
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:33,480
Here it's activated produces change when cytokines, the macrophage can do a better job of killing intracellular pathogens.

361
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:43,350
Here's a helper t cell. It recognizes a complex with this the antigen and MHC class molecule.

362
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:50,250
This helper t cell produces TGF cytokines and now that b cell is going to proliferate,

363
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:57,120
differentiate, produce a lot more antibody in response to those cytokines that th2 cytokines.

364
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,020
Okay. So what's the CD designation?

365
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:13,560
So the T cells bear a molecule on their surface that distinguishes them from other cells.

366
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:24,000
So if you'll see different markers, CD or positive, but different combinations, it's just a cluster of differentiation.

367
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:33,810
And for the most part, when we talk about CD8 positive cells, we're talking about cytotoxic T cells.

368
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,259
And when we talk about city for positive cells,

369
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:46,830
we're talking about help ourselves that recognize this class two molecule that produces the cytokines th1 or th2.

370
00:48:49,760 --> 00:49:00,710
So here's the summary of the first part. Native and adaptive immunity allows the immune system to recognize a diverse number of foreign antigens.

371
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:12,630
Its very specific. And it provides immunological memory, allowing a more rapid response to reinfection.

372
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:27,930
Okay. So let me stop there and ask anybody, everyone, if you have any questions about what I've gone over so far, this is just the basic stuff.

373
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:36,420
And this will help. This will serve as a reference point for when you when we talk about more details and nutrition and the immune response.

374
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:49,170
Yeah. Okay. So one cytokines produced by this subset of t cells, th1 cells.

375
00:49:50,850 --> 00:49:57,990
They help eliminate pathogens, interferon, gamma, also important in eliminating viruses.

376
00:49:59,130 --> 00:50:04,650
Al two This promotes t cell proliferation and then t nfl.

377
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,800
So all of these are examples of th1 cytokines.

378
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,340
thQ cytokines are four out of five out of 13.

379
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:23,010
They help B cells produce antibodies and an example of an allergic response would be

380
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:30,750
this IGB molecule that can cause the mast cells in the tissues to do granulation.

381
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:39,480
It can recruit inactivate eosinophilia, which also can do granulation, producing these allergic responses.

382
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:46,650
And there's this interesting interplay between page one cells and th2 cells.

383
00:50:47,430 --> 00:50:56,750
So a t h to cell can inhibit the activity and the production of cytokines in at1 and vice versa.

384
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:07,980
The th1 cytokines produced by the th1t cell can inhibit these types of cytokines and other types of th2t cells.

385
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:14,900
Okay. So lots of detail here. What are chemokines?

386
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:21,350
Chemokines are essentially cytokines that recruit side cells to the site of inflammation.

387
00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:26,900
And there are millions of there are lots of them. There are more than 50.

388
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:33,260
Okay. So there are a lot of the different types. Some have more specificity than others.

389
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:38,900
But you're essentially sending out a signal telling cells that are wandering around the body.

390
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:42,770
Come here. There's an infection here. There's an inflammatory response here.

391
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:51,200
We need to eliminate this antigen. So this is a form of communication to recruit immune cells to a site of inflammation,

392
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:57,830
and that can be specific for neutrophils or blood monocytes or lymphocytes.

393
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:18,910
That's what I mean by Kumagai. And so they can attract a specific type of cell, an example of a neutrophil chemo tract and humans as easily.

394
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:26,980
There are similar molecules in mice that we might see in the semester that have this capacity.

395
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:34,120
You have other ways to distinguish these chemokines.

396
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:49,420
So humankind would see that you'll see a6c designation in a cell that in a in a cytokine recruits mononuclear cells, you'll see a CCL designation.

397
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,220
So a MIP one alpha is a monocyte chemo attraction.

398
00:52:54,490 --> 00:53:00,610
It will track more of these macrophage like cells to a site of inflammation.

399
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:08,889
And then finally you have chemokines that are specific, that are problematic in an allergic response.

400
00:53:08,890 --> 00:53:16,270
So e attacks and is an example it can recruit eosinophils to the site of inflammation and that that

401
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:22,329
can be really problematic especially if you have allergic asthma near your cells in your lung.

402
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:29,450
Maybe producing this is taxing. Okay.

403
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:36,230
So let's put all this together and look at some hypersensitivity diseases.

404
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:44,360
This is essentially a classification of allergic responses.

405
00:53:44,390 --> 00:53:52,540
There's four different types. So you can live without these.

406
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:56,140
It's an aberrant, excessive or uncontrolled inflammatory reaction.

407
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:02,770
And it happens because your body's recognizing an antigen that's not associated with a pathogen,

408
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:10,960
but it's associated with pollen or dust or dust mites or particular food or a particular chemical.

409
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:26,530
And the very first time that you encountered this sandwich, and there's no response, but with that, non-responsive.

410
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,530
Reaction.

411
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:41,180
Your body's processing that antigen and you're starting to develop cells now that can recognize that answer and be problematic in the future.

412
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:50,000
So on second exposure, you develop this allergic reaction and it can become stronger and stronger.

413
00:54:51,140 --> 00:55:00,430
The more times that you see a particular antigen. And you can develop symptoms.

414
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:09,190
The symptoms depending on the type and the dose of the antigen and the route that it

415
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:14,350
enters your body and that the immune cells that are involved in the immune response.

416
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:24,470
So you don't need these. They cause distress and tissue damage.

417
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:31,790
They're the same types of responses that are provoked when you're infected with an agent makes you sick a pathogen.

418
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,720
But in this case, they serve no purpose.

419
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:46,850
So this is your immune response, reacting to something that it hasn't seen and it's identifying as a pathogenic agent.

420
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,830
So it causes a unneeded, unwanted, inflammatory response.

421
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:01,110
So there are four types. The first three types are antibody mediated.

422
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:09,480
So you have antibodies against a particular antigen, and different classes of antibodies can provoke different kinds of responses.

423
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:14,250
So on first exposure, nothing happens.

424
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:25,800
On second exposure, your B cells that have this memory function produce antibody and that response can occur within minutes or hours.

425
00:56:28,710 --> 00:56:38,700
And the type for sensitivity is the delayed types of hypersensitivity, and that's mediated by T cells.

426
00:56:38,940 --> 00:56:42,580
So let's look real quickly at this.

427
00:56:42,630 --> 00:56:44,700
The first three types.

428
00:56:46,590 --> 00:56:55,440
So you have different cells, you have different types of antibodies, and you have different kinds of antigens that are involved here.

429
00:56:56,190 --> 00:57:00,210
And here's a different effector mechanism that's illustrated here.

430
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:03,960
And here are some of the samples. How many of you have allergies?

431
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:12,120
Three for the most. Just about four or five people.

432
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:15,350
Three out of five people in this class and 4 to 5 people in this class right now.

433
00:57:15,360 --> 00:57:21,570
Okay. So the first type of hypersensitivity is type one.

434
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:29,610
You're you have ITP. It is produced by B cells that recognize a soluble antigen.

435
00:57:30,510 --> 00:57:33,899
And this can be something that you can consume.

436
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:37,670
That antigen could be in a form of a food allergy or a drug allergy.

437
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:42,060
And that the response here, the effector mechanism,

438
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:49,860
is that your molecules have coated the surface of the nasal and that mast cells can live

439
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:54,980
on the surface of your skin and your respiratory tract and your gastrointestinal tract.

440
00:57:54,990 --> 00:58:01,260
And when you're when you're ITP binds to that antigen, it activates that cell.

441
00:58:02,010 --> 00:58:09,749
And the mast cell here is secreting pro-inflammatory agents and it's eliciting

442
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:15,510
a hypersensitivity response and it could cause inflammation within your knee.

443
00:58:15,510 --> 00:58:31,440
So pharynx causing allergic rhinitis, it could be in your lungs producing the hyper reactivity of your your airways production of mucus.

444
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:44,400
And if it's strong enough, it can has a serious response called anaphylaxis where you can go into shock as a consequence.

445
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:52,860
So you have a very systemic response in regard to anaphylaxis.

446
00:58:53,520 --> 00:59:02,040
So it's really important in people who are highly sensitized to control these responses with anti-inflammatory drugs.

447
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:07,690
Anybody on an inhaler? Yeah. Only sometimes.

448
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:11,940
Is it a rescue inhaler or is it a double acting inhaler? It's just like a regular.

449
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:16,080
Looks like an owl. Okay, so this. It does.

450
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:19,720
Does your heart race after you've taken up enough of the inhaler?

451
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:23,800
Yeah, it's probably just a beta agonist.

452
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:32,560
So what that does is it causes your airways because the smooth muscle in your airways are responsive to that drug,

453
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:40,450
and they open up your airways and letting more air and so that you're not having an asthmatic reaction.

454
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:44,560
Yeah. Is that hypersensitivity? Just seems like just about allergies or what?

455
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:50,540
That, I guess it's not just allergies, it's other. Other types of responses.

456
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:54,070
It can be an allergy and it's more severe than it can be.

457
00:59:54,100 --> 00:59:57,590
Yes. So the type one response would be an allergic response.

458
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:03,700
That's an example. Okay. But it's a little more complicated when we talk about two, three and four.

459
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:10,840
So in type two, we're not talking about IGG now we're talking about IgG.

460
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:14,950
Now you're supposed to produce IgG against pathogens, right?

461
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:25,900
But in this case, it's a host protein. And your body is supposed to eliminate cells that produce receptors against host proteins.

462
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:29,050
And that that's problematic. And how the heck does that happen anyway?

463
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:39,459
Well, I'm going to show you. So the antigen here is a cell or a matrix associated.

464
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:45,760
And as you know, if you get example of that here in a minute or a cell surface receptor.

465
01:00:48,050 --> 01:00:57,980
So here's the effector mechanism for the type two. It can be complement, it could be FC receptor on cells involving that.

466
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:06,920
The phagocytic cells are natural killer cells, and it could be an antibody that alters intracellular signaling.

467
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:13,760
So here is an example of a drug allergy.

468
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,300
So what do I mean by cell?

469
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:27,410
Our matrix associated antigen, the allergen here is the penicillin and the penicillin adheres to the surface of the platelets.

470
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:35,750
And if you recognize that penicillin as a foreign antigen,

471
01:01:35,870 --> 01:01:44,320
sometimes that processing of that antigen includes not only the penicillin but the self protein, the surface of the platelet.

472
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:53,150
Okay, so you're developing antibodies against the platelets with the penicillin stuck to it.

473
01:01:53,810 --> 01:02:02,240
And that can cause that systemic inflammation that can cause a response like like hives.

474
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:08,360
You could have an agent against it, but you can also cause you to eliminate a lot of your platelets.

475
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,120
As a response to that, you might experience some thrombocytopenia as a result of that,

476
01:02:15,710 --> 01:02:21,650
there are a whole lot of other interactions with the cell matrix associated antigen.

477
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:27,980
It's a complex of a foreign antigen in your cell proteins, and that's where the antibodies are directed against.

478
01:02:30,150 --> 01:02:43,170
Type two. Here you have this cell now that normally responds to a particular signal and manage it here, let's say, and you get it.

479
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:50,100
You're saying that signaling events that occurred downstream of that receptor in this case,

480
01:02:50,460 --> 01:02:55,680
that cell surface receptor, is recognized as a foreign thing.

481
01:02:55,890 --> 01:03:08,190
And here antibodies bind to that receptor and that receptor activates intracellular signaling events that translate into inflammation.

482
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:17,250
So in this case, you have chronic inflammation, chronic you to carrier in response to having these antigens.

483
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:24,120
I'm sorry, these antibodies that are directed against these cells are these of these receptors.

484
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:34,210
This response can occur in certain diseases involving the thyroid gland.

485
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:43,240
You can have other types of diseases in which the antibodies recognize a receptor that

486
01:03:43,330 --> 01:03:50,170
induces an intracellular signaling events and causes this chronic inflammatory response.

487
01:03:51,450 --> 01:04:03,900
So let's type two examples of type two. And then in type three, it's not a cell or a matrix reset associate and it's it's a soluble protein.

488
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:10,110
So again, the effector mechanisms are complement and phagocytes.

489
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:26,159
And here you have the formation of an immune complex where you have complement proteins and IG or IG binding,

490
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:39,660
and these complexes now can form multi-member compounds that circulate in your blood, and this can cause systemic inflammation.

491
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:50,669
And in the example here, they give you a serum sickness or the Earth's reaction where your body is essentially responding to an immune

492
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:58,680
complex that is formed by your exposure to some type of a foreign antigen that causes this response to occur.

493
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:03,480
Imagine circulating your blood antibodies bind to it.

494
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:07,620
Complement becomes activated causes systemic inflammation.

495
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:14,400
And if it's strong enough, if it can't stay. So that's a Type three.

496
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:20,459
And the last one is this delay type hypersensitivity.

497
01:05:20,460 --> 01:05:23,850
And a classic example of the delay type hypersensitivity.

498
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:29,880
It's poison ivy or contact a form of contact dermatitis.

499
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:34,980
So it's delayed because it takes it's the T cells that are involved.

500
01:05:36,330 --> 01:05:41,910
It can take one or two days to develop after exposure to an antigen that you may have experience with.

501
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:48,840
So contact dermatitis from poison ivy, it's a cell associated antigen.

502
01:05:51,240 --> 01:06:02,430
There's a delayed response and it's due to the time required to recruit the antigen specific T cells and other cells to that local area of exposure.

503
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:11,820
So here's the illustration that summarizes the type for response.

504
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:16,590
How many of you have gotten poison ivy or poison oak?

505
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:25,380
Just one person. So I'm noticing that as time goes on, I've been here for 23 years.

506
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:32,450
There are fewer and fewer people who get who have told me that they've experienced a rash from poison ivy.

507
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,809
How are people spending less time in the woods or is there something else going on?

508
01:06:36,810 --> 01:06:42,210
I don't know. So I've gotten really bad reactions to poison ivy.

509
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:48,540
I have memory t cells that recognize this complex.

510
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:52,650
So here's, here's some examples of different types of type four.

511
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:58,740
So it's a single antigen or a cell associated antigen.

512
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:06,960
It involves th1 or change two or four of this cytotoxic T cell, CD8 positive T cell.

513
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:12,690
And the effector mechanisms a little bit different here can be macrophage activated.

514
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:17,760
It could be an assassin, a field mediator, or it can be a cytotoxic t cell.

515
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:24,480
So with the macrophage activated the antigens on the surface of the macrophage,

516
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:30,090
it activates activates one response to get lots of chemokines and cytokines inside of toxins.

517
01:07:30,630 --> 01:07:36,510
And you get this reaction. And the classic example is dermatitis.

518
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:42,690
It could be an example of this that you might have experiences that divert during skin reaction.

519
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:48,570
How many of you had a TB test where they put the antigen under your skin?

520
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:57,000
Did you respond? No. Okay. In some international students, in some other countries,

521
01:07:57,780 --> 01:08:07,589
people are will have gotten a vaccine against tuberculosis and they'll get a response to this.

522
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:15,659
And this is what's going on. Okay. ath2 delayed type response involves change.

523
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:23,790
Two cytokines that activate the mast cells ultimately causing this inflammatory reaction.

524
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:32,640
And in this response you can have an allergic response in the lungs causing asthma.

525
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,220
It can happen in the nasal pharynx, causing congestion, nasal congestion.

526
01:08:40,290 --> 01:08:51,510
And then finally you have this cytotoxic t cell response where the T cell is recognizing this complex

527
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:59,790
of the antigen and that the cellular cell and the T cell is actually killing the epithelial cell.

528
01:09:00,630 --> 01:09:07,410
So when you're exposed to something like poison ivy, the,

529
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:19,380
the the lipid within the poison ivy becomes oxidized and it makes it very reactive and it can bind to your epithelial cells.

530
01:09:19,980 --> 01:09:34,650
And your immune system recognizes that complex of cell proteins and oxidized lipid from the poison ivy and your cells kill those epithelial cells,

531
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:38,100
the skin cells causing this contact dermatitis.

532
01:09:39,740 --> 01:09:40,040
Okay.

533
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:57,360
So here, here's some more descriptions of the three different types and other cells that are involved, a level of detail that I've already described.

534
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:03,000
But so now we've covered now we've covered in and adaptive immunity.

535
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:08,280
So we have now some foundation to proceed with the rest of the semester.

536
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:14,340
And what I want you to get from this is to think about things that you're interested in and study,

537
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:26,969
and then look at your the papers that you're interested in more closely with this serving as the basis for doing so.

538
01:10:26,970 --> 01:10:34,350
When you're when you're trying to determine whether or not a particular strategy consuming within

539
01:10:34,350 --> 01:10:41,040
your diet some kind of a micro macronutrient does that what does it do to these types of responses?

540
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:47,030
In other words. Okay. So one more thing before we end.

541
01:10:49,790 --> 01:11:01,520
So let me go back here to the home page, and I want to remind you that terms of reference.

542
01:11:02,390 --> 01:11:07,280
I've downloaded a PDF of that, the textbook, the ninth edition here.

543
01:11:07,290 --> 01:11:12,740
So if you click on the download, you can get the whole textbook. The other thing that.

544
01:11:13,400 --> 01:11:22,810
Nutrition. Immune function review paper. This paper gives you kind of an overview of different areas of nutrition and immunity.

545
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,580
And you could look at that for ideas for the projects that you want to work on.

546
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:35,730
Okay. Any questions or comments before we end for today?

547
01:11:37,500 --> 01:11:41,340
No. Okay. So the next time we meet,

548
01:11:41,340 --> 01:11:51,240
