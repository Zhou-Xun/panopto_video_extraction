1
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,390
All right. Good morning, everyone. Apologies. I'm running a few minutes late this morning.

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,710
I'm feeling the semester crunch is equally as you all are.

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:32,860
So today we're going to talk about aspects of climate and energy, but specifically focusing on impacts on health.

4
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,160
So from an exposure science perspective, we'll kind of set the stage.

5
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:43,390
I know that this is like a it's a very broad topic and I'm sure you are touching upon in many of your courses, if not already.

6
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,250
But but I want to oriented as we move on towards aspects of health.

7
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,959
Right. And the impacts on health.

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:59,140
And it's a little bit of a unique circumstance as a topic compared to some of the others that are much more direct that we've discussed.

9
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,930
But before we get into that, I had a couple of things I wanted to touch on.

10
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,940
One is the debates that are coming up, right?

11
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:16,720
So we're starting on the next class session on Thursday with our first set of debates.

12
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:23,919
And I was I was thinking a little bit on the question that actually Mesa asked in the previous course, right.

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,830
About is it fact based or are there other, you know, kind of like emotional aspects to consider?

14
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:34,120
And I answered, I think, pretty strongly, fact based. Right.

15
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:39,370
And I want that debate to make sure that that is the foundation of your arguments.

16
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,530
But I absolutely do not want to discourage you from having fun with it.

17
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,460
Right. I don't really want to encourage, like, trash talking per se.

18
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:53,260
But don't be afraid to kind of bring it right. The goal is to win the debate.

19
00:01:53,260 --> 00:02:03,370
And you are opponents on this stage. So to that extent, you know, yes, you can tap into, you know, aspects of this that, you know,

20
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:15,170
might give you a distinct advantage that maybe veer a little bit from not fiction versus fact, but but zero in on the realities, right.

21
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,500
Of some of the emotional ties to issues that can help kind of tip your argument.

22
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:23,890
So absolutely. Have fun with it.

23
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:31,329
I think I jokingly suggested to one of the teams like, you know, dressing in some sort of somatic, you know, team spirit.

24
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,720
I don't know what it's like. You know, don't be afraid to have fun with it.

25
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:40,060
That was also actually in response to a question. Are there any like dress expectations?

26
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:44,470
Absolutely not. I'm about as casual as you can get right in this class.

27
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,140
Don't feel the need to, you know, dress up. You're not being graded on your apparel by any means.

28
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:57,790
So anyway, with that said, are there any questions that have come up since last class period,

29
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,960
which has been a little bit of a break, right, since sort of Thanksgiving holiday?

30
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,030
You folks have any other questions regarding the upcoming class debates?

31
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,350
Okay. Fair enough. As usual.

32
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:22,650
Don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have questions.

33
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:29,500
I will try to be as responsive as possible over email if you feel like it's something your team needs to meet.

34
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:40,330
I'm happy to do a quick zoom. Just let me know if a second update is on the, uh, the class proposals.

35
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,140
I don't have them graded yet.

36
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,140
With apologies. I have most of them graded, but I'm not done.

37
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:56,070
And it's kind of my personal policy to not post grades until I have them all done so that everyone's receiving the grade at the same time.

38
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:02,489
Should be tomorrow at the latest that they'll be posted then in Thursday's class session.

39
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:08,880
I can I can get a little bit of an overview. Right. And kind of address in general how well posted and so forth.

40
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,050
So my apologies for that but forthcoming quickly.

41
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:19,590
And then actually related to that assignment, uh, for anyone who is interested.

42
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,870
This is actually an event being put on by the state of Michigan, right?

43
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,720
The folks that you were writing your mock proposal to.

44
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:38,640
Uh, so the department is Environment, Great Lakes and Energy and they have, it's their third annual Virtual Forest Summit.

45
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:47,940
And it's all types of stakeholders program managers, policy experts, researchers, contractors.

46
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:48,480
Right.

47
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:59,879
So basically the context with which you were writing this proposal, the people that are involved in this process and it's got participants are local,

48
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:10,530
state and federal government officials, consultants, vendors, academic researchers, students, industry and community organizations.

49
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,080
So a pretty interesting forum. It's a it's a multi-day summer fit to the seven.

50
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,450
And the registration deadline is the end of this week on December 2nd.

51
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:30,000
I was hugely bombed to see that it's like that they're charging a fee of $35 and that there's no, like student option.

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,620
Right? Like, okay, the industry and the consultants have to pay, but, you know, students don't.

53
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:41,280
I would expect that I'm disappointed about it. I would imagine there's a coupon code.

54
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:46,010
I don't know what the coupon code is. Yeah, I don't know either.

55
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,200
It's really interesting to participate in.

56
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:59,520
I would not hesitate to reach out to organizers and say, Hey, if there's any little students, you know, is there a waiver for the admission fee?

57
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,010
You over 20.

58
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:08,250
I want to put that out there. These are this is real stuff. Right. And this is I just is to illustrate how real it is.

59
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:15,270
And if you felt whatever engaged and a little bit interested more interested in the topic

60
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:20,520
after sinking your efforts into that proposal and want to continue to explore further.

61
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:30,120
This looks like a great opportunity. So with that, let's launch into climate and energy.

62
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,090
It impacts on health. So set the stage.

63
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,770
And again, most of this are much of this might already be familiar to you.

64
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:47,780
We'll talk about the basics now. What are our sources of energy that we depend upon and demand, basically?

65
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:54,770
And that can ultimately lead to adverse health effects associated with that production of energy.

66
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,480
Learn about the history of the scientific background of this issue.

67
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,770
Understanding what does it actually mean for something to be called a greenhouse gas?

68
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:09,710
And how do we know that it's not adversely affected by it?

69
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,780
And then to gain an understanding of some of the challenges.

70
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:19,730
Right. Not just where we are now, but but looking forward into the future.

71
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:28,340
And and how do we approach that? What are some of our strategies as exposure scientists, as environmental health experts?

72
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,770
Looking forward, we already looked at this slide in the context of urban smog, right in that air pollution lecture.

73
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:42,649
It just kind of brings it home or brings the point back home about fossil fuel emissions

74
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:49,700
really being the basic foundation of so many of these environmental health exposure issues.

75
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:55,650
There's a little bit of a difference in that, you know, urban smog, PPM and ozone.

76
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,570
We talked about that.

77
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:05,540
These are things that we're directly inhaling right through that route of exposure, causing a direct health effect for atmospheric deposition,

78
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:12,680
things like mercury or persistent organics in bioaccumulation or often eating, for example, fish.

79
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,689
So through that ingestion route or directly being impacted and having adverse

80
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:23,480
impacts on our health for indoor air pollution and especially household pollution,

81
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:30,890
which we will talk about, or it's Thursday or I think it's next week, one of the lectures next week, a half lecture.

82
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,890
Again, it's direct inhalation, right?

83
00:08:34,910 --> 00:08:43,300
And causing the impact on health. With climate change issues related to greenhouse gas emissions.

84
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:49,239
They fit into this being from from an exposure pathway perspective.

85
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:56,980
Right. It's the same sources. It's the fossil fuel combustion and it's itself those emissions being emitted into the atmosphere.

86
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:06,309
Right. As a major environmental pathway. But there's very little about those greenhouse gas emissions that's causing a direct impact on our health.

87
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,490
Right. We're not ingesting those greenhouse gas emissions.

88
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,170
We're not inhaling them. It's not that they're coming into contact with our skin.

89
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,230
It's much more indirect that those health effects are able to be kind of manifested.

90
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:25,270
So that that'll be kind of the focus of where we'll end the lecture with today.

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:42,190
And I'm really happy to say, based on a comment from he challenging my 2007 ish raid plot, I updated that on the slide here that we're looking at now.

92
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:51,220
So this is a much more recent citation put out by the same organization, the US Energy Information Administration,

93
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:58,360
but it's their most recent energy outlook published in 2021, but it's looking at similar data.

94
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:07,540
So to kind of reset the stage over here on the left, we're looking at primary energy consumption by sources.

95
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:10,600
And this is for for the whole world, not just for the US.

96
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:19,900
And you can see not just the magnitude right on the left, but then also the trend over the recent decade.

97
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:27,700
But then the projection, uh, going out a few more decades at the top is petroleum, right?

98
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:32,590
So this is primarily our transportation energy demand.

99
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:42,249
Uh, below that currently is coal in terms of magnitude, in terms of projections looking relatively stable,

100
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:48,819
slightly decreasing, but over time actually beginning to slightly increase again.

101
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,850
And we'll talk about coal more specifically here in a few minutes.

102
00:10:52,750 --> 00:11:05,260
Down here is nuclear has always been relatively low as a fraction of energy production or consumption and is projected to remain relatively stable.

103
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:09,520
And then renewables over here that make up a relatively small fraction,

104
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:16,210
but of course, are being projected to dramatically increase over the coming decades.

105
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:29,110
And then similar data is plotted a different way here to snapshots in time current basically being 2020 and the projection being out to 2050.

106
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:38,500
And I just wanted to kind of reiterate the same point that I made using that older slide with older data is that, you know, if you look at renewables,

107
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:52,750
right, I'm just going to eyeball it about 15% rate of current energy consumption compared to, you know, what is almost entirely fossil fuel sources.

108
00:11:53,440 --> 00:12:01,090
And then projecting that out to 2050 or making big leaps in renewables, nuclear is relatively stable.

109
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:07,149
But again, the vast majority, even decades from now, the projection is as a world right,

110
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:12,820
that we're going to continue to be relying on these fossil fuel sources for energy.

111
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,680
So what does that mean? Right.

112
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:20,920
So we're going to we're going to kind of step back and go through some history and then end with the present and looking forward to the future.

113
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:26,620
And and what are some approaches that we need to consider in terms of how to manage this?

114
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,990
Uh, let's see. These were a couple of more updated slides that I pulled in.

115
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:38,770
Okay, so this is looking at starting to explain why there is that trend, uh,

116
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:50,240
for the world is that if you break it down by basically high income countries compared to low and middle income countries,

117
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,410
there are different trends in terms of projections over time.

118
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,299
So this is looking at, again, energy consumption and it's breaking it out by region.

119
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:05,690
But I'm really just going to kind of focus on the total here. You know, maybe slight increases over time.

120
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:14,900
And, you know, much of this can be tied to just, you know, continuing increase in population and demand for energy.

121
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:23,990
But the plot over here on the right, when we look specifically at low and middle income countries, massive amounts of development.

122
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:34,250
Right? These are countries that are in developing stages of huge, uh, investments in infrastructure building and so forth.

123
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:43,030
So much higher demand, but at the same time, much less access to renewable sources of energy in the meantime, right.

124
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,760
So much a much higher dependance on those fossil fuels.

125
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:51,170
And so those projections. Right. You can see the very different slope here,

126
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:59,990
much higher rate of increase over time in terms of energy demand and projected

127
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:04,820
consumption over the coming decades in those low and middle income countries.

128
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:12,530
And so that is what is driving this kind of world trend over time, over the same time frame.

129
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:21,350
Yeah. And it kind of comes back to this concept of the energy ladder, which has been pretty well documented.

130
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:29,180
Kids got a question or comment? Yeah. Sorry if we can go back to the the different types of the one before I.

131
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,960
I'm not meaning to pick apart your crossover, but I just think like, you know,

132
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,020
all graphs have some amount of political agenda to them based on who's creating them.

133
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:46,979
And I'm curious if like coal starts dipping and then it's like, Oh, nope, we're going to go bounce back.

134
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,250
And it's the U.S. and Energy Information Administration.

135
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:56,940
It's I'm wondering how much of that is coming from, like, U.S. industry pressures to like.

136
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:02,280
Oh, well, it was just the pandemic that dropped the demand for coal.

137
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,669
And we're going to increase it again. Right.

138
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:16,290
Right. Because I remember like 2020, the U.S. Energy Information Administration probably was appointed by Trump and he was very pro-coal.

139
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,530
So I'm just wondering if you ever.

140
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,540
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, the. Let's see.

141
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:31,840
What's a. And an example to state that there's probably, you know, continued confidence in this.

142
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:39,640
It's actually going back to that, uh, that the 2007 slide that I presented, right?

143
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,069
So that's going back a long time ago. Completely removing, right.

144
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:49,330
You know, current concerns about who was appointed or who was influencing or whatever.

145
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,760
And it's, you know, it's basically the same projections that have been in place for for quite a while now.

146
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,240
They've been refined. I just think that dip in that back.

147
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,720
Back. Yeah. It's interesting. It was it was real.

148
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:09,819
I mean, the the shutdowns that occurred for the pandemic really dramatically reduced that demand from energy.

149
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,360
It was short lived, but it was absolutely real.

150
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:19,870
And it was seen in the environment like air quality monitors, you know,

151
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:30,820
the levels of air pollution being measured dropped dramatically in some of these mega cities in Asia, where the sun is very rarely seen.

152
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:38,799
Suddenly, like the skies were cleared and it was like people were talking about how they're seeing the sun rise and blue sky or,

153
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:47,350
you know, the first time in their lives, literally after, you know, living in Delhi or Beijing, you know, for for many years.

154
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:56,379
So that the dip was real as a result of the pandemic and kind of the shutdowns in place.

155
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,020
And so the you know, the the projections going forward aren't aren't unrealistic.

156
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:11,290
And they're not driven by U.S. demand or expected expected demand or consumption of coal.

157
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,520
I mean, it's mostly driven by these projections and in low and middle income countries, developing nations.

158
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,910
Is that a variant fair answer. Okay.

159
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:28,460
Now, cool. Thanks for. And yeah, this is like, let's talk about this.

160
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:36,270
Yeah. Rebecca I noticed the, um, the footnote says the petroleum and other liquids includes biofuels.

161
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:43,440
Biofuels, like things like biofuels and like ethanol, like they're included in petroleum and other liquids.

162
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,500
But do they have the same effect as like fossil fuels?

163
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,579
They do, uh, in terms of greenhouse gases.

164
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:56,070
Yeah. And I mean, this is, these plots are focused on this is something to clarify as we go forward.

165
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:01,080
These are focused on, uh, energy sources, right?

166
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,970
That can be contributing.

167
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:11,160
There are absolutely other emissions that are considered to be greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to climate change,

168
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:20,370
that are not coming from energy consumption. Uh, so there's a whole right, I mean, just methane from, from, uh, agriculture, right?

169
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:23,490
Cows. These are, these are major things to consider.

170
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,059
Um, so it's coming back around to yeah.

171
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:39,960
So biofuels is included, uh, but as a fraction, I mean, it's, it's really petroleum that's making up the, I mean, the vast majority of that category.

172
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:47,969
And so, um, if biofuels have like the same effect, it's like, why are they promoted?

173
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:54,330
It's like, yeah, yeah. It's, um, companies don't want to go out of business.

174
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:00,389
There's got to be a, well, there's the, it's actually real estate and, and we'll get into it.

175
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:06,360
We'll talk about some of the health effects before we transition to just, uh, changing climate impacts on health.

176
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:12,180
But with some of these and, you know, natural gas, there's been a big investment in natural gas, right?

177
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:15,610
We'll talk a little bit next week about, uh, fracking, right?

178
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:23,790
Hydrologic fracturing and what has really, uh, increased, uh, as an industry over the last decade,

179
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:32,760
ten or 15 years, that natural gas has been seen as, uh, a transition source of energy, right?

180
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,790
It is arguably better than coal.

181
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,399
We'll talk about coal here in a minute.

182
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:45,240
In terms of the health direct health effects that are caused by its emissions, but strictly from a greenhouse gas perspective,

183
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:50,820
very, very minimal of any benefit between natural gas and coal comparatively.

184
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,710
So biofuels would kind of fit into that category as a transition source of energy.

185
00:19:56,870 --> 00:20:02,820
You can put forth a realistic argument that they are less impactful on, on health.

186
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,750
Um, but from a greenhouse gas perspective, you know, minimally any better.

187
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:18,719
The director of the US EIA at that time at that time from 2018 to 2021 before that

188
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:24,260
worked for Marathon Oil and specifically piloted the Canadian tar sands mining,

189
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:34,340
so to speak, for sure. Yeah, there's, there's a lot, uh, here and it's again when the 2022 report comes out, you know,

190
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:45,419
I'm not expecting there to be any monumental changes and projections just in terms of the politics always are shaping these things,

191
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:48,990
whether or not that's my guess. Now it's others.

192
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:57,300
You know, this is getting back to just what's what's promoting or negating rate changes in these categories.

193
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:08,370
And it's an uphill battle, right, for in that renewables category for on many uh levels with just within the U.S.

194
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,980
Right. It's for the longest time it's not been economically feasible.

195
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,960
Right. That as an industry, as a up the profit margins aren't fair, right.

196
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:28,020
They cost more to produce renewable energy than it does to produce energy with, you know, more traditional means like burning coal or natural gas.

197
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:34,710
So it's required, you know, government subsidy to to promote that and to help grow that.

198
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:38,040
That's just looking at like a US centric view.

199
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:45,899
There's also the worldwide consideration, right, when when we talk about low and middle income countries,

200
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:49,170
but these are not this is not a small fraction of the world's population.

201
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:55,380
It's the majority of the world's population. Right, that fits into that low and middle income country status.

202
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:04,860
So there are, there are a lot of, uh, barriers, challenges to tipping, to further tipping this at a faster rate,

203
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,390
right, in terms of renewables compared to more traditional fossil fuel.

204
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,530
Okay. We made the point on that one in terms of high income countries versus low and middle income.

205
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:28,500
Okay. So the energy ladder, so this this concept, this has been pretty pretty well-studied and documented that in general,

206
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:39,090
socioeconomic development is a precursor to energy sources that are more efficient,

207
00:22:39,210 --> 00:22:46,260
cleaner, further from the receptor and that have delayed impact on health.

208
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,580
Right. So at the lowest kind of socio economic development.

209
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,810
So again, this is kind of following on that low and middle income country slide.

210
00:22:55,560 --> 00:23:09,540
Things like crop residue, animal dung are used for, you know, very localized heating and cooking wood being one charcoal, kerosene.

211
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:17,250
And then we finally start to get up to more traditional wide scale production of all electricity that's used.

212
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,530
But it's not until that development has gone pretty far down.

213
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:29,450
The timeline that we get into basically non fossil fuels and sources of energy, right?

214
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:33,390
So here's nuclear getting with it and then renewables at the very top.

215
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:45,550
Okay. So here's the the point I wanted to make about coal is that the projections, right,

216
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:57,460
is that coal consumption will continue to increase, although relatively slightly on a global basis over time.

217
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:09,970
And why why is that an issue? Uh, this is looking at the US, uh, primary pollutants that we're concerned about.

218
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:17,380
One being carbon dioxide. This is generally from a climate change perspective, right?

219
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:22,959
For the most part, CO2 that's emitted into the atmosphere is not a risk to us as people for like inhalation.

220
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:31,570
Right. Or any other route of exposure. Or the other three are sulfur dioxide is toxic for us to be exposed to it.

221
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:36,730
Nitrogen oxides can be directly. They also contribute to the ozone formation.

222
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:40,570
Right. That we're inhale. And then mercury as something that we ingest.

223
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:47,890
So if you look at emissions from all electric generating power plants plotted in yellow.

224
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:56,540
And then look at how much of the contributions of each of those four pollutants comes from specifically power plants and coal.

225
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,170
You can see the major contributor, right?

226
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,800
It's coal. This the major contributor of CO2 from power plants.

227
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:08,450
The major contributor to CO2, nitrogen oxides and mercury.

228
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,960
So for this reason, this is what supports.

229
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:19,390
Utilization of some intermediate sources of energy like natural gas.

230
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:27,070
Right. Natural gas is cleaner burning and that it has much less of these pollutants that we are concerned about.

231
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,750
It's still emitting greenhouse gases. It's still an issue in terms of climate change.

232
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:37,240
Same explanation for the biofuels that that Rebecca was remarking about.

233
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:43,810
So so coal is at the very top of the it's bad for us out of the fossil fuels.

234
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,590
Could I see your hand going up again?

235
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:56,340
And I'm like, I am interested in what methane would also look like on this graph, because they know that natural gas emits a lot of methane.

236
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,570
And doesn't methane also partially degrade into other greenhouse gases?

237
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:11,760
Yes. Yeah. So this is you know, the point of this slide is really to focus on those direct exposure and impacts on health,

238
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:18,080
where coal is clearly far and away above all of the other fossil fuels in terms of adverse impacts.

239
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:25,290
All right. And then just to lay out a couple of those, too, to set the stage, uh, we're concerned about,

240
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,930
you know, documented impacts on, on health as well as ecological effects.

241
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,000
Here's, here's petroleum and things that we know adversely impact our health.

242
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,330
There's coal that we just talked about here is natural gas of the biomass.

243
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:51,190
So, you know, impacts from using hydrological power and then, you know, nuclear power, there's a type of cougar.

244
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,130
Um, so, you know, nothing.

245
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:04,740
Nothing is perfect, right? But things are better. There's that there's clear differences between energy sources and those being better than others.

246
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,740
All right. So let's take a step back a little bit and make sure we're all on the same page.

247
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:18,149
I'm sure everyone's heard of the greenhouse effect. And just to make sure that we all understand it, we talked a little bit, right,

248
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,880
about air pollution and health and the atmosphere and the layers of the atmosphere and how this works.

249
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:32,040
But specific to the greenhouse effect, right? We have this solar radiation coming in through the atmosphere.

250
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:44,180
And we learned earlier that most of that radiation is absorbed by the earth's surface and then it's given back off in the form of infrared.

251
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:49,560
Right. So if you remember, the atmosphere warms from the surface up.

252
00:27:49,920 --> 00:28:05,040
Right. And then there is a healthy amount of natural greenhouse gases that exist in the atmosphere from from natural sources.

253
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:06,900
And without them,

254
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:17,100
all of that radiation would just go back up to space and the surface of our planet would be so cold that it wouldn't be habitable for us.

255
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:27,390
So having some amount of natural levels of greenhouse gas to absorb that infrared energy in the form of heat is what makes it habitable.

256
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:34,260
It keeps it at a reasonable temperature and moves places across the surface of the earth.

257
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:41,790
So what's happening is that we're adding to those gases that kind of fit this category of being greenhouse,

258
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:46,320
those that absorb that energy that's being given off from the Earth's surface.

259
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:58,560
So more of that piece is being trapped within the lower lowest level of the atmosphere and not being released out into into space.

260
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:07,740
So this is what is causing overall a warming of the of the earth's surface and the atmosphere right above it.

261
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:14,770
Is that does that make sense? Are we all on the same page with that? Okay.

262
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:25,690
So now let's look at some some data or even some surrogates or proxies of data going back a long, long way.

263
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,580
When you start actually on this, the plot over here on the right. So this is looking at.

264
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,050
Estimates of global mean surface temperature.

265
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:46,700
So this is a high temperature variable or metric that's used by a lot of the folks to study a changing climate.

266
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,080
So it's the average temperature across the entire surface of the earth.

267
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:55,100
Right. And how is that changing over time?

268
00:29:55,220 --> 00:30:04,490
So there is over here on the right is estimating for the past 1000 years, this particular one is looking at the northern hemisphere in particular,

269
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:15,200
and it's comparing it relative to the average concentration of the Earth's surface from 1961 to 1990.

270
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,810
So going back a thousand years, it was actually less than that 30 year average.

271
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:31,290
But very recently, right, this is about the year 1900s and the early 1900s, it starts to dramatically increase, increase, increase, increase.

272
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:40,460
And going further up. There are a couple of different colors on this plot, red meaning direct temperatures,

273
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:46,310
which are only happening more recently since the 19th, early 1900s.

274
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:50,480
And we actually have the technology to measure what the temperature is.

275
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:58,880
And then the blue on this plot that goes back a thousand years is termed proxy data.

276
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:06,120
So where where are the estimates coming from, going back a thousand years for this blue line?

277
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:20,930
Ice cores? Yeah, absolutely. So scientists in this field are actually able to take cores out of ice and using different isotopes.

278
00:31:21,290 --> 00:31:25,100
Isotopic analysis of that core are able to date.

279
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,870
Right. How far back within each layer of that core.

280
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:37,670
And then with measurements of CO2 and other things, they're able to estimate what the temperature was in that point in time.

281
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:44,870
So basically able to kind of reconstruct temperature as a global mean surface temperature.

282
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,610
Going back a long way.

283
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:54,320
Okay, so let's focus in over here on the left during the time period where we actually have those direct measurements of temperature.

284
00:31:55,250 --> 00:32:04,280
Okay. So we're looking at late 1800s and then we get into the early 1900s and we start to see this kind of upward slope.

285
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,749
Right. We're at about that average, I mean, which is kind of artificially defined.

286
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:13,730
Right. 1961 to 1990 and the earlier periods that were hovering right about there.

287
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:21,680
And then we get to about 1980 and we see just another really sharp turn and we're increasing, increasing going forward.

288
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,920
Looking at the same type of data.

289
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:35,579
So this is going back, uh, about a thousand years a red is that temperature change, right?

290
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:41,250
So it was kind of cruising along until we get to the 1900s and it's going up dramatically.

291
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:46,350
We can look at CO2 concentrations again estimated from those ice cores.

292
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:54,480
They're relatively stable, right, until we get to about the late 1800s, early 1900s, and then increase dramatically.

293
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:59,340
And then we can estimate also carbon emissions over that time.

294
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:08,580
Once they get to that late 1800s, early 1900s, carbon emissions increasing quite dramatically and then plotted in this kind of,

295
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:13,379
I don't know, pink salmon color is the contribution of fossil fuels.

296
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:16,560
That fraction of fossil fuels in those carbon emissions. Right.

297
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,389
Is also dramatically increasing. So very coincident data, right.

298
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:28,680
We have this huge increase in fossil fuels that are being combusted to meet energy demands and this

299
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:34,890
resulting increase in CO2 concentrations and coincident increases in global mean surface temperature.

300
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,650
Uh, looking at things a couple of different ways.

301
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:46,020
This is some of it looking at CO2, some of it looking at other gases.

302
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:52,649
So if we kind of break things out, uh, we talked about there, there are multiple greenhouse gases, right?

303
00:33:52,650 --> 00:34:04,920
Contributing to this issue. CO2 specifically from fossil fuels is, is the biggest contributor making up over half our other sources of CO2.

304
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:11,640
Right. Some of them, uh, perhaps even natural in terms of a source.

305
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:17,700
Deforestation is a big one. Okay, we talked about biomass.

306
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:22,260
Uh, it's kind of an other bunch, all other little contributors,

307
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:32,700
but that combined are significant methane that was mentioned earlier is absolutely a greenhouse gas of concern and nitrous oxide and others.

308
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:41,270
So with with, you know, taking CO2 as being the biggest right about three quarters or so of greenhouse gas emissions.

309
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:51,990
Uh, let's look over here. What our, uh, actually, before we jump to CO2, this is still all greenhouse gases, but emissions by source.

310
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:58,710
So what are the source types or source categories that are contributing to these, as we've already talked about,

311
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:07,860
um, energy, transportation, um, residential and commercial buildings, industry, agriculture, forestry.

312
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:14,040
And then this is an interesting one. We could talk a long time about this and maybe if we have time we can circle back to it.

313
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:22,320
But it's also interesting to look at it by region or even by country and kind of who are the biggest contributors?

314
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:26,880
Uh, China is certainly large. The US is certainly large.

315
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:31,950
Uh, collectively the European Union, uh, relatively large.

316
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,180
And then smaller contributions right from Russia.

317
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:43,379
India, although is growing Canada, Japan and then basically excuse me the rest of the world.

318
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:49,709
And this one is specific to to CO2. But it's a relevant question to ask.

319
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:57,900
Like, okay, we're looking at that, looking at this point in time, at a very recent point in time, how did that look historically?

320
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:03,660
If you go back 50 years or so, so if we have time, we can circle back to that.

321
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:13,640
So yeah. So this is the slide that Kate was asking as the class was starting, you know, why did I pick, uh, 2013?

322
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:21,170
Because there have been subsequent IPCC assessment reports that have been published.

323
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:27,170
And the reason is that this was really the point in time that that up until then,

324
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:35,820
when people talked about climate change or actually the, you know, the the original term was global warming, right?

325
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:41,390
That it was used both in kind of scientific and military audiences and discussions.

326
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,550
And while it's true, right, that global mean surface temperature is increasing.

327
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,530
So global warming,

328
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:57,410
it didn't resonate with people on regional scales because the reality was it's impacting different regions of the globe very differently.

329
00:36:57,810 --> 00:37:06,020
Right. There are actually some regions that are experiencing record low temperatures still as a result of the change in climate,

330
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:15,169
as a result of that global warming and what individuals are experiencing or in or communities are experiencing is actually on a colder extreme right,

331
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:17,360
which doesn't resonate or perhaps doesn't make sense.

332
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:27,590
So that nomenclature evolved from global warming as being the issue to climate change, as being the issue as perhaps a more accurate one,

333
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:34,280
because not every place is experiencing, you know, warming equally or to the same extent.

334
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,350
What is the other point I want to make?

335
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:46,760
Oh, the other one is that and most of you are probably not old enough to appreciate this, but it was thought of as a as a debate.

336
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,560
You know, the climate change debate is climate change is real.

337
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:56,060
You know what what are the causes of it? Who's responsible, who's not?

338
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,100
It's all made up, you know, by liberals, whatever the explanation was.

339
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:05,510
But it was promoted as as a topic to debate.

340
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:15,600
And the reason that I chose this, this 2013 citation is because this is really when, uh, that debate was put to rest, right?

341
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,180
That it was conclusive.

342
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:32,390
This was 237, uh, experts on the topic from around the world that reached these consensus statements that were put out as part of this IPCC report.

343
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:39,310
New and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed over the last 150 years.

344
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:44,000
Right. So this is kind of focusing in on this time period here.

345
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:53,000
Is attributable to human activities, right. Things that we are doing as a as a global society.

346
00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:01,640
Warming in the last 2000 years is unusual, and it's unlikely to be from entirely from natural origin.

347
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:10,340
Natural forcings alone can explain that very recent and substantial warming that's occurred even in the most recent decades.

348
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:14,600
And this is where the model projections, which we'll talk about, 90 minutes,

349
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:23,360
are very clearly predicted that temperature and sea level are going to continue to rise under all scenarios.

350
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:31,820
Right. Whatever emission reduction strategy is put forth, we're going to pass the point of no return and that this is coming regardless.

351
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:40,910
Yeah. So this, you know, this report, uh, basically establish that the debate is over.

352
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:43,729
There's no longer any reason to doubt.

353
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:52,700
You know, here's the number 259 authors representing 39 countries that reached this consensus opinion statements.

354
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,320
And then, yeah, here's the plot that I wanted to show. And it's you can't see it.

355
00:39:57,330 --> 00:40:01,530
It's a lot of business going on here, but I can explain what it is.

356
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:09,660
So here's our temperature record going back a thousand years and then we get this more recent increase.

357
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:17,909
And then, you know, again, what these what these experts within the field of climate science and climate change,

358
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:24,899
you know, using these very sophisticated models, are able to change the emission reduction scenarios.

359
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:33,299
Right. So going from there, some magic technological breakthrough and we're able to literally just turn off the faucet.

360
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:41,310
Right. And we're no longer emitting any greenhouse gases from from fossil fuels or anything related to human activity.

361
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:48,809
That's like a best case scenario compared to at the other end, a worst case scenario,

362
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:53,610
which is basically the status quo, like doing nothing to change the dynamic,

363
00:40:53,670 --> 00:41:01,980
you know, continuing to utilize fossil fuels as they happen and then a bunch of scenarios that are kind of in between those two extremes.

364
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:11,790
So that's what's represented here. These different color bars on the chart represent those different emission reduction scenarios.

365
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:20,909
The one at the top here that shows the most dramatic global mean surface temperature increase is the status quo.

366
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:27,510
Do nothing, change nothing, scenarios that best case scenario magically, technologically,

367
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:35,070
turn off the faucet and we no longer have human related greenhouse gas emissions.

368
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:43,170
That's the one here at the bottom. It still shows this very dramatic increase in temperature going forward out to the year 2100.

369
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:52,830
So the message is right. Yes, we need to continue to try to address this problem because we don't want to be here.

370
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,860
But we also at the same time need to face the realities that even best case, we're still going to end up here.

371
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:02,549
Yes. Okay. He has an other alternative explanation.

372
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:11,070
No, I don't have an alternative explanation. I also just want to add that all of those reject higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius of warming,

373
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:16,020
which is one the target that we're apparently somehow going to meet by doing nothing.

374
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:25,800
And 1.5 degrees is used from under IPCC report because that is the temperature

375
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,360
at which we still see massive amounts of sea level rise and other things.

376
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:35,660
But we can still sort of like maintain humanity the way that is often discussed.

377
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:39,210
And so all of those are above them.

378
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:47,100
Absolutely. That's a great point. And we we will get to break we'll talk about sea level rise and other concerns and where this,

379
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:53,640
you know, indirectly is causing harm to us as people from an exposure perspective.

380
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:57,930
But yes, that's an excellent point and I'll try to draw it up. I know that's it's pretty small.

381
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:03,270
Here's 1.5 degrees departure rate from that base.

382
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:10,020
And every one of those scenarios, even the best case is pointing it above that point.

383
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:21,090
And the 1.5 degree increase is looked at as a level that, you know what, we can still kind of manage this.

384
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,300
Uh, and so we're, we're above that.

385
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:32,160
So it's going to take extreme measures in order to be able to, to have a chance to manage it, as that may be the way to interpret that.

386
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:45,560
So right on cue. Here is some global mean sea level data going back over kind of a similar time period, right, 150 years ish.

387
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:51,880
And we have we've been measuring this for a long time.

388
00:43:51,890 --> 00:44:00,680
So we have this tidal gate data which shows right. In a very clear increase right over that 150 years ish period.

389
00:44:00,830 --> 00:44:05,180
What's that from? How is this happening? Why is sea level increasing?

390
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:17,959
You guys know this? Ice melting.

391
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:21,500
Yeah. So we have glaciers, ice caps, polar ice caps melting.

392
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:27,470
Right. So from that. Very gradual, very consistent increase in global mean surface temperature.

393
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:33,070
We have our polar ice caps, glaciers and so forth that are melting.

394
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:36,320
Where does that water go? It goes into all of the world's oceans.

395
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,010
It's slowly rising, raising its sea level.

396
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:45,470
So this is very well documented as well going back over that timeframe.

397
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,790
Uh, why is that a problem?

398
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:56,360
Um, no. And I did go back and look and I can't remember because I tried to quote this rate from an air pollution perspective,

399
00:44:56,390 --> 00:45:02,510
the percent of people that live within X distance of a of a coast,

400
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:12,500
what 40% might be in the notes in the slide, 40% of the world's population lives within a hundred kilometers of an ocean coast.

401
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:18,800
So anyway, lots of lots of people. Right. That are vulnerable to sea level rise.

402
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,940
So. Right, so literal inundation of water.

403
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:29,120
Also importantly is salinization of of coastal aquifers.

404
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:35,510
Right. So freshwater drinking sources being tainted by seawater.

405
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:42,560
This is looking at against some of the more modern data.

406
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:52,940
Starting from that 1950s time period, looking at measured levels of CO2 and the way that this is measured is,

407
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:58,880
you know, not at my backyard hour here on the UVM campus.

408
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:06,230
This is going to areas that are very representative of global mean a global circulation.

409
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:16,640
And so global warming levels of CO2. These are from the observatory on top of Mauna Loa, which is a mountain in Hawaii.

410
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:21,380
The volcano, in fact, is erupting now. That was the news headline that I read yesterday.

411
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:31,370
But it's not like at the peak is, I don't know, like 13,000 feet above sea level and it's out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

412
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,640
And so it's quite representative of the hemispheric levels of CO2.

413
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:47,810
So we see this very consistent increase since the 1950s, and this is a really cool image.

414
00:46:47,810 --> 00:46:51,770
It's actually a loop, and I'll explain what it is. We can watch it a couple of times,

415
00:46:53,030 --> 00:47:02,340
but what it does so it's the point here is that let's kind of shift from talking about global mean surface temperature increases, right?

416
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:08,750
That kind of slow change as a mean for the whole earth and start to zero in on it.

417
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,940
It doesn't impact the whole Earth equally.

418
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:18,260
There are different regions of the globe that are more and less impacted and different types of impact, and we're kind of get into those.

419
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:25,340
But to start this, this is a really cool simulation. It is plotting temperature and there's a.

420
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:31,880
A chart scale here that I might put it up at, like with the bar there.

421
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:39,560
Um, basically, darker blues are cooler and orange and reds are warmer.

422
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:45,380
So when we look at on the, on the graph here, you know, the darkest blue is looking at cooler temperatures.

423
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:50,570
And then as we get into yellows and oranges and eventually reds, it's warmer temperatures.

424
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,580
And as this loop plays, the year is going to change.

425
00:47:54,590 --> 00:47:59,810
So it starts at 1884 and that's a more recent year, like 2011 or so.

426
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:04,880
And then the colors will change with each passing year. So I'll play it at least twice.

427
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:35,950
Wow. Like just those last couple of decades, the most recent decades.

428
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:41,049
How dramatic that moves. The reds, right.

429
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:50,680
Are the northern hemisphere is is bearing a higher brunt in terms of a mean temperature compared to the southern hemisphere.

430
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:56,230
And then you see particular regions. Right. That are are increasing faster than others.

431
00:48:56,620 --> 00:49:02,080
I'll play it one more time. Isn't the northern hemisphere because there's more land and water?

432
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:27,070
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

433
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:32,590
So, you know, at least one basic takeaway from this is that while the average temperature,

434
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:38,560
the mean temperature of the earth is slowly increasing over time on a regional scale,

435
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:43,390
some regions are increasing in temperature faster than other regions.

436
00:49:43,870 --> 00:49:54,250
And so there really are regional changes. And again, the reason for why the term climate change is probably more appropriate versus global warming.

437
00:49:55,030 --> 00:50:03,400
Global warming is accurate. And I think the slide basically is just restating what I just said.

438
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,840
It's not really just global warming. It really is a change in climate.

439
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:13,840
So this is a a busy plot over here on the right,

440
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:23,799
but it's showing that it's not just that we have the experience from individuals is not that this year is,

441
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,280
you know, 0.1 degrees warmer than last year. Right.

442
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:38,700
It's that the extremes in the take on each end, not just warmer but also colder, are part of our reality.

443
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:45,130
And part of it is from those melting ice caps at the poles.

444
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:59,170
The meteorology locally in the polar regions is generally very tight and so the circulation at the poles keeps the cool air in the polar regions,

445
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:02,710
keeps the water frozen there. Right.

446
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:12,430
And so with with the the mean temperature of the earth warming, but then also with different regions warming faster than others,

447
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:19,390
it's really throwing literally throwing a loop to that circulation over the polar regions.

448
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:24,220
And you get these big kinks and things kind of start to fall apart and sort of being a tight circle,

449
00:51:24,490 --> 00:51:28,600
it starts to kind of like wobble into more of like an amoeba shaped circulation.

450
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:38,110
And so what used to be cold air that just stayed over the poles is now coming down in the northern hemisphere to further southern latitudes.

451
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:45,370
So even though the the average temperature is increasing, even here in Michigan, we're getting these periods.

452
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:48,009
That's where the of the polar vortex rate don't know.

453
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:53,440
A couple of years ago we had like this extremely cold weather and it's impacted different regions of the globe.

454
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:58,180
Right. The North America getting it one winter, Europe getting it, you know, another winter.

455
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,700
But these these multi day periods where what would otherwise be cold air trapped at

456
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:07,840
the poles is able to kind of leak out and leak further into southern latitudes,

457
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:15,660
resulting in colder temperatures where we are. Right. And this was, you know, kind of helping to fuel some of the skepticism early on because, like,

458
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:20,930
how can people be talking about global warming when we're experiencing record low temperatures?

459
00:52:20,950 --> 00:52:24,490
Right. Doesn't make any sense. It's all you know, it's all a bunch of whatever.

460
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:30,459
There's there are scientific explanations for this. We are also and people realize this as well.

461
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:35,770
Right. We're having record warm temperatures with extreme heat events and so forth.

462
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,840
So let's see. I wanted to make a point about water scarcity.

463
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:48,280
This is one of the impacts of this regional change in climate and different regions being impacted more than others.

464
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:57,460
Warm air actually holds more moisture so could result in more precipitation.

465
00:52:59,290 --> 00:53:07,840
The contrast between warmth and cold depredation, which is also related to differences in pressure, is what creates wind.

466
00:53:08,470 --> 00:53:18,550
So we have more extreme wind scenarios. We already kind of talked about this melting of ice, really resulting in higher sea level.

467
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:24,880
It's changing ocean currents, which also impact atmospheric circulation and currents.

468
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:34,360
So the result is that we we have some areas or regions that are warmer, although are others that are actually colder over our very short term.

469
00:53:34,990 --> 00:53:39,270
And then some areas that are weather and then others that are dry.

470
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:46,960
Dry. Right. So we actually drought being experienced where areas that used to get more regular precipitation.

471
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:52,510
So so these are kind of some of the examples of the drivers that are getting closer.

472
00:53:52,600 --> 00:53:56,440
Now, how does this cause us adverse impacts on our health?

473
00:53:57,340 --> 00:54:03,010
Sticking with water. Right. So drought is becoming a bigger, bigger issue.

474
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:09,340
Water scarcity itself. This is looking at, oh, gosh, I can barely see it.

475
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:22,270
But basically like water availability projecting out this is 1961 to 1990 and the one down here is projecting out to the year 2017 or 2017.

476
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:27,640
And so where water scarcity as an issue is growing, right.

477
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:28,930
Kind of US centric,

478
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:40,600
we know very well about the issues in the southwest part of the US and this is interesting is going back to Kate was talking about politics,

479
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:45,100
trying to think of which presidential primary it was.

480
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:49,600
Bill Richardson was maybe a governor of Arizona.

481
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:54,880
Anybody who's like really politically inclined, correct me if I'm wrong, because I'm spitballing this a little bit.

482
00:54:56,740 --> 00:55:01,630
I'm relatively. Sure he was a governor of a southwest state, probably Arizona.

483
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:05,200
And he was running as a as a presidential candidate. New Mexico.

484
00:55:05,410 --> 00:55:08,620
New Mexico. I just Googled and, you know, totally fact checked.

485
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:20,440
And this was this was part of his platform was basically building a pipeline from the Great Lakes to bring water to the southwest U.S.

486
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:24,920
That kind of whatever flew over. Right.

487
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:28,900
He wasn't a legitimate candidate. It wasn't a whole lot of attention given to it.

488
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:39,110
But in more recent years, right as this drought is is really getting worse by the year in the US West and wildfires rage.

489
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:44,560
I'm sure you've all read about, you know, the Colorado River Basin, right?

490
00:55:44,950 --> 00:55:52,720
The dam, it's reaching like critical levels to be able to support, you know, ends the millions of people across these regions.

491
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:56,350
And so it's becoming water scarcity is becoming more and more of an issue.

492
00:55:56,650 --> 00:56:02,980
And it's not just in what might previously been thought of as resource poor countries or areas.

493
00:56:03,310 --> 00:56:15,450
It's absolutely an issue right here in the US. This also has an impact on on food resources over time.

494
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:24,780
So this is looking at projected changes in agricultural productivity going out to the 2080s.

495
00:56:25,230 --> 00:56:34,440
So again, looking at the scale, greens are areas of increased productivity and then kind of orange and red are areas of decreased productivity.

496
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:39,059
So it's kind of easy to look at the U.S., you know.

497
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:45,270
Yes, with drought and increasing temperatures, we're looking at lower yields in the southwest part of the US.

498
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:57,040
But as we look at more of these temperate latitudes with with increases in temperature, perhaps we have a longer growing seasons, right?

499
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:01,620
The spring might come a little bit earlier. The winter might come a little bit later.

500
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:09,570
So agricultural yields in certain parts, typically more northern latitudes could actually be increasing.

501
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:15,870
So the impacts of changing climate are not equivalent on a regional scale.

502
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:24,750
This is a really great slide that kind of summarizes all of the potential impacts

503
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:32,070
from climate change directly on health and the potential to impact health adversely.

504
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:37,890
I won't go through all of it, but it does know it highlights air pollution.

505
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:42,360
I think there's a slide on that coming up. Severe weather. There's a slide on that coming up.

506
00:57:43,050 --> 00:57:48,480
Extreme heat. I actually got some of these covered environmental degradation.

507
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:55,370
Water and food supply impacts, water quality impacts, increases in allergens.

508
00:57:55,380 --> 00:58:05,850
Right. So while agricultural yields might be a benefit for those longer growing seasons, for those people that are impacted by allergens right now,

509
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:14,940
you have longer growing seasons of the plants and trees and whatever it is that produce those allergens and then changes in vector ecology.

510
00:58:14,950 --> 00:58:18,509
So yeah, actually have I think have a slide on most of these coming up.

511
00:58:18,510 --> 00:58:29,790
But we talk about mosquitoes. One of the big topics with DDT, but with those changes in temperature of regional scale,

512
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:36,690
it becomes areas that were previously not so inhabitable for mosquitoes are becoming more habitable.

513
00:58:36,690 --> 00:58:44,140
Right. And so our challenges or our risk for vector borne diseases increasing.

514
00:58:44,190 --> 00:58:48,150
All right. So let's touch on each of those or most of those briefly here.

515
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:52,230
Heat waves, extreme heat events. Right.

516
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:55,860
So kind of hitting our those tails. It's not just a slow warming.

517
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,810
We get these really big swings in extremes on a regional scale.

518
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:05,969
This is going back to one that's been very well studied in 2003,

519
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:17,100
extreme heat events during the month of August that impacted most of Europe and, you know, excess deaths that were calculated at 44,000 people.

520
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:22,530
And this is just looking at that single month of August of 2003.

521
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:27,930
What I have a note here.

522
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:35,670
It's not just the heat, right? We're going to talk about it, but with warmer temperatures, right.

523
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:41,610
If you remember back to that atmospheric chemistry, it's able to promote more of that secondary pollutant formation.

524
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:45,780
So more of the smog that we're worried about can be formed.

525
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:50,550
So it's kind of a double whammy. The warmer it gets, the more extreme heat people are exposed to.

526
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:56,770
But at the same time, the more pollution that can be generated, but then people are then co exposed to it.

527
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:07,800
It's a combination of the heat and the air pollution in terms of in terms of severe events, extreme weather like tornadoes.

528
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:14,140
We talked about the extreme winds. Hurricanes and typhoons.

529
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:19,930
This is very much related to changes in water temperature.

530
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:23,410
So just very slight changes in water temperature, right.

531
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:28,060
Due to the melting ice caps, a warming of those ocean currents.

532
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:36,100
There are very clear, documented but not well-understood thresholds.

533
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:43,240
In order for a hurricane to form the sea, surface temperature needs to be above 26 degrees Celsius.

534
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:48,760
There are some pretty good theories or hypotheses out there, but it's not totally understood why that's the case.

535
01:00:49,210 --> 01:00:52,900
But it's very well documented, which is one of the requirements.

536
01:00:53,410 --> 01:01:00,820
And so all it takes is just a slight change in sea surface temperature in the ocean to go from.

537
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:06,070
We can't have a hurricane forming to be in a place where now a hurricane can form.

538
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,480
So not just the frequency but also the severity.

539
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:17,470
The warmer the water, the more energy that feeds those storms and the more severe they become in terms of the amount of rainfall.

540
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,430
They can, at least in terms of the maximum winds that can be involved.

541
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,960
These photos here, it's just picking out one example.

542
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:33,280
This was technically a hurricane, but it kind of got a name of super storm because it was so late in the season.

543
01:01:34,790 --> 01:01:37,850
It was Hurricane Sandy or Superstorm Sandy.

544
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:42,800
This is going back to 2012. So very unusual.

545
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:49,600
Made its way all the way up the northeast coast. And these are pictures from, uh, the New York City coast.

546
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:55,840
So before and after. Right here is a traffic tunnel. Here's flooding and cars piled up all over the place.

547
01:01:56,140 --> 01:02:04,510
Here are a bridge going over a waterway. And then, you know, just an indication with with the storm surge washing out.

548
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,510
Similar images in Europe, right. There's so many examples.

549
01:02:07,950 --> 01:02:14,180
I think it was last the last year it was like Germany and areas of Central Europe just extruded not from hurricane,

550
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:19,180
just extreme flooding inundation from massive amounts of precipitation.

551
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:25,870
Uh, disease is a waterborne diseases, right?

552
01:02:26,350 --> 01:02:32,169
So we have, uh, from all of these increases in precipitation, we have more runoff, right?

553
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:39,130
So stuff that wouldn't otherwise be controlled is now able to get into water systems and taint them.

554
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:45,130
So having more exposures. Uh, of different, uh.

555
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:50,960
Waterborne diseases. We talked about the mosquitoes, the vector borne diseases.

556
01:02:51,650 --> 01:03:00,590
And so it was only a couple of decades ago, right, that we didn't have to be concerned about what some of these West Nile virus.

557
01:03:00,590 --> 01:03:06,410
Right. Is the locally speaking one that it's been a concern in Michigan, but just over the last ten years or so.

558
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:18,080
And it's because of the northern northward movement of mosquitoes that are now able to inhabit places that used to be too cold for them.

559
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:26,270
They're now supported by the warmer temperatures moving north and importantly.

560
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:29,450
Right. The diseases that that they bring with them.

561
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:38,680
Here's the slide on on air pollution. So as we have this warming rate, we also have the ability to even without changing the emissions.

562
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:43,100
Right. Same emissions from cars, energy production, whatever it is.

563
01:03:43,550 --> 01:03:52,280
But just by warming the atmosphere, it's able to produce and generate chemicals from those reactions at a higher rate.

564
01:03:52,400 --> 01:04:00,740
So we end up with higher levels of pollution. We also talked about an increase in allergens for longer growing seasons.

565
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:05,450
Uh, touching a little bit on policy here.

566
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:09,530
This is going back to the early 1990s.

567
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:18,680
There were a couple, there was one, the Rio convention, which adopted a an existing United Nations framework on climate change.

568
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:25,670
It became effective in 1994. There were 195 nations that basically signed on to this.

569
01:04:26,330 --> 01:04:31,950
And since then, there's been an annual conference of parties, right?

570
01:04:32,450 --> 01:04:38,569
That happens each year to basically review what everybody signed on, to assess the status of things,

571
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:42,530
what's the progress or the shortcomings, and what do we need to improve upon?

572
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:47,680
The most recent one just took place two weeks ago. Yes.

573
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:51,610
It just started two weeks ago, starting two weeks ago in Egypt.

574
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:55,540
I got quite a bit of press coverage.

575
01:04:55,630 --> 01:05:04,120
The one that folks are probably most familiar with was the one that took place in 2016 in Paris.

576
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:08,770
It took place in December in 2015. I was there.

577
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:16,150
That's the signing signing ceremony. But that that made some some big improvements.

578
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:20,830
Those assessments revisit the progress, what needs to be shored up.

579
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:34,860
There were substantial new commitments. Both for falling well short of what many people see as needed to be successful on this issue.

580
01:05:34,950 --> 01:05:38,909
But going back decades, right, since this Rio convention,

581
01:05:38,910 --> 01:05:48,389
adopting the U.N. framework in the early nineties was significant and is also a kind of a common reference point I think Kate was mentioning.

582
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:53,820
If you are going to go, you know, 1.5 degrees Celsius, it kind of goes back to you.

583
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:55,860
What were what were the agreements that came out of that?

584
01:05:56,550 --> 01:06:08,670
The Paris Climate Agreement, uh, kind of a parallel to that was the Kyoto Protocol in the slightly later 1990s,

585
01:06:09,330 --> 01:06:15,180
where developed countries and emerging markets promised to reduce their emissions of six

586
01:06:15,570 --> 01:06:26,400
important greenhouse gases to 5% below the levels of 1990 by the year 2008 and 2012,

587
01:06:27,990 --> 01:06:38,670
by the time we get to 2007, it was ratified by all of the UN parties except of course, the U.S. Canada withdrew in 2012.

588
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:46,620
Russia, Japan and U.S. New Zealand basically didn't commit to any new binding targets.

589
01:06:47,310 --> 01:06:54,960
Its its reductions were largely not achieved, and relatively speaking, it was not a successful policy endeavor.

590
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:00,350
All right. So we're moving along.

591
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:07,620
We have a few minutes left. I wanted to hit on this. So we're kind of setting the stage, looking at the realities of it.

592
01:07:07,630 --> 01:07:10,660
Right. And those emission reduction scenarios going forward.

593
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,140
The reality is it's coming here.

594
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:22,960
It's going to get worse regardless, even if we have some magic technology to turn off the faucet tomorrow of greenhouse gases.

595
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:28,450
So some important definitions here to understand and then we'll have a few minutes to kind of break out and discuss things.

596
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:32,500
So mitigation, what does that mean?

597
01:07:33,010 --> 01:07:45,640
A mitigation is defined as an anthropogenic intervention to reduce either of the sources of greenhouse gases or enhance the sinks of greenhouse gases.

598
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:59,860
And then when we talk about adaptation, this is adjusting our natural or human systems in response to what's actually happening or what we

599
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:11,080
expect to happen in terms of changing climates to moderate harm or to exploit beneficial opportunities.

600
01:08:11,890 --> 01:08:17,260
Various types of adaptation can be distinguished. They might be anticipatory and reactive.

601
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:21,129
They could be private from an industry.

602
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:26,170
They could be public for like an individual city or state.

603
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:38,950
They can be autonomous, they can be planned. And then the term resilience basically defines or is a measure of our ability to adapt.

604
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:46,090
Okay. So with that as kind of an understanding of terms, with the few minutes that we have left,

605
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:52,659
I'm going to say let's take 5 minutes and probably just for the first time just turn to the person or maybe choose

606
01:08:52,660 --> 01:09:01,270
a groups of two or three and think of examples that you can come up with or mitigation and then also adaptation.

607
01:09:07,120 --> 01:09:32,470
And how do you know this sounds and smells like, oh, did you and I know you felt that it was just like some burn something where it can burn.

608
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:38,420
No, I'm not going to. At least I think I'm sorry.

609
01:09:44,770 --> 01:10:01,110
Yeah, I do have some kind of extreme history, and so it's just like physically, but adaptation tables is just like,

610
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:14,949
you know, it's given me so much and I've written about this trying to help victims as well as well.

611
01:10:14,950 --> 01:10:26,140
So it's like the 90 seconds.

612
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,780
We have different thoughts. Again, we'll see.

613
01:10:29,230 --> 01:10:48,730
But I think I think there's something about services that we for attempting to you know, there's a lot of like all the carbon sequestration stuff.

614
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:59,139
Like, I don't know, I guess because I don't know any cultural differences like that that you could use for mitigation.

615
01:10:59,140 --> 01:11:07,570
Basically, all the urbanization technology is ahead of that or so adaptation issues and climate change.

616
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:14,049
I mean, I mean, what would that be about?

617
01:11:14,050 --> 01:11:17,250
Like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

618
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:29,290
Changing your diet to suit all things like that must be completely waste of dietary things like that.

619
01:11:29,290 --> 01:11:43,480
That would help you. It's not going to also I mean, it's pretty substantial, asked everybody in the country,

620
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:49,090
we should teach our kids, you know, you think you have your house. What was that?

621
01:11:49,660 --> 01:11:53,860
Sounds like you would probably at some ungodly hour.

622
01:11:54,490 --> 01:11:58,040
Actually, I thought this was yeah, it was awesome.

623
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:03,820
How did you feel about that? And then just in the first month, like by the time.

624
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:19,170
The amount of is that went into it when you want to get rid of the chicken industry or the ag industry because they're letting their own eggs,

625
01:12:19,530 --> 01:12:30,580
obviously, and yet they tried out a similar system for 20 years.

626
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:37,520
I think it is a little bit just because, you know, sometimes it's really hard to get your chickens to lay eggs.

627
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:45,269
So they thought, yeah, by default, I think getting like food scraps for your chickens, that's what your marketing is.

628
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:49,830
And that's really a way right to get screwed.

629
01:12:50,580 --> 01:13:04,510
We got this resource super high nitrogen content that I really should get, so I took care of the script.

630
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:09,340
All right, let's see. Let's go ahead and reconvene. We've got like 3 minutes left in the class period.

631
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,750
I want to make sure that folks have a chance to share the great ideas.

632
01:13:13,530 --> 01:13:18,960
So what are some examples of folks came up with mitigation strategies or approaches?

633
01:13:24,580 --> 01:13:34,870
Yes. We talked about trying to push renewables, public transport, limiting the use of personal vehicles and help farming and tree planting.

634
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:43,940
Okay. So examples of both reducing emissions, but then also increasing things, right, in terms of the tree planting rates.

635
01:13:44,590 --> 01:14:00,700
Any others? We talked about, like geoengineering methods to reduce like of the effects of CO2 and like reduce CO2 itself in the atmosphere.

636
01:14:01,390 --> 01:14:04,560
Absolutely. So geoengineering for both, right.

637
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,770
For for increasing things as well as reducing emissions. And we'll leave that one alone.

638
01:14:08,770 --> 01:14:14,270
And that's coming up as a highly contested debate. Let's shift to adaptation.

639
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:17,440
What are some examples of adaptation strategies?

640
01:14:17,680 --> 01:14:21,910
Yeah, changing your diet to be more plant based and things like that.

641
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:26,230
Yeah. So from an even in individual behavior. Absolutely.

642
01:14:27,370 --> 01:14:30,820
These are good examples where we're talking about kind of some that are private, some that are public.

643
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:37,659
Different layers of we talked about between like preventing development on

644
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:43,540
coastal areas to protect those barriers or putting up barriers like brick walls.

645
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:48,430
Yeah. So that inundation is coming. What can we do to prevent it?

646
01:14:48,430 --> 01:14:57,370
And knowing that so many people live along the coastal areas, maybe moving the people out or building infrastructure too.

647
01:14:57,400 --> 01:15:04,960
I mean I mean, like, you know, Louisiana, they carved out the coast for like infrastructure.

648
01:15:04,970 --> 01:15:13,630
You can rebuild, though. Like one of my friends worked on oyster reefs and rebuilding oyster reefs there to help protect them against hurricanes.

649
01:15:13,690 --> 01:15:19,489
Absolutely. Like community level protection against viruses.

650
01:15:19,490 --> 01:15:25,720
So like social distancing or virtual methods of keeping everything covered?

651
01:15:26,110 --> 01:15:32,290
Sure. Yeah, absolutely. Things that I think community level, a lot of individual cities actually have,

652
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,940
you know, climate adaptation plans that are in place, climate action plans.

653
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:41,410
So I want to close with and apologies that we're right up against the time.

654
01:15:43,640 --> 01:15:47,040
It's it's not it's not one or the other. Right.

655
01:15:47,060 --> 01:15:53,470
We're at the point where we can't say, let's focus on mitigation or let's focus on adaptation.

656
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:57,140
We really need to do both at the same time.

657
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:03,300
So we need to continue to try to mitigate, right.

658
01:16:03,350 --> 01:16:10,129
Control the amount of greenhouse gases we're putting into the atmosphere or reducing those levels.

659
01:16:10,130 --> 01:16:11,330
Right. By increasing sinks.

660
01:16:11,780 --> 01:16:24,019
And at the same time, we absolutely need to be able to plan to adapt, knowing that those those pressures and challenges and impacts on health right.

661
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:31,310
From an exposure perspective are just going to continue to increase over time, even in the best case scenarios.

662
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:36,020
Thank you so much for your time and attention and engagement.

663
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:37,819
This is a super interesting topic.

664
01:16:37,820 --> 01:16:47,900
I know many people said let's do maybe we can sneak in some more time to talk about it or that there's actually a third thing.

665
01:16:48,110 --> 01:16:54,650
The third thing, which is loss and damage, which this cough costs like the most recent couple established a fund for it.

666
01:16:55,070 --> 01:16:57,740
We'll see if they actually and that's what we didn't get right.

667
01:16:57,740 --> 01:17:03,010
It's like looking at those point in times, what are what are present day emissions but what we're lower we're emissions.

668
01:17:03,290 --> 01:17:09,399
You're on a regional or national. Good one, you guys.

669
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:17,510
Thanks so much. I think we should settle.
