00:00:00,434 --> 00:00:07,273
Hello, everyone. My name is Melinda Needham and as chair of the Department of Epidemiology,

2
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:12,284
it is my pleasure to welcome you to the Thomas Francis Junior Memorial Lecture.

3
00:00:13,184 --> 00:00:19,424
Today's lecture is part of a full day of events to honor the remarkable career of Dr. Arnold Monto.

4
00:00:20,564 --> 00:00:25,994
Arnold came to the University of Michigan in 1965 after completing a three year

5
00:00:25,994 --> 00:00:30,914
national service commitment at the NIH Middle America Research Unit in Panama.

6
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:39,714
During his 57 year career at U of M, Arnold made significant contributions to the Department of Epidemiology,

7
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:45,834
the School of Public Health, the University and the Field of Infectious Disease Epidemiology.

8
00:00:47,094 --> 00:00:57,204
With over 350 publications. Arnold is an internationally recognized expert in the occurrence, prevention and control of respiratory infections.

9
00:00:58,644 --> 00:01:03,984
While I don't have time to list all of Arnold's accomplishments, I want to mention a few of the highlights.

10
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:10,794
Just after arriving in Ann Arbor, Arnold launched the Tecumseh's study of respiratory illness,

11
00:01:11,004 --> 00:01:16,014
which transformed our understanding of the household transmission of respiratory viruses.

12
00:01:17,334 --> 00:01:26,694
Three years later, during the 1968 Hong Kong influenza pandemic, he found that vaccinating schoolchildren reduced infection in the entire community.

13
00:01:27,114 --> 00:01:29,424
It was an early demonstration of herd immunity.

14
00:01:30,814 --> 00:01:40,174
In later years, he evaluated strategies to control influenza, including vaccines, antivirals and non-pharmaceutical interventions such as face masks.

15
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:47,264
From 22 to 24, Arnold served as director of the Bioterrorism Preparedness Initiative,

16
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:52,124
and in 2014, he founded the U.N. Israel Public Health Partnership.

17
00:01:53,284 --> 00:02:02,884
Most recently. In 2020, Arnold was selected to chair the FDA's vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee on COVID 19.

18
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:07,024
Although he officially retired last December,

19
00:02:07,414 --> 00:02:16,024
Arnold continues to serve as co-director of the Michigan Center for Respiratory Virus Research and Response, where he is actively engaged in research.

20
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:23,174
Arnold's commitment to his work is truly inspirational, and I am grateful to have him as a colleague.

21
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:28,973
Now I'd like to introduce the dean of the School of Public Health, Dr. Dubois.

22
00:02:28,974 --> 00:02:36,804
Bowman. Dean Bowman isn't able to be here in person today, but he has prepared a video to mark this special occasion.

23
00:02:37,704 --> 00:02:44,904
Before I press play, I'd like to remind everyone to please join us for a reception in the Cornell Community Room following today's lecture.

24
00:02:48,724 --> 00:02:55,804
Hello. My name is Dubois Bowman, and it's my privilege to serve as the dean of the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

25
00:02:56,674 --> 00:03:03,334
Welcome to the Thomas Francis Jr Memorial Lecture, and thank you for joining us for this special event.

26
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:13,904
This lecture honors an incredible man who conducted groundbreaking work on influenza in the polio vaccine right here at Michigan Public Health,

27
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:21,854
Dr. Thomas Francis Jr. Was recruited to the University of Michigan in 1941, the year that the School of Public Health was founded.

28
00:03:22,784 --> 00:03:31,124
He was the first person to isolate the influenza virus, which included the discovery of multiple strains that he used to develop.

29
00:03:31,134 --> 00:03:33,314
Methodology for vaccine development.

30
00:03:34,864 --> 00:03:43,264
His vaccine methodology was ultimately foundational to his former student, Jonas Salk, developing the polio vaccine.

31
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:56,014
Together, Francis and Salk conducted trials on 1.8 million children in the US, Finland and Canada, a monumental and unprecedented achievement.

32
00:03:56,164 --> 00:04:00,243
It was on the steps of Rackham Auditorium at the University of Michigan that

33
00:04:00,244 --> 00:04:05,404
Dr. Francis announced to the world the findings of the vaccination trials.

34
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:11,374
Polio would soon be eradicated from the country and most of the world within a decade.

35
00:04:11,974 --> 00:04:18,963
In addition to these achievements, Dr. Francis started the landmark two country study to look at the behavioral,

36
00:04:18,964 --> 00:04:27,454
environmental and family factors associated with cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions in a community over time.

37
00:04:28,114 --> 00:04:33,424
The study was one of the first of its kind that was used to investigate the epidemiological

38
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:39,004
health of a community and test the herd immunity concept that is so common now.

39
00:04:40,384 --> 00:04:49,174
Dr. Francis was a luminary in the field whose work impacted the lives of communities in Michigan, across the country and throughout the globe.

40
00:04:49,954 --> 00:04:55,324
This lecture is one of the ways we at Michigan Public Health continue to honor his legacy.

41
00:04:56,674 --> 00:05:04,594
Today, we're delighted to welcome another luminary in the field as our keynote speaker, Sir Jonathan Van-Tam.

42
00:05:05,584 --> 00:05:09,394
I want to express my deep thanks to him for being with us today.

43
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:16,594
There is much we can all learn from his extensive experience across clinical settings academia,

44
00:05:16,924 --> 00:05:24,694
private industry and government, including several years serving the people of the UK during the COVID 19 pandemic.

45
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:35,974
Thank you again to everyone who has joined us today, and thank you to Dr. Sir Jonathan Van-Tam for sharing his time and expertize with all of us.

46
00:05:42,354 --> 00:05:46,974
All right. Well, a remote. Thank you to Dean Bowman for his comments.

47
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:57,243
And I'd like to take a moment to extend a warm welcome from our team here at the Michigan Center for Respiratory Virus Research.

48
00:05:57,244 --> 00:06:04,804
In response, the and give a just a brief comment about the center before we open today's program.

49
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:12,064
So the historical heart of our center, which was founded by Dr. Monto, is the Household Influenza Vaccine Evaluation Study.

50
00:06:12,304 --> 00:06:16,744
A longitudinal household cohort study that was based.

51
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:20,554
It arose from the foundational tecumseh's study of respiratory illness.

52
00:06:20,854 --> 00:06:26,434
This program has recently marked its 12th anniversary, and you are, oddly enough,

53
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:30,814
sitting at what was supposed to be the 10th anniversary party of Thanksgiving.

54
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:37,174
This program has also been joined in the center by numerous studies and other initiatives

55
00:06:37,174 --> 00:06:42,394
focused primarily around the epidemiology of viral illness and vaccine effectiveness.

56
00:06:42,664 --> 00:06:47,823
Spanning a large breadth of settings. Our center is made of a dedicated and diverse team,

57
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:53,164
from phlebotomists to laboratories to coordinators to analysts, to couriers, to students, trainees,

58
00:06:53,554 --> 00:07:00,994
all who are committed to advancing the science of viruses and vaccines, and who all rose to the challenge when the pandemic upended our fields.

59
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:08,854
We also owe a debt of gratitude to our participants. Without their involvement, we would know so much less about the world that we live in now.

60
00:07:09,454 --> 00:07:17,554
So with that, I would like to extend to you all a warm welcome and turn things over to Dr. Mahto, who will be introducing our keynote speaker.

61
00:07:25,934 --> 00:07:43,484
Thank you, Emily. I just want to welcome you all to this very important event and introduce our guest lecturer, who is Professor Sir Jonathan Van-Tam.

62
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:49,044
It's my great pleasure to welcome him to Ann Arbor.

63
00:07:49,064 --> 00:07:59,564
Finally, it's been a number of years since we've known each other and worked together, and I learned a lot by looking at your wiki.

64
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:08,144
This is the universal source now for things you didn't know about a person who you thought you knew everything about.

65
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:11,714
And I discovered that he was a Bostonian.

66
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:17,714
And I'm not our Boston, but Boston in Lincolnshire.

67
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:25,904
And he has spent almost all his career within just a few miles of his birthplace,

68
00:08:27,104 --> 00:08:35,384
going to medical school and having his training at at Nottingham University in a neighbor

69
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:45,974
neighboring county and continuing his training there after he finished his medical school.

70
00:08:45,974 --> 00:08:58,844
And a short time thereafter he actually began to work in public health, being the regional epidemiologist in the Public Health Service,

71
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:05,354
not only serving at the hospital and the university, but also being in the public health service.

72
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:17,623
But he has moved around in his career, which I think is evidence for how much you can learn in your career by having different experiences.

73
00:09:17,624 --> 00:09:28,994
Because from 2000 to 2004, he was with industry working for companies whose names have changed multiple times since,

74
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:35,204
and the names wouldn't even be meaningful to many people at this point.

75
00:09:35,864 --> 00:09:43,064
Then he went to the Health Protection Agency and spent some time with governmental

76
00:09:43,064 --> 00:09:50,894
agencies returning to Nottingham in 2007 as Professor of Health Protection.

77
00:09:51,464 --> 00:10:01,934
He also established a W.H.O. collaborative center for pandemic influenza there and began his career working on pandemic problems,

78
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:13,154
which resulted in two editions of this book, which I recommend that you look at because it's a very useful document for people who are not.

79
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:21,434
Those who know a lot about science and those who know more about policy and have

80
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:28,904
policy interest greater rather than scientific interest in controlling pandemics.

81
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:33,434
Following the 2009 pandemic.

82
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:40,424
He was interested in working on two issues, among others, that of influenza transmission.

83
00:10:42,454 --> 00:10:53,254
Trying to separate the the two elements which we've had problems in separating large droplet versus airborne transmission.

84
00:10:53,674 --> 00:11:05,004
And I served on the External Advisory Committee and had some interesting times traveling around the Midlands after one of our meetings.

85
00:11:05,014 --> 00:11:16,564
And if we have time, I'll share an anecdote about, about that, that memorable trip and also looking at the role of antivirals.

86
00:11:17,014 --> 00:11:20,014
And I think he broke ground.

87
00:11:20,824 --> 00:11:31,144
Now we know that observational studies are a great value in determining how effective how a vaccine is.

88
00:11:31,474 --> 00:11:43,114
He broke ground in showing us how observational studies can be used to try to determine how effective and antiviral is.

89
00:11:43,504 --> 00:12:00,814
And the use of an antiviral such as Tamiflu or oseltamivir, in controlling both pandemic and epidemic, pandemic and seasonal influenza in 2017.

90
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:04,474
He made an interesting decision at the time,

91
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:14,434
and we wondered whether it was good or bad for his career to move to Health England as deputy chief medical officer.

92
00:12:15,214 --> 00:12:28,144
And then what happened? Obviously, the pandemic happened and he then became the spokesman, the public spokesman for Health England.

93
00:12:29,574 --> 00:12:36,404
On the telly. Once a week and became the.

94
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:54,734
Famous relator of anecdotes and metaphors and all sorts of things about the effect of the pandemic on the British citizens.

95
00:12:55,984 --> 00:13:06,784
In March of 2022, he returned to Nottingham as faculty pro vice chancellor for medicine and health services.

96
00:13:07,144 --> 00:13:11,894
And in the process and this just a little story.

97
00:13:11,914 --> 00:13:17,404
When you retire from certain positions in the UK, a knighthood.

98
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:20,294
Is more or less automatic.

99
00:13:20,474 --> 00:13:34,484
It is not automatic when you are a deputy rather than the full director of a particular group in in the British civil service.

100
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:39,494
But John Jonathan because of his work.

101
00:13:40,664 --> 00:13:45,074
In communications and letting the people know what was important.

102
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:53,344
And what that and the reasons for lockdowns and the risk was listed in the new year.

103
00:13:53,624 --> 00:14:02,324
New Year's honors for 2022 and was knighted by the Duke of Cambridge just a few months ago.

104
00:14:03,184 --> 00:14:13,054
So it's my pleasure to introduce Professor Sir Jonathan Van-Tam, otherwise known as JV.

105
00:14:14,134 --> 00:14:34,994
Who will be giving the Francis lecture for this year? Thank you, Arnold, for that really warm and generous introduction.

106
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:39,313
And thank you all, dear colleagues, for inviting me here today.

107
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:49,534
And a special thank you to Maria for a a schedule that is military in terms of its precision, in terms of where I will be, at what particular time.

108
00:14:49,544 --> 00:15:01,214
So thank you very much. So. It is just absolutely brilliant to be with you for the celebration of the career of a

109
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:07,544
man who has meant so much to the world of respiratory virus epidemiology and to us all.

110
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:14,144
But of course, is tinged with a little sadness that in the last few hours, Her Majesty the Queen has passed.

111
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:20,024
And I know she was much loved in the USA as she was in the UK.

112
00:15:21,344 --> 00:15:34,393
But you know, there's a little rumor circulating that the story goes that when people were considering asking me to come here today,

113
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:37,964
they kind of the answer was, Oh, no, we're far too busy.

114
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:47,744
Actually, the the opposite is true. It is such an honor to be asked to give the Thomas Francis Junior a lecture,

115
00:15:48,554 --> 00:15:57,194
but it is even more of an honor that, you know, of all his friends spanning seven decades in the free world.

116
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:04,994
Dr. Monto asked me to come over and my answer was instantaneous, that I would be here.

117
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:17,264
And it's also quite daunting because this is someone who I've looked up to for the 30 years that I've known Arnold as,

118
00:16:17,264 --> 00:16:23,804
you know, the absolute grandfather, the absolute, you know, number one in flu epidemiology.

119
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:34,424
And today has already had, you know, three very stimulating staff speakers, followed by three equally excellent student speakers.

120
00:16:34,454 --> 00:16:38,474
So I hope I can live up to the challenge, as it were.

121
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:48,010
So let's get down to business. One of the things that I think we haven't yet got to a point where we're doing

122
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:53,080
is studying each other's responses to the pandemic that has just happened.

123
00:16:53,710 --> 00:17:00,370
Immediately, the crisis was so severe and so all consuming, I think we turned inwards.

124
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:08,470
And, you know, despite my very frequent telephone exchanges with HHS and teams calls during the pandemic,

125
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:15,160
I think I have a lot to learn still that I don't yet understand about the nuances of your pandemic response.

126
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:24,400
And what I'm going to do today is try and tell you our story and maybe come up against a few of the nuances that

127
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:32,950
we in terms of the way that we've handled arguably the worse public health crisis for several generations,

128
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:41,529
and how we can reflect on some of the major lessons that I think are either are emerging or will emerge in the future.

129
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:52,690
And of course, as number ten Downing Street know full well that the views I offer are not necessarily those of Her Majesty's Government, but my own.

130
00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:03,690
So I want to begin at the beginning with influenza and influenza pandemics, noting, of course, the ones that you know about very well,

131
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:12,270
the three pandemics of the 20th century, and noting that 1918 was clearly marked out as one that was very severe.

132
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,510
And in terms of putting that into context a little bit, with the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic,

133
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:25,020
there were 198,000 excess civilian deaths in Britain during the 1918 pandemic.

134
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:36,180
And at the midpoint of our pandemic in mid 2021, in England, Wales, we had already amassed 98,000 excess COVID deaths.

135
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:40,440
So I think this has been quite a seismic shock that we've been through.

136
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:50,180
Those pandemics that followed in 57, 68 were correspondingly mild, but there were vaccines and they were in very small quantities.

137
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:56,670
Not everyone knows that, mainly deployed in the US a little bit in 1968 in the UK too.

138
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,120
Very hard to get some data, some firm data on that.

139
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:08,699
And of course there was then this 2009 pandemic was mild but was characterized by the ability to deploy both vaccines and drugs.

140
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:16,260
And I think the mildness and politically has has no favors at all in terms of where we began the 2020 pandemic.

141
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:24,390
But here there's some images on the screen of, of course, a temporary hospital facility in the US in 1918.

142
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:30,660
And the one on the right is the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, showing the overflow into the outdoors.

143
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:38,580
And on top left are these UK Nightingale hospitals that we built around major cities,

144
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:45,509
huge conference centers or warehouses converted with literally hundreds and hundreds

145
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:51,600
of extra beds because that is what we felt we might need if things went wrong.

146
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:59,050
And the picture now unfolding from the W.H.O. globally.

147
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:06,349
These data are a snapshot into the for the first two years and December 2021 show a picture

148
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:14,270
of really significant mortality in terms of reported ascertained COVID 19 related deaths.

149
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:25,880
But of course, the real picture relates to the excess mortality and the I'll touch a bit more on that as we get into diagnostics.

150
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:32,750
But it's essentially a kind of three fold increase compared with with ascertained deaths.

151
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:40,560
And turning now to coronavirus disease in general, we've touched about samples in 2003.

152
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:44,120
We haven't really touched on Mars in 2013.

153
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:54,450
I think history is going to judge all of us in public health and is going to say, well, look, we had two warnings about this.

154
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,820
Your pandemic planning was very focused on influenza.

155
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,979
Maybe for the future, this wasn't quite the right approach.

156
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:12,410
And I think that's my kind of first parable that we need to continue to prepare for pandemic threats quite a bit beyond influenza.

157
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:20,370
Quite possibly beyond respiratory viruses and beyond airborne and droplet routes of transmission.

158
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:29,310
I'm one of that young generation of UK doctors who worked with HIV positive patients in the 1990s,

159
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:35,250
when young men essentially came into hospital to die and there was nothing else we could do for them.

160
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:46,800
So I recall, you know, a pandemic of a different pathogen that was not preventable and nothing to do with airborne, airborne or droplet transmission.

161
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:55,740
And of course, reminders about disease X. And I think we can all reflect and we will over time on the the fracture lines

162
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,170
that appeared in terms of geopolitical cooperation and pandemic preparedness.

163
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:05,100
And that is something, again, we will have to look at afresh for the future.

164
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:13,800
Now in the UK we have have always been very blessed with good influenza surveillance for seasonal

165
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:22,320
disease and I think we were able to turn quite a lot of that into good surveillance for COVID 19.

166
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:30,030
And this is just a typical a typical snapshot of the kind of data we were getting from our joint biosecurity center.

167
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:36,780
And it happens to be in Nottinghamshire, where my medical school is based for autumn 2020.

168
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:44,310
And what you can see on this snapshot of just a few weeks from early October to towards the late of October,

169
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:50,280
is this rapid heating up of case rates in the 16 to 29 year olds?

170
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:56,280
It's quite remarkable that these 16 to 29 year olds don't mix with their younger siblings.

171
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:59,070
And that bottom line remains quite pale.

172
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:06,030
But they do, of course, mix with people in the next age group up and then the next age group and finally into the over sixties.

173
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:13,560
And it takes one or two weeks before you start to see heating up of disease levels into those older populations.

174
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:24,690
And the basic problem, it doesn't matter whether you're a devotee of the census point being 28 days post COVID 19 diagnosis or 60 days,

175
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:32,429
the point is the same that this is a highly age related mortality pattern and as has been seen absolutely.

176
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:44,880
Around the world. And these these are pseudo scientific data produced by a Financial Times journalist, but really very eloquently presented.

177
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:52,679
And they do use Office for National Statistics data on COVID and influenza fatality rates.

178
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:58,860
And this is the snapshot in mid 2020, so long before vaccines.

179
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:03,720
And you can see that essentially once you kind of hit about 30 years of age,

180
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:11,130
there is a tipping point where COVID 19 becomes very, very much more lethal than seasonal flu.

181
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:20,380
And by the time you're hitting my age, then you're starting to get into nearly 20 fold increase in lethality.

182
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,400
I will return to this slide a little later on.

183
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:32,790
But, you know, the uncomfortable reality in spring 2020 around the world and including the UK was that we were faced with something

184
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:39,900
spreading very rapidly with a very high mortality burden and the over fifties with a high hospitalization burden,

185
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:49,140
predominantly, but not exclusively in the fifties, and with higher than average clinical severity in everyone over 30.

186
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,660
And no vaccines and no therapeutics. And so I think, you know, the the parable,

187
00:24:56,670 --> 00:25:06,420
the second parable is we have to continue to prepare to deal with high severity, high infective scenarios for the future.

188
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:13,170
And I've already I had dinner with some employees on the in the House of Commons on Monday night.

189
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:19,709
And, you know, there was talk about a kind of once in a lifetime pandemic.

190
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:27,480
And I said, gentlemen, you know, I wish I could assure you that this was a once in a lifetime phenomenon, but I'm almost certain it won't be.

191
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:30,670
And I think for the kind of youngsters in the audience, you know,

192
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:36,420
you have to be prepared for this to happen at least once in your professional lifetimes, if not twice.

193
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:47,040
And something I think that's new that emerged during the COVID 19 pandemic, which was different materially different from influenza,

194
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:54,270
was that this was just so severe and so threatening in terms of overwhelming health care services.

195
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:06,660
There was this new emphasis not just on trying to slow the emergence down per the kind of Neil Ferguson type modeling in South East Asia,

196
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:15,630
which you heard about earlier today. But actually, I need to continue to put the brakes on until well had other options to to use.

197
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:23,000
So here's here's some diagnostic data for you.

198
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:32,359
On the top. These are UK cases as reported as confirmed rather by PCR by specimen date.

199
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:37,370
And you can very clearly see waves one, two and three in the UK.

200
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:44,990
From April the first wave peaking in January the second wave and then the third wave in January 2022.

201
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:53,750
And overlaid on exactly the same timescale are hospital admissions for confirmed COVID 19 disease.

202
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,559
And of course,

203
00:26:54,560 --> 00:27:08,719
I've put the red box around the first wave because the the the the small size of the the case wave in the first wave is entirely arti factual and

204
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:17,960
completely related to the fact that we had to put all of our diagnostic capacity at the doors of the hospital where people were desperately sick.

205
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:23,570
And meanwhile, we just kind of sleepwalked into what was happening in the rest of the community.

206
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:32,940
And if you look now at those W.H.O. excess mortality data and this time break them down a little further by income category,

207
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:37,180
you can see that in the high income countries top left,

208
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:45,740
the kind of other on different scales, the kind of temporal correlation between reported COVID deaths and excess mortality is pretty tight.

209
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,020
But if you look at low, middle and low income countries at the bottom of the slide,

210
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:54,730
there's no relationship whatsoever showing that there were territories in the

211
00:27:54,730 --> 00:28:01,750
world where we will never understand the true burden of the COVID 19 pandemic,

212
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,060
except through the measurement of excess mortality.

213
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:12,160
And so I think there's a more general point here about the limitations of diagnostic testing around the world.

214
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:22,360
The time it took to scale up even in vigorous Western economies, that it was never scaled up in developing parts of the world.

215
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:29,020
I'm worried that we need to maintain sufficient capacity to be able to monitor trends and time.

216
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:36,130
And, you know, there is this kind of political question about how much testing and for how much longer.

217
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,840
I risk that if we don't do it, we will sleepwalk into another problem.

218
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:51,039
And I don't think we feel settled yet about the question about further variants of COVID 19 and the ability to resurge.

219
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:59,650
That testing capacity is going to be to keep that to keep that on ice, ready to go for a couple of years more is going to be very critical.

220
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,200
And so now I want to talk a little more about science and policy and public health practice.

221
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:16,090
So I think I would say that we had three phases of science interfacing with policy and practice.

222
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:24,190
The first one was very limited information on the virus from those countries with the early waves and

223
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:31,810
no doubt made more difficult because of the geopolitical aspects of where those first cases occurred.

224
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:39,580
And our policy and clinical responses were essentially based on first principles with a bit of modeling,

225
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:46,060
albeit with some quite wide confidence intervals and relatively limited data and limited testing.

226
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:55,260
We then moved into a different period where we started to get our own observational, clinical and epidemiological data.

227
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:00,810
We started to get widespread testing and we could make a more targeted response,

228
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,940
including some tools that were really due to the Western world, such as face coverings.

229
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:15,510
And we began to get some discoveries about the repurposing of existing medicines, notably the corticosteroids and the IL six inhibitors.

230
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,130
And then the kind of third era for public health policy and practice has been now the development

231
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:30,709
of vaccines and their wide rollout and also now appearing the anti COVID 19 specific drugs,

232
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:42,110
more of which later. And so in kind of public health terms, what we had was limited or scarce data, very low public health certainty about anything,

233
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:50,240
no specific treatments and no concept of whether vaccines would be a year away or five or more years away.

234
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:57,950
But a very high public health imperative to stop spread at all costs to avoid health service overwhelm.

235
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:06,320
And over time, that has transitioned as we've got data, as we've got disease modifying treatments,

236
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:17,000
as we've got antiviral medicines and vaccines and a mature vaccine program where we can rely less on those public health interventions or

237
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:26,570
social interventions to do the heavy lifting and rely more on the clinical measures as we've got the health services pressures under control,

238
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:36,260
not necessarily solved, but under control. And, you know, it's worth the students in the audience just reflecting that, you know,

239
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:41,120
this pandemic feels new, it feels strange, everything feels like it's happened in the last three years.

240
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,840
But this is exactly what we did with HIV.

241
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:50,330
Before we had anti HIV medicines, we had to find a means of slowing transmission.

242
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,070
This is exactly what happened with Ebola. Before there were Ebola vaccines.

243
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:00,740
The only thing we could do was to take public health measures to slow things down.

244
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:06,710
And if you go further back to the cholera outbreaks in Europe in the in the in the 1860s,

245
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:14,030
this is exactly what humankind has done that's created these kind of social barriers to slow disease down.

246
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:22,400
So we've reverted to type in many ways now these public health measures, these non-pharmaceutical interventions,

247
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:28,970
they've generated a very great deal of kind of heat and controversy around the world.

248
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:37,430
And normally we balance the strength of scientific evidence with the difficulty

249
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,510
of the intervention when we're trying to make these public health decisions.

250
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,270
It's always made worse by emergencies.

251
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:51,620
But there are basically well, I'm going to say that traditionally there are three things that you take into account.

252
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:59,270
I'm going to argue that there are four and that that like the Penrose triangle, there's actually no solution in the end.

253
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:07,110
The first is the difficulty of the intervention. How difficult is it to do?

254
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:14,100
What are the downsides? What is the cost to the government? What is the likelihood of popular support or not?

255
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:17,730
And how long will it take you to put it in place?

256
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,580
The next one, if we can do all of that, what bang are we going to get back for the book?

257
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,480
What's the size of the effect? Is it bigger? Is it small?

258
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,740
And then the next question that the politicians ask you is, well, how certain are you on the evidence?

259
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:40,900
If I do this, will I definitely get that back? That's something they want to know when they frame this.

260
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:47,100
And finally, they always say, what are the potential risks and what are my political optics?

261
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:52,170
If this feels like a very uncomfortable decision and I decide to do nothing.

262
00:33:53,100 --> 00:34:00,330
So it's a very difficult area and I have a lot of sympathy with politicians.

263
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:09,240
You might find that strange for me to say that, but there were essentially no easy decisions left after about two weeks in this pandemic.

264
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:17,550
Now, this one's a little a little teaser test as well for you.

265
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:29,100
You will notice on this slide that Mr. Sunak, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, appears taller than the Prime Minister.

266
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:35,649
Mr. Sunak is in fact very much shorter than the Prime Minister and shorter than I am.

267
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:45,610
But if you look carefully, he's standing on a little black box and when I go to the podium at number ten, I always ask for the little black box.

268
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:53,730
And I'm in typical irreverent English and irreverent English way.

269
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,580
The little black box is called the Sarkozy Box.

270
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,070
And it was actually used first, I think, by President Sarkozy.

271
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:12,590
But, you know, our politicians had to make a very difficult decisions integrating scientific advice

272
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:18,320
with both the social and the economic issues before they took any decisions.

273
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,910
And. Getting that balance right has always been very difficult.

274
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:28,800
And our sage committee, as opposed to the W.H.O. Sage Committee,

275
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:37,620
was charged with providing that central scientific view, but always charged with laying out the uncertainty.

276
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:43,590
And that is the really critical bit of advice to ministers is laying out that uncertainty.

277
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:53,220
And we also had to make clear that our scientific advice could change, as could our understanding of the virus, as could the virus itself.

278
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,210
And therefore, it was the best information we could give at the time.

279
00:35:57,450 --> 00:36:00,390
But not necessarily enduring and perfect.

280
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:11,310
And in a democracy, there are always perfectly reasonable scientific views that crop up saying you should do more or you should do less.

281
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:17,280
And we don't live in societies where it is right or proper to suppress those views,

282
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,660
but they do materially make what we have to do and that bit more difficult.

283
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:28,410
And so parable number four is really about making urgent strategic decisions

284
00:36:28,410 --> 00:36:33,570
under pressure with highly imperfect information and just how difficult that is,

285
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:41,040
how communicating scientific uncertainty to policy makers is part of our job in public health.

286
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:51,000
But it is really difficult to do. And equally, there's a separate job of communicating scientific uncertainty to the public.

287
00:36:51,480 --> 00:37:04,840
And that is no easier. Now earlier you've had a slide about Operation Warp Speed, and our equivalent in the UK was the UK Vaccine Task Force,

288
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:14,529
and we literally pulled together a group of people with very wide expertize from the private sector,

289
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:20,200
from clinical manufacturing, vaccine science, from the commercial side,

290
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,800
from the project manager management side, and proper civil servants to make sure it was all done properly.

291
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:31,240
We were given a budget, an adventurous budget.

292
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:38,560
We were very clear that we would have to take very significant risks with taxpayers money in order to get a result.

293
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:44,859
And we took an approach which was really a portfolio approach going for every single class

294
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:51,130
of vaccine that we felt had a realistic chance of delivery within the next 1 to 2 years.

295
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:57,040
We didn't go for the far out early science. That wasn't the job of the taskforce.

296
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:03,420
We went for all the low hanging fruits and instead of treating the industry like, you know,

297
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:10,720
people we buy from and where the customer actually we just engaged with them came along side by side,

298
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:18,670
embedded some of our people and work to find them facilities, find them in money,

299
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:24,250
find them whatever they needed to go faster and to manufacture as far as possible.

300
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,759
In the UK we did a national campaign asking people if they would take part in

301
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:36,190
vaccine clinical trials and within three months a half a million people had said,

302
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:39,910
yes, whenever you want to contact me, just do so.

303
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:50,410
And we commissioned instantly without any kind of rounds of significant competition or approval studies such as the mix and match com study,

304
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:57,640
which you will all have read, and the Cov Boost study, which enabled us to decide which vaccines we would use in our booster program.

305
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:04,840
We just commissioned those pieces of work very, very quickly, and Dame Kate Bingham led all of this for us in the beginning.

306
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:10,360
And it is it's no secret and no accident that Dame Kate is not a scientist.

307
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,980
She's a venture capitalist. And that's the kind of approach that we took.

308
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:22,930
And then our equivalent of ACP, the JCP, had some difficult decisions to make,

309
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:32,770
and the first decision was hard in terms of the optics of the fact that our population all wanted vaccines and all wanted to be first in the queue.

310
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:42,700
And but in science terms, it was very easy and it was made easier by the fact that our politicians said, we are going to leave this entirely to you.

311
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:49,269
We are not going to make a hierarchy of vaccine priority a political choice.

312
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:53,230
We're going to leave it entirely in the hands of the clinicians and the scientists.

313
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:59,589
And the whole thing boils down to the column on the right hand side of the right hand side of this slide,

314
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:03,040
the number needed to vaccinate to avert one COVID death.

315
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,760
It was very clear that we should go into care homes first.

316
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:13,689
It was very clear we should then drop down through the ages with much less urgency, only under fifties.

317
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:15,250
And that's exactly what we did.

318
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:29,220
The second decision I know it's one that Arnold wanted me to talk about a bit was the UK decision to ignore the product label for the vaccines

319
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:39,510
and to give priority to giving as many people as possible the first dose of vaccine and extending the interval for the second dose to 12 weeks.

320
00:40:39,930 --> 00:40:45,210
Now this was definitely taken by JCP with a bit of kind of support and

321
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:51,450
endorsement from the chief medical officers because it was highly controversial.

322
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:58,550
But if you look. The the data in the panel.

323
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:07,310
These are from the siren study, which is a study of health care workers in the U.K., a very large study, tens of thousands of health care workers.

324
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:13,880
And on the x axis is a rate, the interval between first and second dose.

325
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:21,410
And on the Y axis is around the hazard ratio with read point estimates for infection.

326
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:30,680
And you can see that whilst there is a reasonably good result when vaccines are spaced 21 to 27 days apart,

327
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:35,570
there is a improving result with a further extended interval.

328
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:43,010
Now we got a lot of criticism from this during the pandemic, have always had a lot of fan mail, as you can imagine.

329
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:49,280
And at that particular moment, there was a lot of fan mail from elderly patients.

330
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:53,030
And, you know, why can't I have my second dose?

331
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:57,410
You wicked, wicked doctor. You know, I you know, you're making me wait.

332
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:04,520
And you don't reply to them, of course. But if you could reply, you'd want to reply and say, Well, thank you, madam.

333
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:13,760
Which of your elderly neighbors would you like to choose and nominate not to receive their first dose in order that you can then have your second?

334
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:21,770
And it was basically about sharing. And we got a lot of criticism from the W.H.O. who later came on board.

335
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:27,230
We got a lot of criticism from the British Medical Association, who never apologized.

336
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:33,050
And all of our critics, I believe, were ultimately wrong on this point.

337
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:46,380
One thing that was a hard place that was unforeseen was the the clotting signal that became apparent quite quickly with AstraZeneca.

338
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:53,460
And the panel shows you really the potential benefits in terms of ICU admissions

339
00:42:53,460 --> 00:43:00,930
by age per 100,000 people versus the potential harms due to the vaccine.

340
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:08,100
And you can see we worked out fairly carefully that the logical cutoff point was 30 years

341
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:16,890
of age below which it was equivocal about the A-Z vaccine and it's likely a risk benefit.

342
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:27,630
But above that it was pretty clear and eventually the UK went to an age threshold of 40 below which we only use the messenger RNA vaccines.

343
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:31,770
But that was really because we had supply alternatives.

344
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:41,250
I'm quite sure that we would have continued down to the age of 30 with a Z if we'd had no option, no other supply alternatives.

345
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:49,600
Quite sure. And there was much poorer and more inconsistent decision making about Assad in Europe.

346
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:59,950
I think it has done enormous damage to the vaccine's reputation, particularly in low middle income countries where at $5 a dose it was really.

347
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,600
Other than COVAX donations, it was the only game in town.

348
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:09,339
This is very difficult now in vaccine uptake.

349
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:14,260
I know that over here you struggle a little more with vaccine uptake than we do.

350
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:18,890
But I really want to show you the curve on the left of this slide.

351
00:44:18,910 --> 00:44:22,660
These are first dose data from December and January.

352
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:31,060
But yeah, December really, they're from the first dose and then the December, January 20, 20 to 21.

353
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:42,760
And the that the curve is for the over eighties. And you can not only see that we get up to 95%, but we get up to 95% in just a matter of a few weeks.

354
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:50,080
The clamor and vigor to get the vaccine if you are elderly is really astonishing in the UK.

355
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,380
Over time, that enthusiasm declines.

356
00:44:56,310 --> 00:45:08,040
And you can see that although our final uptake of the third dose in the over eighties was 90%, it took a bit longer to get there.

357
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,420
Now here's a slide I hope works. It's from Theo Sanderson.

358
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:18,870
And this is I want to show you several things on the slide.

359
00:45:18,890 --> 00:45:24,380
First of all, if you look at the calendar date, the date stamp at the top left, that will start to move in a minute.

360
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:36,200
And the the colored bars essentially show the state of immunity, as measured by the Office for National Statistics zero survey in the U.K. over time.

361
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,830
And then, of course, you've got the youngsters on the left and the older people on the right.

362
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:44,990
I'm now going to play this movie. And the date will fast forwards and.

363
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:50,480
The immunity changes as we start this vaccination program.

364
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:55,160
And you can see how quickly by May, June, July.

365
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:59,270
That's the kind of picture we were getting up to now.

366
00:45:59,370 --> 00:46:06,350
Post it there in September because that very high level on the right for the over eighties has dropped a little bit.

367
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:11,210
And that was really the motivation for moving with our booster dose when we did.

368
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,370
Which then brings it back up.

369
00:46:14,390 --> 00:46:24,950
And by Christmas, by the time Omicron started to appear in the U.K., we already had a population with very significant immunity to wild type.

370
00:46:27,220 --> 00:46:30,430
That was a backup in case the first slide didn't work.

371
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:40,750
And here you have, I think, the resultant of that immunity mainly conferred by vaccines.

372
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:44,770
But of course, there's a role for wild type infection in that, too.

373
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:56,920
But here is the disparity by age in terms of hospitalization rates for COVID 19, when you compare the unvaccinated with the vaccinated.

374
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:06,490
And that is that is really the story of how we change the outlook for our health service and why in the UK.

375
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:13,089
The whole thing. We're in a different, completely different space now.

376
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:22,390
These are UK HSC data on vaccine effectiveness against Omicron and the outcome measures hospitalization and its test negative case control design.

377
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:29,379
The point I really want to make here is that you can see the data at the top of the slide on first dose, second dose, second dose.

378
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:35,590
And the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalization with Omicron is really starting to decline.

379
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:40,660
But it's a different story after that third dose, after that booster dose.

380
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:47,890
And that's why I think for the time being, we are locked into needing to think about periodic boosters.

381
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:58,590
And the three dose data. These are in the Omicron area in January 2020 to 2022 to February.

382
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:06,420
You can see that the data are not quite as dramatic in terms of the difference between three dose vaccinated and the unvaccinated,

383
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:12,450
particularly in the older group. But they are still very worthwhile public health benefits.

384
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:24,980
And so I use this slide to. And teach the students really that, you know, the iceberg of disease through the vaccination program,

385
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:31,380
we've made it a bit smaller, but only a bit smaller. But what we really have done is pushed it below the waterline.

386
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:39,410
And of course, as public health physicians, we're only interested in the book bit the sticks above the waterline, less the bit below the waterline.

387
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,670
And so Parable five is really that we are where we are in the UK because of mass vaccination.

388
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:55,490
We've lowered the disease pyramid, but we are faced with the fact that we have disease modifying vaccines, not infection preventing vaccines.

389
00:48:56,270 --> 00:49:02,840
We know these wane over time. We know we continue to be at risk of new variants, vaccine escaping variants.

390
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:09,800
And I think we now know already by bivalent vaccines look like the new normal.

391
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,230
But I'm interested and was obviously very interested in Scott's presentation this morning

392
00:49:15,470 --> 00:49:20,810
about the future possibility of buy and try pathogen vaccines with the messenger.

393
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:25,820
RNA technology is tantalizing, but of course at the moment it's unclear.

394
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:37,890
And so Parable five continued, is that even in a severe pandemic with a population as compliance and accepting as vaccines as we have,

395
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:45,750
you can see that the urgency, the uptake is incomplete and the urgency gets less with each passing wave of boosters.

396
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,430
And I think that's a reality. But you can't say to the public, this is irrational.

397
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,380
You know, you're being you're being silly,

398
00:49:52,710 --> 00:50:01,380
because actually they've worked it out that those first two vaccines were comparatively more important to them than booster doses.

399
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,250
So actually, they are kind of rational in how they thought about this.

400
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:08,010
But we need vaccines that are going to protect the longer.

401
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:15,860
But the cautionary note here is that we've been trying this for influenza for 75 years and we still haven't done it.

402
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:18,240
So watch this space.

403
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:28,130
And then finally we come to this moment when it's all over in the U.K. This was the political moment when the politicians said, it's all over.

404
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:36,560
We're going to concentrate on something new now. And Ukraine popped up to be the thing that and now the cost of living that's replaced it.

405
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:40,970
But we got to that point. And if you repeat a.

406
00:50:42,970 --> 00:50:47,020
The John Byrne Murdoch analysis.

407
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:53,860
But fast forward it to March 2020 and remember this takes into account wildtype infections,

408
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:59,260
vaccination and the fact that Omicron is a less virulent virus.

409
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:09,699
But nevertheless, the data on seasonal flu and COVID 19 in terms of infection fatality rates look remarkably

410
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:16,090
similar and very different to that rather awful picture which we faced back in spring 2020.

411
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:24,970
So on that basis, I think there is an argument now about learning to live with COVID 19 and returning life to normal as much as possible.

412
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:29,770
Now, we haven't talked much about antivirals for COVID 19.

413
00:51:30,610 --> 00:51:37,720
We're going to start that little discussion with talking about lessons from the neuraminidase inhibitors.

414
00:51:37,970 --> 00:51:44,980
Now, these were first licensed in 1999. Our first kind of clinical guidance was in 2000.

415
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:48,940
And it basically said only in high risk patients.

416
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:53,620
And we got very limited use, hardly used at all in the UK.

417
00:51:54,190 --> 00:51:59,830
We then had a widespread pandemic in 2009 and quite widespread use.

418
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:08,830
But there was still this controversy about whether they were effective or not or whether they were a complete waste of money.

419
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:19,080
And the problem lay in the fact that the manufacturers wanted to develop a drug for widespread market adoption.

420
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:26,940
And to do that, they had to go for community patients with symptomatic, mild illness, low risk populations.

421
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:31,470
And in those populations has very low rates of complicated disease.

422
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:39,480
And all of that data, almost all of their data sat inside that red box.

423
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:43,170
But we as public health people said, well,

424
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:49,740
we're not that bothered about whether somebody gets better a few hours quicker or even a day and a half quicker.

425
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:55,320
We're far more interested in preventing complicated disease that lands people in hospital.

426
00:52:56,190 --> 00:53:04,650
And so what we're interested in is the bit in this red box where there are there were very little outcome data.

427
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:13,140
There was an opportunity to look at that in in the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic.

428
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:21,420
And that's what we did. But it is you know, it is the devil's own work to get data from 80 different research groups around the world,

429
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,830
standardize the data for an IPD meta analysis and make sense of it.

430
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:31,710
And even when you do that, there are people that don't agree with you, that you don't agree have done a good job.

431
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:37,680
So it's really difficult. And we had to rely on these observational data to give us a public health answer.

432
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,090
And two decades after,

433
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:52,100
we're still in this very unsatisfactory position where our own Academy of Medical Sciences tried to settle the matter in 2015 with a report,

434
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:58,340
and the report concluded the observational data are generally at risk of higher risk of bias.

435
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:01,820
But the steering group do not agree.

436
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:06,780
The observational data are invariably of less use than data from asked.

437
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,310
And they then followed with an indictment.

438
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:21,050
The failure to conduct asked us in 2009 contributed to the current weakness in the evidence base and the uncertainty for clinicians.

439
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,220
So there was a pretty strong message that.

440
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:37,129
And I think part of this lies in the way that we've built, the way that we conceptualize the kind of handover from the industries,

441
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:42,680
clinical development of a drug to our our using it in public health policy.

442
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:48,320
We basically create this kind of hard cliff edge where they have a high commercial

443
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:54,350
imperative to bring something early to market for sales and for patient benefit.

444
00:54:55,040 --> 00:55:03,740
And we. No this expense the difficulty and commercial risk associated with.

445
00:55:05,290 --> 00:55:08,890
Studying drugs to find out their public health outcomes.

446
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:11,940
And it creates this cliff edge where the industry do what they do.

447
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:18,820
They get it's a license and they just kind of throw it over the fence to the public health people and then say, here, make some sense of that.

448
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:28,810
And I think. We need to move more to a kind of shared stewardship model where the industry is prepared to engage early and

449
00:55:28,810 --> 00:55:35,410
accept that these public health outcomes are actually the ones we care about most that customers care about most.

450
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:41,950
But we have to be more willing to reach back over the fence and help them get these

451
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:47,350
products over the fence with the right data to support that kind of public health use.

452
00:55:47,830 --> 00:55:52,300
And I think we are starting to get there, but there's a lot further to go.

453
00:55:53,230 --> 00:56:02,740
And the reason I say I think we're starting to get there is that in the UK, the 2020 response to research was really very good.

454
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:15,160
It was much more directive. We were a country that totally resisted the pressure to deploy drugs before we had evidence from clinical trials,

455
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:19,360
and that was a whole of a whole of the National Health Service edict.

456
00:56:19,990 --> 00:56:25,810
And we had already strengthened our research in the interim.

457
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:35,050
Our infrastructure between 2009 and 2020 to the point where in the first year into urgent public health studies, we recruited a million people.

458
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:41,410
And almost all of the NIH effort was focused on urgent public health studies.

459
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:45,100
Everything else fell by the wayside and was not prioritized.

460
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:52,300
The recovery trial you heard about this morning, I think that really was the UK's gift to the world.

461
00:56:52,300 --> 00:57:02,020
In the middle of 2020, the important discovery was dexamethasone, but others have followed, such as tocilizumab and more recently, baricitinib.

462
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:08,760
As important as the fact that recovery showed that certain treatments did not work,

463
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:19,019
including hydroxychloroquine and the lopinavir ritonavir combinations, convalescent plasma and a whole load of other stuff.

464
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:24,600
That wasn't a sharp elbow, by the way, but it's just a fact that recovery did do that.

465
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:33,710
And we're continuing in that vein at the moment with the panoramic study that won't be as well known to you.

466
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:42,410
But panoramic is a very large, community based, general practice based, antiviral treatment study.

467
00:57:42,950 --> 00:57:48,860
And we're looking at the outcome of reductions in hospital admission.

468
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:58,160
And we are evaluating these new antiviral treatments that have already been licensed by the regulator.

469
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:01,610
And so you might be thinking, well, they've gone completely mad.

470
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:07,190
They're evaluating products that have been signed off by the regulator.

471
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:13,730
But the truth of the matter is that the data on MOLNUPIRAVIR and parts of it that have contributed

472
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:20,810
to the licensure and from the phase three trials have been performed in vaccinated patients.

473
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:30,529
And there's a really big scientific question about in an individual who's by now in the UK or the US had three doses

474
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:39,980
of vaccine possibly for what is the incremental benefit of giving an antiviral drug on top of that background,

475
00:58:40,530 --> 00:58:44,900
background that we now know largely prevents most severe outcomes.

476
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:48,200
So that's the big question that panoramic is trying to get to.

477
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:55,519
So far, 26,000 patients in that study Molnupiravir the data set is closed.

478
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,670
It's under analysis, I hope will be a result quite soon.

479
00:58:59,090 --> 00:59:04,610
And the Paxil of it, because of the contraindications and drug interactions, is taking a bit longer.

480
00:59:05,210 --> 00:59:11,150
But the size of effect from the Phase three study suggests that the power calculation is going to be a bit more favorable.

481
00:59:11,510 --> 00:59:16,190
So again, I'm hopeful that will be a result before the winter on that.

482
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:25,350
And the final parable is therefore be bold and, you know, be uncompromising about doing research in a public health crisis.

483
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:30,640
It's very easy to clutch at straws. But don't use the science.

484
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:37,830
Use our scientific power that we do have to get clear and get policy relevant answers.

485
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:48,360
So that's the kind of end of my talk about what this pandemic has been like.

486
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:58,170
Some of the you know, the big lessons and the big learnings I think have emerged from the UK and I now want to just finish with this slide.

487
00:59:58,590 --> 01:00:07,170
So this is the stained glass window in Saint Coonan's Kerk, which is a tiny chapel on the shores of Lochore in Scotland.

488
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:14,070
And I took a picture of this when I managed to get my first proper holiday after two and a half years.

489
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:22,260
And these are three nights and you won't be able to see the inscriptions on the stained glass windows.

490
01:00:22,650 --> 01:00:25,680
But the first one says, I fought a good fight.

491
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:33,300
And I translate that into kind of modern speak, if you like, as I've put in the best effort I can.

492
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:40,020
The next one says, I finished my course. I wasn't referring to Tamiflu or antibiotics.

493
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:47,220
It's saying, I think I've gone as far as I can do and completed the task that was sent to me.

494
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:52,199
And then the final one, it says, I have kept the faith. And of course there's religious studies.

495
01:00:52,200 --> 01:01:02,070
I guess that was important. But I translate that as I've stuck to my values, I've stuck to my personal ethics and my beliefs.

496
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:10,019
And in recognizing that we are here today to honor and pay tribute to a man

497
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:16,380
whose career and influence on us all as scientists has been utterly remarkable.

498
01:01:16,950 --> 01:01:25,290
I think I'd like to put it to you that Arnold has put in the best effort he can, that he has gone as far as he can go.

499
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:30,900
And beyond completing the task that was set off for him and that throughout,

500
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:38,760
he's been very forthright and very true about his personal beliefs and ethics on any given subject.

501
01:01:39,210 --> 01:01:49,890
And I have certainly greatly enjoyed our 30 years of friendship and association on the influenza and now COVID scene.

502
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:56,460
I've particularly enjoyed some of our private conversations which will remain private,

503
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:06,160
but have been in a great fun when talking about antivirals and vaccines and policy and politics and all of this and that.

504
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:17,970
Just a tremendous delight to be here for you today and to you all, a huge honor to have been asked to give the memorial lecture.

505
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:37,140
And thank you very much, indeed. Do you have a few minutes to make the question?

506
01:02:38,350 --> 01:02:43,810
Use for questions. I.

507
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:54,700
I think what we have a. I was just wondering if you could speak to a little bit more about the discussions to make that.

508
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:05,060
That's. Hard decisions that.

509
01:03:06,090 --> 01:03:09,610
We're not very good. Well.

510
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:12,950
But what? Yeah.

511
01:03:13,670 --> 01:03:18,650
Okay. So there are two ways of answering that question.

512
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:25,250
In the UK context, one is that it has always been the case and I'm so glad it will always be the

513
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:32,230
case that advisers advise ministers decide that is the way our system works.

514
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:40,520
And so these kind of decisions ultimately have to be presented as a set of choices and options for a minister.

515
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:44,480
And a minister has to say, Yeah, that's what we're going to do.

516
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:54,830
Now. It was down to relatively simple modeling for us that if you could get a.

517
01:03:56,370 --> 01:04:04,380
Vaccine effectiveness in terms of preventing infection greater than 50% from the first dose of vaccine.

518
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,570
Then that was a better bet to give twice as many people.

519
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:19,730
50% plus than to give half as many people more and leave the rest unprotected.

520
01:04:20,030 --> 01:04:25,700
And we were facing quite a kind of binary situation because.

521
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:32,770
The people who were left behind on a two dose policy were fully unprotected against COVID.

522
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:38,440
It wasn't the same as a booster dose where the people left behind have already been primed.

523
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:45,580
This was very different. And so it was quite clear that that was the right thing to do.

524
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:54,700
We knew that in terms of communication, it would be difficult and we knew that it would cause anxiety,

525
01:04:55,720 --> 01:05:00,430
particularly as not all of the manufacturers were entirely,

526
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:11,620
entirely helpful in terms of their counter messaging about, well, we can only say the data we've got, which is a 28 day interval.

527
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:17,620
We can't comment if you don't do that, which is actually technically the right answer in terms of,

528
01:05:18,310 --> 01:05:21,730
you know, if you've only done the clinical trials in that area, that's all you say.

529
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:30,760
But on immunological first principles, it's always been the case that the longer you allow the maturation of the immune response before challenge,

530
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,300
the better the, you know, the better the eventual response is.

531
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:36,790
And put it another way.

532
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:49,150
I think if we could have had these vaccines in 2021, knowing that the pandemic would start in 2022, then the supply pressure wouldn't have been there,

533
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:59,150
but we'd have still gone, probably for a three, three or four month interval between those two doses with the idea of maximizing response.

534
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:03,190
So. That's ultimately what it boils down to.

535
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:12,310
But there was obviously a science decision, a policy decision and a communications handling issue.

536
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:16,870
And that's the kind of that's the kind of joy, if you like, if that's the right word,

537
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,340
of operational public health, that you've just got to think of all of the angles.

538
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:28,050
O'Brien. A decision regarding.

539
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:38,390
You read source that we knew that was. We're evaluating the figure was was quite low.

540
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:44,620
Yes. And a lot of low. And you see the decision.

541
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:49,050
You know, you saying that, you know, essentially eventually.

542
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:57,000
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm just kind of wondering why that.

543
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:03,160
So that was that was an illustration from the from the Winton Center.

544
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,760
They also did an illustration of higher exposures as well.

545
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:13,740
Which we felt were relevant to the international context and they're on the Winton Center website,

546
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:18,120
but they weren't the most relevant to the UK choice that we had to make.

547
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:20,490
But we all agreed that if we ran,

548
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:29,280
if we run into trouble with higher incidence and we ran into trouble with the supply of messenger RNA vaccines, we would have just carried on.

549
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,799
And that's very hard knowing this.

550
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:41,140
I know him as a safety signal, but knowing still being very firm about the fact the risk benefit for a population is still in favor of carrying on.

551
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:52,590
That very general question. Do you think we're better prepared for that kind of information now?

552
01:07:55,980 --> 01:08:04,320
Yeah. So the question is, are we better prepared for the next pandemic having had COVID 19?

553
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:08,219
And the answer is yes, but no. But then if you watch British TV.

554
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:13,910
But the answer is yes, but no. But. No, we're not.

555
01:08:14,570 --> 01:08:23,090
If everything goes back in the box and everything is forgotten and there isn't enough corporate memory.

556
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:31,430
But yes, we are. If politically, our policymakers and our politicians say.

557
01:08:32,410 --> 01:08:40,690
And realize this is more likely to happen again in the future than less likely given the ever

558
01:08:41,290 --> 01:08:48,610
closing agency move between animals and humans and the propensity for pandemic organisms to emerge.

559
01:08:48,940 --> 01:08:50,950
If they grasp that and say,

560
01:08:50,950 --> 01:09:02,380
We don't ever want to go back to a situation where we have to have lockdowns or lockdowns for as long as much economic damage as has happened then.

561
01:09:02,950 --> 01:09:07,150
And we know that means we'll have to spend money on preparing now.

562
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:13,030
Then I believe we could be in a better place. But the jury's out at the moment.

563
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:16,780
The pandemic is not really over in all parts of the world.

564
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:24,220
I don't think it's over in any parts of the world fully. So we'll just have to see how the political world reacts, I think.

565
01:09:26,280 --> 01:09:30,070
Cathy. So thank you. Really, really great talk.

566
01:09:30,090 --> 01:09:36,480
It was interesting to see where it didn't didn't parallel what happened here in the U.S. So thank you for that.

567
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:39,950
Continuing on this same thing, you know,

568
01:09:39,990 --> 01:09:50,670
I would argue that perhaps one great benefit we've had from the pandemic is taking some formulations and propelling them to licensure on the vaccine.

569
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:57,840
Yes. Martin it so how realistic you just mentioned preparedness in different places in the world.

570
01:09:58,050 --> 01:10:06,230
How realistic do you think M RNA manufacturing could be in multiple places?

571
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,569
And do you see that as as a positive? Yeah.

572
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,550
So I'm not an industrial scientist,

573
01:10:12,090 --> 01:10:22,650
but my understanding is that messenger RNA vaccines are much closer to being a chemical entity rather than a biological entity.

574
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:27,750
And that means they're going to be easier rather than more difficult to manufacture.

575
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:32,849
And certainly I've been told I don't know if it's true, but a kind of five liter kind of oil,

576
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:36,570
the kind of you buy in a car shop for your motor vehicle.

577
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:43,710
If you have that much messenger RNA bulk, just five liters, you'd be carrying around enough vaccine for a million people.

578
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:52,520
So, you know, they do not need a thousand liter fermenters, multiple copies of.

579
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:56,560
It's a much smaller scale science operation.

580
01:10:56,830 --> 01:11:04,420
It doesn't change the fact that dilution, fill and finish is the biggest bottleneck still in the world for vaccine manufacturing.

581
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:07,630
And that certainly needs a bigger geographic footprint.

582
01:11:07,990 --> 01:11:16,750
But I think the messenger RNA vaccines are going to change the way we do business in the future.

583
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:28,480
I really do. I would like to hear from others who know more than me, but my gut feeling is that if this pandemic had occurred five years ago,

584
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:35,050
the messenger RNA technology would not have been quite mature enough for.

585
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:43,650
Large scale vaccine delivery as it was. So there's absolutely nothing fortunate for the world about a pandemic.

586
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:49,320
But I think that there might be one piece of fortune in there that actually the messenger

587
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:55,020
RNA technology platform was finally mature and ready to go at about the right time.

588
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:02,210
Yeah. It was Clinton world. It's been a lot worse than.

589
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:10,920
It's a lot. Responding to something like monkeypox.

590
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:17,080
I didn't say. Probably would have.

591
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:22,290
On your radar there are now. They don't.

592
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:28,810
Might. Yeah.

593
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:42,250
So I think public awareness of public health, of statistics, of data and the way it's presented has changed forever.

594
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:51,690
I think the public curiosity of what they've got when they start to cough and sneeze has probably changed forever.

595
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:57,100
And although governments right now are, you know,

596
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:04,800
stepping back and very taking a very big step backwards from public funding of lateral flow tests forever in a day,

597
01:13:06,450 --> 01:13:09,540
you know, I don't think this is going to go back to 2009 ten.

598
01:13:09,810 --> 01:13:11,130
So I think that's going to change.

599
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:25,170
On monkeypox, certainly in the U.K., the epidemic is being so far very concentrated in men who have sex with men and men who have sex with men.

600
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:32,770
MSM were already a group who were quite aware of health risks and health conditions and quite high.

601
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:38,340
Presenters, i consultants and for for medical issues.

602
01:13:38,700 --> 01:13:42,480
So in a way it's been.

603
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:52,170
Again, there's nothing fortunate about it but the fact that it has been kind of delineated in a a definable community who are also,

604
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:58,080
I would say above average in terms of health awareness has probably made it easier.

605
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:08,310
I think it would have been, you know, a world more difficult if this had got out into the general general population.

606
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:15,990
Really difficult. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

607
01:14:16,650 --> 01:14:21,110
I have one more question. I really wasn't aware of.

608
01:14:21,240 --> 01:14:29,030
And maybe it's. Big softball.

609
01:14:34,230 --> 01:14:40,130
What? And I just realize that the monkey pox vaccine.

610
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:45,760
United States are doing it right. And it causes a large.

611
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,480
Swelling we saw that space for.

612
01:14:50,610 --> 01:15:00,260
Over. Right. And so, you know, so there are some things that, you know, a good friend when he's like, oh, I.

613
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:06,000
Right? Yeah, we do, too. You know, they're also uniforms.

614
01:15:07,090 --> 01:15:12,490
But there are this huge group of other people there. You know, I didn't get because I wore a short sleeved shirt.

615
01:15:14,630 --> 01:15:22,400
And so it's kind of leaving the stigmatizing mark out here if you're not.

616
01:15:23,380 --> 01:15:26,470
Yeah. And so while I feel like, you know, we learned a lot.

617
01:15:26,620 --> 01:15:29,790
Yeah. With HIV. Yeah.

618
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:33,650
Right. About where? Yeah. Marginalized populations.

619
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:42,890
Transcript. Right. So, so you're saying that you think there's a lot that we can't do that we have to do this, but I'm wondering how much.

620
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:54,720
Yeah. So to your specific point about what you've had, I my understanding of the vaccine we're using in the U.K.,

621
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:59,430
which is a Danish smallpox, third generation smallpox vaccine.

622
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:06,750
Kathy, you may know more about this than me on my book, talking rubbish. But my understanding is it's a standard sub cut injection.

623
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:13,500
But what is being given in a forum is a micro dose intradermal.

624
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:19,380
And certainly this vaccine is very difficult to manufacture.

625
01:16:19,540 --> 01:16:22,680
The small the new generation smallpox vaccine.

626
01:16:23,010 --> 01:16:28,320
The manufacturer is not a big manufacturer who's only ever before made kind of,

627
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:33,930
you know, slow scale manufacturing for biodefense purposes, for stockpiling.

628
01:16:34,290 --> 01:16:37,500
And so suddenly people start ringing up, going, can we have some?

629
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:42,870
Can we have some? Is kind of throwing them into a spin. And the lead time on each batch is nine months.

630
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:52,560
So there is a shortage. And in the U.K., we have moved temporarily to intradermal vaccination to eke out the doses,

631
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:57,660
especially as we've got a very large consignment coming in, I believe.

632
01:16:58,290 --> 01:17:05,520
And so, of course, you know, that will help us going forwards rather than backwards with who we need to vaccinate.

633
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:11,280
It sounds like you've been given, you know, who has been given an intradermal dose on the forearm,

634
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:17,490
but presumably intradermal vaccination could be given in other parts of the body.

635
01:17:17,990 --> 01:17:23,140
Yeah, that's what I think. Yeah. I don't think it was the way they would say would.

636
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:27,910
Yeah. I think that's a delivery issue, which we'll get into.

637
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:31,460
I think we should. It was just so shocking.

638
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:35,620
I think that's what we call in the supposedly we've learned all these.

639
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:40,960
I think that's a I think as a clinical protocol issue. I think it.

640
01:17:41,990 --> 01:17:45,830
You know, what it probably comes down to is it's a new way of doing it.

641
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,160
Now, a lot of people are comfortable. There is a protocol.

642
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:51,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

643
01:17:52,580 --> 01:18:03,530
And intradermal definitely causes, you know, more likely than not as dramatic as what you've seen in every case, certainly, but much more often.

644
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:10,610
Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a really, um.

645
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:16,760
Yeah, that's a really important insight that you've made. Yeah, that it does.

646
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:21,910
Absolutely. Yeah. But in the US we did it for the same reason.

647
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:25,440
Because it's that short. Yeah. Yeah.

648
01:18:28,050 --> 01:18:33,910
Yeah, well, it's harder still. And it's. It's the thickness of the dermis, the visual eyes.

649
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:37,270
Yeah. 3/8 of the lab. Yeah.

650
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:43,980
Area of the skin. That's more visible. Yeah. Yeah, it is certainly what we call in the UK.

651
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:50,110
The tail wagging the dog slightly. Yeah. Thank you.

652
01:18:50,320 --> 01:19:01,330
Well, we're the for. Thank you for really an excellent presentation.

653
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:07,170
It was such an honor to have you here and it's also an honor to be able to present to you the

654
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:13,590
Francis Medal in recognition of your extraordinary achievements in the field of epidemiology.

655
01:19:13,830 --> 01:19:28,280
Thank you so much for. I'd like to invite everyone to please join us in the Cornell Community Room and SDH one for a reception.

656
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:32,820
Thank you. And.
