1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:10,630
Without a vaccination. The first one is hardly okay.

2
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:16,440
I want to give you a quick one before you don't want to miss a single piece of this one.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,950
Let's talk about policy memos and house prices.

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:30,040
So I know it might sound really dry. I want to sell this to you, I guess, as a really important, fundamental transferable skills.

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,450
So this is a bit of background.

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:42,600
I was on sabbatical and you kind of have to say sabbatical rather than sabbatical because I was also working

7
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:51,060
for my partners at the US Army Corps of Engineers and a lot of what we were doing was writing policy memos.

8
00:00:53,790 --> 00:01:01,920
So what would happen in a typical week is I would get a phone call or email from one from then or from someone who was out.

9
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,470
So we've worked with people in some of the female regions.

10
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:13,920
We write to people who, since we sent a lot of equity briefings to the White House task force.

11
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:22,160
We sent quite a lot of briefings to New England states where we had good working relationships with the health departments there.

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:32,090
So we would try and do as brief as possible, short pieces of really fast analysis, and then we write them over policy matters.

13
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:42,060
So one of the things I want you to take away from this is that we're teaching this in a particular defined way,

14
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,990
mostly for pedagogical reasons, as well as trying to make sure that grading across the class is kind of even.

15
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:54,540
There's a wide variety of policy memos that you can write.

16
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:04,710
I think the important thing is to get to grips with the writing style and think very carefully about your audience and who you're targeting.

17
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,750
So I'm going to talk a bit about how to write a policy memo.

18
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:15,930
We're going to keep doing this for the next 10 minutes or so, and then our guests will be here probably about 10:30.

19
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:25,090
So if we have any time after that, you can ask me anything either about policy memos or anything else I could do.

20
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:35,910
So a policy memo in this context is a short document summarizing some key points in relation to specific policy.

21
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:42,320
And it really is a form of professional writing that is incredibly helpful in different scenarios.

22
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:48,059
I have students come back and tell me, Yeah, I used to use writing to writing tips,

23
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:56,130
to policy memos to communicate to my board of directors, to communicate to partners, to communicate to the public and the advocacy work.

24
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:04,350
So thank you. So I can use it practically. And so you could write a descriptive memo,

25
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:14,910
which is try to inform somebody may be a partner as key key interest group collaborator about the policy that you're trying to inform the public,

26
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:23,280
especially if you have a really short policy. Who of one pager as well he can be argumentative.

27
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,510
And in this course, we are going to ask you to write an argumentative policy memo.

28
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:33,840
So what you're doing that is building an argument in support of a specific policy action.

29
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,420
So it's more of a call to action.

30
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:43,770
You're trying to balance evidence with a well-constructed argument that is convincing to the reader of that position.

31
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:48,960
Okay. So how do you get when you've written something like a policy memo for.

32
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,469
What are your experiences in doing that? It's easy about it.

33
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:01,720
And what's hard. Yeah, right.

34
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,650
Yeah. So policy management, the easy part is it's relatively short,

35
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:16,830
but that also is a double edged sword because you have to try to keep all of your information really concise and use the argument ammunition.

36
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:24,600
And because you don't have a lot of space because no policymaker wants to read ten pages of something, they want to read one or two.

37
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,470
Yeah. So, yeah. Do you want a fun sentence?

38
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,559
Yeah. Adding on to that, every sentence really matters because you have such a short page of it.

39
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,040
And I find that a lot of times I have a little fluff sentences in my writing.

40
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,000
This is not a policy.

41
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:45,180
Then I go through and I cut every single one of them because they're not actually saying something that's really frightening to my argument.

42
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,809
Exactly. So they're short and that is easy and hard to getting to grips with.

43
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:55,590
Being able to write short is just useful in all kinds of context.

44
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:04,290
You know, I think everyone counts. And so one of my big tips to all of you is you probably need to edit twice as much as you already think.

45
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:10,440
You need to edit this, which you have to do multiple rounds making it fit into two pages.

46
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,410
We didn't I wasn't essential information,

47
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:21,540
especially people who are approaching this for the first time sometimes give me a lovely page of background information.

48
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,150
Super carefully research, lovely statistics in there, nice citations.

49
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,000
And then they cram all the argument into the second page or even the second half of the second page, right?

50
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,590
So don't get so carried away into research, which with a bit of luck because it's linked to the first assignment.

51
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:47,399
You already have a clear idea of some of the policy solutions in this area and some of the politics of the area.

52
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,270
Right. So you're writing your first policy memo on the same topic as the paper you've just completed.

53
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:00,530
So hopefully build up a bit of knowledge, but don't give me every bit of research you've done.

54
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:05,310
You've got to be selective. Who else has written a policy memo and wants to tell me about that experience?

55
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:13,050
Jonathan I would say that thing is having something to say and the hard thing is having too much to say.

56
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:18,510
So definitely what you said. I usually write like for a two page policy memo.

57
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:24,080
I probably would write like three and a half pages and then just cut, cut, cut, cut, cut to get down to the page line.

58
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:35,820
Yeah, this was my problem because I'm happy I got a phone call from my my father and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and he said,

59
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:45,600
I need a really short memo on all the differences between all three variants and any research that you can get about disease spreads.

60
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,830
In my country and I sit down and he's like, You've got 3 hours, right?

61
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:59,280
So I like to tell them I wanted to produce a two page memo that you could find page memo,

62
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,880
and then I got one hour to turn it back into a two page memo.

63
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:06,059
So I feel your pain, especially right now.

64
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,720
That feeling of this is new. There's no research on this flipping question.

65
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:14,070
I'm looking through a million preprints trying to figure out what the [INAUDIBLE] is you thinking about?

66
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,150
And then check in with my bench scientist collaborator around.

67
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,800
Can you give me a graphic of this in 2018?

68
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,650
More evidence on this point. And yeah, it was pretty hard.

69
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:31,980
So sometimes I think, you know, two, five or, you know, a policy area really well, it can be even harder.

70
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,290
All right. Who else has written a policy memo? Wants to show it to me. Thank you.

71
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:46,650
Pretty sorry for making the Rumsfeld that I think the first part was like framing it appropriately.

72
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:53,459
The audience was on, I think the one that I represent for the public and trying to make sure that like the language I was

73
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:58,910
using was appropriate for that like different levels of like really understand what I was saying.

74
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,420
Yeah, exactly. So you have to know your audience, right?

75
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,479
So in this assignment,

76
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:14,850
we are asking you to write the probably the most likely scenario as to why that just means that you're trying to persuade them to.

77
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:19,830
The simplest way to construct this assignment is to make a law, pick a bill,

78
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:27,070
and figure out who could be in support of that bill and make a request for them to sign on or support the bill.

79
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:34,110
It might not necessarily fit depending on the policy area, but that's one simple way to structure it.

80
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:45,420
But if you don't know what those they like to expect, so typically you're writing somewhere that they just they're incredibly progressive, right?

81
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:52,500
So first of all, you're probably writing to a staff person. Verily, you might be writing that.

82
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:59,040
The new writing might well get to the expert staff person who's dealing with the health portfolio.

83
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,260
Why not go through the hands of an intern first or somebody else in sorting mail?

84
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,260
It does not help you to include a lot of technical detail and too many like heavy statistics.

85
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,230
I think some might descriptive statistics can help if you explain properly what they mean.

86
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:25,500
But you should use general language and try not to be too technical or jargony.

87
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,970
That is something that all of us do sometimes. I think in this class.

88
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,770
I just had a quick question. Yeah.

89
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:48,599
With the technicalities or just like detail in mind, how do we then can be like evidence based arguments and outside like stats or I can cite them,

90
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:56,909
but you have to make sure you explain what they mean. So where people go wrong is they use aggregations or they use bits of evidence

91
00:09:56,910 --> 00:10:02,069
that are people around and they think maybe use some people have the best,

92
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:10,030
maybe the audience won't see us. And you never tried to have to write something about risk or odds ratios or something like that.

93
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:23,610
You try to be careful about your language, right? The CDC misuse of the CDC produced a policy brief during the pandemic about the risk of contracting.

94
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:32,460
I think it was the overkill variant of the vaccination versus the risk of contracting it if you're not vaccinated and then it's double the risk,

95
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:40,770
he said. The problem was that the risk was originally very small in magnitude, so if you double a very small risk, it's still a very small risk.

96
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,690
And I actually had Walensky press release this as a big deal,

97
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:51,150
and everybody in my team that does risk analysis was like, No, this is like a rookie mistake.

98
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,990
So you have to be careful when communicating.

99
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,940
Can an ordinary person understand what you're saying?

100
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:05,640
And can they can they clearly conceptualize the problem or in this case, the risk?

101
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,960
Right. So do you want to add any misleading information in there?

102
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:18,840
So I want to touch on a specific type of policy memo that is frequently used,

103
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,600
particularly for communicating with the public or sometimes leave behind materials.

104
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:30,510
If you are visiting a legislator or someone else involving them, which is a one pager,

105
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,959
we're not asking you to write a one page memo for this assignment,

106
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:41,820
but that will come up again at the end of the course when we do the policy challenge packet a one pagers,

107
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:48,180
just a more difficult version of a policy memo. So a memo could be a couple of pages with one pager.

108
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:54,020
You're only about one page, although some people cheat and they might actually have one page.

109
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,510
Two pages. Don't ask me. I did it without HP.

110
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:01,090
I mean, why didn't they do so?

111
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,930
Yes, it's even shorter.

112
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:12,270
It is a little bit more visual, especially in the sense of having to pay attention to the layout of the page in the white space.

113
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:21,560
So without policy memos, all the assignments for this class, we do not expect you to have any fancy graphic design.

114
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:27,120
We do not expect to do it in color. We don't expect you to have it because the graphics.

115
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:32,310
But I think the one thing to pay attention to is readability.

116
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:40,740
I do want to be able to read the entire thing. No, cram every word into your two pages page into one page.

117
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,310
Take a minute, edit it down, make sure it's very it's readable and there's enough white space on the page so that someone can see why.

118
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,650
Because your audience has at most a few minutes to pay attention to this piece.

119
00:12:56,370 --> 00:13:05,330
So you're writing for someone that may not have expert knowledge that is implicit in the topic potentially, but they want to know their analysis.

120
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:09,960
They want to know what's in there. Is there a regulator? They might want to know what's in it for the public.

121
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,650
If they're a member of the public, they might want a really clear definition of why this is an important problem.

122
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:22,739
So you would tailor it according to who your audience and the targeting,

123
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:28,440
especially that you discussed starting with starting in the American government.

124
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:36,180
1 to 1 comes right at the beginning of the semester. That's important, but struggling to figure out who is responsible for making this decision.

125
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:44,430
One of the best things you can do with a policy memo is right for the heart and soul and then send it to the wrong person.

126
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,740
Oh. So a colleague of mine who used to do a lot.

127
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:56,380
Of advocacy and lobbying at Michigan, and she was the person who got the bid in the ACA.

128
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:02,230
She used to teach this and say and give some example memos.

129
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:11,080
Lovely memo from an interest group advocating for better food and nutrition in several communities in America.

130
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:20,620
They said it to the president. You know, there might be some places where you do want to tell the president about something.

131
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:28,240
It is much less likely that that is going to be effective than sending it to someone who actually has a lot of decision making,

132
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,810
authority and interest at the community level.

133
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,700
If indeed that's the focus of your policy. Okay.

134
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,350
So that's why targeting is important, because you can have reasonable time with the world.

135
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:53,050
So we've got this audience this time pressured by expertize.

136
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:59,470
And we're going to tell you, I just want to give the caveat that policy members come in different formats.

137
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:05,590
The format for this class, as I've said, is about practicing writing and argumentation skills.

138
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,210
We do ask you to show evidence and provide citations in the memo.

139
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:15,970
If you read Policy Never in the Wild, we have citations, but of course I do.

140
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,930
But this is an academic class. So one of the things I want to do is see what you researched in order to create that.

141
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:30,760
And targeting is one of the most important points. This is the basic structure of the assignment for this class.

142
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:40,280
So there is a template for memos in the same way that we provided a template for the assignment you've just completed.

143
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:45,510
Please look at the example memo and please follow this template.

144
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:56,350
So like I said, we're forcing you to do it in a particular way, but there's a reason to our practice so soon from subject itself.

145
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:02,840
When it comes to the executive summary, that is your chance to put all of your arguments in a couple of sentences.

146
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:12,559
I really want to be at the glance at the top of this memo and understand exactly what you're asking for, particularly what's the call to action?

147
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,560
What is the action that you want this person to take?

148
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,190
I want to be able to read that immediately in the first paragraph.

149
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:25,499
Okay. When we went the background checks.

150
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:31,090
So we asking you to provide essential background information that frames the problem.

151
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:39,250
Don't think of this as just description. This is your opportunity to frame the problem to your advantage, right?

152
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:47,860
We talked a lot about framing insurgent construction, how you can frame problems in different ways and shine a light on them to engage the audience.

153
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:57,910
That's really what you're doing with this section, even though it just says, Well, we want you to explain why the current situation,

154
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:06,129
the status quo, which you will have identified in your cry out what's right for you, feel free to reuse the research.

155
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:13,480
You create excitement. That's why there are many terrifying situations.

156
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:21,010
This isn't good enough, you know. And then you're going to recommend that the target person takes this specific action.

157
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,520
Don't just assume you have to spend this out, right?

158
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,070
So just assume that the action that you want them to take is evident from your definition of the problem.

159
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:36,970
It quite often isn't. You need to specifically say, we're calling on you to support this legislation.

160
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:44,950
We're calling on you to sign on to this film. I'm calling on you to fully fund this policy initiative, right?

161
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:58,750
Bridget So I was like thinking about this, that question when I was writing my strategic paper on maternal mortality.

162
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:10,620
And like from my perspective, it seems like that that would be an issue that everyone in theory has, like a common goal of reducing that every line.

163
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:18,399
And so theory and theory. So like compared to like gun control where there is a lot of like more pages to be,

164
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:26,680
I'm just curious like is stating like I'm calling you to lower I make efforts to lower teaser rates need to do is

165
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:34,300
that what do you mean by self evident or sorry I mean that's because that's okay and don't worry you're not alone.

166
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:39,129
Is this some point across from everybody who's here and different with this?

167
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:45,430
Okay. So I would say it's good to define the problem.

168
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,059
I do not think you should assume that everybody. Yes.

169
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,850
How serious it is. Right.

170
00:18:52,300 --> 00:19:01,060
If you think about how we talked about the issue in the class and like the multivariable problems, that one of the things I pointed out.

171
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:06,490
But you can bring that totally different. Yes. So I want you to think about the framing here.

172
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:13,570
And if it helps you to shadow an organization that's already advocating on this issue, that's quite okay.

173
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:17,980
I would try and define the problem as quickly as possible.

174
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,960
And what do you think your audience will get? I'm I would definitely call for specific action.

175
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:30,249
Okay. Oh, I wish that we could say everybody supported action to reduce maternal mortality.

176
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:39,340
But given the current political scenario, there's probably a lot of politicians who don't like that, and that's actually one point.

177
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:48,880
So when you're choosing somebody to target so if they are a legislator, think carefully about who's likely to be a champion.

178
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,190
It's great to look to to reach out sometimes to people whom you don't see.

179
00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:01,540
So you might have a different opinion, but really you want to focus on folks that would already be supporting your position.

180
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:08,410
Right. Okay. I'm going to pause them now. So, you know, welcome Mitch Zeller, which I'm very happy about.

181
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,610
So this is your dance. You are my music.

182
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:20,620
Nice. Today we're going to record as well. He's a security and democracy.

183
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:30,460
People expect Australia to look. He's an expert on the day to day on day one of the holiday.

184
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:42,219
So it it's my pleasure to welcome to all of the of tobacco products at the FDA who had a very distinguished tenure there.

185
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,870
And every talk with you do something bad things more taxing things.

186
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,420
And so I believe that we have lots of questions behind today.

187
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,799
Well, I have many questions because all of my research is on tobacco control.

188
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:01,450
But I will try to hold them back a little bit so that we can all have a good discussion together.

189
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:12,849
So one of the things I was wondering and I'll start and then I want you guys to keep your questions is we have a lot of

190
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:21,690
people in the audience here who might be going into policy or might not understand regulatory policy specifically what.

191
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,270
Your advice to somebody who wants to go and do that for a career?

192
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:31,370
Like, I feel like your career has been doing these high profile policy scenarios,

193
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:40,550
the regulatory system pretty much from scratch and implementing them in an area where the sector is really quite combative and conflicted.

194
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:47,570
So what characteristics or insights you have to happen to be robust with that?

195
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,759
Sure. Well, thank you for the question. It's a it's a privilege and an honor to be with all of you this morning.

196
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,100
Everybody hear me? Yes. Good.

197
00:21:55,310 --> 00:22:04,400
I think I think I would answer that question in the same way for lawyers graduating law school as I would for all of you.

198
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:15,200
And that is if you're interested in generating the science to inform regulatory policy, but especially tobacco regulatory policy.

199
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:23,150
Even though the Food and Drug Administration has been in the business of regulating tobacco products now for 13 years,

200
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:28,730
there was and remains no blueprint for how FDA is doing it.

201
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:40,910
So the founding center director who I took over for nine and a half years ago, he had to build the center out of whole cloth.

202
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:45,950
And I ran the center for the last nine plus years and helped grow it.

203
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:54,350
But the the driver for anything that's programmatic is the science or what we call the regulatory science.

204
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:59,899
And so there is an extraordinary opportunity for anyone who is interested in

205
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:05,480
continuing to generate the evidence base to produce the regulatory science,

206
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:09,440
to inform policy in any programmatic area.

207
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,750
How should we be thinking about the products that are under review in an Office of Science?

208
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,269
Regulatory science can inform our communications efforts because the center

209
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:23,930
spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year on public education campaigns.

210
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,040
And with the explosion of the popularity of e-cigarettes with kids, unfortunately, starting in 2018,

211
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:37,940
we had to do this massive reallocation of resources away from primary prevention

212
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:42,650
for kids and cigarets into primary prevention for kids and e-cigarettes.

213
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,260
And it's the regulatory science that was needed to sort of crack the code,

214
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:52,100
because kids don't think about e-cigarettes in the same way they think about cigarets.

215
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,970
And it was it was the regulatory science and the insights that came from that

216
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:03,860
that generated huge information for us to make important programmatic decisions.

217
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:10,640
Regulatory science is also, over time, going to inform what is probably, I would say,

218
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,280
the single most powerful tool that FDA has, and it's called the Product Standard Authority,

219
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:24,890
and it is the authority to ban or limit the allowable level of any ingredient, compound, constituent or any of them in any finished tobacco product.

220
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,310
It's great that the agency has the authority, but we all know how litigious the tobacco industry is.

221
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:42,440
And so those regulations can only go as far as they will surviving a lawsuit and the way that the agency wins those lawsuits,

222
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:48,080
because it is the industry's right to sue when the agency takes final action the way the agency wins,

223
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:52,820
despite the strength of we call it the administrative record. But for your purposes, it's the strength of the research.

224
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:56,800
It's the strength of the strength of the science that informed the policy in the first place.

225
00:24:56,810 --> 00:25:07,040
So I would say, if you're interested in generating the research to inform that kind of policy, this is an extraordinary time to still be getting it.

226
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:13,880
And 13 years into passage of the statute that created our center, you'd still be getting it on the grounds work.

227
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:18,350
And I would say at least for another decade, because, as I said, no blueprint.

228
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:23,780
There's no place for FDA to turn to to get an answer to the question of how should we use this authority?

229
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:28,280
I don't want to say that we're making it up as we go along, because that sounds haphazard.

230
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:37,939
But it is every day that that center works on new policy is a day that that probably a policy is

231
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,860
not being worked on anywhere else in the world in terms of the strength of the science behind it.

232
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:51,080
And so you will have an extraordinary opportunity to contribute to that if that's something that you are interested in doing on this program.

233
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:59,120
And I think one of the questions, would you you mentioned the ability to control substances.

234
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:06,650
I wonder what you see as the future of controlling nicotine in tobacco products, which is something I think we're going to see.

235
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,920
So I'll talk about this in that in the talk that I'm giving later today,

236
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:21,020
a bit of let me start at the at the macro level through sort of like a broad public health lens and.

237
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:33,440
Ask all of us what is the ultimate objective here when it comes to any kind of intervention to reduce tobacco use or regulation,

238
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,270
public education, community based programs, cessation services?

239
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:44,180
What is the ultimate population level objective?

240
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,720
Is it? Well, let's just get everybody off of tobacco.

241
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,860
Is that the goal or is the goal?

242
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:55,970
Let's not only get everybody off of tobacco, but let's get everybody home with nicotine.

243
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,220
Well, I'll see you later.

244
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,070
And what I think the science makes clear is we have some really important questions that we need to ask as a society about nicotine,

245
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,600
because nicotine in tobacco products doesn't cause the cancer, the lung disease, the heart disease.

246
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:23,540
The nicotine obviously creates and sustains the addiction. And 90% of all smokers still today started smoking when they were kids.

247
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:31,370
And it's the repeated exposure to all of the other components of tobacco and smoke that's linked to the cancer and the lung disease and heart disease,

248
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:35,390
but not the nicotine. And as controversial as e-cigarettes have become.

249
00:27:36,830 --> 00:27:43,580
We now have alternative and less harmful products that can bring about momentary delivery of nicotine,

250
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:50,569
which from a treatment standpoint is a breakthrough. We now have pulmonary delivery of nicotine without having to burn tobacco

251
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:55,340
leaves and inhale the 7000 chemicals that are in tobacco smoke with every puff.

252
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:07,760
But it's a it's a tradeoff because while nicotine doesn't cause the diseases and the deaths, it can be, especially when it's in pulmonary delivery.

253
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,450
Very addictive. And that brings in the whole concern about kids.

254
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,860
So. So what's the ultimate objective? Is it just tobacco free?

255
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:23,240
And would we be okay with a whole bunch of smokers who have become former smokers, thanks to the availability of other products,

256
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:30,200
staying on those other nicotine delivery products for as long as they have to to avoid relapse and the relapse to a more open.

257
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,910
What is the goal? This is a society that should be both tobacco free and they can be free.

258
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:43,490
And it's a it's a debate that we need to have. I'll tell you where I don't I think that the goal should be tobacco free.

259
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:51,200
I think that in a properly regulated marketplace, there is a place for alternative and less harmful products for people who need them.

260
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,600
But it has to be in a properly regulated marketplace.

261
00:28:54,620 --> 00:29:07,700
While you will generate the science to answer some questions about behavior that we do not yet have robust longer term insights into,

262
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:15,290
starting with dual use a smoker who starts vaping but continues to smoke.

263
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:20,000
Right. And most adult smokers who may continue to smoke.

264
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,770
Well, at a population level, what do we know about dual use?

265
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:40,900
And are most of the smokers who who engage in dual use dramatically reducing cigarets per day or only incrementally reducing cigarets?

266
00:29:41,630 --> 00:29:45,980
And do we know enough about what's going on in the population to get an answer to that question?

267
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:50,920
That's going to be critical to regulators. And it's the world of regulatory science that's going to inform that.

268
00:29:50,930 --> 00:30:01,440
Because in a world where. Most smokers who engage in tool use are significantly reducing their exposure to toxins because they went from,

269
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,800
say, being a pack a day smoker to four cigarets a day.

270
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,850
We, of course, would like to see them completely cigaret free,

271
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,820
but a pack a day smoker who goes down to four cigarets a day and then supplements with the current

272
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,230
availability of nicotine in cigarets supplements it with nicotine from a less harmful source.

273
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:32,560
It's it's pretty clear that that hypothetical 20 to 4 cigarets per day person is going to be significantly reducing their exposure to toxins.

274
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:41,969
Even if we haven't been able to look at this, so really answer the question, what is the ultimate goal here?

275
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:51,000
And there needs to be a debate and not just among researchers and retired regulators, but with the general public to get a sense of,

276
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:58,920
first of all, dispelling misperceptions about nicotine safety and then figuring out what what is the ultimate objective.

277
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:06,780
And if you want to know more about this, you should read karaoke kissing piece and health plans that came out very recently.

278
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,830
Personal contact with students. And she specializes in tobacco control.

279
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:17,460
So who has a question they would like to ask me? And we're going to do because I don't know where the other one went.

280
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:23,600
Oh, we have keyamo, something like that.

281
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:28,200
So first of all, I just I think on behalf of everybody, I wanted to also express my gratitude for having you here today.

282
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,950
And your question was an interesting one in terms of asking about, you know, what is the ultimate goal.

283
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:43,020
And I kind of feel like even answering with this the ultimate goal to get people to stop tobacco or nicotine,

284
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:51,690
maybe you have to reach even further and say, well, where does the regulatory authority in Germany come from?

285
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:56,609
Because in the United States we value our rights to drink what we want, smoke, we want these kind of things.

286
00:31:56,610 --> 00:32:06,370
So is the ultimate goal to get people to stop smoking or is the ultimate goal of health or is the ultimate goal to reduce health care costs?

287
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:10,920
On top of that, I mean, it's one thing to say we want you to stop smoking.

288
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,159
And science supports that because X, Y or Z, I'm not a scientist.

289
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:22,260
I want to use our science to generate relevant. So I guess that was that would be my question is the ultimate mandate of a regulatory

290
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:26,219
agency to be able to say we're doing this because it's going to make you healthier?

291
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,650
Or is it because, you know,

292
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:35,639
the federal government funds a lot of health care here and we need to reduce health care costs just to kind of take it a little further than,

293
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,940
you know. So the way I would answer that is by turning to the statute that gave FDA regulatory authority

294
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:46,590
over tobacco products in the first place because Congress was clear in what their mission is,

295
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:53,340
what the goal is. The goal at a societal level is to reduce death, disease and harm from the members.

296
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:59,100
And as a consequence, it drives down health care costs.

297
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:10,140
But the policy objective, the public health policy objective is to reduce death, disease, illness from tobacco use.

298
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:19,950
And there was a lot of focus when that legislation passed in 2009 on kids, because what was true 50 years ago was true in 2009.

299
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:27,509
And what is true today is that 90% of all smokers who start smoking started smoking

300
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:33,360
when they were young and half of all smokers by the time they did turn 18,

301
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,650
which isn't even now, the legal age for sale of tobacco products to kids.

302
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,379
Half of the kids who experiment with combustible products earlier in life.

303
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:48,300
As children around, the lessons have become regular smokers by the age of 18.

304
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:54,790
Whether or not even of a legal age now to purchase a pack of cigarets in this country.

305
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:59,050
So I think that the goal is to reduce the harm,

306
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:05,910
because with all the progress that we've made in reducing consumption, the prevalence, historically low consumption,

307
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:13,450
prevalence rates for combustible tobacco products, it's still the leading cause of completely preventable disease and death in the country.

308
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,010
So if the tools of product regulation.

309
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:25,970
Can we use the Product Standards Authority, the power to review and make decisions on a case by case basis for new products,

310
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:29,690
either coming to market, coming off the market, or never even getting to market.

311
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:37,220
The Public Education, Compliance and Enforcement and the other regulatory tools that FDA has.

312
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:41,080
I think the focus is, is the leading cause of preventable disease and death.

313
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:42,890
How can we reduce harm?

314
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:55,580
I don't mean that to be any kind of oversimplification, but it's such an absolute statement because it quickly gets complicated,

315
00:34:56,030 --> 00:35:01,430
controversial, and it really all comes back to what does the science tell us?

316
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:07,730
No one knows what the long term health effects of e-cigarettes are. We're not going to know the long term health effects for for several more decades.

317
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:15,799
But. I think even the most ardent proponent of e-cigarettes would say, well, in the abstract, probably long term,

318
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,450
we're talking about the kind of weird products that's less harmful than a product

319
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:24,020
that requires you to burn tobacco leaves and inhale them into your lungs.

320
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:29,360
Have you ever seen the old Bob Newhart routine about Cigarets?

321
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:39,860
Not now, but go to YouTube. And in that, this is one of the world's most famous routines.

322
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,950
He's on a phone in the 1600s. Of course, there were no phones.

323
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:51,470
He's on the phone and he's speaking to Sir Walter Raleigh, who just came to the United States and discovered tobacco.

324
00:35:52,560 --> 00:36:02,010
And Sir Walter Raleigh is trying to convince the king and the queen that that Spain we're in,

325
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:07,140
we're going to cover which country should should make a major investment in tobacco.

326
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:15,150
And Sir Walter Raleigh tries to explain what a cigaret is to these these palace officials in the 1600s.

327
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,510
It's really, really.

328
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:29,910
And so we we have we have the ability to use these tools to try to drive down the leading cause of completely terrible disease and death.

329
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:36,730
And and you all are in a position to inform how we go about it.

330
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:49,320
This is not, at least for me, this is not anything that's ideological or puritanical or political.

331
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,410
This is just this is just basic. Public health.

332
00:36:54,420 --> 00:37:04,740
The previously secret internal tobacco industry documents that that started to emerge in the 1980s revealed a lot.

333
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,500
And one of the things that they revealed was how the industry looked at children and adolescents.

334
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:17,670
And one of the companies, cigaret companies, actually referred to young people as replacements workers.

335
00:37:19,670 --> 00:37:23,500
Predictable smokers who die within months.

336
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:28,340
Still, what's going on today, albeit at much lower rates like this?

337
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:34,520
It's the children of our country that remain the replacement smokers for addicted adult smokers retire.

338
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:41,479
Quit. One of the differences between now and when those documents were first created was

339
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,750
that we had the opportunity to use the tools of product regulation to use them.

340
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,170
That's a long way of saying it's about reducing. You don't appreciate clarification.

341
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:59,070
Now. Thank you.

342
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,820
I so thank you so much for coming in. First of all, my advice and you being here.

343
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:16,110
So I was just curious about what the relationship between the FDA and the enforcement agencies like the ATF are and whether there is one in my head.

344
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:20,849
They seem like very separated and it seems that there's a process of them

345
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:24,360
being informed under the new regulations and whatnot and then enforcing them.

346
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:27,479
But I was wondering if you had any anything to add or.

347
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,960
Yeah, it's a good question, because most people assume that because it's called ATF, Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,

348
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:42,480
that they have a role in enforcing the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Acts chapter that gave FDA regulatory authority over tobacco products.

349
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:55,680
And the answer is not so. ATF is primarily in the revenue generating business when it comes to taxes on tobacco products.

350
00:38:56,550 --> 00:39:01,500
FDA is responsible. We have our own Office of Compliance and Enforcement in the Center for Tobacco Products.

351
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:05,070
But in order to take an actual enforcement action,

352
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:12,570
FDA has to sit down and get the agreement of lawyers at FDA lawyers, the Department of Health and Human Services.

353
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,840
And then if it means going to court for either a seizure or an injunction or a

354
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:21,690
court order remedy or getting the support of lawyers out of Justice Department.

355
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:30,360
So it can be a very complicated process of persuasion, where we sit inside the Center for Tobacco Products of FDA,

356
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,320
we do the monitoring, we do the surveillance, we see the bad behavior.

357
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:42,270
We see the violations of federal law. But FDA cannot independently take compliance and enforcement action.

358
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:47,940
So the only thing that FDA can do independently is the first of be an important step in the process,

359
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:57,640
which is called the issuance of a warning letter, where you send a warning letter for a violation to a retailer that illegally sold to a kid,

360
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:06,210
a manufacturer that put an illegal product into interstate commerce, a wholesaler that distributed an illegal product that was an interstate commerce.

361
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,979
But a warning letter is technically non enforcement action. It's it's what it says.

362
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:15,360
It's a letter warning the recipient of a violation of the law.

363
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,650
And the key is what kind of follow up actual enforcement can be taken in there.

364
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:28,860
It's not ATF, it's lawyers elsewhere then that FDA has to persuade to support them in an enforcement action.

365
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:35,580
Thank you. And you can come back in a couple comments.

366
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,670
But you want answer questions, do you?

367
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:49,350
Hello. I just was wondering if you could speak to the difficulties and challenges of leading a regulatory agency,

368
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,340
seemingly nonpartisan, during different presidential administrations?

369
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,970
Because I think you've seen three different presidential administrations come in.

370
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:03,960
And how does their agenda kind of impact for and the challenges that comes with it for the FDA?

371
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:09,540
Well, that's also a great question. And if the answer is,

372
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:17,729
it is always a challenge and the new administration comes in first to build

373
00:41:17,730 --> 00:41:22,709
the relationships because all of these agencies are run by political leaders.

374
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:27,330
And when I worked in FDA for the first time in the 1980s, I was a focal point of the Clinton administration.

375
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:32,490
So I was one of the new people that came in, and that time stayed for seven years.

376
00:41:34,290 --> 00:41:45,150
So it can be a challenge regardless of Democrat or Republican, regardless of ideology, regardless of the views on regulation.

377
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:54,270
Really what it comes down to is because I know that we at FDA are good at building the relationships.

378
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:58,920
We even managed to build decent working relationships with people in the Trump administration.

379
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:03,240
But FDA is not an independent regulatory agency.

380
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,800
So the Federal Trade Commission is an independent agency.

381
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,780
It's a commission of five commissioners,

382
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:21,330
and they kind of operate on their own and can do things without getting the approval of another department or of the incumbent administration.

383
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:26,700
Well, that's not the FDA. FDA is an operating division within the Department of Health and Human Services.

384
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:33,060
Department of Health and Human Services is a Cabinet level department that reports directly to the president.

385
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:46,440
And so we at FDA and a center within one of those operating divisions has no ability or right to independently enact a policy.

386
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:59,380
I think it might sound a little counterintuitive when I say that when I came back to FDA for my second stint as central director,

387
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:12,810
honestly, the interactions that we had with the Obama administration when Game Change and policy change and all of that came down to is.

388
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:18,060
Because we regulate a complicated and controversial product.

389
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,470
Controversial industry. Politically influential industry.

390
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:36,720
And any kind of game changing policy that we at the central level is going to advocate for obviously requires the political people at every level,

391
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:42,180
USDA and HHS contributions to say nothing of the lawyers and just.

392
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,840
And what I encountered in the Obama administration, frankly,

393
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:56,860
was a degree of risk aversion to spin and especially to political risk, not so much legal risk, but especially political risk.

394
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:02,590
That surprised me and ultimately was disheartening.

395
00:44:03,610 --> 00:44:10,959
I think that there are policies that I tried to pursue during my first three years

396
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,340
as center director and then during the last term of the Obama administration.

397
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,530
But I never got the support to try to push it, so they never happened.

398
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:29,050
Fortunately, the Biden administration is more supportive and less risk averse that the Obama folks.

399
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:32,590
So that's really what it what it comes down to. I mean, ironically,

400
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:36,760
some of the most important statements ever uttered by an FDA commissioner on tobacco

401
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:42,220
regulatory policy came in the Trump administration because we had a commissioner who got it.

402
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,760
He got the science. I mean, he was willing to take some risks.

403
00:44:46,790 --> 00:44:53,770
Unfortunately, he lasted less than two years. And when he left, things didn't go so well after that.

404
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:57,520
Yeah, very, very diplomatically.

405
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:10,330
Okay, we have time. One more question. You know, I wouldn't be in the room where they're trying to put things right.

406
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:15,070
So I have one question. Giving the president climate change.

407
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:23,620
Do you think that products and marketing might be reconsidered as unconstitutional,

408
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,420
as a violation, as a violation of free speech in the Congress in the future?

409
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:38,640
You're asking about actually prohibiting products. So the answer is no for not for the reason that you.

410
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:44,860
I think it's better than your question. When Congress put FDA back in the business of regulating tobacco products,

411
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:48,339
there was a short period of time where we were doing some regulation in the

412
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:54,550
1990 when Congress put the agency back into business in 2009 of the powers,

413
00:45:54,790 --> 00:46:03,070
with some exceptions, the powers that the agency were given, were what would really be impactful and potentially game changing.

414
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:09,850
But there is one section of the statute that talks about powers reserved to Congress,

415
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:16,180
and one of the powers reserved to Congress is FDA does not have the legal statutory

416
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:22,270
authority to ban any category of tobacco from the FDA can regulate the heck out of it,

417
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:29,709
but you can't ban categories of products. Only Congress can do that through the political process.

418
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:38,350
So it it would never we would never be in a situation where FDA was proposing to eliminate cigarets

419
00:46:38,470 --> 00:46:45,100
or eliminate cigars because the agency does not have the statutory legal authority to do that.

420
00:46:46,330 --> 00:46:53,350
I think your question applies mostly to, well, what if Congress passed the law that bans cigarets?

421
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:03,410
I think that there would be a constitutional challenge. I don't think that given how incredibly dangerous and toxic cigarets are, i.

422
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:10,350
I as a lawyer, I don't think that that that would know that that would pass constitutional muster.

423
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:17,860
Another power reserved to Congress. And this is an odd one. And I wish it was a power that if we did have this Congress and FDA,

424
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:23,920
you can you don't have the authority to limit the sale of tobacco products to particular types of elements,

425
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:29,109
because a lot of people in the tobacco control field have come to FDA and said, well,

426
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:33,610
it's one thing if you only allow these products to be sold in adult only establishments.

427
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:40,780
Well, it's a great idea, but it has absolutely no legal authority to take tobacco products out of gas stations,

428
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:44,049
convenience stores and any other kind of outlet.

429
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,160
That's not adult only.

430
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:53,720
Congress has the power, and that would be an interesting law to see Congress enacted if there was ever the political will to do that.

431
00:47:53,720 --> 00:48:00,250
And we know that the retail community would scream in opposition to that book without pass constitutional muster.

432
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:10,690
I don't think that's written in the right way that we've run out of time, which means that really so much violence,

433
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:18,729
if you are really into this topic, you can listen to give this talk later on when we share the details with you in just a moment.

434
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:27,070
Can we please. Thank you. Thank you.

435
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:30,930
Thank you. Thank you. All right.

436
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:36,340
Okay. Oh, that's okay.

437
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:43,710
Okay. Okay.

438
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:57,440
So this is what I think. Is it? I never had a problem that that was the only other thing that my tobacco related that required talking about saying,

439
00:48:58,170 --> 00:49:02,250
yes, there is actually and I know Jonathan had a question about this one.

440
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:09,149
I did not realize because I've been doing coronavirus stuff for a whole year and the FDA actually

441
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:15,330
has a final rule to implement graphic warnings with no pictures you can get on their site.

442
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:26,040
The final rule is coming into force next week, but don't get too excited because it's going to be months more before this shows up on actual packs.

443
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:31,680
Especially is a weird thing that the industry has to each tobacco company has to

444
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:36,900
create a plan for how they're going to display these graphic warnings on the packs.

445
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:45,150
And there are some rules when they have to display these pictures and they have to have a plan to take the pictures, which is something I referred to,

446
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:53,219
like when we were talking about the evidence in the last class and the FDA has to approve that plan before it goes into effect.

447
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:57,060
So I'm interested to see how that implementation works.

448
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:05,160
I think it could be kind of choppy, sort of roundabout way of implementing this law, which other countries haven't really followed.

449
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,150
So now I'm fired up to go study that when it actually happens.

450
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:13,170
Or maybe if you guys come into my office next to you, see,

451
00:50:13,170 --> 00:50:21,180
I've got this American text maybe to my collection of different stats from around the world, which is creepy in the past.

452
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:25,800
I'm sorry. So I don't want to did this last 20 minutes too.

453
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:35,040
We can talk more about policy than I was, but I was also thinking it might be more fun if I just did the AMA.

454
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:41,159
I've talked a bit about some of the work that I do and some of the policy writing that I've done.

455
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:50,160
So I'm wondering if you have questions for me about what those experiences were like or yeah, anything at all.

456
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:54,750
I mean, we did a I did a lot of things over the last year, pandemic related.

457
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:59,280
I also work with the EU and right now we're working on the global health strategy,

458
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,179
which is really suggesting some very good things and they're not listening.

459
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:06,390
So that will be very interesting as it goes forward.

460
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:11,670
Yeah, I was wondering if you guys have any questions for me. We've only got 20 minutes, so let's make the best of it.

461
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:17,280
And yes, they can be questions about policy and anything else class related.

462
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:22,690
Please. It's mechanical.

463
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:26,710
Thank God it's for you, Praneeth. I've not had enough caffeine to run around the stalls.

464
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:33,280
Thank you. I'm totally over about your work with you.

465
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:44,230
Yeah, of course. So you use the European Union? I studied the EU here, my Ph.D., particularly in your trade policy.

466
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:49,540
I studied trade policy, personal health policy, because it would give me a great perspective.

467
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:55,360
At the moment, the EU is designing its new global health strategy,

468
00:51:56,020 --> 00:52:02,230
and there's also the time pressure politically, because this has to come out pretty much by the end of the year.

469
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:11,590
And so it's interesting. They asked us for some advice and asking myself, my colleagues problems in the process.

470
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,909
And we work with the European Observatory on Health System Policy.

471
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:19,750
So we're working with them. They're meeting of the W.H.O. in Europe.

472
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:32,580
So we've been making some recommendations around trying to use the policy powers that the EU has in a lot of areas to try to address global health.

473
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:42,160
We'd like to see global health issues incorporated, included in a wide range of policies because it tends to get pigeonholed into this,

474
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:48,670
into being a development policy, or the EU loves to talk about its overseas aid,

475
00:52:48,670 --> 00:52:53,280
which it does give a lot of money, but it is a problematic history that.

476
00:52:53,290 --> 00:52:59,619
Right. So the EU actually has a lot of power and it's a really big market.

477
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:07,060
It's a large number of countries, huge population, lot of money potentially for anyone wanting to break into that market.

478
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:15,090
And so we're trying to make this argument that trade policy, investment policy gives a natural property, some of these other areas of regulation.

479
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,440
We really should focus on health.

480
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:26,950
Would you consider health and how they're going to promote the health of populations outside of the EU rather than being detrimental to them?

481
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:30,970
Because a lot of people see have a two edged sword. If they're managed as well,

482
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:37,959
they can lead to many probably better health outcomes if they manage quality because of the

483
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:44,020
reasons that power disparities between the EU and that country can be a very bad situation.

484
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:52,990
So we've been trying to make that point. I don't know whether they're listening, but we're hearing our the folks who just came in,

485
00:53:53,080 --> 00:54:01,870
I thought we would just do a amazes me for the last 20 minutes that doesn't have to be explicitly focused on policy memos or anything else.

486
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:06,410
Does anyone else have a question? Hi.

487
00:54:07,570 --> 00:54:13,440
My question will wait for the speaker or the people who were at home watching his.

488
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:24,460
I don't know. I feel that my question is just about I mean, you've made a couple of additions to the the frustration and the slow progress.

489
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:30,540
And I'm wondering, how do you cultivate resiliency?

490
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:35,080
How how do you manage that sort of consistent frustration?

491
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,190
This is a very technical question, but it's it's a good question.

492
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,380
I mean, I'm not always very important in all of these conversations.

493
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:51,850
Sometimes I am and sometimes my research is is what's being considered all the time.

494
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:53,079
But when you do the projects,

495
00:54:53,080 --> 00:55:03,640
we've kind of supported because of political scientists that approach this kind of thing as a form of public engagement and therapy, frankly.

496
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:13,190
I don't have a clear idea of the goals I want to see, but if I can't do even small things towards the right things, I would be more frustrated.

497
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:22,780
Like if I wasn't doing anything about this situation and I'm trying to improve policy, I think I'd get more frustrated more quickly.

498
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:32,740
The difficult part is when you put yourself out there and you've done a piece of work and you've done indication of this, and then nobody picks it up.

499
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:40,629
We've written some things where they've been quite influential, some of them that we intended to be agreed to.

500
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:47,050
And it worked like the the book we wrote on European Union health policy, which is free to access.

501
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:55,059
It turns out bureaucrats need books that tell them about their policy and because sometimes they don't know what their authority is right,

502
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,210
or what the potential is in that policy area.

503
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:03,190
So we're trying to spark a bit of imagination in them about what they can do.

504
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:10,480
That was really successful. We did a bunch of stuff vaccines, not that no public engagement comedian or nothing.

505
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:16,780
So when I get confronted with that, it's one reason I do multiple projects.

506
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:20,110
And you just have to say to yourself, Look, I did my best.

507
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:23,050
You can't control the power differentials necessarily.

508
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:33,240
But I do think that every policy person should care about political systems and about the power differentials within that system,

509
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:36,459
and then do think about ways to change that.

510
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,240
And that's one of the reasons that I do policy work,

511
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:45,910
but also the governance work because the governance what is political and governance is

512
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:49,690
a great way to talk about politics with politicians without anything about politics.

513
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:58,360
So you can say you should adopt this governance framework which is more transparent or includes better participation or inclusiveness,

514
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:06,220
to tamp down on corruption in a way that you can't say that if you're just saying the politics here are terrible and you need to fix it.

515
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:11,139
Right. So it's a long helps to your question.

516
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:15,520
I don't know why I answered it properly. So I think the short answer is that you reframe.

517
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:22,120
Yeah, right. I try to rephrase it and see what language you can get.

518
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:30,790
Think about the longer term. And this is, I think when it's frustrating for people doing this, first off, you could do advocacy.

519
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:37,600
You might get a small time success in a backseat and then knock it for a while and you have to be in the

520
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:45,970
game for longer in order to actually accumulate relationships and resources and colleagues or allies,

521
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:50,670
depending on what position you're in, in the political system, and to get some traction.

522
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:56,200
And even then, you know, party politics can come along and squish you sometimes.

523
00:57:56,200 --> 00:58:03,880
So you're going to be in it for the long term. You have some question would.

524
00:58:06,290 --> 00:58:13,729
I wander around a little bit haphazard from as far as I was concerned.

525
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:17,390
I just quickly pulled out your CV. Oh, my God.

526
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:26,090
Why are you like this?

527
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,299
I know, I know. You mentioned this was your first assignment.

528
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:34,050
They thought you are part of us. Like you have another job.

529
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:44,430
But I don't know. That's common for associate. So I'd love to hear how your balance in that and then how it like how your education is failing the UK.

530
00:58:44,450 --> 00:58:48,290
How did you get your position? How does that come from?

531
00:58:49,550 --> 00:58:59,510
Yeah, so far we've not been out of the house yet, so yeah, we like being in the UK.

532
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,430
It's going to be nice to have the London School of Economics exactly the sort of economic,

533
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:12,229
political science I'm pretty sure I've told you guys, but I ended up here for seven different reasons.

534
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:17,990
When I was studying my dissertation, I wanted to compare what the EU was doing on trade with what the US was doing.

535
00:59:17,990 --> 00:59:21,920
So I spent a year and a half something like that.

536
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:31,370
I work for a nonprofit in D.C. which political scientists are part of it because it produces something called the liberal quotient,

537
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:36,500
which is a voting indicator which you'd never have to know about unless you studied party politics.

538
00:59:37,610 --> 00:59:43,280
People who study American political history narcotic because it was a group that were that was part of

539
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,950
the progressive movement in particularly in the sixties and seventies in the US and still exist now.

540
00:59:49,310 --> 00:59:54,680
So I did some campaigning, I did some organizing. I quite liked it here.

541
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:59,300
I was living in D.C. I came back for my dissertation to do fieldwork in D.C.,

542
00:59:59,810 --> 01:00:07,610
interviewed a lot of people into a lot of meetings and did observations so that interest in America was there.

543
01:00:08,750 --> 01:00:13,060
And when I started looking for jobs, I started looking for jobs in the States as well as here.

544
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:17,240
And it happened that my first job was at SUNY Albany in the US.

545
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:27,979
And so that's sort of where I come from. The question So we did Army Corps, I'm very lucky.

546
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:31,040
One of my former Ph.D. students works there now.

547
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:34,550
He came. He worked there before he started then he works there again.

548
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:39,470
Mean now he's super senior and I don't sound as important as he is,

549
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:47,210
but we've been working together for a while and he called me up and I actually called Scott up as well.

550
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:55,990
Yeah, actually, both on his committee somewhere in the beginning of the pandemic saying we need social science expertize on the table.

551
01:00:56,750 --> 01:01:02,720
And we said, okay. And so we we did that on an on and off basis for a few months for three.

552
01:01:03,710 --> 01:01:11,150
So he would call us and say, what's your social scientific take or political take on this issue in Guam?

553
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,800
And we would say, okay, let's figure that out.

554
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:22,160
And so there were lots of these random questions in the beginning, and we eventually figured out how to do that efficiently.

555
01:01:23,030 --> 01:01:29,450
And it turns out there's a need to understand how the response measures used to

556
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:35,329
try and stop the spread of COVID across countries and how those countries differ.

557
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:43,310
So there's a real need to understand how few differences, political differences, health system differences,

558
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:49,670
public health differences, because the people we were talking to, the federal government did not appreciate that.

559
01:01:49,670 --> 01:02:00,320
They would quite often and unfortunately look at a country like South Africa and they would say, well, so the disease is spreading like this.

560
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:06,769
And we would say, hang on a minute, you're going to apply that lesson to the U.S., that you've got different demographics,

561
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:11,210
you've got different patterns of spread, you've got a younger population, much younger in South Africa.

562
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:22,340
And they would do things like, why are we adopting the policies of Sweden, which were quite a bit more hands off by some measures,

563
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:25,970
but actually quite strict by other measures, which is the thing that most people don't like.

564
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:29,719
And they say, Well, why can't we do the Swedish approach in America?

565
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:37,850
This was constant under the Trump administration, particularly, was we we want to do less, we want to have a hands off approach.

566
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:44,999
And so we would explain to them patiently and carefully that Sweden is not a good comparative country with the United States for various reasons.

567
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,650
But I can go on about at any point later.

568
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:56,120
But it is a population health system, culture of governance, very different.

569
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:00,330
And so it doesn't make sense to directly apply policies from that context to here.

570
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:04,700
So it's our job to try and speak up when people are.

571
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,120
Any suggestions like that and say, well, hang on a minute,

572
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:12,880
you have to understand the context in which this is being implemented in order to understand effectiveness.

573
01:03:12,910 --> 01:03:14,980
So that's what we we did a lot of.

574
01:03:15,570 --> 01:03:23,889
And then probably we'll be doing some of the same thing this year around climate change and some more environmental things too,

575
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:28,330
as they get added into the mix that it's a long answer to.

576
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:32,410
Yeah, yeah. I think that's so cool that we got that article.

577
01:03:32,440 --> 01:03:36,670
Our position grew up using it. I think. Yeah. And so I still work with it now.

578
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:38,619
It's difficult to manage,

579
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:49,720
but it's there are forms of contracts with government agencies where they pay the researcher without having to have like a concrete research project.

580
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:54,489
So that's something that's been in law for a long time. So I, I have one of those agreements.

581
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:57,700
So some portion of my effort goes towards that work.

582
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:03,940
And then the rest of the time I'm working on how many final minutes?

583
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:07,500
Any more questions? Well.

584
01:04:09,830 --> 01:04:14,480
Sorry. Yeah, just tuck it in.

585
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:18,049
I was just wondering my back to the EU. You're talking about policy there.

586
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:20,510
I was wondering how challenging it is to move from,

587
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:26,460
like overall EU policy to like policy in specific countries in the EU and specifically with like the

588
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:32,690
changes in leadership of like with Italy in putting in their new leadership and everything like that,

589
01:04:32,690 --> 01:04:35,240
being so conservative and stuff like that kind of.

590
01:04:36,890 --> 01:04:47,840
Well, we basically are going to call out my former student who studied the far right actually in the far right classes in Austria,

591
01:04:47,840 --> 01:04:51,559
and he's just finished a last year on exactly that.

592
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:56,900
So I definitely have to have a little chat with her about what's going on there, which is really unfortunate.

593
01:04:58,370 --> 01:05:03,469
So. Now can I study the EU as an entity?

594
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:09,830
So I have to look quite a bit about how they government health a policy across the 27 country market.

595
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:14,510
I wouldn't hold the people who practice in the country.

596
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:21,230
So the European Observatory has specialists in pretty much every country in Europe.

597
01:05:21,530 --> 01:05:30,830
They work with a lot of policy makers directly. So it's our job to think about how those countries policies interact with the EU.

598
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:38,930
Within the EU, the Organization of Finance and Health Systems remains a national competence.

599
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:46,490
So if you are in France with the UK and Germany, your government is setting the organization and budget.

600
01:05:46,970 --> 01:05:53,299
Well, what happens is they mostly go all the questions is a much more heavy involvement from

601
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:58,400
the EU as a group of countries that you can see clearly on public health policy.

602
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:01,660
So that's actually where it gets kind of interesting.

603
01:06:02,330 --> 01:06:08,000
Fortunately, I don't have to be an expert in every country because I think that would be impossible for one person.

604
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:15,060
But especially I don't think it's necessary linguistic skills to make that work.

605
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:23,870
So it's you know, it is actually best in most cases.

606
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:29,000
Oh, well, I simply want your questions.

607
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:35,300
Spend time, don't you think, for a short period you're going to have this conversation here next.

608
01:06:35,450 --> 01:06:44,629
So if anyone has questions about oh, you know, about you some from these discussions or anything else with my free time out,

609
01:06:44,630 --> 01:06:48,380
there's no one else to give you some sort of interesting.

610
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:00,550
Yeah, I know.
