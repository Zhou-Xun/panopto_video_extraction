1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:14,140
Yeah. I think you could control it. No, I realize again, I know that nearly everybody routinely sits in this part of the show from back in the day.

2
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:24,820
I know. And I sat down.

3
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:33,730
I was cooperating with that when I was there, though.

4
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:55,960
I know what I told them, but I want to say yes, yes, yes.

5
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:08,430
Welcome to Michigan Fall. Well, I kind of feel so thinking back now to the week ago or over a weekend,

6
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:13,240
over a week ago, we talked about how insurance affects the demand for care.

7
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:19,420
And then we talked about, well, it could even create a entirely new demand curve that reflects the fact that you have insurance

8
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:26,259
to cleanly sort of incorporate how insurance affects the demand for things that everyone thinks,

9
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:31,430
sort of the next step and about insurance and sort of why not want health insurance in the first place?

10
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:38,769
What's the what are the factors that also the demand for how much coverage they want and whether they want coverage at all

11
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:47,290
because they want coverage or do they want to have coverage with lower premiums but leaves them with greater out-of-pocket costs?

12
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:57,610
So in a couple of ways in which health insurance relative to other types of insurance is kind of weird.

13
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:05,740
So we talked about the car insurance example. Car insurance is simply to your car gets totaled.

14
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:09,880
They send you a check that's equal to the market price of the car that was totaled.

15
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:23,200
And then you can use that money on whatever you want. So that tends to work well when both the insurers can identify the cost of the adverse event.

16
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,240
And that's the main reason for why insurance is just to protect you against the financial risk.

17
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,239
To have that already talked about health insurance, like any other type of insurance,

18
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,290
is partly demanded in order to protect you against financial risk.

19
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:44,020
But you're also secondary reason for wanting health insurance that can improve your access to care,

20
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:48,190
even care that might be affordable and doesn't have insurance,

21
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:55,540
in a sense, care that you couldn't afford as an insurance if you wouldn't consume it absent insurance doesn't create a financial risk.

22
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:04,329
If you don't get it, there's no cost to it. But having access to it provide protection against a greater risk of having a life threatening

23
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:08,290
condition for which there is an effective treatment that you otherwise couldn't receive.

24
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,370
So you're buying not just protection against financial risk.

25
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,320
You're also buying access to care that you couldn't be otherwise. And that's very different than the car insurance example.

26
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,030
If my car gets totaled, you're not going to send me a check to buy a new Ferrari.

27
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,100
My current car is about $300,000 less expensive than a Ferrari.

28
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:38,620
So in a sense, with health insurance, it's kind of like saying why one insurance, not just to cover the financial risk,

29
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,260
but the concern is that turns out that I really, really need a Ferrari and I couldn't afford.

30
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:46,660
Absent health insurance, I can get the Ferrari.

31
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,550
So it's not just to cover the financial risk, but it's also to get me access to care that I couldn't afford without it.

32
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,760
There's another reason that health insurance is weird. For most types of insurance.

33
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:07,640
You really don't think twice about rates being set based on the individual's level of risk.

34
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:16,910
About life insurance organs. So you're relatively healthy, I assume most of you, relatively young people.

35
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:23,750
How would you feel about a life insurance policy that says, you know what, we're going to bore you with a bunch of 70 year olds?

36
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,220
We have five comorbid conditions and we're in charge of the average rate.

37
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,200
So that's not a good deal. That's unfair.

38
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:43,480
Would you buy that policy? No. So you don't feel like, even for life insurance, that there is a need for, say,

39
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:47,690
younger, healthier people to cross-subsidize, older and less healthy people?

40
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:58,640
Auto insurance? Yes. You have a minivan and you're 45 years old and you've got a 30 year clean driving record.

41
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,320
How would you feel if the insurance companies said, you know what?

42
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:12,620
We're going to charge you the same rate as we charge a 22 year old with two DWI convictions, ten speeding tickets and five at fault accidents.

43
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:18,100
That drives a sports car. That's some good, you know.

44
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,459
So for most types of insurance, we really don't we don't think it's controversial that different people should be

45
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,420
charged different rates based on the level of risk that they pose to the insurer.

46
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,680
Health insurance, we feel kind of differently.

47
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:41,470
A lot of people sort of want or expect health insurers to charge higher and lower risk to people the same premiums.

48
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:46,310
Yeah. Do you have health insurance in many people's minds as well?

49
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,050
The young and healthy cross-subsidize, the older and less healthy.

50
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,330
And that's the way it should work.

51
00:05:53,410 --> 00:06:01,990
And that's why I saw premium protection for preexisting conditions is kind of one of the most uniformly popular features of the Affordable Care Act.

52
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:12,280
So why do we feel differently about health insurance than we did for life insurance or auto insurance or renters insurance or any

53
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:18,999
of these other types of insurance where we think it's perfectly natural for higher risk people to be charged higher premiums.

54
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,340
And we don't think there's any problem with that for a number of potential reasons.

55
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,440
One of them, a lot of conditions are out.

56
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,780
If we fill out of people, call the 22 year old with the DWI convictions and speeding tickets and at fault accidents.

57
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:39,040
Well, that's kind of on them. That's their decision.

58
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:46,889
That's forcing them. Whereas a lot of our health conditions are things that just happened to us and we didn't choose to have them,

59
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:50,200
maybe everything we possibly could to live a healthy lifestyle.

60
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,770
And we still got cancer and we still had a heart attack.

61
00:06:57,530 --> 00:07:03,500
Another is that insurance contracts generally are written on an annual basis by a contract.

62
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:08,950
Right now, my open enrollment I think started this week, so I have to decide in the next two weeks.

63
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:14,510
So by the end of October, I have to decide what my plan is going to be for the year 2023,

64
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:20,450
and then I can do that again next October for my 2024 coverage.

65
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:30,860
So what happens if there's no no protection for preexisting conditions and I develop a new chronic condition next year?

66
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:36,840
What's going to happen to my premiums for the rest of my life after that? Well.

67
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,879
So these annual health insurance contracts protect us pretty well.

68
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,810
If I do, if I've got a decent insurance policy from the financial risks of things that occur to me during that policy year,

69
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:55,049
if we didn't have preexisting conditions protections and we didn't have large group coverage and we just said,

70
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:05,580
well, everybody has to buy an individual policy each year and it's rated on the basis of the expected risk that they insure for that coming year.

71
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:10,380
Well, as soon as I'm develop a new chronic condition, I premiums go up for the rest of my life.

72
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:14,670
I also face financial risk of my premiums going up.

73
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:25,270
So by having preexisting conditions protections that kind of protects people against that risk of becoming a high risk in the future.

74
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:30,010
Now, we could also, in principle solve that by having longer term insurance contracts,

75
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:36,340
but as long as we stick with sort of annual insurance contracts, when people's risks can change over time.

76
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:43,060
Then having preexisting conditions coverage protects us not just from the financial risks we face during that calendar year,

77
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:49,030
but protects us from the financial risks of what if I become a less healthy than average person in the future?

78
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,010
I would have to pay higher premiums for the whole rest of my life because of that.

79
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:59,790
That's a real financial risk in annual contracts that get reclassified year by year.

80
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,200
And then finally, we want others to be able to access care.

81
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:13,710
So for all those three reasons, it seems like health insurance, that's a weird aspect of health insurance kind of arises for a number of reasons.

82
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,100
And we don't feel for life insurance or auto insurance.

83
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:24,630
The need to say that, well, you know, a safe driver should pay higher premiums in order to cross-subsidize less safe drivers.

84
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,809
We don't have any problem with premiums going up over time.

85
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:35,390
And if suddenly I get a bunch of DWI convictions that my premiums should be higher in the future, we think that's fair.

86
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,700
But for health insurance, we don't think that's fair because these things are outside of people's control.

87
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,390
You have these annual contracts that places us at risk of being reclassified, having to pay much higher premiums in the future.

88
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:55,260
You know, they have some protections and we want to make sure that others can afford therapy and medicine for America.

89
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:07,410
Now, what are the problems that a health insurance market might face? Already talked with detail about one last, which we talk about moral hazard.

90
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,460
What about the idea that health insurance changes people's incentives can change your incentives for preventive care,

91
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,150
making the risk of a bad event occurring in the first place go up.

92
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,190
And it could also change the incentives on how much care to use once that bad event occurs.

93
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:34,989
There's also adverse selection. So you think of asymmetric information as often being, you know, the doctor knows things.

94
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:38,080
I don't know. The consumer's at a disadvantage.

95
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:43,900
Well, in this case, the consumer knows things the insurer doesn't know. The consumer might be at an informational advantage.

96
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:50,110
So if people have private information about their health status or family history, their preferences, for example,

97
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,320
and we expect that higher risks might be more likely to buy policies or might buy more generous policies.

98
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:02,050
Another problem that insurance markets might face is non-independent risks.

99
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,329
Insurance works really well for things where the one enrollees.

100
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,470
The risk of having the event is independent of all other enrollees risks.

101
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:17,320
Because then if you enroll enough people, you're going to supply the statistical law of large numbers and say that, well,

102
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:20,740
if I know enough about the population I'm insuring,

103
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:26,050
I can predict very accurately how many heart attacks are going to be in that population in the coming year.

104
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:33,670
I might over predict or under predict by a handful, but I'm going to be very, very, very close and a large population.

105
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,809
I'm assuring a million people I can probably know that,

106
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:45,670
say 50,000 of them are going to have heart attacks this year or 5000 or whatever the number is, plus or minus a very small error.

107
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,480
And that's simply because my having a heart attack is independent of your having a heart attack this year.

108
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:57,380
They were all independent risks where a million independent risks of heart attack.

109
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:03,760
Else. Not all risks are independent. We found that out in the last two and a half years.

110
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:10,700
Very strongly contagious disease is not independent by getting COVID is definitely correlated with your getting COVID.

111
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:19,520
You think about insurance for things like natural disasters, flood insurance, hurricane insurance, earthquake insurance.

112
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,620
Even if I live in San Francisco, my likelihood of earthquake damage is very,

113
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,950
very highly correlated with my neighbor's likelihood of earthquake damage.

114
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,990
There's no such thing as a devastating earthquake hitting my house and not affecting my neighbors.

115
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:40,639
So insurers have a harder time dealing with these not independent risks because they might have years where they don't pay

116
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:47,300
any claims and other years where they have a massive claims liability unless they've maintained a huge amount of reserves.

117
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:53,470
They're not going to have enough money to pay out claims when the big natural disaster hits their populations.

118
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:02,649
And finally, do people make good decisions? Lack of information and where we talk later in November,

119
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:11,620
we have Jeff Colburn as a guest speaker to talk about behavioral economics and sort of the decision biases that people often face.

120
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:19,749
So here's some non-independent risks very different than a heart attack this or a graphical graph of,

121
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:26,230
you know, where do people have heart attacks in this community this year? There would be a dot here would be a dot here that would be about it.

122
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:30,670
And if we drew it again the next year, maybe there'd be a dot here and a dot here.

123
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,710
Obviously, when a natural disaster strikes, everything is wiped out.

124
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:46,720
So if I'm an insurance company and my business is I'm only insuring homeowners in Fort Bliss in Fort Myers, Florida, against hurricane damage.

125
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:50,860
Well, guess what? Most years I paid out nothing. This year, I'm screwed.

126
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:58,760
So I want to kind of create more independence in my risk pool by saying I'm going to some houses at Fort Myers.

127
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,809
I'm not sure some houses on either side of Florida. Some houses in Louisiana.

128
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:07,820
Some houses in Carolina. So that.

129
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,010
Even if they're actually working in one of those scenarios,

130
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:19,100
I still have the premiums paid in the other areas plus some level of reserves I still have to keep because I can still have a bad year,

131
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:30,190
much more so than I would covering heart attack here. So why do people want health insurance?

132
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:33,940
I'd like to avoid or reduce risk.

133
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:38,530
And we talk about medical care as being a derived demand. I actually don't like medical care.

134
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:43,090
I don't enjoy getting it. I don't want to go to the doctor. I don't want to go to the hospital.

135
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,170
I don't want to do surgery. But what I do demand is good health.

136
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,390
That's something that creates utility for me.

137
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:56,650
So if I see scenarios where these unpleasant things can be valuable inputs in creating that other thing that I do care about.

138
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,940
Things can happen to my health that will then create a financial risk through this induced demand for medical care.

139
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,440
I'd love to be able to directly insure health, to buy a policy that says if something bad happens to me,

140
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,870
you'll restore my health by that policy, but I can buy the policy.

141
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:21,640
It says, if something bad happens to me. You'll pay for the medical care that I will use to help me restore my health.

142
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,700
You'll help me buy this input into the production of good health. So that's what creates the insurable risk.

143
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:37,320
Then we also have this access motive we talked about. And last Monday we talked about sort of the ideal health insurance market and it is

144
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:41,010
sort of moving into come around two states of the world where it's really valuable.

145
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:49,330
And the health insurance policy lets you sort of mimic that ideal policy and say, well, when does it pay off?

146
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,430
It pays off in states of the world where something happens to me that's just really bad and there's really expensive care that can be helpful.

147
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,079
In other words, a stay in the world where my marginal utility of income would be really, really high.

148
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,790
I really want money to be able to pay for that heart attack care or that organ transplant.

149
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:16,080
As we said, some of that care might even be unaffordable. Apps that insurance meetings are not really buying the insurance to cover financial risk.

150
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:22,320
If I wouldn't get the care absent insurance, it wouldn't create any financial risk even less because of this induced demand.

151
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:36,370
Drive demand for health. How do I choose an insurance policy that's going to keep the policy really, really simple?

152
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,870
One parameter co-insurance. The generosity is a full coverage, a, b, c, zero.

153
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,700
Uninsurance, a, b c was 100%. And so.

154
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:55,300
My decision is as a consumer, as do I want to buy a policy that has full coverage for not buy a policy at all?

155
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,610
Or do I want to buy a policy through some level of cost sharing?

156
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:02,770
If so, do I want a really generous policy, maybe five or 10% cost sharing?

157
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:09,190
Or do I want a policy that's a lower premium but a higher cost assurance at 20 or 30 or 40%?

158
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:13,570
I'd like sort of gold, silver, bronze.

159
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:22,780
In the health insurance exchanges, gold plan would have 20% on average, silver 30% and bronze would be 40% on average out of pocket cost.

160
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:31,490
So my problem as a consumer. So I choose that level of coverage, that generosity of coverage to maximize my expected utility.

161
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,750
So think of how much insurance I'm buying a sort of let's see.

162
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:43,160
I think the smaller the C as the more insurance I'm buying, the greater the C is, the greater the coinsurance rate, the less insurance I buy.

163
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:49,700
Let's assume that I'm risk averse. Kind of establish everybody here is risk averse.

164
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:58,000
Talked about some gambles that you would or would not take. What I necessarily want full coverage.

165
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,060
So think about that for a minute. You know, you're all risk averse.

166
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:09,080
We established that by nobody wanted to take me off of the coin toss game and that we had to give you

167
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:14,000
a much higher than 5050 odds of winning that game before we got everybody's hand to go up and say,

168
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,570
Yeah, I take that chance. So you're all risk averse.

169
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:27,210
Does that mean you'd necessarily want full coverage? Or what might we do to say, you know what, it's worth accepting some level of co-insurance?

170
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:38,370
Yeah. I mean, you'd want to think about your expected utilization of health care for the next year.

171
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,150
You're expecting low utilization. You'd maybe pick a plan that has some level of co-insurance.

172
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:51,689
Okay. Especially if you can't get a rate that is totally based on your individual level of risk or maybe you get it through your employer.

173
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:57,780
So when I buy my policy, they don't tailor my premium to my individual level of risk.

174
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:04,680
So if I think I'm not going to use a lot of care next year, I might say, you know, I'll buy I'll take the less generous option for the lower premium.

175
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,190
I think I'm going to use a lot of care that I'd want the more generous.

176
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:16,499
So if the way insurance is priced to me isn't tailored exactly to my personal level of risk, I'd say, You know what?

177
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,680
It's worth it to bear some cost sharing for a lower premium,

178
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,690
because my premium is sort of forcing me to cross-subsidize people who are getting this more here than me.

179
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:32,680
And so that's one good reason. I also have something so very much related to that.

180
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:41,960
Did you buy insurance for the actuarial fair premium? I'm sure insurer is going to be in business for very long if they're charging the fee.

181
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:48,200
So the fee for recall means that they're charging you just enough that they've

182
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:52,520
collected enough premiums during the year to pay out the claims that are due that year.

183
00:19:53,600 --> 00:20:00,440
In other words, there's nothing left at the end of the year. So if they have any administrative costs of running the policy, which they certainly do,

184
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:05,360
or if their investors have any hope of making a profit if they're charging the AFP.

185
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:17,270
Actually, you'll be losing money. So if you're charged premiums above the AFP, even if you're risk averse, you might say, wait a second,

186
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:22,760
maybe taking a little bit of risk in order to reduce the premium is worthwhile because I'm not really getting the greatest deal.

187
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,440
And that's actually the exact same rationale effectively that what you laid out.

188
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:32,930
You know, if you're if you're in a group where you're pooled with people that are riskier than you are,

189
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,540
you're being charged more than your personal IFP.

190
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:41,540
So that's exactly the motivation for saying, You know what, I'll choose a plan that's got a little less generous coverage.

191
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:49,830
Saves me some premium. Maybe it doesn't only that some of the folks I don't support it.

192
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:56,030
There's another reason related to what we talked about last Monday, moral hazard.

193
00:20:56,810 --> 00:21:04,250
So if getting very generous coverage means that we've got to buy we're going to buy more care as a group,

194
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:11,740
the premium has to go up to reflect that extra care. So if we have some level of cost sharing, the controls that overutilization,

195
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:16,510
the premium can go down through or the example we had of the the Michigan

196
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:25,420
premiums for blue care for the super network plan for silver bronze silver gold.

197
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:29,830
And how that went up sort of more than linearly with the coverage.

198
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,630
In other words, the more generous coverage was expensive, not just because it covered a greater percent.

199
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:39,400
We as insurer anticipated that the people would take the more generous coverage,

200
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:43,420
are going to use more care because they've got less reason to cut back.

201
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:47,120
And or it would be the sicker people choose, the more generous coverage.

202
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:53,740
Probably both of those factors are in play. So with moral hazard, we've got a surcharge.

203
00:21:54,780 --> 00:22:05,130
More in order to cover that extra cost. So getting that access to that extra care that, you know, isn't probably super valuable care.

204
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,360
Fires you to pay a much higher premium.

205
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:14,250
It might be worthwhile to say, You know what, I'm going to take a little more cost sharing in exchange for a lower.

206
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:19,990
So those are the main reasons if you're charged more than the AFP,

207
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:25,899
either because you're pooled with people who are sicker than you are or just simply because insurers have to

208
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:33,910
charge more than the to stay in business or because premiums go up to cover the extra utilization of care.

209
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,660
More generous plans. Even a risk averse person would say, You know what, I don't necessarily want full coverage.

210
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,450
Scott Well, we just talked about that behavioral response. Insurer pays a higher fraction of medical costs.

211
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,240
You're going to use more care. The premium has to go up to cover that.

212
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,640
It's not really a sort of what I call the fundamental tradeoff in the choice of insurance.

213
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:04,930
There are two objectives you're trying to meet with that insurance design. So here the insurance design is simply a choice of how generous it is.

214
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:09,249
What's the co-insurance rate, risk averse people.

215
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,559
Ideally, we want to we want to spread financial risk.

216
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:16,660
We want the insurer to bear that risk rather than us as individuals bearing it, because we're all risk averse.

217
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:22,480
And the insurer can pool us insured, can diversify our risks and bear them for us.

218
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:29,799
So that risk spreading itself says, well, we want really complete coverage because we're risk averse.

219
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,530
Why not pool this risk and have somebody else bear it for us?

220
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,290
But on the other hand, the more generous the coverage is, the more distorted our incentives are.

221
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,759
When I say our incentives, I mean the incentives of the group of enrollees and all of us,

222
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,959
when we have very generous coverage, we're not going to be conscious of the cost of care.

223
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,470
Therefore, we're going to use more care. We're not going to shop around for lower prices,

224
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:58,000
etc. So that increases the care level and therefore we have to raise the premiums to cover all that extra care.

225
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,429
So that's really the tradeoff.

226
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:06,760
The more we want really generous coverage to protect against risk, but the more generous the coverage is, the more distorted our incentives are.

227
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:14,230
So we're trying to find the best. The best balance is probably either no coverage nor 100% coverage.

228
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,960
May differ for people.

229
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:29,130
And so risk averse consumers are going to want high coverage, but high coverage reduces the out-of-pocket price, causing them to buy more care.

230
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:35,450
Let's take an example. I was going to jump to the graph for this one.

231
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:12,649
You know, I suppose we've got two types of illnesses.

232
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:19,760
We've got a mild illness or a severe illness. I suppose my demand for care, if I get the mild illness, is this lower demand curve.

233
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,880
That's also a more price elastic demand curve.

234
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,920
It's a flatter demand curve.

235
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:32,270
It's more responsive to changes in pricing, or I suppose I might get severely ill, and if I'm severely ill, I get more demand, much more care.

236
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,559
But let's also make the assumption that maybe the care that I demand around severely

237
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:41,080
ill I'm less price of plastic with respect to those things are much more important.

238
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:50,209
If I had the moderate illness there's a lot more. Well, I can see the doctor once a month or twice a month, whereas if I had severe illness,

239
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:54,770
maybe more of the care that I consumers have, you know, get the surgery or don't get the surgery.

240
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:59,150
And I really want to get the surgery because the outcomes are much better than not getting it.

241
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:11,090
So if that's the case, we see that in the mild illness, we get a big increase in care when I have insurance.

242
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:14,570
So I've got the this is the co-insurance price, oil prices here.

243
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,469
Co-insurance, maybe that's about a 25% co-insurance rate.

244
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:23,480
It looks like the out-of-pocket price that I face is about 25% as high as using

245
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:29,330
a sliding down the demand curve estimate of how how insurance affects demand.

246
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:37,339
And we say, well, I'm going to buy in two rather than I'm one. And then the shaded area is we call that welfare loss over insurance.

247
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,860
The reason they call that the welfare loss from over insurance, welfare laws for moral hazard, I should say.

248
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:50,350
As we're looking at the difference between the full price of those extra units of care and using that strong

249
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:55,360
value interpretation of the demand curve is reflecting how much those extra units are worth to consumers.

250
00:26:55,770 --> 00:27:02,680
So while they're worth a lot less in that shaded area, it's just the difference between the full price of those extra units.

251
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:17,080
There's their full price. That's what they're worth to consumers.

252
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:24,549
So we kind of just walk off that triangle and say that's how much more of those extra units of care cost.

253
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:28,120
And therefore the insurer has to charge extra premiums to cover that cost.

254
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:33,100
How much more it is? And then those care, those extra years of year, are actually worth to our consumers.

255
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:42,790
Ideally, we would like the consumers to stop here and consume only those units of care that are worth more to them in the forecast to providing them.

256
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:51,560
So this would be an area of consumer surplus. There's a kind of think this is an area of negative consumer surplus.

257
00:27:52,190 --> 00:28:00,920
Or if I have the insurance plan, I am going to consume those extra units of care because I'm going to use that against this lower price of CP.

258
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,070
But the premium has to go up to reflect that extra care.

259
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:13,340
That severe illness case where I assume the demand was relatively price inelastic,

260
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:19,490
the types of care of the baby I consume, what I'm severely at home unless price sensitive towards,

261
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:29,810
there's a much smaller increase with insurance I buy and for rather than having three which is only a little bit more care,

262
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:34,580
I say, Well, what's the welfare loss from that low value care that I'm consuming?

263
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:39,530
It's relatively small. There's the full price the insurer has to pay.

264
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:44,390
You sure. Plus me after paying as I'm paying part of it, I think keep the insurer.

265
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:52,920
Insurer essentially is paying that difference. Insurer pays that.

266
00:28:56,020 --> 00:29:02,760
I pay that. So I'm going to behave as if the price is here.

267
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,200
So I'm buying for real.

268
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:13,150
With those extra units of care there, they're worth the price I have to pay to get them, but they're not worth the total price.

269
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:17,810
So again, we get that sort of negative consumer surplus and call it a welfare loss.

270
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,370
And that has to be covered.

271
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:28,959
So that's why I sort of covering things that have high moral hazard, where extra insurance is going to go to cause a lot of increasing use of care.

272
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,180
That's not worth its full price to consumers. It's going to be less desirable to cover those things.

273
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:40,000
So we would predict that people would be more likely to want their plans to include coverage for

274
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,500
the types of care they would get when they're severely ill and for the types of care they get.

275
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,730
Many of the mild illness.

276
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,540
You know, look at the extra premium that has to be paid to get generous coverage for the sorts of care they get when they have a mild illness and say,

277
00:29:54,540 --> 00:30:01,360
wow, that's a lot of money just to be able to go to the doctor one more time a month when I don't know.

278
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:07,530
That's really helping me all that much. Okay.

279
00:30:07,530 --> 00:30:16,140
This equation is a little bit hairy and there's a lot of parts of it, but it's actually pretty easy to see where it comes from.

280
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:21,000
Okay, so think of them as just the average use of care.

281
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:29,330
Across this insured population. So you've got a whole bunch of enrollees, the insurer projects.

282
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:34,100
So I'm going to use and they're going to use on average end units of care over time.

283
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,230
Do this with care. What's going to be the total expenses that are going to be incurred?

284
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,350
It's going to be. Prime time zone.

285
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,720
Here is the full price of care.

286
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:54,380
And just like we saw in that last graph that split up that between the part the insurer pays and the part that I pay so I pay.

287
00:30:54,490 --> 00:31:03,420
C insurers paying the fraction one minus C So the full coverage C would be zero and

288
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:08,879
the insurer would be liable for the entire expense of PM times the price per unit,

289
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,450
times number of units that the average enrollee uses in the year.

290
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:19,290
You see what they point to, then the insurer be responsible for 80% of that.

291
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:29,550
So essentially one see times PPM represents the cost of the benefits that the insurer is going to have to pay out.

292
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:39,440
The average enrollee uses units of care average price per unit as PM, and the insurer is liable for fraction one minus C of that.

293
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,600
In a policy that is called coinsurance,

294
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:49,970
Rainsy can so the premium then insurer is going to charge presumably is going to have to be large enough to cover that.

295
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,520
Otherwise the insurer won't even have collected enough premiums to pay out its claims liability.

296
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:02,569
And the insurer is probably going to market up above that to cover its administrative costs and from its perspective,

297
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:07,310
hoping to make a profit at the end of the year. So we call all the loading factor.

298
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:14,750
So that's just sort of the proportion by which the premium is marked up above the insurer's expected liability.

299
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,800
Or this. This is the insurer's expected liability.

300
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,999
For enrollees of the average enrollees,

301
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,590
as AM units of care and price PM and insurers liable for one minus C of that this as well from the average enrollees that I'm covering.

302
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,219
That's how much money I expect to have claims filed for.

303
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:41,430
And we have to write checks to cover that. And then I always just look at my markup above that.

304
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:48,930
So the premium is one plus. L So if I was charging the RFP, then L would be zero.

305
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:59,900
And that's just equal to the AFC insurance perspective.

306
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,649
My liability is one minus three times, so fine.

307
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,860
All the zero. I simply charging that this would go away.

308
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:11,330
This would be zero and I'm charging the AFC.

309
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,930
So think of else of I'm charging, say a little loading of 20%.

310
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:21,950
That would be my premium would be 1.2 times the AFC, 1.2 times expected liability.

311
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:27,110
That makes sense. Deconstructing this from piece by piece in terms of where it comes from.

312
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:35,160
Yeah, yeah, I got a question. So because insurance doesn't pay the same that a self-pay would pay.

313
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,270
They don't pay the full bill charges. So how does that factor in?

314
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,120
So think of this as the price that the that the insurance company has negotiated with the providers.

315
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:50,510
So let's say if it's a very simple policy, so we've got some prices that are negotiated with providers.

316
00:33:51,540 --> 00:34:00,570
And then of that price I'm liable for fraction one minus C you the enrollee or ly liable for fraction C and in total we pay premium.

317
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:09,420
So there's no balance billing in this policy. It's not like, well, I'm, I think it's $100 benefits like over 80 and you cover 20.

318
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:14,520
But if the physician bills you 150, you also have the extra $50.

319
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:21,269
So think of this as just a simple policy where we've got a price schedule that's been negotiated and see just says,

320
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:28,320
what fraction are you the enrollees liable for? And therefore one minus C is the fraction that I am sure reliable for that makes sense.

321
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,470
So it's basically keeping us as simple as possible.

322
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:41,219
So there's a price out there that has been negotiated in the policy, just says, how are we dividing up that price fraction of a do you pay?

323
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:43,010
What fraction of a do I the insurer pay?

324
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:59,460
Okay so Brian argue is that if l were zero your insurance is free is your premium zero what your premium would still be one minus C times per month.

325
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:07,460
So you're still paying a premium, but you're paying a premium that on average you're going to get 100% of that money back as a pay claims.

326
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:13,690
So if El were zero, the insurer actually b bearing all of your financial risk for free.

327
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:22,889
Is that some enrollees they're covering, they're only collecting enough money to have available to pay out the claims.

328
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:29,370
On average, you're going to pay out every single penny of premiums they collect as they paid claim to it, to their enrollees.

329
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:33,599
So in that sense of zero, you're still paying a positive premium.

330
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,450
It might be a very large premium because health care is expensive,

331
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:41,730
but you're actually paying nothing for insurance for that spreading of financial risk.

332
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:48,570
The insurers say bring it on the pool, everybody in this room and collect premiums and collect exactly enough.

333
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,410
To pay out the claims that you're going to file and I'm going to have this left at the end of the year.

334
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:03,840
So it doesn't mean your premium is zero, but the insurer effectively is bearing your risk for zero if they're charging you the RFP,

335
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:08,010
because the enrollees as a group are getting back every year.

336
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:12,000
So we have a graphic of every you would bring their money into a jar at the beginning of the year.

337
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:20,340
At the end of the year, everybody who got sick is going to pull money out of that jar and there's been nothing left in the jar.

338
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,290
So the people who put the money into the jar are going to get every penny of that money back out at the end of the year.

339
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:32,520
So in a sense, you can think of insurance as free floating a zero premium is not zero.

340
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,820
You're paying a premium, but on average you're going to get all that money back.

341
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:44,010
The set of enrollees is going to collect every penny in premiums and so that we can really think of as the price of insurance.

342
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:50,720
So this complicated equation is the premium. But really that's the price of insurance.

343
00:36:51,350 --> 00:37:00,060
If ala0 the insurer is bearing your risk for free, the higher l is, the greater there is a markup of the premium above your risk.

344
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:11,450
So we would also predict then that the higher the loading factor is, the less insurance will be demanded by a risk averse person and la0.

345
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:23,730
So that's a pretty good deal and pretty complete coverage. So let's kind of see empirically if some of these predictions are actually verified.

346
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:28,830
So let's look at the loading. One of the things that truly affects the loading factor is how big the group is.

347
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:37,110
So this is kind of pre ACA data, but on the individual market, the loading is about 60 80%.

348
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,900
So in other words, the premium would be about 1.6 to 1.8 times as high as the AP.

349
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:48,790
Pretty big markup. A small group, less than ten.

350
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:53,740
That already drops substantially, but not a very large groups over a thousand.

351
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,230
I think in the University of Michigan employee group, the loading is about 5 to 8%.

352
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,400
So I'm getting my insurance up very close to the AFP,

353
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:11,800
whereas if I had to buy in the individual market or I was the employer with three employees, I'd be paying a lot more.

354
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:20,230
So a number of factors that explain this one is just the fixed cost of writing and marketing policies can be spread over a lot more people.

355
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:24,760
You know, Blue Cross doesn't have to enroll about 5000 individuals.

356
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,230
They can just talk to the University of Michigan and they've got 5000 enrollees.

357
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:38,280
Also, the insurer is not going to have to worry as much about adverse selection because the University of

358
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:43,530
Michigan employee group has its come together for reasons other than just the purchase of insurance.

359
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:48,970
That's not our primary function of having this group of employees work here.

360
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,760
Give them a deal on health insurance.

361
00:38:51,750 --> 00:39:00,840
So it's going to have some good risks, some bad for us, some young people, some older people, all in sort of predictable, stable proportions.

362
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:03,950
For some people, leave the pool, leave employment every year.

363
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,110
Some people come. But the people that come and the people that go are pretty predictably similar.

364
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:21,049
To the group we had last year. So I don't have to worry as an insurer about all kinds of detailed medical underwriting and having

365
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:26,810
lab tests done on people and so on and so forth to try to figure out how much to rate them.

366
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,760
So here are the factors that we think would influence the demand for insurance.

367
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:38,530
And think of the demand for insurance not just as you can get insurance as a piece of the demand for insurance.

368
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:42,189
Is that. Yes, no decision, but also contingent on getting insurance.

369
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:46,480
You want a really generous plan or do you want a plan with more cost sharing?

370
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:53,079
So you think the more risk averse the consumer is, the greater the risk, the greater the risk premium is,

371
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:58,570
as we saw when we did utility maximization under risk and the greater the willingness to pay for insurance.

372
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:05,290
If I was risk neutral, if I had a linear utility of income curve, well, I'm not really willing to pay anything above the ASP.

373
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,850
More risk averse I am the greater my willingness to pay above the AP.

374
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:17,550
So even more risk averse people want more insurance depending on financial risk or insurance that want.

375
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:28,920
So if I told you there is a 50% chance that you'll lose $2 this year, are you going to run out and get an insurance policy to cover that risk?

376
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,730
If I tell there's a 50% chance you'll lose $10,000, you maybe you want to insurance policy.

377
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,629
So the bigger the risk is, we think that there will be greater demand for insurance.

378
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:47,250
And again, goes back to those same graphs we did in the last couple of weeks of utility, expected utility,

379
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:56,060
and we saw that the riskier, smaller bets created less risk, the larger best and the more elastic the demand for services.

380
00:40:56,070 --> 00:41:00,360
So we saw that demand curve for the mild illness compares to one for severe illness,

381
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,840
the one that was more elastic, the one for the mild illness in that graph.

382
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:09,750
And so we're just going to be a lot more extra care consumed than the premium is going to have to go up to cover.

383
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:13,380
So if I get really generous coverage, the premium is going to be way higher.

384
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:21,930
So I can get a big reduction in my premium by accepting some financial risk and therefore reducing that utilization.

385
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:29,070
So we think the world is elastic that demand for service, the less we expect people to want to be competition.

386
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,110
And then finally the higher the price of insurance, which we justify not really is the premium,

387
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:39,550
but as the loading factor by the proportion which the premium exceeds the actuarially fair premium.

388
00:41:39,990 --> 00:41:47,600
The less insurance will be demanded. So here's some data from the old Rand health insurance experiment.

389
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:55,250
And they found basically that insurance is going to be related to elasticity of demand, magnitude of risk and size of employer.

390
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,300
So let's look at hospital care.

391
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:10,760
In the RAND study, fairly price inelastic about -2115 surgical ended in hospital medical care also about negative .15, fairly price inelastic.

392
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:17,690
And we all see they're fairly high risk things, the variance. Most of us are going to go to the hospital at all this year.

393
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:22,410
A few of us are going to go and we're going to have really high expenses.

394
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,939
So that's a very high variance situation. Most of us use very little hospital care.

395
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:34,410
You know, when a few of us are going to have really, really high expenses of surgical inpatient medical care,

396
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:38,850
since that is only a fraction as high as the total hospital charge,

397
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,730
that's also a high risk because most of us are against a lot of that and a few of us are use a lot.

398
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:49,650
But the risk is the dollars aren't quite as large there as they are for the actual hospital level.

399
00:42:50,460 --> 00:43:01,950
So we've got the highest risk, the lowest elasticity of demand and these are predicated on the highest portion of the population has coverage for it.

400
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:08,940
And we include sort of the over 65 because they're in Medicare, they're not really making that choice of coverage as much.

401
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:14,760
And here we've got, say, price elasticity, a little bit less risk.

402
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:20,970
And the coverage is just about as high in terms of the proportion of people in this old data that had coverage for it.

403
00:43:21,990 --> 00:43:28,170
Now, outpatient physician and more of us are going to see a doctor or an outpatient basis than go to a hospital.

404
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:35,609
So greater percent of people are going to use this than this. So it's not going to be sort of as bifurcated between a lot of us or zeros.

405
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:40,409
And a few of us are going to have massive bills. You know, a few of us are going to be zeros.

406
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:44,700
Some of us are going to go once or twice. Some of us might go ten or 12 times.

407
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:50,160
And a very, very few of us might go 50 times a year to a doctor.

408
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,050
So much more compressed financial risk and the cost is much lower.

409
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:03,629
So the spread, the variance of risk isn't nearly as large. So lower variance of risk and also a greater elasticity of demand.

410
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:09,750
So the premium is going to have to go up by a bigger factor to cover that extra care because people are more price sensitive.

411
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,770
Now we see that many fewer people have that coverage. Again, these are old data, but it's showing the pattern.

412
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:28,910
Devil. Lowest variance of risk. You know, most of us are going to go to the dentist twice a year for routine cleanings and have nothing more.

413
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:39,020
You know, a few of us might need a filling. And even less of us are going to need a crown or a wrench or something more complex or root canal.

414
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:44,330
But even those upper end things cost, you know, in the thousands of dollars,

415
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:48,560
not in the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in the fillings, or maybe a couple hundred dollars.

416
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:53,510
So it's the lowest variance of risk. All of us are using some.

417
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:57,770
A few of us are using a little more. Very few of us are using a bunch more.

418
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:06,710
But nobody's paying $100,000 for dental care. And price elasticity is even more, and we see the lowest prevalence of insurance.

419
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:10,690
So at least from these correlations,

420
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:16,480
we see that the things that have the most risk and the least price sense of demand have the most insurance coverage.

421
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:24,810
Let's take a look at employer insurance offerings by size of group.

422
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,790
So we saw the data showing how loading very dramatically by the size of the group.

423
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,129
So a lot of those groups, 200 or more workers, that's kind of like Lululemon.

424
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:40,860
And essentially all firms with 200 or more workers offer health benefits.

425
00:45:41,430 --> 00:45:45,750
That's 98, 99%. And it's been that way forever.

426
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:50,370
The lowest it ever got was 97. And what's 2000?

427
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:58,290
Three and 2005? The highest member guys, 99 since 2006.

428
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:01,080
It's been 98 or 99 every single year.

429
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:09,780
So essentially those large groups that have low loading, they offer coverage now also in the smallest groups, 3 to 9 workers.

430
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:17,569
As the dark blue in the bottom is essentially out pretty consistently.

431
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:28,310
It was a little over half a trillion. The data is the little less than half now, more recently, but it's basically 50%, give or take, 5 to 7%.

432
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:33,350
So those are the groups that face the highest loading and they're least likely to offer coverage.

433
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:37,040
So they're consistent with that idea that loading is the price of insurance.

434
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,880
And the demand for insurance will be greatest of the lower end. Lowest.

435
00:46:50,570 --> 00:46:55,280
Okay. Now we can talk about insurance as if we're all buying it as individuals.

436
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:00,230
Or we can also think about the way our system works for most of us.

437
00:47:01,070 --> 00:47:08,120
Most of us. Many of the under 65 employee populations and the dependents of that population where it comes through an employer.

438
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:17,170
So if the University of Michigan pays for my health insurance, why wouldn't I want super generous coverage for everything?

439
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:28,579
Is that awesome that they're giving you giving me my insurance? So what do we say?

440
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:32,720
Paid for insurance as an employer provides. We do.

441
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,630
Employee will, right? Because it's part of our compensation.

442
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:44,629
You know, they have to offer me a compensation package, which is part cash and part various types of benefits,

443
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:49,820
health insurance being probably the single most important one. Retirement by being the second most important one.

444
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:57,200
They also have to offer me a package of compensation that is sufficiently attractive to get me to sign on.

445
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:01,130
And then once I'm here to convince me to stay and I'll look for another job.

446
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,030
If I value health insurance, which I do.

447
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:15,230
And they offered me lousy benefits unless they're offering me, say, much better pay or a much better retirement plan.

448
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:19,460
I'm more likely to start looking somewhere else. What's your.

449
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:28,310
So we think that it's really me who pays for our health insurance even if the employer writes the check for most of the premium.

450
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:34,440
Is there some evidence on this?

451
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:44,400
There's a pretty good evidence on it from the better design studies, although that pass through doesn't seem to be sort of perfect and immediate.

452
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,690
The Jonathan Gruber famous paper looked at mandated maternity benefits.

453
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:59,940
So if you go back to like the 1960s, 1970s, even into the 1980s, a lot of employers didn't cover maternity benefits.

454
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:09,610
And why would employers not want to cover maternity benefits? Yeah.

455
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:15,959
They're paying you for work that you're not doing because you're not there, so you're going to be gone.

456
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:24,450
Or, you know, maybe they would say, well, you know, do we really want to even attract a worker who is not going to then,

457
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:28,680
you know, take an extended leave or maybe even quit afterwards?

458
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,309
So there were a lot of mandates initially at the state level.

459
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:39,480
States start saying, wait, wait, this is crazy because, you know, we get our employment, we get our insurance through our jobs.

460
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,200
And our jobs are telling us that. And try to try to avoid.

461
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,320
Covering people that are going to have these sort of high predictable costs.

462
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:54,059
So and then also take time off associated with that they to discourage those people

463
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:58,800
from signing up as employees by offering the benefits that is not attractive to them.

464
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:03,540
So we talked about how that compensation package is intended to attract and retain labor.

465
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:07,739
So if the employer is looking at it very narrowly, they can say, you know what,

466
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,059
that's not the kind of labor I want to attract labor that's going to be expensive because they're

467
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:17,040
going to use this expensive care and then they're going to be gone for a while or maybe even quit.

468
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:24,040
I don't want to hire those people now as a pair of public policies, and it's just kind of crazy.

469
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:27,550
So let's say, okay, let's mandate maternity coverage.

470
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:31,540
You can't offer health insurance that doesn't include maternity benefits.

471
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:39,040
So what Gruber did is he looked at what happened when states implemented these mandates and eventually it became a federal mandate.

472
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,520
So you can't get these crazy policies that don't have majority coverage anymore.

473
00:50:44,590 --> 00:50:49,500
It turned out that over a few years it didn't happen immediately, but pretty quickly.

474
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:59,990
Wage growth changed for different types of workers. And wage growth was specifically lower for women of childbearing age,

475
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:06,290
where married men of the prime childbearing age were covering women as dependents.

476
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:12,739
So even in the case of maternity benefits, who paid for the mandated maternity benefits?

477
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,950
It ended up being the work, not the workers as a whole.

478
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:23,390
But it actually laser beamed into the wages of the workers who became more costly to employ the ones who actually use maternity benefits.

479
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:30,719
So that's kind of pretty powerful evidence that it is going to be that the workers who

480
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,830
pay for benefits because you had a particular type of worker became more expensive.

481
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:41,549
Those two types of worker, women of childbearing age and then married men of childbearing age was married men could

482
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:47,220
cover dependent dependance on policy and wage growth went down for those two groups.

483
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:56,710
And roughly went down by enough over a couple of years to pay for 100% of the cost of the retiree benefits.

484
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:03,440
It's an old story, but an interesting one. Was it really shown through a laser beam,

485
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:10,310
the wages of the exact group of employees that became more expensive to employ when they had to cover maternity benefits.

486
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:19,730
You didn't have to cover them before. You could also look at aggregate data and say, well, corporate revenues are, say, X trillion dollars a year.

487
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:23,690
What percent of those go to pay for wages?

488
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:34,040
So really since 1950 4% going to wages and wages and salaries and other is the cash part of the compensation bundle has steadily declined.

489
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:42,760
But the share going to labor in total cash wages plus benefits has been more or less constant.

490
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:47,260
It's gone up or down a little bit, but it's been relatively constant.

491
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:54,120
So if you can imagine the. Grab the marker.

492
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:11,070
Okay. So that corporate revenues are under 100% is here times in 1950, 2022.

493
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:17,970
I don't have the exact data, but it's basically roughly half. So here's 100%.

494
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:26,530
It goes up or down a little bit. That's total compensation to labor.

495
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:36,309
It used to be almost all cash compensation. But over time.

496
00:53:36,310 --> 00:53:46,480
So this is benefits, that's cash compensation, that's total compensation.

497
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:53,440
So what we see is that the share of the total share is roughly similar, but this gap is.

498
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:59,480
Emerging if employers really paid for.

499
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:08,700
Health benefits. What we would expect to see is that the cash share would be constant as health care costs have gone up.

500
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:24,470
This will be the graph we expect of employers paying for health benefits cash to be roughly constant.

501
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:31,600
Health care is becoming more expensive, so employee compensation being a bigger share of corporate dollars over time.

502
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:39,610
We don't see that. What we actually see is the total compensation is about constant and cash is going down, benefits are going up.

503
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:45,700
So that's the pattern we would expect if employees are really paying for their own health benefits.

504
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:55,770
But there are also some papers, though, shown that it's not it's not a perfect trade off and it's certainly not an instantaneous trade off.

505
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:58,320
Health care spending goes up suddenly this year.

506
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:05,519
It's not like all of your wages are going to immediately adjust down to cover that extra health care costs.

507
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:13,049
It's going to take some time to work through. And in particular, a suit found that when health care spending was growing faster than GDP,

508
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:21,240
overall employment and output tended to shift away from industries that had higher percentages of workers holding employer sponsored health insurance.

509
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,560
And that's what you would expect of employees,

510
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:30,630
because employers can't sort of immediately reduce wages or wage growth to offset the higher health care spending,

511
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:38,250
which is going to take them multiple years to do. And you might see some changes in employment moving away from sectors that are

512
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:42,690
more affected by higher health spending toward sectors that are less affected.

513
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:51,090
Here's another piece of data that we can see.

514
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:56,790
I always try to find a more current version of this graph, and I have not found the same graph replicated.

515
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:02,430
I have to go back to the original data and find a way to replicate it myself.

516
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:13,920
But we see we've got an increase in medical expenses and we've got increase in average hourly earnings, cash wages and salaries for our work.

517
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:19,590
And we see what health spending is going up. Really high wages are stagnating.

518
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:27,150
You're not getting rate. You basically says the raise you're getting from year to year is going entirely to your health benefits.

519
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:36,330
Your cash wages are stagnating. And then we saw a time period where health care spending really moderated.

520
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,620
Spending growth actually trended very zero for a while.

521
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:44,460
And that's where we saw then cash wage growth. The triangles go up.

522
00:56:45,950 --> 00:56:50,900
And then once again, when health spending went up again, we see the wage growth go down again.

523
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:58,040
So essentially that is consistent with that story that employees are paying for their benefits.

524
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,680
If health care benefits are becoming more expensive, then cash wages tend to stagnate.

525
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,220
When health care spending moderate growth moderates.

526
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:18,870
Then there's enough money left over to increase cash wages. So why do we have our employers involved?

527
00:57:21,750 --> 00:57:26,380
So if I'm really paying for my own health insurance, why does the University of Michigan provide it?

528
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:34,620
Why don't we just have an individual health insurance market and maybe expand the exchanges to everybody and get rid of the employer?

529
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:41,609
So horrible reasons. There are World War Two policy reasons.

530
00:57:41,610 --> 00:57:45,630
There are wage controls and World War Two and benefits were exempt.

531
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:50,130
So employers were not allowed to compete because there was such a shortage of labor.

532
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:58,980
Employers were not allowed to compete for workers by raising salaries, but they were still allowed to compete for workers by increasing benefits.

533
00:57:58,990 --> 00:58:02,700
So that's when health insurance benefits first became tied to employment.

534
00:58:03,390 --> 00:58:07,530
So that's kind of a historical accident that sort of got us to where we are today.

535
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:14,240
If you were drawing the US health care system on a clean sheet of paper and you have to worry about,

536
00:58:14,250 --> 00:58:20,219
you know, how do we implement this given where we are today? Even if you just said, you know, here's a clean sheet of paper design,

537
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:25,470
a health care financing health insurance system for the United States that you think would be awesome.

538
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:31,130
And you don't have to worry about any constraints about, well, now it's all tied to employment.

539
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:34,740
How do we move away from that? Is that a pure clean sheet of paper?

540
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:40,650
You know, a show of hands? Would anybody say the way most of us ought to get our health insurance is through our jobs?

541
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:49,240
That's not a great idea to anybody here. Yet here we are.

542
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,319
Okay. So you've got then economies that grew purchasing.

543
00:58:53,320 --> 00:59:02,049
We saw the loading factor data. So those of us who work for large employers can get a great deal on insurance compared

544
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,800
to what we would get if we worked for smaller employers or if we had to buy it our own.

545
00:59:08,630 --> 00:59:16,940
We also have the tax code, employer paid premiums escape taxation or deductible to the employer and their pretax income to me.

546
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:26,870
So the part of my part of my health insurance paid for by the University of Michigan does not get reported to the IRS as taxable income.

547
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:35,700
So I, the relatively well-paid worker of getting a large government subsidy for my health insurance.

548
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:46,530
In fact, on a per person basis, the tax subsidy for employer sponsored insurance is about the same as covering a medicaid enrollee for a year.

549
00:59:47,310 --> 00:59:53,160
So I'm getting as much of a subsidy from the tax system for my insurance as the average Medicaid enrollee is.

550
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:05,319
So not a large group. I got pretax treatment of my premiums and suppose I got, say, 10% loading in my large group.

551
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:11,680
It might even be a little lower. As we saw, it was like 10%. Anybody was above the 10% income tax bracket.

552
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:17,410
It's kind of like getting insurance at less than the fee because of the subsidy.

553
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:28,630
Is this a great policy already kind of alluded to one factor that maybe on equity grounds, it's not the greatest policy.

554
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:32,860
Is it even an official policy? You know, does it work?

555
01:00:33,970 --> 01:00:37,820
The purpose of the policy is to encourage people to have health insurance. Okay.

556
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:43,360
It seems to work, at least in the sense that insurance purchase is responsive to price.

557
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:50,470
Price elasticity of demand for getting insurance versus not is about negative point three to negative point four.

558
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:55,840
So if we cut the price of insurance, yes, more people are going to get insurance.

559
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:08,620
So at least there's some hope that this policy works as intended. But this pretax treatment means that that subsidy is worth more to hire your income.

560
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:18,850
And so therefore, the higher tax bracket is if I'm in the 12% tax bracket, then essentially $1,000 of insurance premium saves me $120.

561
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:26,580
Whereas if I'm in the 37% bracket, 1000 $3,000 insurance premium saves me $370.

562
01:01:27,330 --> 01:01:31,350
So we're paying the greatest subsidy to the highest income people.

563
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:35,010
We also know the income elasticity of demand for insurance is positive.

564
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,280
It's a normal good. It is moderately large. It's about one.

565
01:01:39,090 --> 01:01:44,970
So we're giving the greatest subsidy to the people who would be most likely to buy insurance even without the subsidy.

566
01:01:48,260 --> 01:01:57,050
Now. I love his policy where he works out for me personally, but I'm voting on a public policy that it's kind of an awful policy.

567
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:04,090
So we're giving the biggest subsidy to the people who would be most likely to get insurance anyhow and

568
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:08,630
have the greatest income and therefore the less the least need for that subsidy in the first place.

569
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:19,720
Yeah. Sound like good public policy sketchy expensive to in 2019.

570
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:25,390
This cost the federal government roughly $273 billion.

571
01:02:28,210 --> 01:02:32,980
So let's get to real money. So I think the ACA was like $1,000,000,000,000 over ten years.

572
01:02:33,670 --> 01:02:44,930
This is like $2.7 trillion over ten years. Was also associated for how much coverage I get.

573
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:50,330
So talk is the loading factor as being one of the things that determine do I want, you know,

574
01:02:50,410 --> 01:02:54,800
a low deductible local insurance plan or a higher deductible, higher co-insurance plan?

575
01:02:56,450 --> 01:03:04,850
So by having pre tax treatment of health insurance premiums and being in a high tax bracket, that really makes my loading factor less than zero.

576
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:09,140
So it's encouraging me to get more insurance as well.

577
01:03:10,280 --> 01:03:19,759
So if we had a simply a flat tax credit in everybody, the same credit, for example, certainly the more efficient and more equitable,

578
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:26,660
a more targeted to people would be less likely to have insurance absent the credit and more likely to need the subsidy.

579
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:32,600
And the current system that gives the biggest subsidy to the people who have

580
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:36,050
the most money would be most likely to get insurance even without the subsidy.

581
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:40,460
Very hard politically to remove that once it's in place.

582
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:47,120
But we should at least be aware that when there's a public conversation about, you know, well,

583
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:54,140
it's not fair that my taxes are subsidizing care for all these people on Medicaid or all these other people.

584
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,070
It's like, well, look at yourself. You're getting a subsidy yourself.

585
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,060
Yep. Pretty good one. Do you need that subsidy?

586
01:04:02,810 --> 01:04:11,300
Maybe not. So another problem in health insurance markets is crowd out.

587
01:04:11,990 --> 01:04:21,350
So crowd out is when we don't target benefits well enough that people wouldn't have gotten insurance anyhow.

588
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:28,940
And we just then switch people from one type of insurance to another rather than actually increasing the likelihood they have insurance at all.

589
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:36,260
And pre ACA data showed pretty significant amounts of crowd out.

590
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:45,100
So about half of the. Expansions of Medicaid to pregnant women and children were offset by declines in private coverage.

591
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:50,560
So basically, for every two people recovered in that plan, there was only a net gain of one.

592
01:04:51,370 --> 01:04:56,019
Moving from uninsured to insured. So some people are moving off private plans.

593
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:59,020
So if the goal is to get a greater percent of the population insured,

594
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:04,720
the more crowd out you have as you just sort of moving people from one coverage to another as opposed to gaining coverage.

595
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:12,100
And we saw similar levels in the S-CHIP expansions, even a little higher and some later Medicaid expansions.

596
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:19,000
And then to early 2000, sort of crispy for the ACA, smaller crowd out.

597
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:23,710
When Medicaid and SCHIP were expanded, Wisconsin was to about 20%.

598
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:33,340
Yeah. It seems like that policy was relatively well targeted at people who wouldn't have had insurance absent the

599
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:39,430
ACA provisions and those earlier trends that I talked about in the last slide of significant crowding out,

600
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:46,900
meaning that if we get a thousand new people enrolled in the program, we might only be getting 500 new people insured.

601
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:52,200
Is 500 of them are going to be coming off private conversations? That doesn't seem to be the case.

602
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,370
The ACA seems pretty well targeted.

603
01:05:55,210 --> 01:06:03,520
Subsidies seem pretty well targeted, and people who wouldn't have gotten coverage otherwise, you know, pretty small crowd out of private coverage.

604
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:11,229
So we see most of the benefits of the ACA going to people who wouldn't have had coverage absent those benefits,

605
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:16,630
as opposed to us saying, oh, hey, I'll get the ACA coverage instead of this other coverage I already have.

606
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:31,389
All right. So health insurance has several unique aspects covering the Austrian economy on the protection of simple financial risk.

607
01:06:31,390 --> 01:06:36,460
It's that demand for coverage for things that I couldn't access absent insurance.

608
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:48,339
That desire for preexisting conditions coverage. For some level across subsidization of less healthy people.

609
01:06:48,340 --> 01:06:55,319
By more healthy people. Higher users by lower users. It turns out that even for risk averse consumers,

610
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:59,160
that market is complicated enough with the moral hazard and other things going on

611
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:03,540
that might not be optimal to have full coverage either for risk averse people.

612
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:09,629
That tradeoff between risk spreading and incentives. Regardless, employer role in health insurance.

613
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:13,800
It kind of started with a historical accident of World War Two policy on wages.

614
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:19,470
This is kind of perpetuated by the subsidies and other factors.

615
01:07:20,490 --> 01:07:26,510
But nonetheless, for the most part, we can say that, you know, really, I pay for my own health insurance benefits.

616
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:31,510
It's not the University of Michigan is giving them to me. Right.

617
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:36,790
A few minutes later I just jump into adverse selection a little bit.

618
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:42,590
I'll stop right now, see if there are any questions, comments or anything that sort of intrigued or surprised you,

619
01:07:42,590 --> 01:07:46,550
especially about some of the data that I was I that just.

620
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:58,920
We are aware of how expensive the tax exclusion of benefits was to.

621
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:08,720
The magnitude of ads about the efficiency and equity aspects of that policy is a little bit of a surprise.

622
01:08:13,740 --> 01:08:22,720
It's very hard to remove that policy. But we should at least be aware of its existence and its implications.

623
01:08:36,150 --> 01:08:38,750
And so we talked a lot about moral hazard.

624
01:08:38,830 --> 01:08:44,370
You know, we talked about factors that affect the demand for insurance, whether you want insurance at all or how generous.

625
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:50,090
You know, we can kind of get into the adverse selection issue and then we'll get to it today.

626
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:53,130
We'll talk about sort of product differentiation, insurance markets.

627
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:58,259
So far, we've talked about insurance as if it's sort of just that financial instrument.

628
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:02,069
Those cost sharing is the tool. But we also have plans.

629
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:07,650
We have HMO is going to propose in plans that appropriate incentives for providers, not just for patients.

630
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:13,500
There's a lot of product differentiation as well, so we'll get into that next week.

631
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:16,530
But we start on adverse selection.

632
01:09:16,890 --> 01:09:21,930
So both moral hazard and adverse selection are information problems, information problem,

633
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:27,930
moral hazard as the insurer can't readily observe and therefore contract on the caretaking

634
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:33,059
activities of the enrollees and then the cost mitigating activities of the enrollee.

635
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:39,480
Once they do get sick, if they could contract all those things, they could just say, Well, we're going to write this contract.

636
01:09:39,480 --> 01:09:48,840
If you get these 12 screenings and we do these other things now and you exercise and you eat well and you don't go skydiving.

637
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:54,140
So it's hard for the insurer to sort of observe and contract and all those things.

638
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:59,600
Information, problem and adverse selection are much more obvious. The insurer doesn't know who we are.

639
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:04,980
The insurer can't tell us apart. They can tell us some things about us pretty easily.

640
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:11,300
They can probably tell our age pretty easily, but they might not know everything about our family history, for example.

641
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:20,959
So at any given premium the insurer offers, who's that premium going to look like a good deal for the higher user you expect to be.

642
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,070
The more likely you think that premium sounds like a good deal and yeah, I'll buy that policy.

643
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:28,790
The lower a user you expect to be, the more you think, well, wait a second,

644
01:10:28,790 --> 01:10:35,630
that premium is really high because they can't differentiate me from much more costly individuals to insure.

645
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:39,680
So I'm paying a premium to cross-subsidize other people's premiums.

646
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:41,540
Bad deal and one out.

647
01:10:45,260 --> 01:10:53,690
We also get what I call regulatory adverse selection so those insurers could observe risk for at least certain important risk factors.

648
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:58,730
But there are regulatory prohibitions against using that information and setting premiums.

649
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:04,800
So under the ACA, premiums can't be set based on preexisting conditions.

650
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:11,790
They can be set on the basis of age, but not to fully reflect age.

651
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:20,940
So if you look at some of the youngest adults compared to the oldest pre Medicare adults, the average ratio of spending is about 5 to 1.

652
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:27,120
So if you're talking about people, people like you in this room versus people who are, say, 60 to 64,

653
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:35,340
if I could fully set premiums based on age, I would charge the people 60 to 64, almost five times as much as I would charge you.

654
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:41,050
So they are allowed to charge more my age, but it's only, I think, a factor of roughly two and a half.

655
01:11:41,730 --> 01:11:46,710
So roughly they're allowed to take no charge for half the age differential.

656
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:51,990
So even though you can't risk vary based on age, they can't they're not allowed to fully risk.

657
01:11:52,170 --> 01:11:58,530
They're only allowed to charge about two and a half times as much for the oldest group of enrollees as for the youngest on the exchanges.

658
01:12:00,290 --> 01:12:04,010
So essentially it's as if there's asymmetric information.

659
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:09,880
So the insurer knows your age, but they're not allowed to fully rate that.

660
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:14,450
Or they might know that you have a preexisting condition. But they're not allowed to rate on that at all.

661
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:23,300
So it kind of creates the same issue, even though it isn't really an asymmetric information source of it, it's more of a regulatory source.

662
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:31,380
So what are the consequences of adverse selection? Well, we've got three potential enrollees here.

663
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:38,860
We've got a very inexpensive and very healthy person, doesn't have any preexisting conditions, great health habits, doesn't do anything wrong.

664
01:12:39,250 --> 01:12:45,130
And somebody else who uses a little bit of care. And third one that's potentially going to use a lot of care.

665
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:51,130
And suppose all of these people know that this person knows, hey, I'm one of the healthier people in the population.

666
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:56,110
This person here about average, median person in this population.

667
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:59,200
This guy knows, hey, I'm pretty expensive.

668
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:05,170
I use a lot more care or I'm in a lot higher risk for using care than the average person in this population.

669
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:08,890
And so suppose the insurer can't tell who's who.

670
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:15,530
In other words, they can't say, I'm going to charge this person alone premium, this sort of median premium, this person I premium.

671
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:21,430
So they have to offer a premium and accept all comers.

672
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:26,020
So suppose they offer out of the middle premium.

673
01:13:27,610 --> 01:13:32,290
Who's likely to buy the policy? Expensive.

674
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:37,450
This guy for sure. Right. You're probably this guy. This guy?

675
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:47,890
Yeah. That doesn't seem like such a great deal. Okay, so now they offer that middle premium on the assumption that all these people are all white.

676
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:51,550
So I'm going to charge a premium reflecting the average in this population.

677
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:58,750
This guy doesn't buy an insurer now has not charge a high enough premium.

678
01:13:59,020 --> 01:14:03,230
What are they going to do next year? Same driver.

679
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:09,670
Yeah, they're going to say, wait a second. My expenses, my claims were a lot higher per enrollee than I expected.

680
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:13,150
I lost money and I have to charge a higher premium.

681
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:16,420
So next year they're going to charge a premium based on this person.

682
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:22,740
And now this guy who bought last year is going to say, wait a second, that's not such a good deal anymore.

683
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:27,579
I was willing to buy last year, but not at this higher premium.

684
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:33,500
I'm out. Now they're left with only. This guy year to plan.

685
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:41,150
So these two end up not having insurance. This is the only plan in town, even though they're risk averse,

686
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:45,590
even though they would be willing to pay a premium if I'd gotten a charge on my work loan rate.

687
01:14:46,310 --> 01:14:47,750
This person was willing to pay a premium,

688
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:52,969
to pay a premium that was based on his ranking as he was sort of the average person the first year when the insurer price to

689
01:14:52,970 --> 01:15:00,620
the average of the whole population but wasn't willing to pay a premium based on this person's average on average expenses.

690
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:06,790
So we can get an extreme case where it's called the adverse selection death spiral and

691
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:11,660
Orlando's year after year sort of eventually disappears because they have to raise premiums.

692
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:17,389
Every year they raise premiums and then more healthy people drop out and they raise premiums more and even more drop out.

693
01:15:17,390 --> 01:15:20,490
And eventually just about everybody dropped out of the plans.

694
01:15:22,910 --> 01:15:29,510
So that's kind of an extreme scenario, that selection. So who's hurt?

695
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:35,260
So to say he was hurt, we have to say, well, compared to what?

696
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:42,650
So how about compared to if there weren't asymmetric information, if insurers could observe and price to the individual.

697
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:49,750
So if the insurer knows this person is this person and they're cheap, so they're going to charge a sheet premium to this person.

698
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:53,560
So the risk averse, the premiums based on their own risk level.

699
01:15:53,570 --> 01:15:57,220
Yeah, I'm going to buy the charge a medium premium to this person.

700
01:15:57,430 --> 01:16:01,900
This person is also risk averse. So the other premiums, based on my own level of risk, I'm risk averse.

701
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:05,680
I want insurance this person to charge a higher premium.

702
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:11,319
That person says, Yeah, I'm risk averse. I know I'm expensive. If I don't have insurance, I'm really out a lot of money.

703
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:14,750
I'll, I'll buy it. Okay.

704
01:16:14,930 --> 01:16:18,560
So that would be sort of the world without asymmetric information.

705
01:16:18,860 --> 01:16:23,899
Premiums would be targeted to risks because we saw when premiums weren't targeted to risks,

706
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:31,910
that kind of created problems for the insurer because all the people that they were hoping to cross-subsidize the expensive people dropped out.

707
01:16:34,750 --> 01:16:38,530
So it was really hurt by asymmetric information is actually the cheap people.

708
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,870
I told that adverse selection story, this person,

709
01:16:43,870 --> 01:16:49,989
even though the risk averse and they would have been willing to pay a premium based on their own level of risk and probably

710
01:16:49,990 --> 01:16:56,800
some reasonable risk premium that gives the insurer some loading factor that they could charge to stay in business.

711
01:16:58,910 --> 01:17:04,970
You're priced out of the market. If they can't be identified as a low risk person, therefore they can't be targeted with a low premium.

712
01:17:05,510 --> 01:17:15,510
They're going to go uninsured even though they're risk averse. So it's actually the low risk individuals that were harmed by adverse selection because

713
01:17:15,510 --> 01:17:19,800
they could get a low premium in a world where they could verify to the insurer,

714
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:23,550
you know, hey, I'm the cheap one in this population. Give me a great rate.

715
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:33,690
So the low are either going to have they're going to be faced with a choice under asymmetric information of either paying too much,

716
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,870
too much relative, their own level of risk or going uninsured.

717
01:17:39,790 --> 01:17:45,010
And that first premium, that first story where we charged premium based on that sort of middle person.

718
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:47,799
This person could have stayed in the policy,

719
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:52,180
but they would have had to pay a premium that was much higher than their own expected risk would indicate.

720
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:59,169
So their choice is either I'm going to go without insurance altogether or I'm going to have to suck it up and pay a premium.

721
01:17:59,170 --> 01:18:09,100
Those cross subsidizing this person. So it's the low risks that are actually harmed by adverse selection because they can't get

722
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:14,799
the plan that they could get in a world where they could credibly verify to insurers that,

723
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:21,940
yes, I am much healthier than average. Therefore, you can still make money as an insurer by offering you a low premium.

724
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:28,860
Does that make sense? It's kind of the low risks that are sort of harmed by adverse selection.

725
01:18:32,730 --> 01:18:34,230
Right. Why don't we end there?

726
01:18:34,690 --> 01:19:11,550
I mean, it's really just sort of I think the blog comments prove that, you know, they're very passionate about making fun of the day.

727
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:30,959
Well, you know, the problem with texting, same when he told me what I thought about that, too.

728
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:35,560
I was like, you know, the newer ones.

729
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:41,690
Yeah, they're going to pay more.

730
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:58,090
So it's like when you got an A-plus.
