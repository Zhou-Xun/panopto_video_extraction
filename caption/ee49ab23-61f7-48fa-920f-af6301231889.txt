00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:35,190
Hi. I'm Dr. Whitney Peoples, and I serve as the director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,780
I'm excited to join you today in this conversation on health equity via anti-racist teaching.

3
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,200
In this portion, I'll share with you my definition of anti-racist pedagogy,

4
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:54,560
as well as six key principles that will guide our thinking and our practice in this area.

5
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:02,989
Anti-Racist pedagogy recognizes the historical and contemporary role of education in establishing and

6
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:10,560
maintaining racial inequities and seeks to disrupt and change those patterns and the outcomes they produce.

7
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,800
Guided by the critical relationship between reflection and informed practice,

8
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:22,130
anti-racist pedagogy operates across three key domains of teaching and learning.

9
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:29,790
Before we move further, I'd like to take some time to unpack this definition, and we'll start with the first sentence.

10
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:40,080
Anti-Racist pedagogy recognizes the historical and contemporary role of education in establishing and maintaining racial inequity.

11
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:48,810
Now, this recognition for some may seem obvious, perhaps not worthy to note, but in my experience,

12
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,690
I find that we're often asked to think about education as inherently beneficial or good.

13
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:04,890
And it is. In many ways, education is an important good that is critical to human development, growth and advancement.

14
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:10,770
But it is also more complicated than being just good or beneficial.

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,840
Education is deeply implicated in the maintenance of racial inequity. In the U.S. context,

16
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,740
if we look historically to segregation and its impact on schooling and education,

17
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:33,420
we understand the way that education has been used as a tool of white supremacy and a tool of racial inequity.

18
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:42,300
We might also think in the US context about so-called boarding schools and their role as tools of colonization,

19
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:46,350
marginalization and oppression of Indigenous nations.

20
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:58,320
Examples such as these help us to understand that while there is much good about education, it has also been used as a tool of inequity.

21
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:03,680
And so with that recognition, we are called to act.

22
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,580
And that's the second portion of our first sentence.

23
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:13,420
In addition to recognizing the role of education in racial inequity,

24
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:21,430
we must move to disrupt or act and change those patterns of racial inequity and the outcomes they produce.

25
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,830
Recognition is important, but by itself insufficient.

26
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:33,460
We must move to act or to disrupt and change patterns of racial inequity.

27
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:36,170
And when we move to act,

28
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:47,420
we are thinking about acting across three key domains of teaching and learning: course design, or what we teach, in class facilitation,

29
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:57,890
how we teach, and the larger context beyond our individual classroom, or where we teach. These three key domains of teaching and learning

30
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:03,860
help us understand the widespread applicability and relevance of anti-racist pedagogy.

31
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:11,720
For example, I often talk to instructors who say anti-racist pedagogy sounds really great.

32
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,620
Unfortunately, it's not relevant to my course content.

33
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:20,300
I teach courses on statistics or perhaps data management,

34
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:27,940
so there's no organic point of connection for me to talk to my students about issues of race and racism.

35
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,010
Even if that's the case,

36
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:42,300
every instructor has a "how" of their teaching and "where." An anti-racist pedagogy is relevant to the how and the where of your teaching.

37
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:53,340
So even if you don't quite see the connection to the "what" of your teaching, you can in fact see the connection to how you teach and where you teach.

38
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,260
As a quick recap, we talked about anti-racist pedagogy,

39
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:06,480
beginning with a critical recognition and that while important, that recognition by itself is insufficient.

40
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:13,710
And so we move to action. The desire to disrupt and change those patterns of racial inequity.

41
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:24,090
And that that action happens across three key domains of teaching and learning: course design, or what we teach, in-class facilitation,

42
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:30,300
how we teach, and the larger context beyond our individual classrooms, or where we teach.

43
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:39,389
Now, I'd like to share with you six key principles for anti-racist pedagogy that will help us further unpack our

44
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:47,370
basic definition and help us begin to think about practice and application in our teaching and learning spaces.

45
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:54,270
Our first principle of anti-racist pedagogy is that it acknowledges racism in disciplinary,

46
00:05:54,540 --> 00:06:01,470
institutional, and departmental context. Much like how we begin our definition of anti-racist pedagogy,

47
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,540
our principles also begin with an important recognition or acknowledgment.

48
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:14,370
Once we understand and see and acknowledge the way that racism is at work in our disciplinary,

49
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,190
institutional and departmental context, we are set up to move forward with action.

50
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,800
So we begin with a critical acknowledgment.

51
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:30,900
The second principle is that anti-racist pedagogy centers both structural and personal manifestations of racism.

52
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:38,280
This is important because it helps us to think about our own interventions, both interpersonally,

53
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:42,390
but also, how might we intervene at the structural level?

54
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,210
How might we be acting across multiple levels of racism simultaneously?

55
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:55,590
This principle is also important in terms of how we help our students understand and think about racism.

56
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,270
It is not either interpersonal manifestations of racism or structural.

57
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:11,389
It is both: and. Principle three requires that we disrupt racism whenever and wherever it occurs. After

58
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:16,430
we do the work of principle one and two of acknowledging that racism is at work,

59
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:21,770
of understanding that racism is at work both interpersonally and structurally.

60
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:25,400
Principal three asks us to follow up with action.

61
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:34,090
Principle four ask us to think about that action happening within and beyond our individual classrooms.

62
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:40,629
Thinking about what's happening at the level of our department, the level of our school or college,

63
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:48,640
our larger university, the city or town that houses our university, the larger state and the larger nation.

64
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,620
Each of these levels helps to determine the experiences of our students,

65
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:03,030
of our colleagues and of ourselves, and as such, are relevant to our work in anti-racist teaching.

66
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:11,230
Principle five ask that we bridge theory and practice, that we look to scholars, practitioners,

67
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:16,600
activists and advocates who have long been working in the area of racial equity,

68
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:26,470
justice and anti-racism, and that we use their best practices to guide our own practice and our own learning in this area.

69
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:34,350
And finally, Principle six stresses that we focus on the importance of process over time.

70
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:41,670
Anti-Racist pedagogy is not a stable endpoint or a destination, but it is a process.

71
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,620
It is a long form work.

72
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:54,360
Principle six asks us to think about our growth over time as instructors and how we might grow and change in our own anti-racist teaching practice.

73
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:04,380
And it also asks us to think about how we might set up sustainable practices and structures that will serve this work for time to come.

74
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:13,340
We spent time in this portion talking about our baseline definition of anti-racist pedagogy as beginning with a

75
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:21,560
critical recognition of education's historical and contemporary role in establishing and maintaining racial inequity.

76
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:27,830
And that once we secure that recognition, we move forward with action,

77
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:35,140
and we aim to disrupt and change those patterns of racial inequity and the outcomes they produce.

78
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:41,390
And our move to action happens across three key domains of teaching and learning.

79
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:52,730
Course, design, or what we teach, in-class facilitation, or how we teach, and the larger context beyond our individual classrooms, or where we teach.

80
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:01,640
We followed up our discussion of that baseline definition with a discussion of six key principles for anti-racist pedagogy.

81
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:09,620
These principles can help to deepen our conversation about the definition and will help to guide

82
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:17,000
our thinking as we begin to explore practices and application in our teaching and learning spaces.

83
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,320
