1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:04,740
Oh, sorry. Well, I tried.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:28,390
Well, you're. Good afternoon.

3
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,990
I'm so glad to see my nephew here today.

4
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,560
Today we do have two important topics to discuss.

5
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:44,540
Both are related. The first one would be vaccine safety.

6
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:59,450
And in this lecture, I'd like to cover the following aspects and with your, of course, joining the discussion from time to time.

7
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,600
Then the next session will be, I guess,

8
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:18,860
the lecture by my colleague about a vaccine for some research is focused on cancer patients in different populations.

9
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:29,720
So I know some of you have referred to the discussion as the tension for a long time.

10
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:40,210
So today is a great opportunity to hear what the experts and researchers have done a lot of work in this topic.

11
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,170
And then it's also a good opportunity for us to ask questions.

12
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:56,100
Some of the questions may have had for a long time. So I'm also excited that.

13
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:04,740
Two days know the back to back North Pole.

14
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:13,280
So first, let's have a quick review of the importance of vaccine safety.

15
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:27,320
And then I think one of the important central themes in this first session is to have the understanding of the different

16
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:41,000
ways to classify vaccine adverse events and then also fact based mechanism for vaccination course for adverse events,

17
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:50,360
how that could happen, why and to how we could avoid that for new vaccine development.

18
00:02:50,360 --> 00:03:00,040
And also in practice, there are many different reasons causes or vaccine recipients.

19
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:06,590
Then, of course, as public health, professional or medical profession in the future,

20
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:23,989
you'll always have the responsibility to explain some of this hype and to determine if it's really a relate to the vaccine or it's

21
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:34,700
related to the vaccine side or it's really to the practice so that you can change the practice to avoid this kind of things to happen.

22
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:47,930
So that means that we have to determine if what we see or what we've heard with the adverse events is to be caused by vaccine.

23
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:53,150
That's, in our words, epidemiology, causal relationship, determination.

24
00:03:53,570 --> 00:04:04,600
How you can determine this is truly, of course, the basic facts of vaccination and of course,

25
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:10,940
a fact that probably would cover more about vaccine safety controversy.

26
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:21,560
So I would only I would probably touch base on some of the major ones that I think we'll explore the causes,

27
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:37,040
the reason for these controversies and misconceptions, where we are currently fighting against all these misinformation and controversies.

28
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:51,080
And then we're end up with a list of current importance areas for research aiming at advancing vaccine safety.

29
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:58,530
Which you will feel would be useful for those of you who were being involved in your life or back.

30
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:11,360
Some people. So why it's important to study vaccine safety, to ensure vaccine safety.

31
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:26,000
And as I mentioned in the last lecture, vaccine safety is looked at prior to licensure in every phase of clinical trial.

32
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:34,040
There's of question one of the primary question is vaccine safety.

33
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:55,250
And then after licensure, once the new vaccine and immunization vaccine's safety is also a continue to invest in the process of licensure studies,

34
00:05:55,670 --> 00:06:01,520
including both observational studies or phase four clinical trials.

35
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:10,940
Why is this so important to ensure vaccine safety, to understand the safety of a vaccine?

36
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:20,000
That's just because of all the other treatments, vaccines or so.

37
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:39,850
Good. That's some important consideration and other.

38
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:46,200
Are you able to hear. It's also in part because you have to.

39
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:56,920
Yeah. Some people won't take the vaccine because they don't feel threatened by whatever it's trying to prevent.

40
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:00,379
So if they see that, oh, what if I do get the vaccine?

41
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,580
I could get, you know, X, Y and Z stomach then.

42
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,590
So that could affect people's willingness to buy goods?

43
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:28,770
Yes. Any other reason we want to really ensure vaccine safety in both prioritizing and, of course, the licensure.

44
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:41,170
What's the vaccine? What's the population and what's the population staff who get the vaccine and how these are different from drugs,

45
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:50,580
treating their disease, for example, and how vaccine differ from drugs.

46
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:59,820
What population? Vaccine package? In comparison with the drugs treating different disease.

47
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:09,740
Think about the House staff as the recipients compared to Cleveland.

48
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:18,760
Vaccines targets sick people, healthy people, healthy people.

49
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:26,830
So this definitely, you know, posts the importance of vaccination.

50
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:38,590
Okay. So let's look at a few slide slides showing some basic importance of vaccinations for everyone.

51
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:45,280
Join the discussion and worry about not covering everything.

52
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:55,540
And together we try to cover all the necessary aspects and sort of parties rather than correct.

53
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:14,020
Okay. So first, looking at this, I kind of look at the table here for cancer facts and you could look at the health shows,

54
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,120
your maximum number of cases reported.

55
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,930
So. For more often vaccine preventable events.

56
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,970
This is in the US. What's the observation from this?

57
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:48,920
These people what you see here? Drastically increased.

58
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,990
Yeah. So a significant decrease in disease risk and.

59
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:12,280
And as a result, when the at risk is reduced, then the attention and access and risk will increase.

60
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:20,880
Right. I would like to report you where I'm not going to into another difference of thought now.

61
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:33,790
But for a long time the risk was very low and any programmatic pieces, associates vaccination would definitely got a lot of attention.

62
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:49,850
So when the disease risk is very high, you can tolerance as slight vaccine for collective polio or your polio vaccine.

63
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:51,200
That's a hazard.

64
00:10:52,210 --> 00:11:03,670
You know, this relates to the cancer and potential vaccine associated with it, but it was still used to wipe the drug rent of the geography.

65
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,410
We're polio nature. Why are the polio transmission was high?

66
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:12,670
So the benefit of getting that vaccine is.

67
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,430
Outweigh the risk of vaccine associates disease.

68
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:29,350
For that reason, you could apply this law and to similarly our recent experience with COVID 19.

69
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:41,230
Even there some reports, some adverse events, some cardiovascular activities, more frequent.

70
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:53,800
But thinking about this pandemic, this widespread infection, you could you still justify all these emergency use of recession, right?

71
00:11:53,950 --> 00:12:01,630
Because it's obvious that the benefits outweigh risk.

72
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:26,360
So. No vaccine is 100% adverse events but you always these make an assessment e for the public health benefit is we run the risk.

73
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:34,790
So as we just heard that this concern public confidence in vaccine safety is critical

74
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:42,570
if because we are already seen some increase and you vaccine nation movement.

75
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:55,370
And so if the any vaccine related adverse events could compromise public confidence, that's for sure.

76
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,530
And then the low tolerance for vaccine risk for a lot of reasons.

77
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:08,930
I ask you to compare vaccine to drugs and the vaccine in a way.

78
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:21,050
Of course, all medical treatments, any products use for human being and have to meet the safety standards.

79
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:22,880
But compared to talk,

80
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:36,260
you could imagine that's the tolerance to vaccine adverse event probably is even higher than than to track because the vaccines use the.

81
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:47,570
By January, healthy people and the trucks and many of trucks as it was the very year of patient,

82
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:53,870
some of the adverse events even might not be absolved easily as the facts.

83
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:01,760
So this means a lower risk tolerance need to search for real reactions.

84
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:08,210
Real reactions often can't be found in the.

85
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:18,320
Prior license studies or early stages of clinical trials due to the limits London cases.

86
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:29,210
So this is one. And here basically to show you how vaccination the university recumbent.

87
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:40,820
I'll just before I summarize is and I want to take a close look at this because how you watch this the figures.

88
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,410
US, if you look at this type of describe what what's the.

89
00:14:57,790 --> 00:15:00,880
So how are these three curves, the relationship?

90
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:06,220
Why is this related to the personal effects?

91
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,300
One curve. Is the public good? Uh.

92
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:19,080
Confidence and acceptance of each other is a disease.

93
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:23,340
True how these false reasons are related to one.

94
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:37,319
More adverse effects, obviously are more people are getting the vaccine.

95
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:48,600
But then you also see that when there's more vaccine coverage and more people are getting the diseases or the disease, incidence is a lower.

96
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:54,840
And then in the middle, when the vaccine coverage drops, you see that that's when an outbreak.

97
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,310
Mm. Good, good, good.

98
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:09,490
Thank you. Yes. So this one really kind of illustrates what we just talked about.

99
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:14,470
If you think, you know, when you introduce new facts.

100
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:25,900
And so with the increase of facts and coverage, what do you see impact from the facts of mission one?

101
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,780
You see disease as a result of the effective vaccination.

102
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,950
But of course,

103
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:47,470
when you vaccinate more people and the sum of real reactions can be absorbed and then you will see an increase was effectively reported.

104
00:16:48,250 --> 00:17:02,860
So when you get to a certain point, the points of when public confidence on vaccine might be or good compromise or you could reduce what happened.

105
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:14,180
And like you were saying, um, you know, for vaccination coverage because the people were afraid and some dramatic.

106
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:25,130
Incidents, reports that could affect the supply of the vaccine as a result.

107
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:37,850
When you have less people covered with an outbreak and especially in the Hopkins population where vaccines.

108
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:47,370
You know, the rejected vaccination outbreak where so this disease happened.

109
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:58,650
That's other public health programs and our general population realize, oh, we can't support vaccination when you stop, that's good.

110
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:02,120
And then you see the impact that you see.

111
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:12,510
So understand how these three things are related where it doesn't do, but it allows you to understand.

112
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:17,050
And they are really, really so fascinating.

113
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,290
You would have become an old man. So you do some some hyphens.

114
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:31,000
Many countries tried in the back of my mind.

115
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:41,100
In other words, the government or the facts may need to have some composition of government to take responsibility.

116
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,670
And is an ongoing safety monitoring needed for the development of some.

117
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,360
And recommendations. These are all important.

118
00:18:52,900 --> 00:19:06,340
And because of the relationship backstage and just so important to recommended we come into vaccination and vaccination.

119
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:17,850
We want to ensure and to what extent that we want to cover the population is a high risk population based the vaccination recommendation.

120
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:26,070
Also university. You know, we come up with all these depends on our study.

121
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:41,130
And here of course it's in general but just so you know, in practice for individual facts and this relationship would also be,

122
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:47,340
you know, stratified by some population characteristics.

123
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,860
For example, age group, a couple different age groups we're seeing.

124
00:19:53,480 --> 00:20:01,070
This is why recently there was some discussion about, you know, these survivors who should give, of course,

125
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:09,830
and you could see it hasn't recovered or, you know, some of the questions that benefit the most.

126
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:20,780
And there's always of course, the question is when you especially for those of you in the school for help and

127
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:28,670
I used to have this fax and just came out I just pick up on talking about,

128
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:35,990
you know, the the vaccination and you.

129
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:47,200
Developing countries. Here we are entering in many countries and people even we have very small percentage.

130
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:56,110
So for that reason, we really want to have our points, of course,

131
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:08,710
and to study all these relationships for difference, not just for how they really identify which population.

132
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:16,700
Very different symbols and a question about the importance of facts and safety.

133
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:28,310
I'm sure it's quite straightforward, right. And that's just the start to think about how these should be looked at in different populations.

134
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,680
Now, this is not the same across all of the population.

135
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:42,560
And then another important topic for today's poll is adverse events classification.

136
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:52,250
Because I know everyone knows I have people talking about after vaccination, I have really some bad days and people say I don't care.

137
00:21:52,730 --> 00:22:03,410
But the question is if that's a truly cause that that vaccine, how we typically as a public health professional,

138
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:14,120
everyone's looking for talk in a hospital level and for their continuous education, physician education and vaccination.

139
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:21,499
So I think as a practicing physician or public health professionals in immunization

140
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:28,940
program or even researchers doing research aiming to develop a safe vaccine,

141
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:34,400
you need to have a good understanding of adverse events classification.

142
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:44,090
There are different ways to classify, but the common goal through applying different classification system is to,

143
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:50,660
you know, inform the development of a safe vaccine.

144
00:22:51,560 --> 00:23:03,720
The goal is to really identify the problem caused by the vaccine so that we can solve this problem is a.

145
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:18,240
To ensure the confidence and the safety of public vaccine and also safe vaccine development.

146
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:26,730
So one traditional, very traditional way is we have these four categories.

147
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:40,950
Once the vaccine induced, this is due to intrinsic characteristics of the vaccine preparation and the individual response of the vaccine.

148
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:46,380
This events would not have occurred without vaccination.

149
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:53,280
For example, vaccine associates of paranoid poliomyelitis.

150
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:59,280
After all, the polio vaccine or polio vaccine is life.

151
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,969
And we talked about the adverse events.

152
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:17,610
Cancer and the safety can vary from population to population for population with compromised immune,

153
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:30,990
even a safe life vaccine that's safe for this population, it could cause some severe disease vaccinate, reduce.

154
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:39,140
So this is what we call the vaccine induced the first category respond to what can only

155
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:48,540
by us subgroup the second second vaccine potentially lots of vaccine potential use.

156
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:59,110
Induced is really caused by vaccine induced potential and said that it's made worse.

157
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:09,540
Yeah, it's the events would have occurred anyway, but it wasn't precipitated by the vaccination.

158
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:19,330
For example, if people had some condition. I can think of an example.

159
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:28,160
For example, first, the severe seizure as the children are predisposed to the child.

160
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:33,420
And then if you give vaccine, it can make it worse.

161
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:45,410
So it's the the recipient already has some condition that need to relate to observed adverse events.

162
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:52,610
But so when you give vaccine some harms include, you know, pretty.

163
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,460
By the vaccination and to make it more likely to happen.

164
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:07,910
But the course itself was not the vaccine or any component in the vaccine that.

165
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:18,680
So you don't call the vaccine induced the and the problematic issue around this is some more relate to the practice.

166
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:31,700
If you are a practicing physician giving people a shot vaccine in your office or if you are a public health professional doing vaccine,

167
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:42,890
this is something you want to make sure that if this is some problematic arrow, what kind of error could be?

168
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,980
Do you know? Continued.

169
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,760
Yeah. That could be some of the arrow.

170
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,130
Any other. Thank you. Yeah.

171
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:19,370
So sever the arrow at the end to cover some of them.

172
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:25,670
And it's the whole process. Basically, it could happen.

173
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:38,550
In vaccine storage and it could happen during the vaccine preparation, during the manufacture of the vaccine.

174
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:49,709
It's certainly the design and the protocol is good, but in the process of vaccine storage,

175
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:55,560
preparation, handling just for administration during the vaccination.

176
00:27:55,920 --> 00:28:04,500
So these are problematic. In other words, it's from manufacture to the terminal or vaccine.

177
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:16,200
I can tell you some one which you may not be, of course, the horrible adverse event, but the course of no protection.

178
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:23,400
It's in manufacture where the you know, they vaccine.

179
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:37,620
It's a compilation vaccine. So typically the manufacturer will have all the three different strains of the virus for each of these components.

180
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,240
But the one time in a lab,

181
00:28:42,420 --> 00:29:00,450
they took like a mumps strain and some measles vaccine preparation strep that cause a lot of measles vaccine was made with long measles virus.

182
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:07,560
Vaccine strain, of course, protects, you know, protection against measles.

183
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:11,790
But a similarly, you could have fewer adverse events.

184
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:21,540
For example, if you are doing a manufacture, you are doing a BCG vaccine that has a different concentration for different purpose.

185
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:28,950
For BCG, for influenza vaccination, it's intradermal injection.

186
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:32,280
It's a point of 75 minute one per year.

187
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:38,940
And but there's another type of BCG packs, and it's for scarification.

188
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:42,120
Just you attach it and then you make some scratch on the skin.

189
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:46,710
That's like hundreds of times of the concentration.

190
00:29:47,250 --> 00:30:00,020
If you mislabel the vaccine or during the storage or preparations of final product and then when it gets to the queen,

191
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:09,389
you use the vaccine that was 100 times more concentrated in short term injection.

192
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:17,410
You couldn't expect to do something like a disease or big like or the lymph node.

193
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:23,190
And so that could be due to a proper batch.

194
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:31,860
Good air handling administration. Just the understand it's not just the absolute and doing immunization.

195
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:46,170
You could take that one. Another example, this is really what we have to actually handle to deal with this.

196
00:30:46,770 --> 00:30:57,510
In the old time, the BCG vaccine it's a skill so it's making this free strength for and the orphan there was also or a

197
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:07,590
psychologist viscoelastic could pass or test the agents to see if the vaccine was effective after vaccination.

198
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:21,330
And there were times some vaccination clinics took the diagnostic agents as the fluids for you know,

199
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:30,450
it sort of froze for signs of vaccine that could also cause very strong adverse events.

200
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:49,620
So this approach, the magic arrow, involves every stage of vaccine candidate from manufacture to the clinic just is yeah core use system reported

201
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:57,980
the events was not caused by vaccination by the hypotensive by chance occurrence or due to under nine years.

202
00:31:57,990 --> 00:32:08,540
If someone for example already a hyper infection of the but doing people breaking time and the height of the flu then after

203
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:20,610
vaccination and you had some fever or some other infectious disease already in the incubation time or subclinical stage.

204
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:27,280
And then you gave the vaccine and you saw this when this.

205
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:36,110
The kids are having to get into activities since they start to have a fever or sometimes even a seizure here,

206
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:39,380
then their nervous system has not been fully developed.

207
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,150
But you could also see some things are related to the fever.

208
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:56,239
So in that case, it's coincidence. So as a clinician giving vaccinations or as a public health professional immunization program,

209
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:05,660
you always want to ask this question because you don't want to mislead people working in the lab to develop a vaccine saying,

210
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:11,490
Oh, we saw so many adverse events, you need to do something, turn to the vaccine for minerals.

211
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:23,669
So that would not be right. This article I put here and I also put you in the under canvas for you to read this.

212
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:34,340
So also try to differentiate, but to use a little different terminology, one called the facts and production related reactions.

213
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,100
This is the basically the same as the vaccine induced.

214
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:48,890
It's really caused by vaccine. Okay. That's cause the old price of oil, it's kind of a relate to.

215
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,900
I actually like to separate this. To.

216
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:04,170
You know, categories battle motherhood into the box and has a tendency for sexism.

217
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:19,770
So you still want to think about if these vaccines have been approved to reduce the prison system from adverse events, that happens anyway.

218
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:27,120
But probably it's better to separate. I personally like the sets of the last life.

219
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:34,840
I shall induce the defense and the substance of the cause.

220
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,860
It's not facts. And so it's others and countries.

221
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:47,580
So profit here, production relates to the direct action and the person wanted to effect the reaction.

222
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:54,220
And this is all presented by facts, and that's due to one or more qualities.

223
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,530
So what's the so subtle difference between the.

224
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:17,650
This means the vaccine, the design, the formulation, one, maybe one batch, one of these products didn't meet the safety standards.

225
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:27,730
So it's the quality, really. It's not the intrinsic characteristics of the vaccine or all some important is this.

226
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:39,190
It's the particular product that didn't meet the standard in the manufacturers for quality control,

227
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:50,030
FDA or other agency in charge of the product or manufacture of the unit.

228
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:59,830
Unity required for the installed system, for security and for vaccination immunization registry.

229
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:08,470
You should also record the last batch of the manufacturing process so the vaccine could be

230
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:17,110
perfectly design and the standard where people hope that it could be some human error.

231
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:23,500
Of course, the product quality. Been compromised.

232
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:33,010
And the last thing he ever related. That this is caused by inappropriate vaccine handling prescribing or abuse.

233
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,870
And thus by nature is preventable.

234
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:45,100
This is a, you know, for example, for the patient or the recipient part of some underlying condition.

235
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:57,330
That's not to recognize the poll funds that by the time vaccination you could, of course, that kind of thing.

236
00:36:57,370 --> 00:37:03,280
So always understand what's the country, what's the precaution?

237
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:12,670
That's important. Important point. Another way to do this is a kind of group function.

238
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:21,310
This is quite a. This is typically it's not to use the separate,

239
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:31,900
it's based or really understand if this vaccine you use is a program of a group and then

240
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:41,870
you can characterize the scope of particular high profile facts and where they are.

241
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:44,870
So you don't use this as separate.

242
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:58,880
You have to understand that if this is vaccine induced or present or problematic or for you based on that for classification, you could.

243
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:07,750
That is why we do research to see how often we see vaccine being used for this particular vaccine.

244
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:19,720
Does that make sense? You don't use the term that's come up as a separate categorization system to characterize that.

245
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:25,360
Of course, you I guess I'm just the interesting difference.

246
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:29,670
Between went to war and then back to actions.

247
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,250
Because I know you were talking about potentially diseases in a preclinical stage and.

248
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,740
Some sort of vaccination. Something happened.

249
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:49,470
Comes in active infection. How would that be different from like vaccine protection where they don't eventually become active anyway?

250
00:38:52,000 --> 00:39:04,150
Celebrate. Yeah. I think the vaccine potential it's difficult to differentiate vaccine potential from core use of right

251
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:13,740
and the vaccine potential the usually these two you know all this is sometimes it's a of defensive.

252
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:27,220
I think the vaccine potential open is really high that's the adverse event that you absorbed.

253
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:33,140
The vaccine would have happened without the vaccine.

254
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:47,440
So sometimes it's more the type of adverse events so that the particular type of adverse events would have happened in this individual anyway.

255
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:54,310
For example, I just it's safe to say, are safe.

256
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:59,320
So in some patients we're hyper,

257
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:08,259
but the coincidence of could be wider range of different symptoms and you could not link

258
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:16,620
to patients the particular conditions that we're generate that particular symptoms.

259
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:21,070
So it's varies I would say they are similar as you say,

260
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:32,710
but a lot of new vaccine potentially for this patient is known to have some conditions or to have some very concerning symptoms and to the

261
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:46,660
vaccine really is triggered that hyper and the coincidence that doesn't happen is the trigger mechanism there instead is happened to occur.

262
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:57,810
Oh, good question. You know, a lot of times this sense of Max is like one plus one or two type of things.

263
00:40:58,090 --> 00:41:10,860
Yeah. Um, and I mentioned this, uh, this the right partner is basically here in the research and this would be, uh,

264
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:18,600
used to look that after you really define the type of sex and you don't just say, Oh,

265
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:25,630
this back's an adverse event, it's come or let's come, you, you, the first thing you want to do term.

266
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,540
What type? What category? Then you would determine the frequency of it.

267
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:34,770
Okay, this is some more other particular one.

268
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:45,870
I'm not going to go through details, but this is the just the more literature, more different the data to show you.

269
00:41:46,860 --> 00:42:02,160
So once we determined this is vaccine induced, then you also want to understand the mechanisms involved in advance, the course, the buybacks.

270
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:08,700
It's really due to the vaccine some ways in the injection process.

271
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:25,380
You know, like I say, if you took the different types of vaccines or scarification, BCG and intradermal vaccine, you would be causing severe disease.

272
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:31,470
You use a different concentration sometimes, like Dr. Frieden mentioned,

273
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:43,080
to have those for pertussis vaccine for you for your youth mix makes that that's different to

274
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:50,909
those for different age groups you could that could be one that's doing the injection process

275
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:59,370
and you took the one product of another it's really doing the manufacturer incomplete inactivation

276
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:08,860
of a vaccination if these vaccines a supposed to be killed the vaccine if your you know uh,

277
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:15,090
process of to kill the vaccine and make it to kill the vaccine was not to add crude.

278
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:24,870
So you introduce life, uh, virulence of pan switching to people and the replication of one life.

279
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,689
Vaccinating this is more in the immunocompromised population is kind of hype.

280
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:39,990
And this is why we don't usually recommend the life of the vaccine for anyone who has a compromised immunity.

281
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:49,860
So that's very important to know. And then in advance, the contamination of vaccine was other life agents.

282
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:56,580
This could happen during manufacture if this is, uh, you know,

283
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:05,450
they have so many different vaccine in place in production if you took the run for two weeks with other.

284
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:15,810
So this is the more if this can happen during the vaccine operation, during the manufacture curve.

285
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,780
But can this be how can this happen during immunization practice?

286
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:42,740
Can this happen? Contaminating a vaccine with other life, aging or other microorganisms happen during the immunization process.

287
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:51,130
If you don't sanitize the. Yeah, definitely.

288
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:52,360
Thank you.

289
00:44:52,910 --> 00:45:06,250
This is so I'm just trying to emphasize to many of the causes especially relate to problematical issue can happen at the upstream and downstream just.

290
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,960
Yes like that's the same thing for you.

291
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:16,460
Didn't you know this in fact, sir, I saw this.

292
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:24,100
In fact, the skin before you injection that kind fiber and now this I can tell you happened a lot in developing

293
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:33,070
country is because of the limited the resource they don't want to throw any open bottles of vaccine.

294
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:48,460
So there's usually a requirement or specification for how long you could keep an open apple, but with the vaccine in the fridge you wait.

295
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:56,410
But the because of they don't want to waste any vaccine they may keep it in stuff for 4 hours as specified on the label.

296
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:05,290
They meet people all day that could cause contamination and then, you know,

297
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:12,040
causes some infection that's actually not by the vaccine, but by companies organs.

298
00:46:12,790 --> 00:46:18,370
So this can happen both directly effect of vaccine components.

299
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:27,160
And as you probably know some you know they are different sense of could be

300
00:46:29,530 --> 00:46:36,670
content in the vaccine as accepted or not accepted or accepted to certain extent.

301
00:46:37,390 --> 00:46:41,350
And then another course could be a host.

302
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:46,870
The immune response to vaccine components normal or approved.

303
00:46:47,230 --> 00:46:54,580
We I had to talk to some a researcher whose major interest is some genetic

304
00:46:54,910 --> 00:47:02,020
predisposition to adverse events and to tracks and to accrue the propensity to vaccine.

305
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:13,810
So and also if people have some condition, that could also increase the chance for them.

306
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:26,350
So then the next thing I want to talk, I mentioned this is just information, but you want to know the vaccine and final product.

307
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:31,760
So often it's not just components of the antigen itself.

308
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:43,480
You want to stabilize the vaccine or in order to enhance a lung protein based vaccine, a small molecule vaccine,

309
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:53,259
or in order to keep this in the vaccine there are different since that's often be and it's true vaccine once

310
00:47:53,260 --> 00:48:05,890
preservatives this is basically keeping bacteria or fungus from growing so and then stabilizing which people in the

311
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:18,370
vaccines the correct chemical composition and and that's why do you use that to boost the vaccines appear to

312
00:48:18,850 --> 00:48:33,820
provide a miracle the feedback so all adaptive ways and the safe margin is established by federal agency some I.

313
00:48:35,510 --> 00:48:43,540
At the concourse level is solely on the skin where the vaccination has been giving occasionally.

314
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:48,290
There's also some response for reaction due to allergies.

315
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:55,430
And that's why when you go to get a vaccination, you are always asked, are you allergy to anything?

316
00:48:55,790 --> 00:49:08,390
So this is just information. Most important is that you understand that an adverse event soon after vaccination not necessarily post the vaccine,

317
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:22,460
but if you determine that that's caused by vaccine, this difference, a potential mechanism for a vaccine caused the adverse events.

318
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:42,680
And the next question, of course, is, you know, since it's important to determine vaccine induced versus coincidental, potentially, what can you do?

319
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:50,630
What kind of studies? Can you help to assess the safety of vaccine?

320
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:59,780
What kind of stuff is coming? Mine, too, you know, to study vaccine safety.

321
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,250
You can think about the product. And I think. Clinical trials.

322
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:14,040
Yeah. Definite clinical trials or the face of clinical trials will help to study that.

323
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:20,870
But that's after we already moved into the new investigational drug phase.

324
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:31,430
Prior to that, the stage how we can get approval for going through the clinical trials is like we're getting more and more.

325
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,640
Not do not directly trust. Mm hmm.

326
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,330
Yeah. Mm hmm. Yeah. Animal studies.

327
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:53,100
That's a pre-clinical. Clinical trials is the ultimate assessment that leads to licensure in order for us to be able to get approved with to study.

328
00:50:53,340 --> 00:50:59,130
We need to do some animal studies. What else besides animal studies?

329
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,110
Animal studies? It's called the In-Vivo studies.

330
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:09,480
Can we do any in studies to to study vaccine safety?

331
00:51:17,450 --> 00:51:21,380
Yes, we can. This is a different type.

332
00:51:21,710 --> 00:51:28,790
That is, we can do laboratory and this and animal studies typically happen before clinical trials.

333
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:37,910
But if we see some signal of Apophis caused by vaccine concerning, I'm sure now COVID 19 vaccines,

334
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:49,130
there are more laboratory animal studies to try to understand the reported to some real adverse event.

335
00:51:49,430 --> 00:51:53,050
So these can happen prior to the license?

336
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:57,500
Sure, it can also happen after the licensure.

337
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:01,390
We observed something. You want to go back and.

338
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:20,230
Pre licensure of humans that is most important you have three phase but they they purely one limitations.

339
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:29,830
They are not able to detect reactions real reactions delayed onset of and to

340
00:52:29,830 --> 00:52:35,710
subpopulations because the doing the clinical trials you don't go over population.

341
00:52:35,770 --> 00:52:45,730
They might be some subpopulations suffering some particular underlying condition that all different genotype connected to

342
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:57,730
so so although these are critical evidence to collect to support safety but that you have to understand that the mutation.

343
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:03,980
Interesting where you couldn't see my friends.

344
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:13,640
I use some real delay, so understand the limitation for that reason.

345
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:18,740
We even after licensure you were have post for licensure surveillance.

346
00:53:19,250 --> 00:53:26,390
Identify real react reaction early during the polio vaccine development.

347
00:53:26,930 --> 00:53:32,959
Very little attention paid to the vaccine associated response.

348
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:41,120
But then later we have to vaccinate the so many people with some real community reaction and

349
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:49,880
the post licensure surveillance can do many different sense ways to identify real reactions.

350
00:53:50,360 --> 00:54:03,620
Monitoring you question No, no reaction, you know, especially with some emergency use authorization able to move so fast.

351
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:10,880
But then when you extend the observation time and with more population, even some.

352
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:17,930
So we learned that during the first six months that's typically for phase one.

353
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:22,190
Traditional was when you were after that. But when you.

354
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:28,070
Study or vaccinate more people.

355
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:42,440
You will learn parts of the race for particular at this event, and more importantly is to identify the risk factor for reactivation.

356
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:51,020
So by identify that you may change your vaccination recommendation.

357
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:55,460
Who should not get the vaccine? Who should replace the vaccine?

358
00:54:56,750 --> 00:55:00,980
Identified vaccine? Not with an increased risk of reaction.

359
00:55:01,370 --> 00:55:08,120
This is reflect the inconsistency in the manufacturing process.

360
00:55:08,450 --> 00:55:14,110
So you could have a perfect batch. Once the clinical trials get a license.

361
00:55:14,510 --> 00:55:29,250
But if you don't have a. Quality Assurance program, then you would not be able to ensure the consistent production of high quality facet.

362
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,790
That's why it's important. And then post the license.

363
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:42,360
You could also identify signals for some new adverse events that was not found previously.

364
00:55:43,170 --> 00:55:51,630
This some system you probably will have to use the for COVID 19 vaccination adverse events report but doesn't care.

365
00:55:51,720 --> 00:56:00,900
You want to know this different resource and no matches are for study or isn't for reporting this vaccine

366
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:07,320
adverse event reporting system open its reported by the physician or public health professional.

367
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:17,340
You get a vaccine from and most of the people who have it done far and to go to report in this system they

368
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:27,660
probably would tell their physicians and their physician may report on behalf of them but that this is inaccurate.

369
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:40,799
But can this system accept the report not just from physicians, from anyone, parents and children and any one like you?

370
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:45,270
And we can report if we wish to share some information.

371
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:48,780
It's a joint administered by CDC and FDA.

372
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:55,910
We've received a lot. I was just the facts and conference back and apology.

373
00:56:56,250 --> 00:57:07,410
There were some studies. One study I saw is using this system to identify some neurological disorder with the vaccine.

374
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:22,830
So what you understand is this has some good use, but it doesn't confirm causal relationship and even you have to do additional study.

375
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:28,200
Similarly, there's another one, one of the major limitation with these findings.

376
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:38,370
It doesn't have standard definition and everyone is talking about the potential adverse event.

377
00:57:39,030 --> 00:57:50,400
And based on their understanding, what that could be and the error was the tolerance to to adverse events, to a giving symptom also different.

378
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,830
So so just another limitation.

379
00:57:53,160 --> 00:58:03,450
Then there's active surveillance of these kind of post the licensure adverse events through this the vaccine safety datalink,

380
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:20,610
which includes the multiple, you know, health care organizations that aim at working jointly to identify vaccine safety.

381
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:33,440
Issues. So. And not necessarily memorize and but no this is a different resource.

382
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:37,240
If you ever think about getting involved.

383
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:41,290
This could be a potential organization you may want to work with.

384
00:58:41,290 --> 00:58:46,790
Or you if you want to do secondary data analyzes is to look for.

385
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,360
This is a clinical utilization safety assessment.

386
00:58:51,660 --> 00:59:00,810
It's another organization network aimed at the same thing, improving vaccine safety.

387
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:07,290
Then the this article is quite the.

388
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:11,190
There's also a video I put the link here you have.

389
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:15,980
But this article basically provides a detailed description.

390
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:27,190
The FDA opposed to licensure, rapid immunization safety monitoring program, what they do, how that program works.

391
00:59:27,660 --> 00:59:31,710
So that's good for you to know. Yeah.

392
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:41,940
There is also particular, you know, Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices and COVID 19 vaccine safety.

393
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:46,350
Technical work is some more, more than one.

394
00:59:46,650 --> 01:00:00,780
These last few slides that basically introduce you to different systems in place and then misunderstanding causal assessments with you.

395
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:07,650
What happened was there was a lot of police use case report and this vaccine adverse

396
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:14,090
event reporting system and the results of recognize and the limitations why

397
01:00:14,640 --> 01:00:22,140
companies report reporting and maybe some people feel so has such a low tolerance

398
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:28,860
that they want to report some but some of many of us just take a half a day,

399
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:40,770
then wait together over. So it's incomplete and the lack of the verification of the diagnosis and then also absence of with the alarming information,

400
01:00:40,830 --> 01:00:45,350
we don't really know for this particular lot or particular vaccine,

401
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:53,070
especially a particular lot of the vaccine, how many people actually have received.

402
01:00:53,400 --> 01:01:07,170
So then you want to be greedy. I detect or describe the risks of such an event for this particular vaccine and the lack of the long vaccinated.

403
01:01:07,350 --> 01:01:18,089
If you want to say this adverse event is really high on hyper more frequency in the vaccinated because of this is all the

404
01:01:18,090 --> 01:01:27,960
vaccinated the people report and then you don't have a comparison so you can't really make a causal or even association study.

405
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:37,040
However, a proper association can also be used to generate hypotheses.

406
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:47,730
You can use this to generate hypotheses, then try to determine the causal relationship with the other studies which are these two

407
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:55,620
major category one is really laboratory study to identify vaccine agents in affected tissues.

408
01:01:55,890 --> 01:02:09,840
For example, in the oral polio vaccine, you I found this sense in people who got the vaccine and then you found the vaccine

409
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:20,490
strain in the basement of the vaccinated people who showed a pathological symptom.

410
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:29,760
And then epidemiological studies, of course, it's always very useful, but these are different epidemiologic studies,

411
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:36,660
controlled trials of before licensure of new vaccine and monitoring adverse events and following vaccination.

412
01:02:37,050 --> 01:02:47,250
You typically could do surveillance that could all the utilization association, but you could also do case control studies.

413
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:58,260
And as an epidemiologist, student or public health student who have had some epidemiology class, you know, you can do case control.

414
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:09,350
You can see if, you know, the observed adverse events and or that people who have these adverse events,

415
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:13,950
case versus those who have, are more likely to have this vaccine.

416
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:23,010
Right. And then retrospective cohort study, if there's a good clinical data available,

417
01:03:23,010 --> 01:03:36,510
you could retrospectively differentiate the study population into vaccinated and not vaccine and investigate the occurrence of the adverse events.

418
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:39,780
And the question that's a retrospective.

419
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:56,030
Even a study so key factors to establish a cause then replicable and you don't suggest that based on randomness

420
01:03:56,030 --> 01:04:04,300
few case this is always you see this again and again here this always follows the exposure to the vaccine.

421
01:04:04,660 --> 01:04:15,760
If we support incidents preceptors that has a lot of individual variation, you don't necessarily see the replicate.

422
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:20,270
You said the relation and the dose response.

423
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,300
This is why I say it's very important.

424
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:27,700
You may, if you suspect, is some vaccine induced problem,

425
01:04:27,970 --> 01:04:38,590
you go back to do some laboratory study or animal study where you establish is a dose response so you have a different dose increase safe.

426
01:04:38,590 --> 01:04:42,880
That's an adverse event in question.

427
01:04:43,450 --> 01:04:56,260
Where B, where you include when you have the increased dose biological possibility you based on your understanding of the vaccine,

428
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:05,739
if we see life, what kind of vaccine doesn't. It's very important that you know what a polio, for example, cause what's a BCG TB disease.

429
01:05:05,740 --> 01:05:09,780
Right so and unique symptoms and laughs.

430
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:18,010
So the symptoms of lab findings are really those only relate to this particular infection.

431
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:27,160
It's not usually these were not to general fever or that come so it had to be very specific unique like

432
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:39,760
paralyzed caused by polio infection all the same the muscle spans by tetanus infection and infection.

433
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:49,930
So it's related to the passage and significant association and this I'm sure you get a lot of those discussing in the.

434
01:05:52,480 --> 01:06:02,680
Of course, for 40 minutes to go through any questions about establishing a causal relationship.

435
01:06:04,610 --> 01:06:16,880
Laboratory, animal and clinical trials all can help to study the facts and adverse events safety.

436
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:33,440
But in order to develop the causal relation to confirm you were either in the laboratory find the presence of the vaccine strain in patients stool.

437
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:44,990
For example, you find the vaccines from in the people who had the vaccine associate the disease.

438
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:53,300
And then you have to do a number of the studies based on what was shown here.

439
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:59,180
Key factors to establish your cause and understand the differences.

440
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:06,350
Any questions so far? And I run a little fast.

441
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:15,120
No. Okay. Then just as a little additional concept before we finish a break.

442
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:26,050
And country country pushing is a condition in which you greatly increase the chance of a serious adverse reaction.

443
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:36,749
So if more people had some condition that's usually that's associated with a seizure, you're in for any action.

444
01:07:36,750 --> 01:07:40,040
That's the trigger that you don't want.

445
01:07:40,410 --> 01:07:56,970
And contradiction of HIV infected people and still or share them with, you know, immunodeficiency and those you definitely it's our country for life.

446
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:02,430
So it depends on what vaccine you're using.

447
01:08:03,030 --> 01:08:14,099
And here I put the one slide here basically you can see still you are looking into based on the contribution

448
01:08:14,100 --> 01:08:24,270
basically is reflecting the immune stance of the individual if they have any kind of immunodeficiency.

449
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:33,240
And then there are some vaccines that are not and I'll give you some examples.

450
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:39,570
Then we also talk about, you know, precaution.

451
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:50,870
It's a condition, a restriction which may increase the chance of severe adverse reaction or may compromise the ability of the vaccine to produce.

452
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:56,040
You mean, for example, if in some way it's in the acute infection stage,

453
01:08:56,370 --> 01:09:02,540
you don't want to people vaccinated, this person will really potentially have a fever or some.

454
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:19,800
And another is, you know, if this person in a very poor health condition, you may want to wait when the patients that have a general health condition.

455
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:31,160
So that kind of response, their immune response to vaccine, um, precaution is not the same as contradiction.

456
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:34,860
You must not this is just you be careful, watchful.

457
01:09:35,470 --> 01:09:48,540
Um, this is just a list of widely, uh, present lung cancer presents the safety controversies and misconceptions.

458
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:51,950
But I think that the vaccine is crossed.

459
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:56,940
We're talking about more vaccine safety controversy.

460
01:09:57,240 --> 01:10:06,780
And the misconception I'm putting here is more for your information, and you can do a lot of research.

461
01:10:06,780 --> 01:10:18,860
It is also discussing with, uh, in the medium to um, since we are going to have another one,

462
01:10:18,870 --> 01:10:26,170
I will not, I also don't have time to talk about the and that's the last lesson.

463
01:10:26,190 --> 01:10:35,880
I also want to highlight a few areas of interest in research relevant to vaccine safety, um,

464
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:41,760
which includes the physiological and immunological response of vaccine and vaccine components.

465
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:50,060
Because as you can see, no matter if it's the protective effects or the first events or contradiction,

466
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:54,450
all relate to the immune stance of the individual.

467
01:10:54,540 --> 01:11:05,460
So understand that's a better word. Definitely useful than how genetic variation affects the immune response that may impact vaccine safety.

468
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:25,080
We it's well documented that's a different genetic background and may relate to different and you know the response to our vaccine and so

469
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:38,310
epitope recognition and also could a predisposition to some conditions that could be linked to increased risk for vaccine adverse event,

470
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:43,709
the identification of risk factors and the biomarkers that may be used to assess

471
01:11:43,710 --> 01:11:49,800
whether there's a relationship between certain pieces or this order of license,

472
01:11:51,210 --> 01:11:59,490
um, then application of genomic molecular technology to improve the knowledge of vaccines.

473
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:08,770
So to summarize, many factors contribute to the safety and to the second point of.

474
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:16,330
Since undergoing extensive safety and efficacy evaluations both prior to and after licensing.

475
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:23,240
Why? Because the safety issue cannot happen prior to licensure and optimization.

476
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:34,100
And the adverse advance of vaccine safety is the key to increase acceptance of public.

477
01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:38,960
Some reference here. Any questions?

478
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:51,750
You have seen my announcement about clinical trials in less than that.

479
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:56,140
Next week we were talking about the clinical trials.

480
01:12:56,160 --> 01:13:06,570
If you have a chance to gather some examples that probably were helpful to be engage in some of the discuss them or questions.

481
01:13:06,990 --> 01:13:23,340
So although the assignment is not to do on here a while late, but I encourage you to look into a study sample now and it would be really useful.

482
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:26,839
Yeah, but I have a few minutes.

483
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:35,190
So if anyone have questions we at the 230 back to back in April where join us.

484
01:13:36,240 --> 01:13:40,990
Any questions. Yes.

485
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:05,090
They are like the kind of thing. Yeah.

486
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,690
Good. Because she's actually, um.

487
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:13,890
We're a whole cup of tea next week.

488
01:14:19,410 --> 01:14:24,240
The first. Phase one involved.

489
01:14:28,610 --> 01:14:43,760
Please. Of course. And also on the face, three places that you must find in the population where you.

490
01:14:47,030 --> 01:14:58,770
Which could potentially include for some population that may not be high in some potential high risk for certain.

491
01:15:00,640 --> 01:15:11,900
You have to. As for this season, we just can't continue to expect things.

492
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:22,020
And there are some facts. I'm just not supposed to give you time.

493
01:15:22,730 --> 01:15:26,170
So it's important to not to.

494
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:35,240
Had. Yes.

495
01:15:41,730 --> 01:15:45,150
And other questions, Nancy, are these evaluations?

496
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:49,620
Or is it just in the country where do that?

497
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:59,520
And in Syria, the phase three trials need to be in the population where the vaccines are designed for people.

498
01:15:59,850 --> 01:16:10,070
So if you think about keeping HIV, malaria, you have to evaluate the country high burden countries there.

499
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:22,410
Yes. A lot of times the case when it's done in the lab and even last year, you don't hear that when you get to a place, you have to move to the.

500
01:16:27,090 --> 01:16:31,080
We will have a chance to ask more questions if you don't have now.

501
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:38,910
Why don't you take a ten minute break and coming back to 30 and we start.

502
01:16:43,490 --> 01:16:46,820
Oh, yeah. You have almost 50 minutes. 40 minutes.

503
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:05,940
As soon as I was stopped for the left, I was stopped.
