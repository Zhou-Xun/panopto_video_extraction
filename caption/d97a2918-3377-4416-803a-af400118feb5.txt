1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:06,150
Oh. I was asking who watched the recording.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:10,919
Oh, yeah. There's only one person. It was me. And you're so lonely.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,090
And now it's funny cause he's not here. Although I'm sure he's going to run in at any minute now.

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,230
And then Joe came at the very last minute, but I was like, That's kind of lonely bird.

5
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,690
So since it was me and him, we skipped a lot of the discussion. So class was just an hour.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,680
I'm glad more people are here today.

7
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:39,480
We did have to switcheroo the schedule a little bit, so ideally this week would have come after cardiovascular diseases.

8
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:49,380
But because Dr. Rosenberg could only do the guest lecture next Tuesday, not this Tuesday, she we had to do a switcheroo.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,460
Just a reminder next week is there, too.

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,300
Tuesday's lecture will be Zoom only. So I will not be in this classroom.

11
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:01,709
And then Thursday I've moved that material, compress that material.

12
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,100
So there's no class on Thursday because I have to be out of town.

13
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,030
So I didn't get that Tuesdays remote and Thursday it's not happening.

14
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:16,930
Yes. Yeah. So Tuesday the eighth is remote and Thursday the 10th is not no class.

15
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:28,810
Okay. All right. Well, first, let's debrief about your survey assignment, which I was grading yesterday evening.

16
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,950
I would agree to that yesterday afternoon, except I am dogs again, which is I had to leave right after this.

17
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,830
And it's really hard to read when she's awake because she constantly wants to be pet.

18
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:49,659
So I had to do it while she was napping. So I looked at your earlier things.

19
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:58,210
I generally providing you feedback on your survey instrument itself, not your actual cognitive interviews.

20
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,390
Good job. Some. Oh, you got at least three. You got four.

21
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,370
What have you got for someone to interview for? I got four. You got two?

22
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:08,830
Yeah, you got four. So good job.

23
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,060
Hopefully it was I think the consensus was that the cognitive interviews were generally informative and pretty helpful.

24
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,610
I gave everybody full credit on the first three parts of the rubric because it's just the pilot

25
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:28,390
and then try to give you like pretty detailed comments on your instrument or ask you questions.

26
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:39,280
So it is up to your discretion now to take what I said in conjunction with what your cognitive interview said to you.

27
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,139
Essentially polish your final instrument, which I will be looking at more with more scrutiny.

28
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:55,480
This I for the final assignment in terms of like esthetics and and layout and flow and then your rationale and all that kind of stuff.

29
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:02,080
And, and the difference is in your final also an expectation that you will describe to a certain extent

30
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,380
how you will analyze the information that you collect not beyond like percentages and counts,

31
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:12,550
but overall. Very good job. The purpose.

32
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,730
Some of you were more vague in your purpose, some of you were very specific purposes, which is fine.

33
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:29,379
Again, we're piloting. So just remember, like if you were a reader, they say that the average American has a reading level of about eighth grade,

34
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:35,110
but most of CDC material and health care literate material is written about a sixth grade level.

35
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,790
So I know we're in grad school and where you see using fancy jargon and stuff like that,

36
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:45,160
but thinking about like putting it directly towards like using the you, what can you do?

37
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:51,310
What are their action items for them? And then simplifying the language as much as possible.

38
00:03:53,140 --> 00:04:00,160
Formatting in particular they the convention is try not to use too many tables to shove all your

39
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,100
questions in and questions presented vertically rather than horizontally for the answer choices.

40
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:15,220
So in terms of like fatigue on the eye where they've done studies on that, but you didn't have to do readings on those kinds of things.

41
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:20,620
Demographics for some of you, like I said, people are in the camp of like, okay,

42
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,650
I'm going to put all the demographic questions at the beginning of a survey.

43
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:30,520
So they're kind of like softball questions to ease people into like the survey taking mood or some people put them at the end.

44
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:36,160
I like to put them at the end because if people are going to do your survey and give up,

45
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:42,819
like what have you collected besides like their gender and their like age, right?

46
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:49,270
So at least you have some relevant data. And then in terms of content and analysis, thinking a little bit more,

47
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:56,799
I know some of you use validated instruments or like took directly from questions and I might have

48
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,940
commented on the clarity of those questions or like the language of some of those questions.

49
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:11,379
It's okay to change those if you want, but if you don't want to and you want to like strictly stick to it, that's that's fine.

50
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,950
As one point of the most feedback I got in my kind of interviews was on the nice round and questions, which I thought was flat, right?

51
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:29,350
And we talked about that in class and how long that questionnaire is right is long and some of it is ambiguous.

52
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,370
Yeah. And that's all I'll say about that.

53
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,520
But I mean, it's there. It exists, right? I was really surprised that you use that and I was like, Dang, that isn't like a survey.

54
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,870
But he didn't know. I got no comment saying that was too long, so I was surprised.

55
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:54,040
Yeah, that's surprising that I have. You got comments generally on how your survey esthetics or flow or maybe you didn't focus on that.

56
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:03,159
Right. And then another way to think about like because I know you're making it in a word document some I ask

57
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:11,170
questions about like the single select versus multi select versus etc. if you want to challenge yourself.

58
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:17,270
We all at the University of Michigan have a license to Qualtrics, which is the survey plan.

59
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:26,479
For me. I use some students from last semester actually like built their survey in Qualtrics for practice on using that platform.

60
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:34,580
And then you can export it either to a PDF or a word document format and then upload that as your final assignment.

61
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,420
I will say if you export it as a word document,

62
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:46,880
it does look a little wonky because you have to uncheck some of the boxes because it will put like some of the behind the scenes stuff in there,

63
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:55,370
like how you decided to like name the questions and stuff. But the pdf will just generate like what the person sees when they take it.

64
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:03,260
And how is this usable in the future? Well, I saw on LinkedIn you announced your job and relations.

65
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,840
You'll definitely probably be doing surveys work to a certain extent to right now.

66
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:13,429
Okay so we'll look at Stephanie's learning in this class is already coming to use and

67
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:18,770
then all of you maybe except for Jeff if you go on to the PhD or something like that,

68
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,640
probably at some point in your job you will have to implement a survey or your colleague or something will have done a survey and you'll see it.

69
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,380
You'll be like, This is true.

70
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,459
And somebody should have asked me what I thought about it because we could have improved like the data that we were getting out of this.

71
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:39,320
Right. Or you can look at it, that is really good. Seldom do that actually happen, though.

72
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:47,209
So again, the purpose of this is just, you know, translating some of the material from this class in terms of psychosocial factors.

73
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:55,280
And how do you measure something that is not obviously seen by the naked eye but is very much present in the society,

74
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,850
such as the workforce that affects our health and well-being?

75
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:05,510
And then how do you get information on that and then potentially inform programs or interventions?

76
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:15,070
Yeah. Any comments or questions that have come up with since I uploaded your stuff.

77
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:22,060
Have you had a chance to look at it yet? I didn't look at it, but you all know how to, like, download it.

78
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:25,960
Okay, cool. All right. In fact, I said, oh, download it.

79
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:31,830
Never mind. I'll look at it later. Okay. Yes. I have to use my computer to download it so I can't see.

80
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:39,130
That's fine. I will say for the online MPH program we are not allowed to use canvas and we have Coursera.

81
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:48,820
I hate it because you can't upload attachments back to student assignments or after individually email each student.

82
00:08:49,510 --> 00:09:01,840
Annoyed. Yeah. But now we're going to go into prevention levels and then dovetail into like interventions eventually.

83
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,140
So let's recap for some of you.

84
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,490
What is primary prevention? And first of all, why are interventions critical?

85
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:22,210
So in the work context in particular, some employers still have this mindset that work needs to be stressful.

86
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,230
And if work isn't stressful, people aren't being productive.

87
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:34,330
They're not doing what they need to be doing. And so they see a stressful working condition as like, quote, a necessary evil.

88
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:41,290
We're not doing our job or working hard enough if you're not stressed or you're having too much fun at your job.

89
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:46,900
Right. Have any of you been told you have too much fun at your job? Thankfully, no.

90
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:52,060
Okay. That's not been my experience either. But I always wondered what it's like.

91
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,530
You know, people who work at like Disneyland as like cast members.

92
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:03,100
That's what they call their employees, like Disneyland cast members or like some of these jobs where people, like, seem really happy.

93
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:08,350
Or maybe they're just pretending and it's miserable. Oh, it's so bad.

94
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,270
Oh, at Disneyland. Yeah. And the tunnels are interesting.

95
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:20,320
It was like they've all the people go through a tunnel and it's like, yeah, they have the Disney College and Disney Cruise program.

96
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,520
Yeah. So it's all a facade. It is like it's bad.

97
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,790
Okay. Like they're not even the real Minnie Mouse.

98
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:31,690
And in the costumes. Now, I was making a joke.

99
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:42,050
Oh, okay. I was like, obviously not. I was like, yeah, obviously not interesting.

100
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:45,910
Well, it must be a facade then. So I wonder what their work pressures are.

101
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:52,270
Probably harassment from the general public, in particular dealing with difficult customers.

102
00:10:53,080 --> 00:11:02,080
I you are familiar with Six Flags. I had to work as in Six Flags in the summer in high school as a booster for a club.

103
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:10,090
It was miserable. I always opted wearing the costumes because people sweat in them and they're not like cleaned in between.

104
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:16,390
So I end up working like the games and then I had to work at essentially like a fry, like a,

105
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:22,650
like a chicken strips and fries thing, which I absolutely like, gotten no training for.

106
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,680
They were like, there's here's this high school booster here to help you today.

107
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:34,059
And then I just like was in the back frying chicken strips and fries and it was like 110 degrees in the valley.

108
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:41,920
I'm like Saudi OSHA violations now. They think about it. But that was not a happy place maybe for the people visiting, but not for me.

109
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:47,710
I'm trying to think of people who I know who really love their job.

110
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:58,240
I mean, nobody loves their job 100% of the time. But even my friend who's an editor in chief for a local newspaper in Southern California,

111
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,780
very, very stressful because we always tried to meet deadlines and stuff like that.

112
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:10,750
But some employers definitely put productivity and profitability over worker health or worker concerns.

113
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,760
So they essentially turn up the pressure like we've talked about before, like places like Amazon.

114
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:22,750
And the root cause of stress is often ignored because they focus on the worker over the environment.

115
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:30,100
So they focus on the experience of the worker experiencing stress rather than the environment in which they exist.

116
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,780
That is creating stress.

117
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:41,920
So from a traditional public health standpoint, when we're talking about primary, secondary and tertiary interventions, they or prevention,

118
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:49,090
they usually talk about it from diseases in particular where primary or trying to avoid the disease or remove the risk

119
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:56,710
factor to prevent disease onset secondaries like early treatment programs or preventing the disease from progressing.

120
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,790
And then tertiary is like reducing established complications.

121
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:09,690
So like primary prevention of something might be like screening for type two diabetes in particular, you might be pre diabetics.

122
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:16,630
So then at that point they're trying to move you back to non pre-diabetic or borderline diabetic.

123
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:21,830
And then just say you have diabetes at that point, which you'll need tertiary treatment for it.

124
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:26,690
They'll try to reduce your established complications by either giving you like a,

125
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:37,160
you know, I'm I'm blanking right now on the term the injection drugs or insulin.

126
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,000
Thank you. Or getting you on a drug like metformin, for example, and trying to manage it that way.

127
00:13:44,330 --> 00:13:52,700
So how does that come into place in terms of like psychosocial factors in these three levels here?

128
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,360
When you're thinking about primary prevention or interventions,

129
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:04,550
this can happen at the population organizational source point and sometimes individual or group level.

130
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:10,700
Now when we're getting to secondary, think like screening for breast cancer, prostate cancer,

131
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,620
colon cancer, that is either happening at the individual level or the group level.

132
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:22,280
But once we're addressing tertiary prevention or interventions, we can only get to the individual level now.

133
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:28,280
So if we're trying to do the greatest catchment of potentially like advocacy of our intervention,

134
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,859
it would behoove us to get at the primary prevention level for many reasons.

135
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,290
Right. We want to stop things before they happen.

136
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:44,510
Generally, this is the most cost effective in particular, but oftentimes this is the most overlooked.

137
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:53,510
So, for example, you remember, yeah, you're maybe too young, but you've probably talked about it in this class.

138
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,110
Remember when Cigaret smoking was, like, a much bigger thing,

139
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:04,159
and then there was tobacco settlement money that happened from Big Tobacco where they were like, oh, shoot.

140
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,790
Yeah, we do know that cigarets cause lung cancer, right?

141
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,470
And they had to settle all of that money out.

142
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:18,290
They're basically doing the same thing now with the opioid settlements with like Purdue, not the university, but Purdue Pharmaceuticals.

143
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:26,570
So each state was given tobacco settlement money and they had to do with it what they wish.

144
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:35,750
Okay. Two states that I lived in, Nebraska, surprisingly, Nebraska would not expect this of Nebraska.

145
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:42,740
Nebraska use that money to stand up their public health department network in all of the

146
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:50,440
counties and fund public health departments there with the tobacco settlement money go that.

147
00:15:51,500 --> 00:16:01,910
Indiana on the other hand used it at the tertiary level where they were used it for treatment with people who already had like end stage lung cancer,

148
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:08,780
which not to sound like callous, but once you get to stage four lung cancer, the outlook isn't good, right?

149
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:13,820
So was that the best use of funds in the long term?

150
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,260
Perhaps not, but at least they used it for something.

151
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:25,190
Some states use their tobacco settlement money to balance their budgets, their state budgets for their treasury.

152
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:32,300
Some of them used it to like repair infrastructure, like waterways and dams and stuff like that,

153
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:36,200
which like, I guess say it kind of it's a net positive.

154
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,100
It's a net positive, but that wasn't what the money was for.

155
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:46,250
So I will be curious to see, you know, what the opioid settlement money in particular.

156
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:53,420
But again, primary prevention is just grossly overlooked now in the work place settings.

157
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,750
So that is us addressing the stress or stressors,

158
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:03,530
either altering the physical or psychosocial environment through organizational changes if

159
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,989
we're going at the secondary level or modifying individual responses to the stressors,

160
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:16,400
so focusing on what should be done in addition to or what should be removed or reduced to their current scenarios.

161
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:24,410
So examples of that might be stress management modification or controlling perceptions over stressful environments,

162
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,760
and then meditation, resiliency and coping techniques.

163
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:35,300
How many of you have ever gone through stress, a formal stress management program?

164
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:44,840
I have not. How about learning modification techniques over stressful environments?

165
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,090
I didn't. I mean, because that day my bed was like a one hour meditation thing through, like, the company.

166
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:58,399
Right. So, I guess, did it stick? I mean, I already knew from all the stuff.

167
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,870
Those nights did not work for an hour.

168
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:11,440
I would say these kinds of things, generally, they try to target like one hour individual sessions, but really to do things like stress modification,

169
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:19,580
stress management or modification of control of perceptual perceptions over stressful environments and coping techniques.

170
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:23,630
This isn't going to be something that's accomplished in a one hour session.

171
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:32,060
This needs to be done through like multiple weeks of either group or individual therapy sessions.

172
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:39,020
Right. Because now one hour your brain, logically, we all know stress is bad for you.

173
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:45,770
Right. And it's not good. Nobody really wants to be very stressed at all times.

174
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:52,220
But how you react to it is kind of autonomic or automatic in a way.

175
00:18:53,930 --> 00:19:04,370
So you have to not only understand the core of where your stress responses are coming from as an individual and what triggers you,

176
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:10,460
but also understand like you have to be able to change the way you think about the situation.

177
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,960
Does that make sense?

178
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:23,660
How many of you that had a scenario where you feel like you were successfully able to like change the way you perceive that stressful situation?

179
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:33,920
Keanu, do you want to share? I didn't have an individual then, but I definitely had like several times, like the stress about something.

180
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:39,560
Go through some like thinking exercises and then be like, aha. Like that and not worry about it too much.

181
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:48,410
Right. That's more general. Okay. Two examples for you, unrelated to one unrelated to work and then one related to work.

182
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:57,920
One unrelated to work is that, you know, I think all of us have our respective traumas,

183
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:04,250
but like growing up as a like a child of divorce, I became the caretaker of my mother.

184
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,200
And then we had like kind of, I would say like a unhealthy, toxic relationship.

185
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,919
But it's not until you, like, grow older that you realize, Oh, wow,

186
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:19,459
this relationship with my mom is really like codependent and unhealthy for me because when she's stress,

187
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:23,720
I feel stress even like 2000, 3000 miles away.

188
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:33,560
Right. So initially, my way of dealing with that stress was to just not talk to her.

189
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:38,660
And then when she would when I would see a text from her,

190
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:43,760
my heart rate would like shoot up because I knew she like needed something or wanted help or something like that.

191
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:52,219
Or like if she left me a lengthy voicemail asking for something like my tummy would get so upset because I'm like,

192
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:56,300
Oh, now like help her do something or she needs money or something like that.

193
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:05,569
And so for a while I just could not interact with her without being really angry, like super angry.

194
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:11,629
And she didn't understand why, like, all of a sudden, like, she's my child, and like, one day, like, you're my best friend.

195
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:14,360
The next day like that you hate me. Like, what's happened, right?

196
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:21,050
But, you know, as the younger generation, to a certain extent, my parents are probably older than your parents.

197
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,910
You have to come to realize that you can't change anybody you can only.

198
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,640
And your parents are highly unlikely to go to therapy if they've never been to therapy.

199
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:33,050
So the only thing that you can change is your response to them.

200
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,030
And it's unfair because we have to put in the work and the emotional labor to do that.

201
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:49,400
It took me a couple of years, but now I can just have my mom talk about me and ask me for things and I'm like, Yeah, that's fine, that's cool.

202
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:56,480
Whereas my sister, who hasn't altered, you know, her perceptions of that stressful environment,

203
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,440
whenever we go back home and visit, it's like, you know,

204
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:08,629
38 year old her turns back into 18 year old her because you mentally revert to the age you were like when you left home,

205
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:12,620
which is why so many arguments happen over the holidays as families.

206
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:16,470
That's true. Yes. Yeah. That's a totally makes sense.

207
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,639
Yeah. There's proven free therapy to you.

208
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:35,990
Really? By proxy. Okay. Now, in a work setting, in particular, every stage of your life, you understand how much stress you're able to handle.

209
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:42,170
Okay. So actually, I thought I thought my master's program was less stressful than my undergrad, but in undergrad,

210
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:49,730
I was pre-med, so, you know, and I didn't like it, but my PhD was definitely more stressful than my MPH.

211
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,360
So when I was in my Ph.D., I was like, God, I am being.

212
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,030
It was so easy. I did not know how good I had it back then.

213
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,959
And then when I started doing this tenure track position, I was like, God,

214
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:09,820
the Ph.D. was like a fricking cakewalk in comparison to what I have to do now.

215
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:13,760
So you just like, kind of like romanticize, like a previous stage of your life.

216
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:17,929
And the first year of this job, I was constantly stressed.

217
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:26,060
I was like working remotely seven days a week, generally 10 to 12 hours a day with real no work life separation.

218
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,980
And I felt like the stakes were so high, it was mostly self-imposed stakes, right?

219
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,440
Because I felt like I was always behind.

220
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:40,220
And then I started talking to our other more senior colleagues.

221
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,360
You'll all be hardly behind the rest of your life.

222
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,530
Okay? As a professor, this is just something you have to accept.

223
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:56,450
So you have to decide, like, do I want to, like, enjoy my life and then not work on this manuscript?

224
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:00,139
I'll answer your emails that. Sure, pressing things like that.

225
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:07,250
But like, you know, sure, I work an extra hour or should I just like have frickin dinner with my children and have children?

226
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:16,549
But I'm just saying. Right. So I think it's also a matter of learning how to cope and then figuring out either your

227
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,560
perceptions of that stressful environment change or you get hard into it over time.

228
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:25,130
They do something in particular in the work.

229
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:30,150
In the workspace that they call like Work Hard, Annie.

230
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,059
Now, traditionally, this is for the physical sense. So think about it.

231
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:41,440
If you're a fireman, for example, I don't know how many of you have been to a firehouse before as a child, as an adult.

232
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:50,740
Like high school for summer. Okay. Most fire stations, each respective fire station, has their own gym room so that the firemen who are waiting,

233
00:24:51,220 --> 00:25:00,129
waiting around on shift or like off duty, they can continue to do their physical training, which is like a form of like physical hardening.

234
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:11,260
Right. Or, for example, if you are a person who has to do like hazardous materials response and you wear that big suit all the time,

235
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:19,000
you would practice doing activities in that suit to get comfortable in the environment, maybe work on your cardiovascular health.

236
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:24,249
They now do something called emotional resiliency, which they try to.

237
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:33,000
I've taken an emotional resiliency training as a trainer, but for people who are volunteers, a lot for a different response to that.

238
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,100
And so just say like the Red Cross, for example,

239
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:46,600
or you get deployed a lot for emergency events like Katrina or like hurricanes like in Puerto Rico or in Florida and stuff like that.

240
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:56,560
You not only see a lot of primary trauma yourself from the disasters around you and then seeing people injured or potentially dead.

241
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:02,260
But you also get a lot of secondary trauma from people sharing their experiences with you.

242
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:08,290
So going through emotional resiliency training is something that they're trying to incorporate more into

243
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:15,520
these like volunteer or like trauma capacity so that essentially people just don't burn out from the field.

244
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:22,810
Tertiary preventions, this is reactive. So at this point you already have the condition or the disease.

245
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:26,710
So at this point, like we're just trying to manage your stress.

246
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,460
So as we talked about with Shia who with only him,

247
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:39,100
we talked about employee assistance programs and then helping employees cope with issues

248
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:45,640
such as return to work or if it's a physical rehabilitation and physical therapy.

249
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:51,220
But there's also a component to rehab and physical therapy that is also mental as well.

250
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:59,979
Folks who get short or long term disability or also fall out of the job due to being injured or workers comp data

251
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:07,300
shows that they do get horribly depressed just because their functioning is not what they're normally used to.

252
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:13,540
So they might have to like short term or even permanently adjust to a new a new way of life.

253
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:22,990
Landsbergis, who I've had the pleasure of meeting in real life, it's so lot, not real life over Zoom,

254
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:31,540
but it's always so wild when you like meet folks that you cite in your like they're kind of like a celebrity,

255
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:38,620
you know, like, like that paper you emailed me, Sam from Dr. Sturgis.

256
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:45,220
She's here today and tomorrow. Really? And she's giving a seminar tomorrow, actually, at noon.

257
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:48,070
There's a really cool people at that one.

258
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:56,320
It's on Zoom or in the community room at 1:00 talking about environmental justice in communities if you're free.

259
00:27:56,380 --> 00:28:00,430
An email about that, that sounds really cool where we're going to find information.

260
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:04,240
Yeah, it wasn't the events thing. I think he's in a different department now.

261
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:08,349
I think it was like in the back yard on the vector. Yeah, I'm okay.

262
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:17,440
Go look it up while I'm talking. But so Landsbergis is another like academic celebrity in the psychosocial factors world.

263
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:24,460
But essentially he lays out here the levels of inter levels of work organization in the stages of prevention.

264
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,800
So primary, secondary, tertiary.

265
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:37,790
So if we're thinking about something like, okay, we want to do a legislation or policy, primary intervention would be like work our limits, right?

266
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:45,520
You to be sure decide. You decide. Oh, I figured look, here you have the signs, right?

267
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,250
Oh, okay. I was like I was like, I'm sorry to call you.

268
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:55,659
Okay. But or banning mandatory overtime,

269
00:28:55,660 --> 00:29:02,080
which is people get pushback from this pros and cons and then staffing requirements secondary

270
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,810
might be something there is it's hard to do secondary for factors for legislative and policy,

271
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,400
but tertiary might be something like worker's comp or Social Security or disability.

272
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,930
Now if you're thinking about job tasks or characteristics,

273
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:24,430
you might think about job redesign or rotation integrating workplace health promotion policies.

274
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:32,280
Now, if a person is already injured, but they're not like debilitating injury, you might think of light duty jobs.

275
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:36,060
So they're kind of modifying what they normally do, but not as intense.

276
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,690
And then that for that one, it's harder to do a tertiary.

277
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:46,259
So there isn't necessarily a solution at every level depending on what you're trying to target.

278
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:53,310
But I think these are some good examples here. Now, let's dig deeper into organizational strategy.

279
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:01,080
So first, clearly dividing worker roles and responsibilities will help mitigate a lot of the

280
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:10,050
stressful issues or matching the worker's capabilities and resources to their workload.

281
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:20,550
I've definitely been in some situations where I feel like I have the capabilities and resources, but it's like the workload is too easy.

282
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:25,050
I've also been on the flip side job redesign.

283
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:29,760
This is more so for like physical tasks, but it also might think of like workflows,

284
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,590
in particular opportunities for workers to participate in decision making.

285
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,970
Are their schedules compatible with demands and responsibility?

286
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:42,600
Improving ergonomics and work environmental design.

287
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,660
Improving communication between workers and management.

288
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,620
Establishing career ladders and upward mobility.

289
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:55,980
Commitment to team building and diversity, equitable pay structures and compensation.

290
00:30:56,550 --> 00:31:01,650
So for the most part, these are the general positive strategies.

291
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,200
But you know, keep in mind, there's always exceptions.

292
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:10,530
Some people just want to work a job that's a paycheck and they don't necessarily care about like upward mobility.

293
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:15,120
But I think everybody generally like wants to make more money.

294
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:24,630
So that could be what they consider upward mobility rather than like a rae, like a job title increase or something like that.

295
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,200
So let's how about individual strategies?

296
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:36,150
These were the organizational strategies and individual strategies now lifestyle management participation and workplace quality improvement,

297
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:43,380
and that's about it. So notice how much more the organization is in control of.

298
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:48,540
But we'll see. We see that most of the onus generally gets put on us as individuals.

299
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:59,519
So stress again, stress management usually refers to secondary and tertiary, but EP's are tertiary and if you're focusing on individuals,

300
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:07,560
you're aiming to modify the appraisal, but the lessons can be a little bit blurry about that itself.

301
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,600
Let's see now, how are we feeling? Are we slouched? I am.

302
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:18,839
Always am was like I tried to get one of those back corrector brace things.

303
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,049
It did not work out very well. My brother has one.

304
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:26,730
It never works. He's always clutch. And I swear, even with the back corrector, he's just.

305
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,500
I know I slouch to my posture isn't good. I'm always tense.

306
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:35,610
How many of you have gotten a massage before? I have.

307
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:38,639
And they're like, Oh, my gosh. Like, you're so tense.

308
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,840
And even when I sleep, I, like, scrunch like this.

309
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,120
And then I do work with Michigan, helping me also on collaborative.

310
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,850
And we're going to do a short meditation.

311
00:32:50,850 --> 00:33:01,229
Actually, they don't like to give me manicures because, well, number one, I can understand everything they're saying about you to do like the nails.

312
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:11,250
Well, your hand has to be relaxed. And I always get like I have to say, they're like, relax, I don't like I can't work with my toes.

313
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,070
Oh, do you get more when you try to focus on being still or is it just something happens passively?

314
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:24,959
Because I know people passively, passively, passively, passively, but like I'm like focused really hard.

315
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,800
I'm like trying to relax. I'm like my leg twitches. Yeah.

316
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,800
Or like, when someone tells me to relax, it's like the opposite.

317
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,980
Oh, like, for fun facts about me.

318
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:39,240
Even though I'm from California. Keep in mind, the Valley, I don't know how to swim.

319
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,370
Many people have tried to teach me and have failed.

320
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:51,240
And the number one people think people tell you in the pool is to relax because that's how you float.

321
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:57,090
Don't tell me to relax. I just go in a fetal position and then I sink to the bottom.

322
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,020
So if we ever get capsized on a cruise, I'm definitely dying.

323
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:05,730
But it's fine. Drowning is the most peaceful way to die from that.

324
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:16,739
And, you know, I could high five, so let's do a meditation now.

325
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:24,690
Not this one, because this link no longer exists, but I chose a short three minute one for us.

326
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:29,380
Because I used to do a longer one in previous classes and they hated it.

327
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,160
Okay, so I will do this exercise with you.

328
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:37,550
Okay. Let's make sure the none of that. So quite.

329
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,040
Close your eyes and find a comfortable position.

330
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:53,300
During this brief meditation, I'll ask you to pay attention to what's happening inside your body right now.

331
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,270
You find that you don't have to change anything. Just observe.

332
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,650
Direct your attention towards your stream of thoughts.

333
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,630
What thoughts are traveling through your mind right now? Can you give them a name?

334
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:32,910
Notice your feelings. What feelings are present in your body in this moment?

335
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,620
Maybe sadness, curiosity.

336
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,320
Anger. If you can try to give them a name.

337
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:07,630
Try to notice if there are other kinds of sensations present in your body right now, like tingling, tension, vibrations.

338
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:29,380
Just observe them and let them be. Now shift your focus and pay close attention to your breath.

339
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,650
Notice how it feels to breathe in and breathe out.

340
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:48,940
Try to give your breath, your undivided attention for a few seconds.

341
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:16,480
Lastly, try to expand your focus and take in the whole body.

342
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Notice that you're sitting here with your whole body, you become aware of your posture, your facial expression, your feelings and other sensations.

343
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:44,680
Hold them in awareness just as they are. Notice that you don't have to struggle to change anything.

344
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:51,240
It's okay to let them be just as they are right now.

345
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,250
When you feel ready. Open your eyes and return to your session.

346
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,160
I gather it was a great one to eat healthy on the go.

347
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,910
There were only 3 minutes of soccer. It did for me.

348
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:14,650
I felt shorter than the 3 minutes that other people thought was hunger.

349
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:20,170
So I think I multitask too much. Oh, yeah.

350
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:24,850
Oh, yeah. It took everyone before. Yeah, we were doing nothing.

351
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:29,800
Was that healthy? Oh, really? Did we like it?

352
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,970
Oh, I feel like I needed it. I like that. Okay. Yeah.

353
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:40,660
I realize how short my attention span is now, actually, like, when I especially I live alone again.

354
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:47,350
So when I watch TV, I'm also on my phone or on my laptop.

355
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:55,120
Can I just be doing one thing? Or even like the silence is challenging?

356
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:01,230
The only time I think about silent is when even when I'm sleeping, I have a white noise machine on.

357
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:09,850
But like when I walk the dog in the morning, I don't listen to anything because it's dark and I'm paranoid about someone sneaking up on me.

358
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,600
But I used to do meditation practice a lot more.

359
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:24,370
I just fell out of it. But it was helpful and I know it is helpful, but if we were to like try to be fastidious in our meditation practice,

360
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:30,280
we would have to do it every, every single day. The I think the challenging part is.

361
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:37,840
I prefer the narrated ones in particular because I feel like I can lose focus if it's just silence.

362
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:43,900
But initially, like a lot of people's thoughts about meditation is that it has to be the absence of thought.

363
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:50,320
But really it is just acknowledging your present thoughts and then moving on from them.

364
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,890
Because I used to get super fixated on like my mind isn't like my mind is.

365
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:58,740
It wasn't like, am I doing this right? And that's not helpful.

366
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,149
That's a good one. Now so again, this counterintuitive is work.

367
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:11,170
Stress is a necessary evil. And again, many studies have shown that work is associated with increased illness,

368
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:16,360
loss, productivity, high turnover, intention, increase, absenteeism, tardiness,

369
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,490
low motivation for like I see this in particular,

370
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:27,940
it's a little bit different for staff than faculty because they kind of have set hours which they work within.

371
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:32,200
So I'm sure you've been to a workplace where like you have colleagues who like sit in their

372
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:38,160
car up until like the absolute last moment before they have to like run in and clock in.

373
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:47,890
Right. And despite all this research and knowledge that we know about how work stress creates all of these things,

374
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:54,670
why don't people still just want to create a space for happy, healthy workers?

375
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:04,690
I don't know. I don't know. I mean. I mean. Money. Capitalism.

376
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:12,080
My answer is okay. Okay. So it still seems like not productive time.

377
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:18,950
Like, not productive in the way that, like, you're making money. So capitalism.

378
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:23,149
Yeah. I think there's a mentality, too, of, like, even if you I mean,

379
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:28,129
even if you could do your job really chill and relaxed and get everything done just as well as if you were,

380
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:33,650
like, frantic, I think for a lot of what performative aspect of things have to if to act like

381
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:38,150
you're working really hard because like the culture is like work really hard.

382
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:44,930
Yeah, there is a, there is a workplace culture and I think there is a performative there is a performative aspect to it,

383
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:49,030
which I think is now differing amongst generations.

384
00:41:49,040 --> 00:42:01,010
Right? So like the concept of like overworking or like I'm so busy all the time, I work all the time, I think for I'm making broad stroke here.

385
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:09,860
So for like older generations, like baby boomers or like Gen X, that is considered like a like a mark of excellence.

386
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:14,450
I'm working so much, I don't have time to do anything else.

387
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:20,209
Look at me. I'm being so productive. Whereas like, I think millennials are Gen Z are like,

388
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:28,370
that's not a flex that shows like you have poor work life balance and that you don't have boundaries with the workplace.

389
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:34,850
Right. So I think some place is try to find a happy medium between the two.

390
00:42:35,210 --> 00:42:41,990
So for this will do I think pair share. So just say you can take the stance you're there public health,

391
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:46,310
professional or industrial hygienist, but you're at an environmental consulting group, right?

392
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,650
The cult, the workers are chronically stressed with high turnover rates.

393
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,300
So no one last. They're really for more than six months.

394
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:00,020
People also show up late and they procrastinate.

395
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:09,230
And then people are also complaining about weight gain, poor sleep, high blood pressure and work family conflict as a result of their work.

396
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:21,500
So talking amongst your peers. What do you think is the priority that might be addressed and why besides just broadly work stress?

397
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:25,280
Right, what specific constructs do you think you might want to address?

398
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:30,860
And then what kind of prevent per primary prevention program might you suggest?

399
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:38,570
So I'll just have you turn to your pair and then chat about this and then we'll regroup and do some reading.

400
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,000
Right.

401
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:47,600
Is the workplace an environmental consulting group or are you the environmental consultant consulting around the different workplace, the workplaces?

402
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:51,050
An environmental consulting group? Yeah. Yeah.

403
00:43:51,350 --> 00:44:01,160
So like a an as best as mitigation company or like asthma and mold abatement and mold abatement in schools.

404
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:07,350
So you work for a company like that. Nobody's lasted longer than six months and we have all these issues.

405
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:14,710
So me, as the public health professional are looking in, what should I address?

406
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,780
What's the priority to be addressed and then what might they do about it?

407
00:44:18,050 --> 00:44:24,350
Does that make sense? Okay, but then you don't want to focus directly under stress, like what's causing the stress, right?

408
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:28,130
Yeah. Yeah, you can make it up. Yeah. All right.

409
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,570
We talk about environmental contributors like Oprah Winfrey.

410
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:41,240
A lot of people are thinking of styles.

411
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:48,809
Maybe there's like something. The question is what their travel is like, what percentage travel to do and how often you can tell.

412
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:55,830
Like we have job sites or like making movies or showing people that were like I they would like to be done a normal pretty decent normal

413
00:44:55,830 --> 00:45:02,720
commute in your house during kind week shows that they're doing projects that like putting construction in takes 2 hours to get there that.

414
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:09,500
But I would probably just see how it works because I feel like there's so many good

415
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:15,930
audiences where obviously there'd be potentially over work or initiatives either.

416
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,510
Or should it just might be stressful to get documents to not want to explain or not.

417
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:25,430
I mean, I guess this year, the two of you also right there, you have the shared manager.

418
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:29,450
It can just be like management, but having a shadow.

419
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,330
See coffee? Yeah. You in 2 seconds. Yeah, but I think it is.

420
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:39,120
Maybe it's just like the working conditions. Maybe there is a lot of concern to these environmental.

421
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:43,590
The particular type of work I do. The really big thing I we drink or something too.

422
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:49,600
Or if it's like I was glad in a school or something, I don't want to be there.

423
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:53,700
There. And sometimes you have to have like a workplace separation.

424
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,130
You're just working. You may have all the time and think about it, especially for me, because weight gain or sleep,

425
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:04,350
high blood pressure, that's kind of like what works is big stress.

426
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:11,150
Mm hmm. And also six months is. Yeah, it's actually insane.

427
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:15,850
I mean, it's like. It's like you show up, just barely learn the job.

428
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,250
That is just beginning to make sense. Yeah.

429
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:23,080
I mean, it's like. Yeah. Yeah.

430
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:27,440
I'm sorry. I'm watching, like, the dog on the cameras. See what she's doing?

431
00:46:28,940 --> 00:46:32,660
She's just barking at nothing. Start to think that there's going to be.

432
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:39,090
Yeah. Okay.

433
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,150
But everyone discussing. Go quiet. Yeah.

434
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:51,160
Okay. What are your. What? What did you guys talk about? Um, we were talking about maybe, like, the working conditions, you know,

435
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:54,290
we were talking about, like, kind of some of these potential consulting careers.

436
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:58,610
Maybe they're doing not, like, environmentally hazardous work, so maybe their, like,

437
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:04,630
recommendations are that good or maybe like just the leadership in general, isn't that well.

438
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,410
So that kind of causing stress to happen and high turnover because of that.

439
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:13,160
So true potential priorities be addressed there.

440
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:19,820
Mhm. And what might you do about it. Primary prevention be hard for leadership because I think that's going to be one that's just

441
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:26,400
like them noticing what they're doing is wrong or like not conducive to the worker health.

442
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:40,910
Um, but I guess for industrial side working conditions of, you know, making sure there's proper, um, proper, I guess what is a word?

443
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,970
Like safety garments and stuff. You know, they're there, they are there.

444
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:50,480
Safety is priority instead of that. But. Yeah. Okay.

445
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:56,920
This group. Thank you. This group we talk about a lot of the same things.

446
00:47:56,950 --> 00:48:03,579
Okay. I wasn't talking about like you here with a lot of consulting companies that people get really

447
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:08,500
like over where like they work like one of the hours in a day and their work that is just,

448
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,270
like, insanely high.

449
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:18,400
So it really depends on the kind of environmental consulting group offices and why what they do, because the law also is completely remote.

450
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:24,040
So then you have like no workload separation. Yeah, it would be hard to maintain, like, work life balance.

451
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:29,400
Yeah. Yeah. We also would think it maybe, like, maybe that high degree of travel,

452
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:35,290
like so they might be or their commute might be in places where maybe their average commute is good,

453
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:38,560
but they go to a worksite that is horrible to get to.

454
00:48:38,570 --> 00:48:43,129
And then also potential like emotional fatigue or like the, the testing that they're doing.

455
00:48:43,130 --> 00:48:47,980
You're like. Like it could be like let in a school kind of thing, which might be very emotionally draining,

456
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:56,470
but like knowing lasted over six months is like literally just long enough to learn how to do the job and then realize you cannot stay there longer.

457
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,990
And so it's obviously got to be some kind of shock value.

458
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:08,680
Right. I mean, yeah, I would say for all of you, be wary that when you if you want to take a position at a consulting group,

459
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:13,629
do your research, because a lot of consulting groups, when you consult, it's like financial consulting.

460
00:49:13,630 --> 00:49:19,960
They own you, they work you to the bone. You're on call for work life separation.

461
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:25,180
But people are generally dead. People don't leave bad workplaces, they leave bad supervisors.

462
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:31,719
So yeah, I would just say that supervisor, the leader is a person who owns this consulting company.

463
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:39,130
Obviously they're not going away. So it may take them some time to realize like, Oh, the common denominator is me.

464
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:43,060
Or they may never realize that, and then just continuously have high turnover.

465
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:49,180
But when you're a small business like that, the more people that you have quit,

466
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:53,680
it doesn't look good because then it jacks up your unemployment insurance rates.

467
00:49:55,000 --> 00:50:02,590
But, you know, they might have to think about things like maybe I should start doing an exit interview, for example, for when people quit.

468
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:09,100
Just like don't let them like walk out the door, like at least have a conversation with them about what those deciding factors are.

469
00:50:09,130 --> 00:50:13,450
See if there's a common thread. I might even as an industrial hygienist.

470
00:50:13,450 --> 00:50:18,490
In addition to is the workplace toxic in terms of the culture, like physically toxic?

471
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:26,859
Because if everybody's in the office and they're not remote, there's a good possibility of like sick building syndrome, bad indoor air quality.

472
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:36,580
Maybe there's too much carbon dioxide build up mold issues, things that are making people feel sluggish in particular,

473
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:40,480
remote work, definitely legitimate poor work life balance.

474
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:49,450
My dissertation advisor, who's now an associate professor at IU, he had a whole life before he went into academia.

475
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:59,710
He used to work for an insurance company, essentially as a consultant, where it was an insurance company that insured high risk businesses.

476
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:08,260
So businesses, the companies that mow the strip of grass on the middle of highways, people get killed all the time.

477
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:15,000
Zip lining companies in particular, like these excursion company,

478
00:51:15,070 --> 00:51:21,340
Adventure Company is where workers frequently get injured or die that are more expensive to insure.

479
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:31,390
And he would have spent essentially like spend most of his time driving around to these different work sites on the East Coast.

480
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:36,070
I don't like driving in particular, not a fan of it.

481
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,359
I really miss being driven around. So that's also really stressful, right?

482
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:45,519
And then the actual job stress, not being home a lot, not having a home base potentially,

483
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:50,620
like not building any community with your colleagues or not feeling like you're getting supervisor support.

484
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:55,960
So I would do a survey.

485
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:02,350
So we need a lesson from the workers. Yes, yes, yeah, yeah.

486
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:07,600
And then from there, determine what primary prevention program that you may want to address.

487
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:13,420
And perhaps it is something like work, family conflict.

488
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:23,050
Right. So we might think about like in implementing it, like remote work policies or our culture that allows people to delineate those things better.

489
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:33,850
Like my current mate, my former mentor, who's, as you know, see, I'm now the dean at Texas A&M University.

490
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,950
Most of the time when you get an email from a dean, you feel like you have to answer, right?

491
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:47,020
He doesn't send emails after 5 p.m. to anybody because if people feel like they have to answer and he actually knows how to schedule emails.

492
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:51,150
So like if I, I schedule emails that go out.

493
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:56,510
Like staff and or things that don't require an immediate response, that they don't see it until the next day.

494
00:52:56,810 --> 00:53:00,440
I just have to write it at that time because I'm going to forgive and forget.

495
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:10,070
But like creating that expectation where you don't expect people to be doing their work outside of work is a really important precedent to set.

496
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:17,290
Now some examples. The EU framework for Psychosocial Risk Management.

497
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:25,400
This first emerged in the United Kingdom in the nineties where they applied psychology and management science.

498
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:31,430
So managers already know about the risk management paradigm in terms of physical safety and health.

499
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:35,750
So they were like, Why don't we integrate some psychosocial factors into this?

500
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:44,150
The first is they declared what is the defined worker population, workplace, and then set of operations, work, particular equipment.

501
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:53,960
So I just to say, for example, at GM, I'm going to focus on the workers who insert the microchips on this Y.

502
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:54,500
Okay.

503
00:53:54,710 --> 00:54:02,960
And then assessing risks to understand the nature of the problem and underlying causes, design and implement actions to remove or reduce the risk.

504
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:14,080
So this European Union prima model essentially is what they looking at here for more management and organization work processes,

505
00:54:14,990 --> 00:54:20,780
taking in a top down approach where they look at the production and the operation of the work production.

506
00:54:21,170 --> 00:54:26,600
And they're using this risk management process where they look at assessment and auditing.

507
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:33,110
How do we change that into translation? Action plans, reduce the risk through interventions, evaluate that.

508
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:40,190
What did we learn from it? And it goes around in a loop and the outcomes are better innovation,

509
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:46,790
increased productivity and worker quality, better worker health, and then generally societal outcomes.

510
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:52,400
Now what about something different like primary prevention of workplace violence?

511
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:57,590
First, you conduct a risk assessment. How much is violence actually occurring in your workplace?

512
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:02,540
Is it between workers or is it between the general public and work workers?

513
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:09,980
What do we consider as workplace violence? Is it only hitting and punching or is it also verbal assaults?

514
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,860
And then implementing zero tolerance policies that address types of workplace violence,

515
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:23,210
ensuring hiring practices to support prevention policies, establishing a visitor policy if that's at all possible.

516
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:29,629
Periodic work thrus, train workers on conflict resolution and nonviolent crisis intervention,

517
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:33,410
and then managers and workers on established policies and procedures.

518
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:35,420
Not to call you out, Brigitte,

519
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:45,820
but I'm sure when working at Starbucks you encountered your fair share of workplace hostility from at least customers and customers.

520
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:50,840
Oh, yeah, I've had a drink thrown at you. Not thrown at me.

521
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,330
Okay, that's good. That's good. How would your managers deal with that?

522
00:55:55,340 --> 00:56:00,200
Those kinds of things like a like a very like a like a Karen, I guess, or something like that.

523
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,650
And they would always we had had sides,

524
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:09,200
so I would always hear what was going on and they would go up to the window so that like the little

525
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:15,200
worker who's often like a high school girl didn't have to deal with like the mean people out the window.

526
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,349
We must be drive through store when I was there. So yeah, they would usually deal with it.

527
00:56:21,350 --> 00:56:26,209
But then like it just, it got to the point where it's just like, what are you going to do?

528
00:56:26,210 --> 00:56:29,690
Like that person is going to keep coming back and doing the same thing. That's true.

529
00:56:29,770 --> 00:56:39,670
So can people get banned from the store? Was like one person that's been banned from stores is like having like how do you how do you enforce that?

530
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,459
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's okay. Yeah, that's tough.

531
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:47,840
Especially like people that would go around like a lot of the Starbucks area and like do the same thing.

532
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:53,419
Oh, I don't know if were like rotate through the stores. It's different when it's like a Starbucks, right?

533
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:58,700
Because I liked Aldi's Target or like Walmart or something. They have security guards.

534
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:09,229
A lot of times they're undercover security guards. But you know, the workers already like doing so much right for my from my mom, for example,

535
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:14,900
she's a she's been interested in a nursing home for over a decade and she gets punched and hit by the residents all the time.

536
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:22,070
But they have like dementia, right? So, like, it's not like there's anything to be done about that, which is unfortunate,

537
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:26,990
but my mind is trained on like how to handle those specific situations.

538
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,670
I mean, but generally in workplaces in particular,

539
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:37,729
you might think of places where there might be more levels of like violence, for example, like if you work at a bar,

540
00:57:37,730 --> 00:57:41,600
for example, or in the service industry or even now,

541
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:50,990
just COVID seems to have really people are wild now just all over the place in terms of reactivity.

542
00:57:51,030 --> 00:57:54,740
But also, like, hair triggers and like what sets them off.

543
00:57:56,010 --> 00:58:03,420
And then creating a culture of awareness to encourage reporting of even minor events or suspicious behavior.

544
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:10,890
Not at this university, but when I worked at Indiana University like this campus, it was an open campus.

545
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:15,100
Right. So you always have, like, interesting characters walking around campus.

546
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:23,370
I've seen less here, but like, you always have people who are, like, very religious preaching, like evangelism and stuff like that.

547
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:30,250
And I was at IU, I think I've told you before, that school was also in the same building as the gym.

548
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:40,890
So I was walking to my office and this guy comes in dragging a parachute.

549
00:58:41,730 --> 00:58:53,790
So he literally had like a harness on and was just like dragging a parachute behind him and was like walking down the hallway.

550
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:58,380
And I, like, looked at him and I was like. And then I just.

551
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:05,290
Went back to my office. It was broad daylight, though, and he didn't seem to be harming anybody.

552
00:59:05,650 --> 00:59:10,060
I honestly don't know where he came from, being kind of lame.

553
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:14,710
Yeah. What we thought about him. That's the.

554
00:59:14,890 --> 00:59:18,380
That's the story. But there.

555
00:59:18,510 --> 00:59:23,160
There is no local municipal. That was not where the is now.

556
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:27,130
It is like a D.B. Cooper. Yeah. What's it? What's that? A D.B. Cooper.

557
00:59:27,250 --> 00:59:33,040
Oh, it's the famous, like from the sixties. Airplane robbery do jumped out the back.

558
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:37,260
Oh, yeah. Yeah, but like in Bloomington, Indiana. That was weird.

559
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:41,530
I mean, at the school, you got a parachute. Why would he be dragged off?

560
00:59:41,950 --> 00:59:48,370
And it would be different if it was, like San Diego. Right. Because I lived in La Hoya campus is on the cliffs.

561
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:51,910
People go like paragliding and parasailing all the time.

562
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:59,620
Less unusual than seeing that. Yeah, I was like, I mean, that was just a tragedy either way.

563
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:06,220
So, I mean, because it damages the shoot, so. Yeah, but you know, like, but also, you know,

564
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:11,319
I guess it's a cross between being vigilant because in some people there are minor events

565
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:17,020
of suspicious behavior is just reporting people of color living their lives so way

566
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:23,919
that as well in this in particular this is an article by Irina and colleagues that summarize

567
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,870
worksite employee health and wellness programs and return on investment findings.

568
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:37,150
So they looked at in particular this worksite wellness health wellness program they implemented.

569
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:44,290
So what does this include? It included a comprehensive work site program focused on cardiovascular health.

570
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:49,569
So they did health fairs. Focused seminars, marketing.

571
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:52,899
Extensive communications. Farmer's market and wellness.

572
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,900
Garden opportunities for physical activity in the workplace.

573
01:00:56,590 --> 01:01:04,480
Being paid to work out. Like at L.L.Bean, that intervention we talked about Total Worker Health Week, well inform champions of available resources.

574
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:11,260
They allowed people to get voluntary screenings and then if people had good health and they lower their risk,

575
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:17,080
they recognized the efforts, they rewarded participation, and they encourage healthy lifestyle choices.

576
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:21,879
And then they focused on things known to be associated with cardiovascular disease,

577
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:28,600
like dietary consultations, physical activity improvement, smoking cessation programs, stress reduction.

578
01:01:28,930 --> 01:01:33,280
And what did they find from this program?

579
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:37,930
They had had they implemented this for quite some time in order to get this data.

580
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:50,440
So they found and there's a particular company for health care cost reductions, it was anywhere between $3.27 to $6 for every dollar spent.

581
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:56,290
So up to a 26% reduction in health care costs for absenteeism.

582
01:01:56,290 --> 01:02:03,999
It was anywhere from between $2.50 to $10 for every dollar spent 25 to 30% reduction in absenteeism,

583
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:10,239
cost, and then presenteeism only a 1% reduction in health care costs.

584
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,600
But it was $1,000 saving per risk factor reduced.

585
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:22,150
So I would say this is a pretty good justification for a comprehensive cardiovascular program, if it if any.

586
01:02:22,460 --> 01:02:26,910
Right. Another example is what happens.

587
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:29,170
Okay. Whilst for work.

588
01:02:29,170 --> 01:02:39,130
So this particular program was maybe what some of you might be interested in examining the impact of physical activity in a natural environment,

589
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:46,300
looking at green space in particular, and then comparing that to persons resting autonomic function.

590
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:52,000
So their heart rate and then their secondary aim was to determine the feasibility of the program

591
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:56,980
changes and physical activity levels and then looking at different cardiovascular parameters.

592
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,410
So this was an eight week randomized controlled trial among 94 office workers.

593
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:07,750
So they were put in three groups where one group, they just did what they normally did.

594
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:16,330
Another one was a nature walk. So at lunchtime they did a 20 minute nature lunchtime walking routine.

595
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:24,610
And then this was and then another group did a 20 minute walk, but it was in a built environment rather than a nature walk.

596
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:31,660
But the nature walk in the built walking group were at least required to take two walks a week.

597
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:35,760
Okay. So what do we think will happen?

598
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,110
I think what's going on is potentially that nature walks might be more effective.

599
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:47,530
I guess we'll see. Okay. I think before the nature walks.

600
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:53,950
No, we're not for the nature jokes. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay.

601
01:03:54,330 --> 01:04:02,040
Because you're shaking your head. I was like, I don't know. So this essentially was you know, this is a plug that a lot of people do.

602
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:08,490
Nature could be improving to health and wellbeing. So nature exposure for mothers and babies can.

603
01:04:09,030 --> 01:04:12,540
Studies have shown improved fetal growth, healthier birth rates.

604
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:18,190
This principle that humans have a tendency to want to be in nature.

605
01:04:18,570 --> 01:04:23,309
It also exposes you to more vitamin D levels, which is why, you know,

606
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:28,710
we get seasonal affective depression because we have less exposure to sunlight and vitamin D.

607
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:35,280
More vitamin D can increase, also reduce nearsightedness.

608
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:43,860
And then you have increased physical activity in particular, and then potentially social emotional well-being are bolstered in green space.

609
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:52,409
So only 73 of the 94 people enrolled in the clinical trial completed the intervention, and sadly,

610
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:58,560
no difference was observed in resting autonomic function between the nature walk and the built environment group.

611
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:06,959
The self-reported mental health, though improved for the Nature Walk group, but adherence to the intervention was low.

612
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,020
So remember, they had to do this two times a week, at least for 20 minutes.

613
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:17,639
43% of the nature walk. People stuck to it. 42% of the built walking in the built environment walk.

614
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:26,250
People stuck to it after the intervention. So why do you think we didn't see changes and how could this intervention be improved?

615
01:05:27,480 --> 01:05:29,820
I think there's a lot of variables that go into this.

616
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:38,610
I think nature was a good one to really have a direct, comfortable, direct line relationship between each walk and this.

617
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,940
And B, I feel like there's a lot of other things that they'd have to control for.

618
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:46,709
So yeah, the change in heart rate, I mean, the lack of change of heart rate,

619
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:53,550
I'm not really surprised if I mean, CDC recommends like walking four or five miles a week, but like, I mean,

620
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:59,730
if you did 220 minute walks a week, that would consider you qualification for the program,

621
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:05,340
which I don't think that would really condition you all that much unless you were very sedentary before then.

622
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:12,050
Yeah. Yeah. And I that's. I just think and also how they measured it.

623
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:19,500
I mean, I mean, having someone measure any body function, it's always like a big stressful event, like the white coat syndrome people.

624
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:23,670
So it's just like, how do they measure these? It's heart rates and stuff.

625
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:28,350
Yeah. Sometimes they give like free, like Fitbits or not.

626
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:33,690
Apple watches, obviously. I will say eight weeks seems pretty, pretty short.

627
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:41,760
So I would have blown this out to like at least a 16 week randomized controlled trial when you tell people to walk for 20 minutes.

628
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:49,800
The pace at which Iowa is very different than the pace at which some people walk, so they could have been doing a leisurely stroll.

629
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:57,179
What essentially you want them to do is like a brisk walk where they're getting their heart rate up and their blood pumping.

630
01:06:57,180 --> 01:07:03,960
Right. And then what are they doing when on this walk? Some people literally might be doing a leisurely stroll and scrolling on their phone.

631
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:11,520
Some people, if you're like me, might be taking a brisk walk with a colleague while complaining about work.

632
01:07:12,330 --> 01:07:15,720
So I'm still like getting heated and activated anyway.

633
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,930
Or like you might want to try to control more of the parameters.

634
01:07:18,930 --> 01:07:29,580
Like you take this nature, walk like by yourself or like, you know, listening to like peaceful music or something.

635
01:07:29,850 --> 01:07:36,960
And I would have done it for at least 30 minutes instead of 20 minutes, and then three times a week instead of two times a week.

636
01:07:37,410 --> 01:07:42,960
It's a lot to ask of people, but if they're getting paid for it and they're doing it their work time, why the heck not?

637
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:49,979
Right. And then also taking some baseline measures of what was their starting heart rate versus their final heart rate

638
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:57,570
to look at the change in in heart rate rather than what's the change in the median heart rate in particular.

639
01:07:58,440 --> 01:08:06,390
And a good a good attempt a for effort on this intervention, not the way I would have done it, I would say.

640
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:12,300
Now, Google, we've all heard Google's an awesome place to work.

641
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:21,270
So free food, onsite health care, massage therapists, onsite gym shuttle services to Google plex.

642
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:29,520
We talked about this before. Generous parental leave, 22 weeks for women, 18 weeks for men if they're the primary caregiver.

643
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,380
Otherwise, you get seven weeks.

644
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:39,060
Plus you can file for FMLA Family Medical Leave Act, so you get an additional 12 weeks on top of what they're offering.

645
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:46,350
You're allowed to bring your pet to work. I wouldn't have to be watching Moon on a camera right now, wondering if she's pooping on my carpet.

646
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:54,930
Right. And then decompression and that capsules and then laundry day and free on site haircuts.

647
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:02,460
But we've talked about this before, right? It's appealing because they make you feel like you never want to leave.

648
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:12,080
What will be so bad about that? You have zero work life balance.

649
01:09:12,170 --> 01:09:17,510
So much work, I feel. Yeah. If you wanted to have a life outside of work, kind of hard.

650
01:09:19,010 --> 01:09:23,299
Yeah. It's like the high paid compensation company,

651
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:29,209
like the 1920s companies store kind of things were like your coworkers would go buy

652
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:33,280
groceries at the company store and then go out as in kind of a gilded cage kind of thing,

653
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:38,240
to some extent a gilded cage. I like that and I like that analogy.

654
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:41,570
The lawyers describe their jobs. I've heard that. Multiple lawyers.

655
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:46,730
Yeah. Oh, I wouldn't want to go to I wouldn't want to be a lawyer.

656
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:52,990
I'm not very good at computation. Yeah.

657
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:58,120
I don't know. I feel like it depends on the kind of lifestyle you want to lead.

658
01:09:58,150 --> 01:10:05,170
Right. So some people, they might not have that much of a life outside of work, honestly.

659
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:11,829
But if you're, like, in a relationship or like you have children or your partner doesn't work at Google,

660
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:19,690
for example, I mentioned some of my friends from college, they're a married couple and they work for Mehta's formally Facebook, Instagram,

661
01:10:20,440 --> 01:10:24,370
and for a while both of them were working at Facebook in the same unit.

662
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:33,520
One had to move. One moved over to Instagram, though I think it was too much like a few time in particular, but they have worked there since.

663
01:10:33,880 --> 01:10:37,390
More or less we graduated college. So like.

664
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:48,080
Like a little over a decade now, I guess, and they seem pretty happy there, despite how I'm not for some of the things Mark Zuckerberg stands for.

665
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:53,840
But I don't know, would you rather work in a gilded cage than in a cage?

666
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:56,959
Yeah. I mean, the extreme opposite. I think I'd rather have this for sure.

667
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,850
I mean, if it weren't for a place that had no amenities, the Google is pretty good.

668
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:05,300
So. So what might the ideal workplace look like for you?

669
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:13,410
I want to work life balance. You want work life balance? I.

670
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:23,190
I'll let you think about that while I talk. Before the pandemic, I used to romanticize remote work a lot.

671
01:11:23,970 --> 01:11:30,990
I think in the four years that I had my job as a non tenure track faculty, probably only once every one day,

672
01:11:30,990 --> 01:11:36,160
every like three or four months I would work from home and I felt like I had to have some kind of excuse for it.

673
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:40,930
Like I got food poisoning. Does that happen? Or I just wasn't like, feeling good, right?

674
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:46,380
Or I was like, you know, whatever. And then I would just, like, drag my butt to work.

675
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:51,120
And then the pandemic hit mid-March. Everything shut down.

676
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:54,810
The first two weeks, I was like, This is great.

677
01:11:55,710 --> 01:11:58,740
And then after that, I was like, This blows.

678
01:11:59,130 --> 01:12:02,790
I actually miss small talk, like watercooler talk.

679
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:05,640
With my car, we'd have a water cooler.

680
01:12:05,670 --> 01:12:13,290
What it was, was I would go bug my older colleagues who were like 50 and be like, My heart's going out of my life, you know?

681
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:18,120
Like, right. But I miss those, like, micro connections that we had.

682
01:12:18,480 --> 01:12:22,880
But I also don't like being told I have to be at work for set hours.

683
01:12:22,890 --> 01:12:25,950
I don't have that here. I technique.

684
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:33,470
Well, I technically leave when I want to leaving after this class, but because I have to, you know, go take the dog out.

685
01:12:33,480 --> 01:12:36,629
But if I wasn't, I'd stay here until like 545 today.

686
01:12:36,630 --> 01:12:47,940
I got here at seven. So for me, like an ideal workplace is like a mix of telecommuting and working remote that I dictate myself with no

687
01:12:47,940 --> 01:12:53,340
particular set hours because I know myself well enough that I'll work until the work is done for the day.

688
01:12:54,270 --> 01:13:08,130
Right. And then in terms of like work life balance, the great part is that no one checks up on me and the worst part is no one checks up on me.

689
01:13:09,990 --> 01:13:17,910
So presentence. Right. So, I mean, how many of you would like to be fully remote, fully or nude?

690
01:13:18,210 --> 01:13:21,630
Fully or like. Like a couple days? A hybrid?

691
01:13:21,660 --> 01:13:27,569
Okay. Mostly fully. I think I could do easy. As long as long as I had, like, very firm.

692
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:33,380
Like, I'm not working after 5:00 in a nine in the morning, but, like, don't reach me.

693
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:37,380
You're doing this hours. You've done fully remote before. Yeah.

694
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,310
I mean, you guys are definitely most people, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're into it.

695
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:45,899
Do you like being back in the class? Oh, yeah. I really think that in class.

696
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:52,320
I do feel like with a word, I'm like, I need a reason that I have to go in person.

697
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:58,890
If it's just like, whatever I'm going to be doing on my laptop, I'm like, I could do that from home and I would just rather do that from home.

698
01:13:59,280 --> 01:14:03,800
That's there. I'm not as productive at home. Yeah, that's me.

699
01:14:03,810 --> 01:14:09,270
I get so much more done when I I've been in office for all of them are basically like a studio apartment.

700
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,859
So I have a home office,

701
01:14:10,860 --> 01:14:18,479
I have a whole room dedicated to my work setup and I will walk out of it and reorganize the pantry even though it's already organized.

702
01:14:18,480 --> 01:14:22,770
But I'll think of another way to organize it more efficiently. Distracted Squirrel.

703
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:28,230
When I lived in a co-op like a bunch of us worked remotely and we would all sit down for lunch,

704
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:32,460
but we would take our lunches between the hours, like 1130 in like 230.

705
01:14:32,970 --> 01:14:40,770
So if you weren't careful, you would just sit down at the table and just people keep coming in and you would just like you would not work for 3 hours.

706
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:44,399
Oh, no. Yeah, we work situation.

707
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:53,100
Yeah. Some people also have a higher tolerance to things like I have the misophonia like the I can hear like a pen clicking for a mile away.

708
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:55,229
But then some of my colleagues, Zoom's like,

709
01:14:55,230 --> 01:15:02,670
they'll literally be talking over like they're small children and all of their toys going off, and it's like, the only thing I can hear.

710
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:09,810
Okay, okay. And they can just talk through it. And I'm like, I would lose my mind, but to each their own.

711
01:15:10,830 --> 01:15:13,080
And with that, we will end for today.
