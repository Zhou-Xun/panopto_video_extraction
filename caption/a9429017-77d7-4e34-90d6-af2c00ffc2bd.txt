1
00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:14,310
We took it differently this time because I just actually got out of the class because I would like to do with my life.

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:20,400
And he said, please respond.

3
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,290
All right, everybody, let's get started. I know it's raining out, which only affects attendance.

4
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:37,290
All right. So today we're going to part two of our discussion of substance use will finish

5
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,990
up next week's third to say we're going to primarily talk about measurement.

6
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,520
We're going to do this round with the National Survey on Drug Use and Health,

7
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,320
with some data like actual data that's used to quantify population mental health.

8
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,740
For those of you who are doing projects relative to drug use,

9
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:04,740
this will be a very useful sort of thing to learn more about because you're probably going to either

10
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:10,950
read a lot of papers that use this data or you can even mess around with it yourself or your project.

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,469
Just as a reminder, your check point number three, which is your annotated bibliography, is due by midnight today.

12
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,480
So not before class devices like today. Let me ask about questions about.

13
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:31,000
And a couple of comments asking if, for example, if you could use the some of the citations that I gave you on your concept map.

14
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:39,370
Yes. You should be like, please use those. That's the value to you and the amount of annotation that I'm looking for.

15
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:44,620
Again, what I'm I want I want to know that you read the paper that you're giving me,

16
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:50,650
but I also want to kind of get some understanding or at least ask you to communicate how you're thinking of using this here.

17
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:59,840
So hopefully, you know, this checkpoint is supposed to is meant to help you clarify how your papers have come together.

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,290
On Monday. You have a break.

19
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:16,770
I'm sure we're all ready for it. And then Wednesday, we'll talk about genetics in Alaska.

20
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,100
So just as a reminder, what we talked about on Monday,

21
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:30,380
what makes splitting up disorders distinct is that it's about a common common framework for thinking about behavioral disorders,

22
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,210
behaviors, any motivated activity or pattern activity. That's a purpose or goal.

23
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,659
We talked about how there's this learned response to a behavior or a learned aspect to a behavior which,

24
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,070
you know, sort of anything that's kind of familiar with this idea of behavior.

25
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:54,799
But there's also this underlying drive on that drive underneath the hood is is common across all all types of behaviors,

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,120
whether we're talking about eating behaviors,

27
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:07,169
drug use, you know, meditation, exercise, etc., even sort of once once this thing gets going, there's there's all of these these elements.

28
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,340
And we also talked about,

29
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:18,620
despite the fact that there are we also talked about part of where that learned response comes in is through environmental factors.

30
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,809
And so we talked about the example when the readings for this week is that the soldiers from

31
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:31,100
Vietnam and how many of them had a high proportion had been using heroin on a regular basis.

32
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:40,399
And that to talk about what was very interesting about this is when they once they returned home, it was not a relapse of heroin use.

33
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:48,740
And the argument for why this was the case, despite the fact that these individuals clearly had sort of developed a physiologic drive for this,

34
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,809
is because the environment that is the antecedents to that use had dramatically changed.

35
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:57,500
And so that was a way to kind of disrupt, disrupt this behavior.

36
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:00,920
We also talked about you.

37
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:10,280
What's under the hood, that physiologic drive is that, you know, the things that that again, what they were kind of like was just fundamental.

38
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,790
Aspects of neurobiology and physiology that are at play here.

39
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:18,510
And these have to do with what are we paying attention to?

40
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,780
How do I know if I feel full? How do I know if I am interested in something?

41
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:30,290
How do I form memories of experiences? How do I regulate my emotions?

42
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:40,530
Right. So all of these are things that are. We have a very complete but we have a very good understanding of how these factors relate because they are

43
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,220
acute for substance use and other behavioral disorders because they are largely evolutionarily conserved.

44
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:50,820
That is, we can study in animal models how these different neural circuits interact.

45
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:56,370
I didn't talk about a lot on Monday, but it is also the case and you may have suspected this,

46
00:04:56,850 --> 00:05:00,509
that the stress response system also intersects with a lot of these similar things.

47
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:06,239
So we think about stress like we know that high under stress releases a hormone

48
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,270
called chronic stress in particular releases a hormone called cortisol.

49
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:17,400
Cortisol is a known memory impair when you can't recollect the details of very stressful, traumatic events.

50
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:26,700
We also obviously like emotional processing and conditioning. This is also another way through the amygdala that that the stress is coming in.

51
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:33,660
And so the notion that stress is a which we have we talked about earlier in class,

52
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:37,110
remember back to the trans lecture about sort of like what do we mean by stress

53
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:41,280
and sort of conscious versus unconscious processes that she that she outlined?

54
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:48,360
So that I'm not going to be able to talk about that in detail, but I just want to call attention to that that that's that is still relevant here.

55
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:56,430
And then the last thing I told you about last time was about the, you know,

56
00:05:56,430 --> 00:06:05,730
how we've we have had public health effects to impact behavioral disorders, in this case, community dependance or tobacco use.

57
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,170
And can talk about what it is that disorder or not nicotine dependance is that the you can cure.

58
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:21,180
But the point is that we have had policies that have been able to really move people at the extremes of a behavioral right.

59
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:25,620
In this case, smoking at least a pack of cigarets a day has has dramatically declined since the

60
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:31,050
restrictions and with restrictions and an increased awareness of the harms of tobacco.

61
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:38,340
But there's been almost no change in like cigarets a day.

62
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,680
This is all. And again, we're not going to be able to get into detail in this in this class.

63
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,790
But I just want to kind of.

64
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:57,180
You know, call attention that certainly your generation, that vaping and e-cigs are sort of the new the new sort of challenge to public health.

65
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:07,410
In 2021, the FDA approved the marketing of e-cigarette products for for cessation.

66
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:14,759
That is so but it's that is so there's vaping products that are not FDA approved.

67
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:19,230
And then the some of the tobacco manufacturers and one of them has been successful

68
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:30,479
in getting a vaping approved for again a this e-liquid VUSE so low power

69
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:36,270
unit or whatever this is the one that's been approved to that that is they've

70
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:43,649
decided it's safer than a cigaret and justifies the justifies the FDA approval.

71
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:53,160
But again they also sort of say that it doesn't mean that we consider them safe or FDA approved, even though it's sort of FDA permitted.

72
00:07:53,160 --> 00:08:00,000
Right. It's FDA authorized. So, you know, they're really trying to sort of thread the needle that I don't think most people really understand

73
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:05,100
the difference between these sort of very distinct things that they're they're trying to say.

74
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:13,440
But it kind of, again, just points to the fact that it's, you know, outright bans like we talked about with Ari, I mentioned with prohibition.

75
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,450
Have dramatic failures.

76
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:26,500
We have this new technology of e-cigarettes, and it appears to have some potential benefit for people who are current tobacco users.

77
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:32,440
But it also is very almost certain to have harm for future tobacco users because this appears to be

78
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:38,290
like sort of an entry way that people begin using e-cigarettes and then move to combustible cigarets.

79
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:41,589
And part of the reason for this,

80
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:49,540
for the transition that people make is because the the amount of and we didn't really talk about this either on Monday.

81
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:57,790
But, you know, part of what makes something so reinforcing is that the reward you get from it is not regular.

82
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:04,700
So think about like a slot machine or even your phone. Okay. So if every time you picked up your phone, you had like a tweet or something,

83
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,340
but whatever you're doing, like, I don't I don't participate in any of those things.

84
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,980
But if every time every time you picked it up, you had something, whatever you're looking for when you open up that app.

85
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,469
But after one of them wouldn't feel so good. You know, you might actually not sort of feel the desire to get it.

86
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:28,120
But what is what is most reinforcing is what is irregular. It's only like one out of every six times or one out of every 12 times that you get it.

87
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:32,410
And it's not an irregular time. It's not like Monday. You know, you have you always get this positive thing.

88
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,640
And so in the same way, so that idea that it's there,

89
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,360
so irregular reinforcement and we know this from animal studies is the most

90
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:45,700
reinforcement that is the most effective way to get any animal to become addicted

91
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:55,150
to tobacco or cocaine or like not give it to them every single time they ever give it to them on an on a kind of relatively random reinforce schedule.

92
00:09:55,590 --> 00:10:00,460
It's reinforcement schedule. Well, what does this have to do with e-cigarettes? So the.

93
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:14,190
The content that is like the juice that you put in these e-cigarettes is essentially a wild, wild west of manufacturing.

94
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:18,999
Like there are people just like brew it themselves and like sell it at these vape stores and that people have

95
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,030
done surveys where some of those things it'll say like 10% nicotine or something on it and some of them have 10%.

96
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,640
If it says 10%, some of them have 0%. Some of them have 80% nicotine.

97
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:36,220
Like there's a there's a dramatic variation, even when it's labeled as such, because it's not considered a food.

98
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,909
So FDA doesn't quite regulate it. Right? So it's like you're really put in.

99
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:48,520
You're like, it's it's. But that idea that even if you buy from the same manufacturer, that the amount of nicotine in that can change over time.

100
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:55,160
And you actually know they've done studies, chemical studies of this is not consistent pot for pot or like this.

101
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,930
And I'm sorry for not knowing the right words to describe these things,

102
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:09,009
but that is the and I guess I could I could be generous and say, gosh, they're manufacturing practices are inconsistent.

103
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:18,339
They should fix that. Or it could be less generous and say they know that if they have more irregularity in the amount of nicotine you get,

104
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:24,580
that that will increase the reinforcement of those that vaping products because that's how reinforcement works.

105
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:33,520
The question generous is that because it was by design that there was not exact there wasn't it was not going to be the same amount every time.

106
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:34,510
Okay.

107
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:42,040
So and the last thing I want to say as preamble is just to kind of remind you of why we're talking about drug use in a class, about mental health.

108
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,990
And the reason is because they're strongly interrelated.

109
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:52,059
So the the x axis here is representing the different types of use of any illicit drugs marijuana,

110
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:55,330
opiates, bingeing, alcohol or using cigarets in the past month.

111
00:11:55,810 --> 00:12:00,969
And the three colored bars are representing people with any mental illness.

112
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,770
Aquinas from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health,

113
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:06,280
which are going to mess around with today people with serious mental illness or no mental illness.

114
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,950
And the Y axis here is that is the prevalence. Okay.

115
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:17,800
So what that means is that about 40%, 38.8% of people with any mental illness have used illicit drugs in the past year.

116
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:21,850
Okay. And it's even higher. About 50% of people have a serious mental illness.

117
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,890
You can see this is true for higher use of everything across the board.

118
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:36,130
And so what it means is when we're talking about efforts to help people reduce or stop consumption of drugs,

119
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,280
we have to sort of be understanding this within the broader context of their mental health.

120
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:45,460
They're not the top. It's very rare that somebody is only binge drinking or only cocaine dependent.

121
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:53,079
They rather than they almost certainly have other things going on. And this is illustrating this again,

122
00:12:53,080 --> 00:13:02,020
this is now about any mental illness and substance use disorder that about half of the people who have any substance use disorder,

123
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:07,900
which is about 20 million people in the United States, about half of them also have mental illness.

124
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:20,620
Questions about about that. Okay.

125
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:26,320
So so this is not a real headline.

126
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,190
This is a headline from The Onion, which is a satirical newspaper.

127
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,559
It used to be an actual newspaper. Now it's probably just a website.

128
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,139
But, you know, it's the reason I show this is because there's a lot of sensational headlines.

129
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,219
And certainly as younger people, you may have heard about these sorts of things,

130
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:47,360
this is this is a story about some new street drug called SCRAM, which,

131
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,010
according to moms who previously do not have among actual things to worry about,

132
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,280
a badge can be made from everyday household supplies, such as sugar window cleaner and petroleum junk.

133
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:03,790
So the idea that sort of there's all these, you know, very dangerous illicit drugs out there and, you know, sort of the anxiety that comes with this.

134
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:06,939
And so I put this up to to say, like, this is not what we're going to be talking about.

135
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,140
Most of what we're going to be talking about is know around.

136
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:15,460
I'll show you online sort of what drug use actually looks like in the United States.

137
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,690
And so what's important, I think, I guess just acknowledge that, you know,

138
00:14:22,090 --> 00:14:30,549
you you may have questions about like strange drugs or, you know, like every year is as too much to ask about, like ketamine.

139
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,660
And I'm like, there's nothing to say. There's nothing to say about, like, making sure any data on it.

140
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:45,100
There's not, you know, so few people use it. It's it's not a important contributor to the conversation of population, population, mental health.

141
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,680
But I mean, it's like some things that are.

142
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:56,490
So the first thing to understand is that widespread and I mean, use the word illicit, even though I know this is sort of different,

143
00:14:56,620 --> 00:15:01,690
this is not necessarily the right word anymore or something like this just a few days ago,

144
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:07,779
you know, granting pardons to people in federal to federal conservations for possession,

145
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:13,550
which long story short, the point is, is I'm still going to use this term just for ease of of.

146
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,860
But what I mean by that is basically any substance is not alcohol.

147
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,690
Okay. So that's what I'm going to be are alcohol cigarets. So these are two different cohorts.

148
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:27,099
The baby boom cohort is 46 to 64 just for reference here.

149
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,030
So that so these are the the cohorts that are born before them.

150
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:41,499
And you can see that essentially prior to the 1950s people born in the 1950s, the only things that Americans were doing were alcohol and cigarets.

151
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,620
Right? So that's the white bars here. So that's that's what people were doing.

152
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,060
And then basically starting in the in among people starting in the fifties,

153
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,440
you get about here, 60% of people in that cohort have used marijuana already.

154
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:57,730
You know, I mean, by this point that you see. But again, look at the bar before.

155
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:04,360
So this was a relatively this is a very fast change and widespread use of a substance

156
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:11,530
where we only had about 6% of people born in the thirties that had ever used marijuana,

157
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:17,200
compared to over 50% of what used just just a couple of decades later.

158
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:24,120
What people are using now. And I'm only going to show you data from 2019,

159
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:29,400
because that's the only data that I that's the most recent data that I feel comfortable showing you given the pandemic.

160
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:37,140
So this is the number of new users every year, or at least in 2019, among people each time.

161
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:42,389
So the vast majority of people are using a drugs for the first time or using alcohol for the first time.

162
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:48,690
That's 5 million, and that is marijuana with about three and a half numbers now, now in cannabis.

163
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
I'm going to use those terms interchangeably depending on the slide, but they're referring to the same thing.

164
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:59,190
Then you have this use. So not just not use not this is not a getting a prescription for a pain reliever.

165
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:03,450
This is a misuse specifically of a prescription pain medication.

166
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:06,720
So this is separate from heroin, which is down here.

167
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:14,580
So this is this is OxyContin, this is Percocet, things like that.

168
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:24,600
So and to, you know, to show you sort of how we're going to talk about this more next week, like how big a problem this prescription drug misuse is,

169
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:29,700
is that as many people are starting to use those as are starting to use cigarets every year.

170
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,840
So it's that it's that common misuse with these meds.

171
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,950
Next up, which I researched is like hallucinogens have made a comeback that that was not there before.

172
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,310
But I mean, being in Ann Arbor is maybe I'm not surprised by that.

173
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:48,629
I was surprised to see that. And then this is this tranquillizers in substance.

174
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:54,959
Again, these are prescription drugs. So this is your volume, Xanax, things like this.

175
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,110
And this is like a medication for ADHD.

176
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,860
Great stimulants. Okay.

177
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:09,220
If you used anything in the past year.

178
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:13,080
So about 80% of people use nothing.

179
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:17,549
So 80% of Americans have not used any illicit substance in the past year.

180
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:23,430
I don't know if I should have asked you what number you thought that was going to be, but it's it's not it's only about 20%.

181
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:29,790
And if you did anything, if you use any substance in the past year, it was basically marijuana.

182
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:32,010
Okay. So that's what that this is.

183
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:37,590
And this is why we're not going to talk about things like ketamine and things like that, because that's not what most people do.

184
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:43,259
The vast majority of people are not using anything other than marijuana if they're using anything.

185
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:48,090
And only about 20% of people are using anything. And this is above this is age 12 and older.

186
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:53,220
So obviously, that 20% is higher among younger people.

187
00:18:53,400 --> 00:19:00,110
That number, that 20% is averaged over all ages from 12 to infinity, 100.

188
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:05,550
But so the majority of these users, so the prevalence of use is going to be higher among younger people.

189
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:12,740
This is showing you in some of the longitudinal data that we have,

190
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:17,600
sort of both of those are cross-sectional sort of the ways that people start to use for the first time.

191
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,370
This is this is alcohol, cannabis and cocaine shown here.

192
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:27,019
And first of all, there's a this is also illustrating the gender difference.

193
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,719
So this data is a little bit older, but the same pattern is here.

194
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:37,220
So most people so again, area under the curve is how many people are using so far, more people use alcohol, use cannabis than use cocaine.

195
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,000
The second is that men are more likely to use all three of these substances relative to women.

196
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:53,270
And then the curve for alcohol is peaking a little bit earlier, sort of 18, 19 years old, and then cocaine use again if you're going to try it.

197
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,370
This is by the time if you kind of get through your twenties without trying these things, you're not going to try.

198
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:03,290
That's the thing to kind of understand about this is like the curve doesn't continue to rise over time.

199
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:12,479
This is the type of so this is consistent with that the bad paper I asked you to read this week from bureau to crack.

200
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,890
Right. Because I'm showing you essentially what I just showed you. Right. Or that this is consistent with that finding.

201
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,820
People use alcohol first and they use marijuana, then they use cocaine.

202
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,630
Right. They don't start with cocaine and then go to university and then go to alcohol.

203
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:29,280
But again, the gateway model, which we're going to talk about next week,

204
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:36,389
is predicated that the reason that the order that this looks the way it does is because alcohol causes someone

205
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:42,240
to somehow decide to use cannabis and that cannabis causes someone to somehow be willing to use cocaine.

206
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:51,239
It's assuming a causal relationship. And therefore, if I were to interrupt that, if I were to sort of make the penalties for using marijuana very,

207
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:56,150
very harsh, then people would not use marijuana and therefore they would not use cocaine.

208
00:20:56,340 --> 00:21:03,510
So it is that's the that's the presumption of the gateway model. But that's not how it works, right?

209
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:07,589
So what's it are? We now know? I mean, even even back then, there wasn't great data for it.

210
00:21:07,590 --> 00:21:12,240
But what else could explain why people are using alcohol first, then cannabis, then cocaine?

211
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:23,250
Yeah. Most parents don't have cocaine readily available in a cocaine cabinet.

212
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:27,749
Right. But they might very well have alcohol available in a cocaine habit.

213
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:34,500
And most of your, like, older siblings don't have ready access to cocaine, but they might have ready access to alcohol.

214
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:40,020
Right. Like alcohol. Just a [INAUDIBLE] of a lot easier to get then than these other two substances.

215
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:50,550
And so and then the other notion is that if you are the type of person who is interested in trying cocaine,

216
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:56,100
you are the type you are that type of person, regardless of whether or not you've tried these other things.

217
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,839
These are just sort of more readily available.

218
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:04,020
And so studies, both genetic studies have done to sort of look at like who uses substances versus who doesn't.

219
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,379
But also around like the environment that you're in in terms of what you do have

220
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:13,680
access to have both are both completely consistent with this model or with this data.

221
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:21,450
And they. And what that means is that you can get the sequence of alcohol and then marijuana and

222
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:26,340
that kind of and then cocaine without there being a causal relationship between those.

223
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:27,819
Right. And that's the most important thing.

224
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:33,030
But like when people people want to kind of simplify the world and think that like a cause is because they see it as like that.

225
00:22:33,570 --> 00:22:38,790
There's not good data, but you can still get the same data.

226
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,770
You can still get there's not good evidence for coverage. You could still get the same data without there being a causal relationship.

227
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:55,260
So it's just showing you who uses. And so this this is looking at non-Hispanic whites and not sorry, nice white males and white females.

228
00:22:56,070 --> 00:23:01,350
The x axis here now is the prevalence of use and the y axis is age group.

229
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:09,570
It's a little confusing because the youngest age group is at the top. Okay, so you're up here 18 to 25, 26, 34, 35 to 49 and 50 plus.

230
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:16,280
And so what you can see is that as I just as I mentioned earlier, the younger people are more likely to use using substances.

231
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:23,189
As you can see, the strong kind of it looks like an inverse relationship between age and use of substances.

232
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:28,980
I've just put this vertical line at 20% just to kind of give you a way to eyeball what you're looking at here.

233
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:38,220
So what that means is about 40% of non-Hispanic white men have used cannabis in the past year.

234
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,900
Right. That's where those dots are. And about 20% of white women have used cannabis.

235
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:51,180
And in the past year, this is now looking at past year cannabis use just among men.

236
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:55,260
And this is this is because men are far more likely to use all substances relative to women.

237
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:03,780
And what you can see here is that there are not there are non-Hispanic whites and Hispanic black men are

238
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:10,140
more likely to have used cannabis in the past year relative to non-Hispanic relative to Hispanic men.

239
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:15,120
All right. So again, this verse vertical line is just for eyeballing, because I know it's kind of hard to see.

240
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,570
So about 40% of white men I showed you that already,

241
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:25,470
about 40% of black men and then about just closer to 30% of Hispanic men have use cannabis in the past year.

242
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:36,280
This past year, prescription opioids. Again, this is true misuse of these prescription opioids.

243
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:45,100
White men are more likely to have misused these opioids in the past year relative to Hispanic and black men.

244
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:50,080
This is consistent with what we've seen in mortality during the opioid epidemic.

245
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:58,750
This has been concentrated among white Americans. That is changing currently the way that the epidemic has unfolded over the last 20 years,

246
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:07,600
that this is white men are the group that has targeted far, far disproportionately relative to any other in the United States from overdoses.

247
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:14,030
So just in terms of description of descriptive epidemiology,

248
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,770
women are more likely to use pretty much everything that we are going to talk about in the next couple of weeks.

249
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:24,890
The use of both licit and illicit substances varies by race. I didn't show you a lot of data on this,

250
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:33,980
but just believe me that non-Hispanic whites are more likely to use most illicit and illicit substances relative to Latinos,

251
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,690
African-Americans and Asian-Americans.

252
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,430
There is a higher prevalence of tobacco and alcohol use among Native American Alaska Native populations relative to these other groups,

253
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,739
which is important to understand.

254
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:52,010
But it's also it's harder to make those comparisons because that group is so much smaller relative to the rest of these groups.

255
00:25:52,010 --> 00:26:01,249
And so our estimates are much more unstable. Drug uses and particularly opportunities for use, is patterned by place and varies over time.

256
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:04,410
And we're going to talk about this next week on issues around the world versus

257
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,880
urban differences have been very important in terms of the opioid epidemic.

258
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:14,030
So let me pause. There are questions about kind of general descriptive, everything else.

259
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:19,760
You do know why you're more likely to look after certain agent?

260
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:28,860
You're less likely to use substances. Yeah, it's it's kind of it's a developmental thing, you know.

261
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:39,020
So there's all sorts of risky behavior, kind of, you know, I'm sure if we if we looked at, like, desire for HIV,

262
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:44,900
it would probably show a similar, like h h kind of distribution where this is like a younger type of thing.

263
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:54,020
There's also sort of the peer influence, like most people get access to their substances if they're going to get through somebody they know,

264
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,200
they don't they don't buy it from a stranger. They get it from somebody, you know.

265
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:01,069
And so the types of environments that young people are in, right,

266
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:07,760
like there oftentimes I was when I worked at McDonald's, that's where everybody got their drugs was from, like our cooks.

267
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,940
Right. It was also also drugs, one of our cooks anyway.

268
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:17,299
So it's like, you know, there was there was a there's different opportunities, right?

269
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:21,830
Because you're in that kind of workplace. Whereas like, I mean, there might be people who sell drugs here at University of Michigan,

270
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:25,909
but like, I don't know, you know, it was it was like that other workplace.

271
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:36,620
It was very obvious. The other thing I would say is that in terms of, you know, we know that there.

272
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:42,190
Sort of an interest in trying new things, having new experiences like that.

273
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:49,239
Is it those those types of things are strongly correlated with this is just trying to drive this is not dependent on the drug,

274
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,559
etc. In fact, dependance on any of these substances just increases with age.

275
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:58,270
The longer that you use the substances, the more likely you are to become dependent no matter when you start.

276
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:04,060
But if you're the type of person who's going to try cocaine, you're going to try it sort of.

277
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,350
You're not going to wait until you're established in your career to try it.

278
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:11,860
You're going to try it the first time and one of the first times you get access to try it.

279
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:20,260
So it's sort of like if there are some people who even if it was like in a in a punch bowl at a party, would never try it.

280
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:28,270
They would just never tried it. Right. And so it's separating out those sorts of person are personal kind of traits from also

281
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:34,670
the thing like where do you get environments where there's access to these things you.

282
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:45,280
The questions. Okay.

283
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:51,180
So let's talk a little bit about what contributes to why some would use a substance.

284
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:55,809
The three things that people weren't going to be able to talk about all these, which are about perceptions of harm primarily,

285
00:28:55,810 --> 00:29:00,219
but certainly availability, which was a little bit about already the cost of the substance.

286
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:06,730
We're going to talk about a lot. We talking about cocaine next week because looking at and still to this day, but especially at the time,

287
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,300
was a very, very, very expensive drugs, one that was prohibitively expensive.

288
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:16,450
All right. And the perception of that is the likelihood that you're going to you're going to be harmed by using this substance.

289
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:23,480
So this is perceived availability. I love this graph because I just feel like it's it's okay.

290
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:30,400
I can I believe this data, but I'm always just shocked of like who are these 17 year olds who think that it would be like

291
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,340
at least 15% of 12 to 17 year olds who think it would be like very easy for them to get help?

292
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,419
And I'm I didn't even notice. Like, I'm a ten year old. I'm like, what do you know what heroin is?

293
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:46,630
What do you feel? So, so but you can see that like people at least think that they might want to say that even among kids.

294
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:52,359
Okay, and we can again, this is their percent that they feel like it would be very easy to obtain.

295
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,400
It doesn't mean it actually is very easy to obtain.

296
00:29:55,750 --> 00:30:03,460
This graph is kind of shocking and but I guess it both shows like the the the power of public health messaging

297
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,889
but also sort of like perhaps we have gone perhaps we haven't gone hard enough on some other things.

298
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,280
So this is that perception again, of this 12 and older.

299
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:17,379
So not not just the idea of with great risk.

300
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:20,620
That is what if this imagine the way they're asking this question.

301
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:31,340
To what degree do you agree that smoking marijuana at least once a month is highly like a greatly risky thing to do compared to a moderate risk?

302
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:36,950
And risk is like not defined. So it's not like am I going to become dependent on it?

303
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:41,840
I feel like it's not like it's not like there's some outcome that they're asking this in context of.

304
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,270
They're just like, is this a risky thing to do or not a risky thing to do?

305
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,220
And so what I'm showing you here is the percent of people who think this is a greatly risky thing for them to do.

306
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,259
So the first is with marijuana.

307
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:57,110
So only about and this is older data you're talking about like this looks like nowadays but started the top of marijuana.

308
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:02,840
So only about 20 a quarter of people think that smoking marijuana once a month is a greatly risky thing to do.

309
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:09,620
And you can compare that to about 70% of people thinking using cocaine once a month is a greatly risky thing to do.

310
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,900
Try heroin once or twice, but 83% of people think that's a greatly risky thing to do.

311
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:24,589
Trying LSD once or twice, 70%, 60 to 70% even compare that to binge drinking once or twice a week.

312
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:27,380
Only 40% of people think that's a greatly risky thing to do.

313
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:37,880
And smoking one or more packs of cigarets a day which is perceived to be more risky than trying LSD once or twice and using cocaine once a month.

314
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:41,750
Right. So it's kind of giving you a sense of like where people, if they're like a raging,

315
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:48,229
where are these risks are we've done a great job of convincing people that heavy smoking is a very risky thing to do.

316
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:55,390
But we haven't necessarily talked to people about these where these other substances are going on there.

317
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,620
This is more recent data. This is from 2015 or 2019. Again, what is it?

318
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:06,740
Very what do you perceive as a great risk? So smoking marijuana now this this is a different metric such as once or twice a week, not once a month.

319
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,700
Only 15% of young people your age think that is a really risky thing to do.

320
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:20,540
So 15% you're 82% of your age group think that using cocaine once or twice a week is a greatly risky thing to do.

321
00:32:21,470 --> 00:32:25,370
93 Think that it's using heroin once or twice a week is greatly risky.

322
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:32,090
Two thirds think that having alcohol to use nearly every day is risky.

323
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,240
And again, this higher proportion think that you smoked one or more packs of cigarets a day is greatly risky.

324
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:46,130
So it's it's important to kind of this this is where our public health messaging can kind of shape like risk perceptions.

325
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:53,030
The reason we care about risk perceptions is not because your opinion matters, but that your opinion is correlated with your behaviors.

326
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:57,140
Now we have to give that is something to show you this before I give the caveat.

327
00:32:57,710 --> 00:33:01,370
So the the y axis, the percent that have done this in the past month.

328
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:08,030
So if you think that binge drinking is a very risky thing to do, only 5% of people have binge drink in the past month.

329
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,530
If you don't think it's a risky thing to do, you are twice as likely to binge drink in the past month.

330
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:21,799
If you think using marijuana is very risky, only about 1% of people think it's risky and do it versus people who don't think there's much risk.

331
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:28,430
About 10% of people do it. So this might suggest that if you start thinking something is highly risky, then you won't do it.

332
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:32,120
What's the other way to think about these data?

333
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:47,380
It also could explain why this graph works this way. I'm suggesting this looks that you think something is risky, therefore you don't do it,

334
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:52,330
or the other way that you think of it is you think something is not risky and therefore you do it.

335
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,400
What's the other way to think about it? Yeah. If you've tried it and nothing that happened, then.

336
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:03,900
You're more likely think it's how you did it. You didn't die. Therefore, you don't think it's less risky.

337
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:09,560
You don't think it's risky. And this is particularly true when we think about like where people get substances from.

338
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:13,560
So when people get their first substance, like we're talking about prescription opioids,

339
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:17,550
they're almost always getting it from somebody who does not engage in a problematic use.

340
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:24,450
Because if you are dependent on prescription opioids, the last thing you're doing is giving people your opioids because you need them.

341
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:31,800
So you're getting your opioid from somebody who it does not appear to be experiencing any bad side effects from their use.

342
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:42,290
And so the you know, you see non problem or you see what person what you think is non problematic misuse or use, you engage in it.

343
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,360
You yourself don't dare lie to me.

344
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:52,070
They told me I was going to be addicted forever, you know. So like you get this like bad messaging and then the messaging isn't quite, you know,

345
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:58,120
doesn't match with your experience and then therefore you readjust your own risk perception, right?

346
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:06,340
Good. This is I show you this to give you an illustration of the type of graph you should not make.

347
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:10,540
So. And this. So this here.

348
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:16,360
White pie. So that the skills are literally the opposite.

349
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,830
The colors are literally the opposite.

350
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:26,830
So in this in this graph, white states have a much higher percentage of people who think using marijuana is a very risky thing to do.

351
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:32,620
Okay. So red states are states where most of the people think it's not a risky thing to do.

352
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:39,220
Okay. So and then over here, this is red states are states where there's a lot more people using cannabis.

353
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:43,600
So you see that the inverse, right? So or rather.

354
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:51,550
So in Colorado, most people do not think that marijuana smoking marijuana regularly is a greatly risky thing to do.

355
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,270
And surprise, surprise, a higher percentage of people in Colorado smoke.

356
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:59,679
Right. Again, illustrating the sort of positive feedback relationship,

357
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:06,010
but also that it's not just that perceptions lead to behaviors, but that behaviors lead to perceptions of this.

358
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:11,850
And both of those things are true. This changing.

359
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:17,190
This is not going to be surprising. But just to kind of give you a sense as to where things are, where things were,

360
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:22,730
so your age group, again, this this right here, this yellow bar in 2002.

361
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:31,330
So Beyonce, age 20, is, you know, about 25% of people thought that was a really risky thing to do in 2002.

362
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:36,450
That number is now less than 20% today. And that's that decline has been.

363
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:43,500
So your age group always thought it was a less risky thing to do, but that decline in perceived risk has has tracked over time.

364
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:57,460
This is just showing you about marijuana laws here where in Michigan where a few years ago we had, you know, allowing for recreational use.

365
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:03,430
You know, I think this is it's it's interesting to see this happening.

366
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:08,160
I guess I'll pause, lecture and insert my opinion.

367
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:11,920
I, I myself had a really difficult time deciding how to vote on this.

368
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:16,180
And the reason for that is, at the time we were voting, we were also voting for a governor.

369
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:21,400
And so we didn't know sort of where if this passed, the governor was going to be.

370
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:26,290
Because in my mind, this conversation, while useful,

371
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:30,729
has not yet fully engaged with the restorative justice movement because there's

372
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,880
a lot of people who are still in jail for things that are now not illegal. In our state.

373
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:38,440
And and that is, you know.

374
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:47,450
A huge problem and is not rectify it. So while it's good that we're not putting more people in jail for marijuana use,

375
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:57,080
that this movement sort of it's feels like it's leaving groups behind that have been disproportionately harmed by hurt by this.

376
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:02,299
And I also I just saw just a couple I think it was last year that it was either Alabama and Mississippi and I'm sorry,

377
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,750
I don't know which one, but one of them also just legalized. I was like, what?

378
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:08,810
Really? Even though. Yeah. So it's like, I think started.

379
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:14,210
They see the money on the wall in terms of like money that is being spent in the justice system,

380
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:20,120
our criminal justice system, the people who are incarcerated, but also the money to be made and taxpayers out.

381
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:30,050
Okay. Um, last few things I want to tell you about in terms of use are like, what are people using the first time?

382
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:34,519
This is data from a decade ago. And I'll show you some more recent data in a minute.

383
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:40,970
But most people, if they try an illicit drug, are trying marijuana, but pain relievers are coming up.

384
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:47,959
This is the fact that almost 20% of people a decade ago, that was their first illicit drug to try.

385
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:55,610
This is kind of shocking. But again, you can kind of see that these other these other substances, like things like cocaine and sedatives and heroin,

386
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:01,790
like these are not what people are trying first, which again, is it's not surprising, but it just kind of showing you again.

387
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:13,470
Okay. So we didn't talk a lot about alcohol, but it's important to just note that it is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States.

388
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,580
Marijuana is the most commonly used drug. And let's go to one.

389
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:23,040
We'll talk about this next week when we talk about the National Drug Abuse Act of America.

390
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:27,570
But it's the most commonly used one drug.

391
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:32,320
Drug use varies over time and place. And again, we talked about this positive feedback between perceptions.

392
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,890
So questions here for we're going to go into measurement.

393
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,090
You know, everybody wants to talk about drugs today. Oh, yeah.

394
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,940
I want to know, what was your like if you were ranking the receivers of the drugs?

395
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:01,730
Did you have to ask for your list? Yeah.

396
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,960
How would I? So how would I have arranged?

397
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:13,200
So this is a great question because it sort of depends on like what most matters is like in reference to what outcome.

398
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:23,160
So the most harm that, you know, it is clear that smoking is very harmful for you.

399
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:28,380
Right. There's there's no benefit to smoking. There are.

400
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:32,969
So this is this is clearly very harmful. Alcohol is also very, very harmful.

401
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:38,510
And these two substances together cause more harm than anything else on here, really,

402
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:48,120
in terms of like life, years lost, etc., something like marijuana is less likely to develop dependency.

403
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:52,259
So it is people are less likely to develop physiologic dependance on cannabis.

404
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,890
This is like a this is a fact. It is.

405
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:02,400
However, especially use of cannabis early in adulthood is associated risk of psychosis.

406
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:06,990
So and we don't have a cure for schizophrenia or other forms of things.

407
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:13,460
So even though that. It is not the case that we should be incarcerated people for marijuana use.

408
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:20,870
It's also not we shouldn't be presenting it as though it's a drug that is has no harms and the medical benefits of marijuana.

409
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,660
Most of those have never been tested. The randomized controlled trials in the same way that like the benefits of like

410
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:29,120
your melatonin that you might take or any other herbs that you might take.

411
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:34,940
Like none of that. Almost none of that has ever been tested in trials because none of those are approved by the FDA.

412
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:40,000
Like when it says like these claims have not been evaluated. That's literally what it means.

413
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:44,010
They can just say it and then they put that little label on it and then they're absolved of everything.

414
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:50,520
So, you know, there's a lot of there's a lot of claims that are happening around like benefits,

415
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:55,709
especially around cannabis, that frankly just don't pay out. Like, I don't even like the CBD stuff is all trash.

416
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:59,130
Like, not like it's a waste of your money. If you're, if you're spending money on that.

417
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,190
The risk of of overdose with prescription opioids is just really substantial.

418
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:11,860
And it's in part because it's so hard to know what you're getting into.

419
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:15,100
Like, it's really dangerous to know. And so it's.

420
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:21,909
The and accidental overdoses are now potentially the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.

421
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:27,850
And that is that is shocking. That was even at the height of cocaine use in the United States in the seventies and eighties.

422
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,610
It was it didn't bring it to the top ten. So. You know.

423
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:39,720
I think those those are sort of if I were to agree, I would I would say so.

424
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:45,510
And the last thing I'll say is that the risk of dependency so it actually develop physiologic dependance is greatest for nicotine.

425
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:49,430
This is this is as bad as it gets. And next is obvious.

426
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:54,690
So those are the two substances that I would if in terms of the outcome is

427
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,030
developing a dependency and not being able to stop using when you want to stop.

428
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:05,610
Those are the two that I would say are the most harmful. Alcohol also has a high dependency ratio, but it doesn't.

429
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,120
People don't usually get dependance until they reduce it for 2 to 3 decades.

430
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,770
So there's a lot more opportunity to intervene on this versus tobacco.

431
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,110
This is what I mean.

432
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:21,690
If you if you ask people who are current smokers today, almost all of them started when they were teenagers because of dependance.

433
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:26,220
It starts very quickly in their life and it's similar with opiates.

434
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:34,290
Like the more you use, the more likely or not dependance. Yeah, I had a question.

435
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:41,070
Yeah, I guess like what's the role of public health in terms like messaging about these substances,

436
00:43:41,850 --> 00:43:46,530
especially since you're saying like there's that disconnect between sort of justice.

437
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:55,840
Yeah. I mean, I'm it's so we, you know, are not the current surgeon general, but our previous surgeon general.

438
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:00,160
His brother was in prison for opiates. For selling opiates.

439
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:07,560
And, um. It was such a missed opportunity because he he rather to me I say missed opportunity.

440
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:22,100
The sense of this is surgeon general speak about the harms of criminalizing what is in part a medical problem that is,

441
00:44:22,110 --> 00:44:26,490
you know, here it is also a social problem and it's also an economic problem. Like it's not just a medical problem.

442
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:37,440
What we're looking at here, it's all these other elements. And and he, the surgeon general, basically said, like, look, it's my brother broke the law.

443
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:43,890
You should be in jail. You know, like that was like the end of what he thought he said about it, which is which is, I think, a missed opportunity.

444
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:52,590
I mean, there's no like I'm in the Department of Epidemiology here, and, you know, there's nobody in my department to study substance use.

445
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:57,620
Like I'm as close as it gets. And I don't really consider myself to be substance abuse researcher.

446
00:44:57,620 --> 00:45:02,389
And I think it has really been. There are people in the school, public health who study but not in epidemiology.

447
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:08,270
And so it has been carved out in a way that is problematic.

448
00:45:08,630 --> 00:45:18,200
And the I think the other piece of this is that we we need to have, um.

449
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:28,620
I listen to a podcast called Leaders Phase and I'm going to go listen to this is an interesting podcast about sort of like anti fat bias, you know,

450
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,780
and sort of like how that operates and like public health messaging around obesity and how this

451
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:38,420
is basically like stigmatized people who are obese rather than like in the name of helping them,

452
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:43,250
you know? And I think that there's also things around like stigmatizing tobacco users or stigmatizing

453
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:47,720
people who binge drink or stigmatizing people who use drugs as a means of like helping them.

454
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:55,940
And it's like that doesn't help them like that. It just makes them feel that they cannot admit or they can't seek help.

455
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:00,739
And we also don't. Yeah. I mean, I'll send an article.

456
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:04,700
I just I finished reading it this morning that Kaiser Health put out.

457
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:05,629
You know,

458
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:11,510
the hospitals like don't have like not only are there not medical schools that we learned about on Monday that have people trained in addiction,

459
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:16,760
like, you know, you went to the hospital and talk to your your primary, your doctor about addiction.

460
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:20,659
Like they wouldn't have much to say. They don't have training and they don't have specialization.

461
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:30,980
And so. We kind of and I guess not less I'll say it in terms of editorializing here is that public health is generally been like.

462
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:37,490
Silent on it. And that's that's with the exception of tobacco and.

463
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:48,310
I don't I guess I don't quite understand why, other than my people are trained in it.

464
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:59,160
All right. So let's talk about how we measure this stuff. So there are lots of different ways that we can measure drug use.

465
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:05,900
We're going to work today on a survey, but there are other ways that you can measure how much drugs are being consumed in the United States.

466
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,450
You can do urine, drug testing. This is required of anybody if you're ever arrested.

467
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:14,530
But people have even done this in like regular sewage water.

468
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:17,150
Like, you know, you've seen them like Tobin testing, too,

469
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:22,380
like in the sewage water to see where there's cocaine outbreaks like you can do that too of of drugs and figure out,

470
00:47:22,390 --> 00:47:26,230
you know, sort of the prevalence of drug use in a population.

471
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:28,760
You can look at prescription records.

472
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:37,210
This is especially helpful with the prescription drug issues, obviously, emergency room admissions, mortality records and then drug seizure records.

473
00:47:37,570 --> 00:47:44,210
But the reason I put this up here, so the CDC has a way to get notified if there's like an outbreak of plague or,

474
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:49,810
you know, obviously COVID we all know about like states having to report to prove it. But there's nothing like this for drugs.

475
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:53,320
There's no there's no requirement for reporting in this way.

476
00:47:55,650 --> 00:48:02,730
So what's important, though, if you're you know, so we're talking about surveys, that is I'm asking to ask somebody about their drug use.

477
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:09,149
We have to really, really sort of think carefully about how we're going to ask them what about their drug use?

478
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:16,950
Because the mode of interview has a dramatic impact on the likelihood that someone will tell you the truth about the drugs drug use.

479
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:20,940
And so you can imagine there's there's several different ways we could do this. I could talk to you in person.

480
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:25,200
I could leave you a pencil and paper questionnaire and have you fill it out.

481
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:31,769
I could call you on the phone. And the gold standard. And what is used in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health is called a computer

482
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:35,219
assisted personal interview or audio computer assisted personal interview.

483
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:41,340
This is either Cappie or a you'll see both languages, both acronyms used in the in the literature.

484
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:48,030
And what an ACASTI is, is I come to your house, I bring you a laptop, I sit you in front of it, I put headphones on.

485
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:54,240
You and I go in the corner and read a magazine and you, the computer reads the questions to you and you do.

486
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,200
You have like a touch screen. You touch the answers to the questions.

487
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:03,030
But the interviewer doesn't is not asking the questions. The computer is asking the questions.

488
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:14,070
The respondent is able to do it in a private setting in their home and know and the reason

489
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:20,790
that we do it that way is because why would you tell a stranger about your illicit drug use?

490
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:25,290
Right? Like what? What do you have to gain? So this is a this is an old paper,

491
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:31,470
but it illustrates this this phenomenon that we that is known to be true and that this is why the mode of interview matters.

492
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:36,960
So the x axis here is I'm asking you about the type.

493
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:42,899
When's the last time you used a truck? So the first down here is have you ever used that drug?

494
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:47,010
And I'm going to ask you about three drugs. Have you ever used alcohol? Have you ever used marijuana?

495
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:53,700
And have you ever used cocaine? Okay. Ever used that have been used in the past year and have used them in the past month?

496
00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:00,630
Okay. So I'm asking everybody three different questions and then are three three different substances, three different questions.

497
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:10,170
The Y axis here, half the people in the study got randomized to fill it out like a pen or people kind of paper by themselves.

498
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:19,650
And half of them got randomized that I was going to ask them in person. Okay, and the Y axis is the ratio of the prevalence of, say, yes,

499
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:26,940
I've ever used cocaine or I've ever used marijuana in the pen and pencil to the interviewer.

500
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,799
So the in-person interview,

501
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:37,560
so values greater than one mean that people are more willing to to tell you about their drug use on the pen and pencil than they are in person.

502
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:45,660
Okay. So any value greater than one means that people tell you disclose more drug use on the pen and pencil,

503
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,360
more private version than they do on the interviewer administered more public version.

504
00:50:50,370 --> 00:50:56,040
So neither of these podcasts that I just told you about this is but this is this is setting the stage for why we have to do the acasti.

505
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:02,430
Okay. So the first is over here on every use. So almost all of these are centered right around one.

506
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:07,680
So when it comes to have you ever use cocaine, you can ask somebody to their face and they'll tell you the truth.

507
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:11,430
You can ask somebody on a pen or pencil won't tell you the truth. That makes no difference. Okay.

508
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,860
Have you used in the past year? So for alcohol it makes no difference.

509
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:19,110
You are somebody. Have you ever have used alcohol in the past year?

510
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:23,040
It doesn't matter if I ask you to your face or kind of pencil, you tell me about the same answer.

511
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:29,720
For marijuana. You tell me about more marijuana use and the pen and pencil than you do face to face.

512
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:33,940
So indicate if you find this a little bit more threatening, even though it's still not current.

513
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,380
Right. You find this a little bit more threatening to reveal to a person face to face and you really much higher.

514
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:44,720
Right. This is about 60%. Tell me about 60% more drug use kind of pencil than face to face.

515
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:50,770
Now I'm in the most frightening time. Okay. Like past month, alcohol again, almost no difference.

516
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:57,529
People telling you how to drink marijuana again, much more likely to tell me about that on a pen or pencil versus in person.

517
00:51:57,530 --> 00:52:02,840
And cocaine, it's two and a half times greater that you'll tell me about it on pen and pencil than in person.

518
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:08,390
Okay. So this is a mode of interview effect that you need to.

519
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:15,830
And what this means is that we have to ask people about these sensitive topics in a way that reflects the fact that they're sensitive.

520
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:19,430
And so that means they need more privacy, more confidentiality, etc.

521
00:52:20,930 --> 00:52:27,829
So how do we do that? Well, the first is that every time somebody asks about the national survey on drug use and health,

522
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:32,540
and I do this for all of my surveys, too, I get what's called a certificate of confidentiality from NIH.

523
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:37,100
And what that does is it literally protects my data from subpoena.

524
00:52:38,450 --> 00:52:41,550
Why would anybody want to subpoena three drinks?

525
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:47,900
Why does somebody want to subpoena that data? Yeah, some of the guys are illegal to use.

526
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,980
Yes, some drugs are illegal to use. And who might who might want this to to issue?

527
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:58,070
Who might want to know that information? The justice system that could make her out outside the justice system.

528
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:03,170
Maybe you're going through a divorce in your spouse. You're having, like an issue with, like, child support or custody rights or like.

529
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:07,700
But your partner knows that you weren't in the survey and they know they have what they asked you about.

530
00:53:08,270 --> 00:53:13,940
So it protects you from subpoenas. So that's the first thing. And then the second thing is that we preserve anonymity of respondents.

531
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,059
And so all the data that you're going to mess with today is just cross-sectional,

532
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,120
because we can't follow people over time if we don't know their name.

533
00:53:21,890 --> 00:53:25,850
So you're going to use the national staff for a survey of health and a few minutes.

534
00:53:25,850 --> 00:53:30,320
But before I before we do, I'm going to give you some other tips about it.

535
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,320
But let me tell you about it first, and then we're going to get into it in a second.

536
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:42,020
So this is an annual cross-sectional survey of about 70,000 people aged 12, plus an investment in the survey.

537
00:53:43,190 --> 00:53:50,420
If they ever come back and say, yes, it is, pay it forward. It's been in the field since it originally filled in 1971.

538
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:56,050
This is essentially that the dipstick for how we measure how much drug use there is in the United States.

539
00:53:56,060 --> 00:54:02,840
This is it. This is this. This is like the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey or needs for drugs.

540
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:08,740
I told you about the anonymity. So this is the recruitment letter.

541
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:12,100
This is literally what you would get sent in the mail if you were chosen for the study.

542
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:18,200
It says you've you've been randomly chosen for, in this case, the 2012 survey on drug use and health.

543
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:27,080
You can't identify you through any information you give. So immediately at the very top, you know, this is you are going to I cannot identify you.

544
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:33,380
Your name and address would never be connected to your answers. Federal law requires we keep all your answers confidential.

545
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:41,470
That's the certificate of confidentiality I just told you about. You get 30 bucks back that in 2012 to be part of it.

546
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,540
So it's just kind of, again, showing you that at the very beginning,

547
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:52,879
they know this is a sensitive topic and so they're letting people know that they're going to protect their confidentiality.

548
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,520
At the very beginning, even before the testimony, sensitive questions,

549
00:54:55,520 --> 00:55:03,620
just to try to recruit to the extent the key strengths of the National Survey on drug use and health

550
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:09,079
surveys like it is that we can ask you a lot of questions about your drug use when you first use,

551
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:17,479
how long you've been using, how often do you use? It's probably the best way to measure a drug that hasn't come to the attention our drug use,

552
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,290
that hasn't come to the attention of some sort of sentinel. So like health care system, right?

553
00:55:21,290 --> 00:55:26,149
So if you've had an overdose, you might show up in an emergency department, but I can measure it through that way.

554
00:55:26,150 --> 00:55:30,070
But if you have not had an overdose and you're misusing an opioid, I have no way to know that.

555
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,480
Right? Like, there's no other way for me to really measure that.

556
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:40,940
The limitations are that there's going to be potentially unintentional underreporting so that we might think about that as social desirability.

557
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:47,599
I just showed you that with that those line graphs, there's also unintentional under-reporting.

558
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:54,730
So if you are binge drinking on the regular, you probably can't actually accurately remember how much you've been drinking, right?

559
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:01,390
So like alcohol impairs your memory. So there's unintentional underreporting.

560
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:07,279
You will miss people who have passed, right? So if you've had an overdose, you should make it.

561
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,200
And you're not going to be able to be in my survey and this is a household survey.

562
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:20,179
So if you are not at home as as in are you in jail or prison or a rehabilitation facility, you are not going to be in the survey.

563
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:25,660
So this is going to under-report. Underreport underreporting and underreporting.

564
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,660
So we know the direction at all of these things.

565
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:36,700
We know that the National Survey on Drug Use and Health is the most conservative estimate we could get for how much drug use there is.

566
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:41,060
We know that because of these the ways that these operate.

567
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,640
I guess this is what the they do. We're not going to.

568
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:49,300
We're not going to. You can go to this website and see an example of this.

569
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:53,410
I showed you this is again at it's confidential.

570
00:56:53,980 --> 00:57:00,160
The questions are read the same way to every respondent. And it's also important that this is now appropriate for low literacy populations,

571
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:03,250
because you might think, well, why don't I just mail the survey and they can mail it back?

572
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:11,170
Well, people have to be able to read all your questions. And people might have lower literacy rate or they might not know exactly what you mean.

573
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:17,090
For example, how how many drinks have you had in the past week?

574
00:57:17,110 --> 00:57:20,830
So just think about that question. I don't even answer that question, but think about that. How many drinks if you hadn't tested?

575
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:25,800
What's the first? Thing that you're trying to figure out in your mind.

576
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,490
I mean, what's one of the things you're trying to figure out in your mind? Yeah.

577
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:33,940
Like what constitutes wondering what constitutes a drink?

578
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:38,739
Okay, so because your drink might not be the same as what I mean, as a drink, right?

579
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:45,600
So you might. I might. So here I tell the respondent I'm asking about a 12 fluid ounce can of beer.

580
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:50,650
I'm not asking about your heritage specialty.

581
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:55,710
14% alcohol, beer or that you had a pint of. Right. That is two of these at least.

582
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,080
Right.

583
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:03,670
So it's you are you literally give when I ask people about their alcohol use, I literally give them this card and I'm like, this is what I mean.

584
00:58:03,790 --> 00:58:09,729
So now spend some time looking at this. This is not like one of these like comical giant wine glasses.

585
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:12,670
I mean, this wine glass, five ounces of wine, right? That's what I mean.

586
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:20,830
So now tell me how many drinks if you haven't asked me to orient the respondent, because the definition of a drink.

587
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:23,960
What I mean by that. What you mean by that. I'm not necessarily.

588
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:33,309
And then we also have things like that we do here to to improve the accuracy of self-report data.

589
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:36,610
So read these questions and let me know if you know what you notice about them.

590
00:58:38,410 --> 00:59:01,809
And it stands out to. Like.

591
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:06,370
So there's the distinction between a whole cigaret and that is just marijuana.

592
00:59:07,350 --> 00:59:10,440
So it's like there's different measurements in homes.

593
00:59:11,070 --> 00:59:24,110
Yeah. Good. Yeah. You like all the things in this country.

594
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:35,840
Even like some of the jargon that. Any work unusual in that you don't recognize?

595
00:59:48,110 --> 00:59:52,760
Germans just don't do dirt. Cool.

596
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,470
So. So the reason. All right, so what is.

597
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:04,250
So the reason you've never heard of dirt or song or DBE or dirt or dirt is because this is not a real track.

598
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:11,290
So remember. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health is administered to 12 and.

599
01:00:12,460 --> 01:00:21,670
I don't know how many like pre-teen or teenage people you have in your life, but like if you were asked to fill out a big survey like this,

600
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:27,880
what's the likelihood that you would just kind of like circles see for everything, you know what I mean?

601
01:00:28,150 --> 01:00:32,380
Just to kind of like just have some fun with it, be like I use heroin every day.

602
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,960
That's what I do. This is hilarious, honestly.

603
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:41,200
Okay, so what they're trying to do is identify those kids because you can't say like, hey, take this seriously.

604
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,830
Right. Because then that's going to make them fill out. Yes. I use it every day.

605
01:00:45,220 --> 01:00:48,490
So. And this is not what you use today. This is not the answer.

606
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:51,910
But there's a there is a drug somewhere in the national survey on drug use.

607
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:55,270
Now that was asked about that is not dirt, but is a drug that does not exist.

608
01:00:55,750 --> 01:01:03,030
And if you as a respondent tell me anything other than zero times for often you use that drug,

609
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:06,970
I know that I shouldn't trust any of your data because you didn't take this seriously.

610
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:14,020
So there is no risk. This is more common again for younger people of overreporting because they think it's funny.

611
01:01:14,290 --> 01:01:21,550
Okay. So so this is we talk about, you know, and again, you don't tell the respondent that one of these drugs is not a real drug.

612
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:26,739
You just give them this question. And again, you know that logically the answer should be zero.

613
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:31,990
I've never done dirt and not seven or more times.

614
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:38,530
Right. Okay. So again, just to summarize, there's lots of ways that we measure drug use.

615
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:43,059
Surveys are the best data we have to measure drug use.

616
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:48,310
That has not come to the attention of a Sentinel agent that is a health care organization or criminal justice system.

617
01:01:48,790 --> 01:01:56,650
And confidentiality is critical to getting accurate much more, even more than thing you asking about things like depression or anxiety.

618
01:01:56,680 --> 01:02:01,690
Like confidentiality is key. You've got to have trust from the respondent. I'm not going to tell you about their drug use.

619
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:11,020
So speaking of drug use, so here we are going to we have a new class activity as opposed to these two.

620
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:15,370
So this is on canvas, but I pretty much have it.

621
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:25,400
You mean there's going to be an assignment? You Scotsman, so you can get to this on campus.

622
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:30,920
You're going to go to this website, the National Survey of Drug Use Analysis.

623
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:35,450
And all these instructions are on that that I know I'm passing out to you.

624
01:02:37,070 --> 01:02:43,340
And you're actually going to go to this analyze pass data online here.

625
01:02:46,050 --> 01:03:00,180
So you can use the data, which is exciting. And you're going to go into this contest later if this is all this is all in your instructions,

626
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:07,379
but this is what you're going to be going to spend the rest of class doing your assignment for this due next Friday.

627
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:15,870
So you don't have to take some time, right? We'll have it. We will have class on Wednesday after questions about it so we can look at it.

628
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:25,020
But I'll call attention to practice. So the only thing you turn into and this is you have this this entire document is on here.

629
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,230
The only thing you've learned is what's page three of this?

630
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:38,490
So the first two pages are walking you through an exercise in class, and then you're the only thing you're going to turn into is this last page.

631
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,330
Please read it carefully. You don't turn in the graphs.

632
01:03:42,570 --> 01:03:46,530
You're going to make the graphs and look at them and write little sentences about them.

633
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:49,530
So I want to know, can you see data and tell me what that data means?

634
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:54,090
Well, the first example is what I have decided to start almost.

635
01:03:55,950 --> 01:04:01,500
Okay. So that's this is the only part. That's the assignment that you turn. So do I hear.

636
01:04:01,830 --> 01:04:10,980
That's all right. So let me I'll sign ask you to work together to to to to get more context.

637
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,600
Okay, well, how about this group over here? I see you as a.

638
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:23,480
No marijuana. Okay. Here.

639
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:31,100
Cocaine. Yeah, it was just.

640
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:34,409
Now you just choose. Give me the part. I'm not going to chew gum with the partner.

641
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:39,010
And she's working so hard, so. And again, just.

642
01:04:39,450 --> 01:04:43,050
And then what I'd like you to do is. And work together on one of these.

643
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:46,139
This is not what you're going to do for your assignment. The assignment.

644
01:04:46,140 --> 01:04:49,440
You can read it back here. But just get used to you. Mess with it.

645
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:57,120
Okay, well, we'll come together. Let's spend about 90 minutes or so on this together.

646
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:02,070
Just to answer any questions about logistics. All right.

647
01:05:04,310 --> 01:05:04,510
I.
