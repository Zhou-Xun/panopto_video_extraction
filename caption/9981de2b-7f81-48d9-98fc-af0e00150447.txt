1
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:07,340
High class I machine and this is session 4.2.

2
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:17,690
We are going to build up on the lecture from session 4.1 where we talked about public health emergency preparedness in the United States.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,700
As a recap, we've talked about how prepared United States is for the next pandemic.

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:32,089
The DFA report talked about the level of preparedness across different states in the U.S. We've also talked about the different health departments,

5
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,010
federal, state and local health departments, and how they collaborate with each other in Session two.

6
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:45,980
And so with this lecture, we are going to take that a step further and talk about a more tangible,

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:54,680
real world example to get an idea of how different public health departments and agencies come together to solve public health emergencies.

8
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:04,430
In the second part of this lecture, we will switch gears and talk about what public health emergency preparedness looks like at a more global scale.

9
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:14,210
Multistate of foodborne outbreaks kind of provide a very good example of how collaboration across federal,

10
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:23,810
state and local health departments results in effective public health actions to stop the spread of disease when there is a foodborne illness.

11
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:32,120
The goal of public health agencies is to, of course, stop the spread of illness, but also more importantly, to identify the source of illness.

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:40,100
So investigations related to foodborne illnesses often require multiple public health partners to come together to solve the problem.

13
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:48,080
Generally, center of Disease Control and Prevention takes the lead, but it is being continuously helped by state and local health departments.

14
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:54,859
And then federal agencies such as the FDA and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection

15
00:01:54,860 --> 00:02:01,010
Service also plays a pivotal role in these investigations since the food supply chain is involved.

16
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:13,730
And we will start with discussing the role of CDC, which is involved in detecting outbreaks early on and to be able to do so.

17
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,830
CDC relies on a national surveillance database, which is called both NET Both,

18
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:28,520
and it is a collection of labs around the country that submit DNA bacterial samples from affected patients, contaminated food and environment.

19
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:36,890
And this allows CDC to track real time data related to outbreaks and identify what is causing outbreaks across states.

20
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:43,070
So CDC continuously tracks this information to detect an unusual activity,

21
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:50,990
which could look like a surge in cases or being able to see transmission across states or seeing a local outbreak in a community.

22
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:57,050
And to provide some context about why this information collected by Posner is important,

23
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:08,090
it really so think about a situation where the same food source such as sea garbage from company X causes in outbreaks causes an outbreak.

24
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,630
And in that case, CDC would likely find the same bacterial DNA among multiple patients across states.

25
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:21,740
And based on this real time molecular data, they can identify a group of patients infected by the same food source.

26
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:29,840
And so the last step really is to mobilize and share this information with the public so that this spread of illness can be stopped.

27
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:38,990
And generally speaking, foodborne outbreaks start as more localized outbreaks.

28
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:46,970
And this is where state and local public health and agriculture departments are doing the hands on work before CDC steps in.

29
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:55,760
It is the local and state departments that are submitting samples to Cbdcs national surveillance database that we just talked about.

30
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:03,049
And so without the help of these local and state departments and without this collaboration between departments,

31
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,740
CDC will not really be able to detect outbreaks timely.

32
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:13,190
So this collaboration is really crucial when we think about investigating outbreaks across the country.

33
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:23,750
And then these departments would generally ask CDC to jump in for assistance if needed or if the outbreak spans multiple states.

34
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,389
And then other than just submitting samples to the national surveillance system,

35
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:37,090
these local and state partners are also involved in collecting qualitative data from patients to identify the source of illness.

36
00:04:37,090 --> 00:04:43,430
So for an example, interviewing patients about where they had food before they start to film this,

37
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:51,530
or testing food samples from their homes or restaurants so that they are able to trace back to the source of contamination.

38
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,770
Next, we are going to look at other federal partners and food industry partners that are involved.

39
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,850
During foodborne foodborne outbreaks.

40
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,090
So so as we talk the talked about how food supply chain is involved in foodborne illnesses.

41
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,550
CDC works closely with two federal regulators, including USDA and FDA.

42
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,290
Their scope of investigation is more focused on the food supply chain.

43
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:28,910
They work to identify the contaminated food source and also the distribution channels involved with the identified food source.

44
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:35,870
They inspect processing facilities and farms and collect samples from these facilities for further testing.

45
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,390
They also review their safety protocols,

46
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:45,830
and their work is really crucial in identifying the contaminated store source rather than detecting illness in the population.

47
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:53,930
And so once a contaminated food source is identified there, where they work with companies to recall their contaminated products,

48
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,790
and the last partner in this long chain of partnership is the food industry.

49
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:07,700
Food industry experts and trade associations are often consulted during investigations to better understand the food production practices,

50
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,130
distribution channels and consumer purchasing related information.

51
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:23,900
Now let's talk about real world example, where collaboration across departments and agencies helps in taking effective public health actions.

52
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,500
A food borne out that spanned across states was identified by CDC in 2020.

53
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:36,230
Specimens from patients were submitted to the national surveillance database that we talked about,

54
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:40,760
and it was identified that the same bacteria was responsible for causing illness.

55
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,090
Among 55 people living in 12 different states,

56
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:52,220
and state and local authorities collected data from patients regarding where they had food prior to the onset of symptoms.

57
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,080
A local restaurant was identified as the common source among these patients.

58
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,380
They all had ramen at the same restaurant, and later,

59
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:06,980
multiple restaurants across states were identified as common places where patients had ramen before getting sick.

60
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,880
FDA was able to lead investigations in these restaurants and identified a particular kind

61
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,530
of mushroom as the common food that was served by these restaurants in their ramen.

62
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:24,350
They also had blue cheese, these mushrooms from the same company.

63
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,840
So the next step was for FDA to work with the company to recall their product.

64
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:39,760
So that really is an example of how these multiple agencies and departments come together to solve a public health emergency.

65
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:51,850
And now we are going to switch gears and talk about public health, emergency preparedness and how that looks like at a more global scale.

66
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,000
Whenever we think about global health, W.H.O. comes to mind.

67
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:06,640
It's an organization that was founded in 1940 448 and is a partner agency of the United Nations.

68
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:15,280
It primarily connects countries, partners and people to promote health, safety and well-being of populations around the globe.

69
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:23,410
W.H.O. has signed a treaty with 196 partner countries that now serve as a guiding

70
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,140
and also as a legal framework to respond to global public health emergencies.

71
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:36,850
The aim of this agreement is to allow international community to prevent and respond to public health emergencies responsibly,

72
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,470
especially when we're thinking about threats that can potentially cross country borders.

73
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:49,420
This H.R. framework really helps to define both rights and responsibilities of countries in responding to global emergencies.

74
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:56,259
Through this four framework, countries also have agreed to build their infrastructure that helps to detect,

75
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:05,709
assess and report public health events timely. H.R. also includes formulation of these specific measures at ports,

76
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:14,710
airports and land crossings that potentially helps to limit the spread of public health risks to other neighboring countries.

77
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:29,590
And then this is a term I think that we have heard about during COVID 19 and more recently during the monkeypox pandemic as well.

78
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,300
So this public health emergency of international concern is a term that W.H.O. uses to define an extraordinary event

79
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:45,040
that poses public health risk across country borders and potentially requires a coordinated international response.

80
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:54,520
And what your definition of W.H.O. implies that this situation is very serious, sudden, unusual, unexpected,

81
00:09:54,910 --> 00:10:07,630
and it has implications that go beyond one particular country, and that the solution really lies in a more in a more coordinated international effort.

82
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:15,879
And countries that are under the age are legally required to respond responsibly

83
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,660
to events considered as public health emergency of international concern.

84
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:25,570
The H.R. algorithm allows countries to assess if an event really is of international concern.

85
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,930
And if it is, then it needs to be reported to W.H.O.

86
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:39,820
And here, this box really shows you, which shows you that if two of these four questions are affirmed, then this event needs to be reported to W.H.O.

87
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:48,459
Based on the recommendations of the the WTO director general has the ultimate

88
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:53,050
power to declare an event as a public health emergency of international concern.

89
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:01,330
It also requires convening the meeting of the major committee, which is really an expert body that advises the Director-General.

90
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:10,540
It constitutes of experts from various different fields across the globe, including infection control, virology, vaccine development, among others.

91
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:16,030
This this committee puts forward a set of recommendations that need to be set

92
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:21,130
in place in order to counter the public health global public health emergency.

93
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:29,110
These set of recommendations are referred to as temporary recommendations that are reviewed after every three months.

94
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:38,020
And here I want to show you the number of times we have seen what you would declare

95
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:42,730
an event as a public health emergency of international concern since 2007.

96
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:50,650
You see here that all of these events are viral outbreaks, but they don't necessarily have to be.

97
00:11:51,580 --> 00:12:00,070
The the public health emergency of international concerns can also referred to events related to chemical agents or radioactive materials as well.

98
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:03,280
Most recently,

99
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:11,800
we have seen that the W.H.O. director general declared the ongoing monkeypox outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern.

100
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:21,070
You will read more about the monkeypox outbreak in the article that is assigned for Section 4.2.

101
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:27,130
And I hope that a lot of the the information in this lecture will help you put together,

102
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:32,920
will help you make sense of the podcast that we have assigned for Section 4.2.

103
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:39,760
And then make connections with the film that we are going to watch during class in session 4.2.

104
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,390
Thanks for listening.
