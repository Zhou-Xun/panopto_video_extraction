00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,890
This is NPR 26. Chapter one Introduction and Math Review.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:10,390
Second Part. So now I'm going to talk about four different discrete distributions.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:17,190
These are really useful as sort of building blocks for building up more complicated models later.

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:25,110
Starting with the binomial distribution, which is for discrete outcomes and is related to the logit and probit.

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:31,410
And then we'll talk about three other discrete distributions, the geometric porcine and negative binomial,

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,230
which are sort of different versions of the binomial that that are related.

7
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:46,080
All of this is to help you start to think about outcomes in terms of probabilities and think

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:53,580
about whether order matters or not and how to write down functions of those probabilities.

9
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:59,219
So we're going to start with the binomial to predict, for example,

10
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:07,440
the number of heads after spinning a coin and times the geometric is going to flip that around and see what happens.

11
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,210
How do you predict the number of times it takes to get heads?

12
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:17,070
Once that is getting tails a bunch of times and then finally heads,

13
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:24,630
the person is an approximation to the binomial when p is really small and is large.

14
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:31,829
And finally, the negative binomial can be used as an extension of the geometric.

15
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:42,240
So instead of predicting how long it takes to get one outcome, once it's to predict the number of trials, you need to get a bunch of outcomes.

16
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:53,610
Let's start with the binomial and as you'll see in the middle of the page, this is going to use the combinatorial function a lot.

17
00:01:54,210 --> 00:02:04,410
So suppose you have a random event that has two outcomes call them and b after and trials like n coin spins.

18
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:12,660
How many times will the outcome be? A so let capital x be the random variables and we'll say it has a binomial distribution.

19
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:22,530
Then it's PDF is the following. That is you can write the equation for the probability that the random variable x equals some specific outcome.

20
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,140
Its end choose x key to the x one minus p at the end minus x.

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:37,530
So let's break this formula down into pieces. The first part and choose X is all about ordering.

22
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:47,490
How many different ways can you order the outcomes A and B like heads and then tails or tails and then heads, that sort of thing.

23
00:02:49,200 --> 00:03:00,540
P to the X refers to the probability of getting an outcome C the outcome a x times,

24
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:09,660
and then one minus P is the probability of getting the other outcome B And so if the total number of of trials is N,

25
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:17,580
then you have X outcomes that are equal to outcome A and then N minus x outcomes that are equal to the outcome B.

26
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:24,569
So the second part of that formula pity the x one minus P to the N minus x that

27
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:30,750
gives you the probability of getting all those outcomes A and B in some order.

28
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:37,660
And again, the choose part tells you. The number of different ways that you can order those outcomes.

29
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:46,240
So yeah, it turns out that the mean and the variance of this random variable are the following the mean is end times.

30
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:57,850
P. So, for example, if you have a fair coin spin at 100 times P is a half or 50% and would be 100 if you spin it 100 times.

31
00:03:57,850 --> 00:04:04,300
So the expected value of the number of heads would be 100 times a half or 50.

32
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:16,660
The variance of that number, the number of heads is N times P, times one minus P, and that's actually a formula you should remember.

33
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:25,690
And times P, times one minus P is something that we will see again in several different versions throughout this class as a variance.

34
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:37,690
So if if P is really small, then the variance will be fairly small as well as the mean.

35
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:46,569
All right, so let's take an example. Um, spin a coin three times so and is equal to three, let's call it a fair coin.

36
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:51,820
So piece a half the number of heads is capital X.

37
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,900
It's a random variable. It could either be zero, one, two or three.

38
00:04:56,950 --> 00:05:06,399
So what is F of zero? What's the probability that for a fair coin, you spin it three times and you don't get any heads at all.

39
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:18,040
So all tails. So using the formula on the previous page, three factorial over zero factor, which is one not zero times three -0 factorial.

40
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:24,700
Well that all wipes out right. Three factorial over three factorial that wipes out.

41
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:30,760
So that's not very interesting point five raised to the zero because we don't get any heads.

42
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,510
Anything raised to the zero is one. So that disappears.

43
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,980
Then we have one minus a half or half raised to the third.

44
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,030
So we're cubing a half, which is one eighth.

45
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:50,980
So if you have a fair coin, one eighth of the time, if you spin it three times, you won't get any heads at all.

46
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,140
Or also one eighth of the time you should get three heads.

47
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:01,390
The geometric distribution is different in the following way.

48
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,590
It's no longer the case that the number of heads is random.

49
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,480
We're going to fix that as being one.

50
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:17,890
But now the random variable is the number of trials, because we're going to say, how long does it take until you get the first heads?

51
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:25,090
So so for example, you spin it, you get tails, tails, tails and then heads.

52
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:31,990
So the first trial, you get tails that happens.

53
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,950
Sorry if this happens on the very first time that happens with probability P because that's the probability of heads.

54
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:48,760
If it takes two times to get ahead, that means you get tails and then heads that happens with probability one minus p times p.

55
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:57,549
If it takes you end times to do it, then that means and minus one times you do tails, and then finally you get heads.

56
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,290
And that happens with probability p.

57
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:08,720
So if capital and now is the random variable, not x capital n is the random variable with a geometric distribution.

58
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,750
Then it's pdf is p times one minus p to the n minus one.

59
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:18,950
Where's the choose part? You're asking where did that go? You love the choose part.

60
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:27,320
So there's no choose part in this case because the order is always the same that you get tail, tail,

61
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:36,649
tail, tail, tail finally heads or outcome B-BBEE Finally outcome A There's no other way to order it.

62
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:41,720
The tail, sorry. The head always comes last. The interesting outcome always comes last.

63
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,520
So there's nothing to rearrange and put in different order. There's no choose parts of the formula.

64
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:55,270
The expected value for the random variable capital N is one over P and the variance is one minus P over p squared.

65
00:07:56,230 --> 00:08:02,440
So that means that both the mean and the variance increase as P gets really small.

66
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:09,429
So for really small P, you're not likely to get ahead very often and therefore it's going to take a long time.

67
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:14,450
So the mean increases and it turns out the variance increases also.

68
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:19,270
Um. Okay.

69
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:28,990
There will always be at least one outcome. So F of zero is identically equal to zero in this case.

70
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:36,550
So let's do another example. Um, let's say you have a fair die.

71
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:46,660
So there's six possible outcomes one through six. And what's the probability that the first time you roll a five will happen on the fourth roll?

72
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,740
So imagine you're rolling a die trying to get a five, trying to get a five.

73
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:58,450
What's the probability that you get that for all of a five on the exactly.

74
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,710
The fourth rule, that means you don't get a five on the first, second or third roll.

75
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:10,570
So the probability of that happening is five out of six, three times or raise to the third power.

76
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:17,230
And finally, the probability of getting a five on the fourth roll is one over six.

77
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:30,070
Multiply that all out, you get just under 10%. The person distribution again is used when you have really small probabilities and is large.

78
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:38,140
So here we have the formula. Actually, it looks exactly like the binomial distribution because it is basically the binomial distribution.

79
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,730
It's just an approximation that works well in P is small and is large.

80
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:54,100
So that formula can be approximate. It is E race to the minus and p times in p refers to the x over x factorial.

81
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:04,120
So it's commonly done to replace End Times P with some other Greek letter like MU.

82
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:08,500
So we'll rewrite it looks a little smaller and friendlier.

83
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:18,070
So now the PDF for a specific value x is e to the minus mu times due to the x over x factorial.

84
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,190
For me it was equal to end times p and really large p really small.

85
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:34,760
It turns out that the mean and the variance are both equal to the same number equal to MU, which is end times p.

86
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:40,629
Let's go through an example here. We need we need small probabilities and big numbers.

87
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,980
So suppose we're trying to figure out if there's life beyond Mars.

88
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:49,240
So in the Milky Way, which is our galaxy, there are about 100 billion stars.

89
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,410
So are we talking big numbers here? 100 billion is equal to N.

90
00:10:54,400 --> 00:11:00,700
And there's some probability that every that each star has at least one planet with life.

91
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:10,180
But I'm going to, we're going to try and find the value p which is the probability that a star has a planet with life on it,

92
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,820
such that there's a 5050 chance of life in at least one other solar system.

93
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:25,480
Okay, so 100 billion stars, if it's like 10% of all the stars out there, have planets with life around them.

94
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,070
And then there's going to be an enormous amount of life out there in in the Milky Way.

95
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:39,250
But how small could P actually be that even though it's a really small number,

96
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:45,160
because there's so many stars, there's actually a 50% chance of life, at least one solar system.

97
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:49,630
Okay. So we're going to write this as.

98
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:56,920
What's the probability that this random variable x equals zero?

99
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,970
Because if it doesn't equal zero, then it's either one or.

100
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:10,540
Or greater than one. That means X is the number of stars that have a planet with life on it.

101
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:21,710
So a 5050 chance of life in at least one other solar system means a 5050 chance that there's no life anywhere.

102
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,760
X equals zero. That's a lot easier to solve. Okay, so let's plug in the numbers.

103
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:35,650
We have each of the -100 billion times p 100 billion times P rise to the zero over zero factorial.

104
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,970
Hey, that's great. A lot of this cancels out. Zero factorial, of course, is one.

105
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:44,230
Anything raised to the zero is one. So that's all gone.

106
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:48,040
And we're just left with E to the -100 billion times P.

107
00:12:49,930 --> 00:13:05,530
So if we set that equal to a half, rearrange, got logs and so forth and solve, we find that P could be really small.

108
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:12,970
So even if the probability of life is a really small number, 6.93, one times ten to the -12,

109
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:20,080
even if it's that small, there's a 5050 chance of life out there somewhere in our own galaxy.

110
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:31,900
It's pretty amazing. So there is another way of doing this, which you could just use the binomial distribution.

111
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:38,170
Hey, we said that person is the approximation for binomial, so you ought to be able to use that formula to get the same answer.

112
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:52,959
That requires taking the hundred billionth root of one minus P or of a half, and that that can be hard to do in a calculator.

113
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:58,640
But you would get the exact same number. Finally we have the negative binomial.

114
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:06,920
So remember that the geometric distribution was how many times do you have to do something before I get a certain outcome?

115
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,610
This is a generalization of that. It's How many times do I have to do something until we get that outcome?

116
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,600
Several times specifically are times.

117
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:27,500
So it's a generalization of the geometric where R is the number of outcomes instead of one.

118
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:33,830
So here the notation is a little different.

119
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:40,580
Again, it looks sort of like the binomial distribution. We have a choose function, we have P to the R one minus P to the end.

120
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:52,189
There a couple of things here that are a little different than we want to go through because we have the outcome of interest happening.

121
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:56,089
R times that's each of those happens with probability.

122
00:14:56,090 --> 00:15:06,700
P So it's P to the R. The the other outcome, the one that we don't care about so much happens in time.

123
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,530
So that's one minus P race to the end power.

124
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:16,420
The question is how many ways can you rearrange all those outcomes?

125
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:21,850
The one the outcome that you care about in the outcome B that you don't care about so much.

126
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:35,950
So here we're going to change the notation a little bit and n is now the number of times that you get outcome B,

127
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,390
r is the number of times you get outcome A and.

128
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,700
Remember the way you're going to go until you get to the.

129
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:54,690
Outcome of a to the last outcome A is fixed but you could get the first two A's right away you could have a and then

130
00:15:54,690 --> 00:16:03,600
a bunch of B's and then finally a or it could be BP and then A and then more B's and A and then finally another A.

131
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:07,490
But the last A is always in the same spot.

132
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:19,110
You can't move that one around. So the twos function is now the total number minus one because the last one is fixed in the last place.

133
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:26,670
Choose an O, which is the number of outcomes b.

134
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:36,330
So the mean and the variance are listed there. The mean is are times when my s p over p, the variance has another p in the denominator.

135
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,860
So again, I want to just emphasize it in this definition.

136
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:55,680
RN is different than in the geometric model and is the number of times you get b it's not the total number of of of trials you have.

137
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:02,250
It's a change of notation. It's a little bit confusing, but just want to remember that.

138
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:11,190
So what we're interested in here is how many times are we going to get an outcome?

139
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,040
B, maybe at the beginning. Maybe at the middle.

140
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:25,800
And so that is the variable of interest capital and is the number of times you get outcome B knowing that we're going to wait.

141
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,030
We're going to keep going until we get our outcomes of a.

142
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,169
So one thing to observe, I'm going to go back a slide about the variance of capital.

143
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:50,850
And is that the mean? And the variance are different and they differ by one over P and you may say well so what it turns out that when

144
00:17:50,850 --> 00:18:02,309
we get to count models used for modeling outcomes that have discrete distributions of numbers typically zero one,

145
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:11,340
two, three, that sort of thing, that there are two standard ways of modeling these count outcomes.

146
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:16,889
One is Poisson. Once negative binomial, the person assumes that the mean equals the variance.

147
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:21,600
The negative binomial relaxes that and allows the variance to be larger.

148
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:31,080
See that the variance has to be larger than the mean because there's an extra p in the denominator and p is less than one,

149
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:40,540
so the variance is greater than the mean. So that is an overview of of the four models.

150
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,600
Let's go through an example for the negative binomial from wrestling,

151
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:57,120
we have an example of so wrestlers in Japan, sumo wrestlers are at different ranks, different levels.

152
00:18:57,330 --> 00:19:01,230
The highest level is called Yukos in a sort of a living hall of Fame.

153
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:10,500
And those are four sumo wrestlers who have won enough tournaments to be promoted up to that highest level.

154
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,980
The level just below that is Ozaki.

155
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:24,110
And so once you get to the Ozaki level, if you win enough tournaments, then you're probably going to get promoted to enough.

156
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,419
So suppose it's the case that a wrestler,

157
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:38,310
sumo wrestler at the level of Ozaki is told that he must win three tournaments to be promoted to level of yokozuna.

158
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:46,660
What is the probability that the sumo wrestler is promoted on the fifth try?

159
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:52,200
So that means at the fifth tournament. So that means a couple of things have to happen.

160
00:19:52,980 --> 00:20:05,820
One is that he's going to win that fifth tournaments, and the other is that in the first four tournaments, he would have to win two and lose to.

161
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,499
Okay. So plugging in numbers.

162
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,649
So he's going to win three tournaments. Let's say he's really good.

163
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:25,280
So it's a probability of 20%. So winning three times at 20% probability is point to race to the third course.

164
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,450
That means he loses twice, which happens with 80% frequency.

165
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:33,020
That's so that's point eight squared.

166
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,680
And then there's several different ways that that could happen.

167
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:46,190
He could win to lose two and then finally win the fifth, or he could lose win, lose, win, win or various other combinations.

168
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:50,990
So the way you figure out the number of combinations again is the twos function.

169
00:20:52,040 --> 00:21:05,780
The two plus three minus one in the numerator means the the two that he loses plus the three that he wins,

170
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:10,489
minus the one that has to come at the fifth tournament.

171
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,000
So we're back to four out of winning four.

172
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:22,700
You can win win two and lose two. So that's four choose to basically that'll give you the number of different ways that you

173
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:29,150
can win two and lose two out of the first four tournaments before winning the fifth.

174
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:31,910
It turns out that's a really small number. It's about 3%.

175
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:41,780
Of course, he might win for the third time at the six tournaments or may take longer than that.

176
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,130
But that's one example using the negative binomial.

177
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,780
So these four discrete distributions are all related to each other,

178
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:59,360
building off the binomial which fixes the number of trials and asks How many heads do you get out of that number?

179
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:06,080
Geometric Flip sat around and says, We're going to we're going to keep doing things until we get heads.

180
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,950
And the random number is no longer the number of heads.

181
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:16,370
It's how many total trials person is an approximation of the binomial when probabilities

182
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:23,839
are small and the negative binomial is an extension of the geometric and as a mentions,

183
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:31,160
the person and negative binomial are models that will return to later in this semester when we talk about count models.

184
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:40,580
So it's a lot of detail there. Overall, I want you to be thinking about partly just the building blocks.

185
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,910
What is the choose function? How does that work?

186
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,150
Why are you multiplying by p raise to a number and then one minus P raised to another number.

187
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:57,739
Think about the building blocks of the binomial distribution and how each of those work and they have meaning.

188
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:11,960
So think about what that meaning is and and also think about how for all these events, discrete events that happen,

189
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:19,370
how we can build these formulas that describe mathematically the probability of these events happening.

190
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:27,770
And we'll use that as we develop maximum likelihood models and eventually logit and probit models.
