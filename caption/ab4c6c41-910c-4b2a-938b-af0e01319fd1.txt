1
00:00:29,580 --> 00:02:51,950
Yeah. I.

2
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:24,070
Oh. Which.

3
00:03:29,070 --> 00:04:27,500
It's. Next. Anyone who's just coming here or working on the survey from the Kansas side is

4
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:32,120
under Arena three was engaged Monday and the presentation slides for today.

5
00:04:47,070 --> 00:05:09,060
It's just. Since we do have quite a bit to get through on the legislation,

6
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:15,629
which requires longer after those communiquÃ©s to kind of go through a little

7
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:21,570
quickly if there are more questions that can be asked or if we have free time,

8
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:30,620
it should happen. The first questions were whether it's possible those hundreds of these has not been increasing since 1985.

9
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,300
Diagnosis has improved. That is true. And.

10
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:45,110
Immunology has played a role in each of these, besides reducing wait time at physician offices, that would be more in business types and.

11
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,160
Not being able to smoke on airplanes,

12
00:05:50,160 --> 00:06:02,910
as is obvious how a 300 calorie counts on the use of restaurants allows people to make health conscious choices and reduce things such as obesity.

13
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,620
The new exchange programs are be shown to reduce harm,

14
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:21,420
to control explanations for observed associations between exposure and outcome, or all of these could be due to chance.

15
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:27,540
That could be an error in measurement for some of the people who have the health

16
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:36,390
outcomes identified in such nutritional information for this time of the year.

17
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:47,990
So how do we. And how many of those criteria must be met in order to establish a cause and effect relationship.

18
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:55,640
I know this one has confused some people. Temporarily is the main one that you look for.

19
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,729
If you find nothing. You probably do not have a causal relationship.

20
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,840
You want to find at least one or two. But.

21
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,300
Adding more on them just strengthens your evidence for causality and doesn't guarantee it.

22
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:20,930
And if you have one, you could reveal something later that allows you to establish causality.

23
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:31,770
Doesn't fit the other criteria. And it is not correct for a physician to tell a patient who smokes that they will

24
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:38,160
eventually develop lung cancer is greatly increase the risk of developing lung cancer.

25
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:45,360
But some people just do not. So you can't say with certainty you're going to go with.

26
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:56,590
Component causes and a series of causal paths must occur in all of the paths, but is false.

27
00:07:57,830 --> 00:08:01,510
Components can be found in just one time.

28
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:07,760
They are really part of that part of the evening that has to be in all of them.

29
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:19,810
Exposure to measles. It is a necessary and a component possibly not sufficient.

30
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:26,640
To be sufficient, it would have to guarantee that it's going to cause measles,

31
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:35,429
whereas someone who maybe developed immunity through infection or had been vaccinated could be exposed

32
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:46,060
to measles and not know which and not develop measles and for considering whether the problem presents.

33
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,750
Those criteria of temporality must be established.

34
00:08:54,470 --> 00:09:04,730
Or true statement. The first one is the relationship between exposure and disease outcomes is not necessarily important causality.

35
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:12,900
You could see a chance or some statistical thing that is going on where you have too many variables.

36
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,780
You're seeing significance just by chance.

37
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,950
Single study is not sufficient to establish causality.

38
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:31,060
One time you will find things that. Bias the study or it only applies to a certain group and you can't.

39
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:37,600
It seems like it's going to affect an entire population.

40
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,490
And you do not have to know all of the component causes.

41
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:51,620
Obesity may lead to arthritis through chronic inflammation and excess weight bearing on the joints.

42
00:09:52,370 --> 00:10:00,320
This is an example of biological responsibility because you've established how this is going to happen biologically.

43
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,940
Let's do the following from two quotes to now.

44
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:14,580
Which of the following are examples of primary intervention? A booster shot of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine.

45
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:22,330
The March on. And a healthy 30 year old person exercising these both prevent things before they.

46
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:33,920
Which of the following are examples of secondary? A mammogram in a healthy 50 year old woman.

47
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:45,490
HIV testing offers other health care. For tertiary prevention.

48
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:53,840
For this question, we say returning to exercise after a heart attack and living in a halfway house for recovering alcoholic.

49
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:05,850
Being evaluated by a doctor for a mysterious skin rash is not considered secondary prevention.

50
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:18,100
The natural history of disease does not refer to the historical, increasing and increasing incidence of a specific moving.

51
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:27,090
It's not all getting along well. Yes, there are all ideologic factors are risk factors.

52
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:38,890
And it's true. At least one level of prevention can be implemented during much of the following points in the natural history of any disease.

53
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,440
Each of the early pathogenesis and disease.

54
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:56,680
Through pathogenesis period. And what level of prevention was initiated during the preclinical phase and the secondary.

55
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:06,060
For. Tertiary prevention generally involves programs and initiatives that target larger groups of healthy people.

56
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:11,670
Primary prevention focuses on rehabilitating individuals recovering from disease.

57
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:22,579
This is false. They are reverse. A 65 year old woman visits her doctor for complaints of the payments business,

58
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:29,830
on which the doctor orders an X-ray to look for any bone or soft tissue abnormalities in or around her jaw.

59
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:34,710
This is an example of secondary prevention. That is false.

60
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,360
For a refresher on what prevention is, which time?

61
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,530
Primary is to prevent the initial development of disease among the disease free.

62
00:12:52,480 --> 00:13:01,420
Secondary prevention is early detection of existing disease among asymptomatic individuals to reduce severity and improve the outcome.

63
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:07,139
Perjury prevention is to reduce the impact of disease among disease.

64
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,140
The individuals who have already been diagnosed.

65
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:18,540
And diagnosis and the detection of existing disease among individuals who are exhibiting clinical symptoms.

66
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,440
Among those identified through secondary prevention program.

67
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:31,379
And those will be important for your learning activity here.

68
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:39,490
A moment. So the only difference between secondary prevention and diagnosis is symptoms, right?

69
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:46,300
So secondary prevention is before someone's symptoms and diagnosis afterwards, and that's the only difference.

70
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,409
Oh, for diagnosis versus secondary.

71
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,709
This is secondary is among the asymptomatic.

72
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:03,440
So you caught it before they're exhibiting the clinical symptoms or diagnosis.

73
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,710
You can catch it a secondary or tertiary catch.

74
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:25,320
Nice thing to look at your stage of disease, the description and the goal in each category of prevention.

75
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:36,530
We're primary one disease free people. We want to increase the risk and the goal is to prevent disease from occurring,

76
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:42,470
healthy people without diseases that you want to lower the risk of developing disease.

77
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:48,400
For secondary prevention. You've already got the dialog, you're gone, says disease,

78
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,890
but you want to detect it at an early stage and that improves the outcome with early treatment.

79
00:14:56,630 --> 00:15:00,200
For tertiary prevention. It's already a chronic disease.

80
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:09,410
And reducing security. The goal is to stop full or stop disease progression.

81
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:25,730
All right. I hope everyone has had a chance to download the engage learning activity or can do so in the home.

82
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,440
So we're going to. Individually and or as a group.

83
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:40,130
You can review the scenarios on the engage learning and come up with answers and see how it goes.

84
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:52,230
You want to see the timer for 15 minutes? Music.

85
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:08,100
Be honest, I am grateful for this house.

86
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:26,460
You I think it is okay.

87
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:36,920
These confused things and just a couple of words. So there is a connection.

88
00:16:37,090 --> 00:17:01,190
It was hard to make today because I just trying to write something to play somewhere,

89
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:18,750
but it's not on 63, 25 times, are you are you sure this is important?

90
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:25,300
I think it should turn.

91
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:36,689
I think when it comes to our country, you know, I've been sharing all those memories for that experience.

92
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:46,860
From what I've seen, the location where there's nothing left.

93
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,580
You don't know what your symptoms are last year.

94
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:06,960
I mean, really, this is getting as much as I can.

95
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:14,070
And secondary is to touch people through the media.

96
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:28,230
So if you're getting lots of, you know, like you're trying to catch diabetes or something, I think it's it's early but in second place,

97
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:41,080
I don't think, you know, it's not like you're doing wrong because a mammogram doesn't know how to prevent cancer screening.

98
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,940
The blood is doing anything to prevent cancer.

99
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,040
You're just kind of prescribed, I guess.

100
00:18:51,760 --> 00:19:03,480
I guess I think of it as just for something, the routine vision that's going to be depending on your point of view.

101
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,220
Oh, it's great.

102
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:23,610
If it's only because that's what you have and that's what you have a great positive mindset, that of protection and presentation, that sort of thing.

103
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:39,870
So it's just kind of they already started trying to make the right decision here

104
00:19:40,140 --> 00:20:07,290
as well because it's early detection and secondary education for children.

105
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:43,020
So in my notes, comparing the screening on screen with preexisting condition, some people might take selfies and stuff like that.

106
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:50,250
I was saying like I guess it's like I just make this transition like this.

107
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,260
So you're trying to get at least I can time, but.

108
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:18,879
Yeah. It's kind of like, you know, I think actresses, but especially because yeah,

109
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:40,270
I know this whole thing which is actually charging extremely hard to make sure that I'm trying to accomplish something.

110
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:56,799
I guess that's also, like you said, it's just us as private sectors.

111
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:37,420
Like I said, I think I was at times like, you know, then you can see how we can expect this big ratings,

112
00:22:42,940 --> 00:23:02,079
although we are one of the few and they didn't get these late night it's just technicalities based on the

113
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:22,990
vaccine department says that if you sign all those just they're going to be somewhat concerned about.

114
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:33,299
Oh, I'm sorry. That's what I think we need to.

115
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:39,640
Let's figure out what I can guarantee that it's not like.

116
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,540
Yeah, I have already been robbed and off.

117
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:56,140
I try to just grab some.

118
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:05,690
Somebody says there's this is the sort of thing.

119
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:33,130
So it's something that's pretty interesting questions that we're putting on the screen.

120
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:44,799
So I think it's screening like if you're touching something when they teach you that while you're testing.

121
00:24:44,800 --> 00:25:15,040
So I'm not sure how it works for me.

122
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:34,960
I feel like any patient across the hall from me and I'm like, you know, I don't.

123
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:50,350
No, no, no, it's not okay.

124
00:25:53,710 --> 00:26:13,670
Yeah. You just. Irish sea creatures.

125
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:20,140
It doesn't say that they're like mercury and it's on the way.

126
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:57,600
I think there's a chance that they're not going to, because if I was watching you guys,

127
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:13,120
that part of the astronomers as know that, you know, it's just like the Australians.

128
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:21,540
It is like a hundred different.

129
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:45,300
However, they do not want to go out there and do the same thing.

130
00:27:46,200 --> 00:28:04,620
I just think what it was like being like this or is it safe?

131
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,360
And that's already have been.

132
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:23,430
Let's go see for so long.

133
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:30,060
So now I'm like, ready?

134
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,250
Yes. I just want to say that probably has something to do with it.

135
00:28:46,890 --> 00:29:03,820
But I think that could be a model that maybe they're testing for the first episode.

136
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:43,200
Sorry. Or is there such a thing as too much on the ice?

137
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:17,390
Yeah. I mean, I think it would be like it's driving me crazy.

138
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:52,860
I know I put your phone on because I was so excited time the day I realized that I was.

139
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:19,340
Yeah. I just think they only reason why. I suspect as we regularly have something like this, it's just there's something it's just it's just not,

140
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:34,010
you know, something that take the next 15 or years.

141
00:31:35,810 --> 00:32:11,810
And I just I was wondering and I don't think we were expecting it to feel like there's so much interest, you know, what did I say?

142
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:15,140
Anything that wasn't like? I'm just like, talk about this.

143
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:23,810
This is like I said, this is very interesting because I wasn't sure I was wondering sort of topics,

144
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:40,400
but I always like to get people that are going to at the diagnostic diagnosis.

145
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:42,560
So that's basically what you said.

146
00:32:42,620 --> 00:33:18,290
She has to reassure them that she's really like, I don't know, I just could see I don't know that they are and I am so happy I was right.

147
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:37,160
So they're not very close. I have something that's exactly right.

148
00:33:40,850 --> 00:34:00,290
So I do. And that's why I put it straight to the ratings.

149
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:08,720
So I don't know how much.

150
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:30,600
And I think there are already stereotypes that I think always are like, Yeah, yeah.

151
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:46,540
So I don't know yet.

152
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:59,809
But you know, she might have heard the secretary.

153
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:13,580
You know, I do want to tell you about your casting.

154
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:44,340
I know. I just I would like to get back to the house because it's great for us.

155
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:54,140
I know. I would try to make matters worse.

156
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:05,550
I'm saying it's fine.

157
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:16,830
Okay. All right. You know, it's very important that, you know.

158
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:50,620
You all right? You know, it's not going to tell you.

159
00:36:51,740 --> 00:37:01,220
Yeah, but it's already happened.

160
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:41,290
So I thought you might like to use it, and I'm not sure what that is for.

161
00:37:41,350 --> 00:38:19,060
On top of that information, specific or some other time to think about your personal relationship with my brother's friends.

162
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:40,460
So I got my brother and sister in law at 663 three measuring the numbers.

163
00:38:45,440 --> 00:39:00,610
So, you know, that's not to say that they're hiding out.

164
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:14,900
Yeah. I mean, you know, it's time.

165
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:27,370
Well, it's impossible to actually kind of decided that.

166
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:37,300
Of course, I want to hear about your interest to report it to on that subject.

167
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:49,030
I guess I really don't know what a scenario explicit area is like.

168
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:06,100
Are you surprised? I was like 400 years ago.

169
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:12,090
I feel like this one. You just don't feel like it's right.

170
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:39,490
Cause I was like. I think it was like, oh, no, no, no, no.

171
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:47,400
I don't like either one of you.

172
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:55,410
I wasn't sure if is a thing.

173
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:13,500
I see my family. Oh, yes, I do.

174
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:25,510
I feel like if the president of the United States.

175
00:41:27,400 --> 00:42:01,740
There are many other nations are in trouble right now.

176
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:42,130
We. How could I? There is not much if you don't want to have a lot of people are never going to go someplace else.

177
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:54,540
And I was like, Oh, that was really pretty good.

178
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:37,120
Like, I, I think I might be able to come back here and things like this.

179
00:43:37,970 --> 00:44:02,170
There might be something that we really thought it was going to be higher here.

180
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:29,170
Yeah. I mean, I was in high school and I was like, oh, you know, I never know.

181
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:39,320
They get to go to school.

182
00:44:40,040 --> 00:45:25,060
Like, I was like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

183
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:49,210
It's probably one of the most important guys I've got, I think.

184
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,620
How did you find out? What?

185
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:55,430
You guys.

186
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:24,980
But I have come to school that I didn't want to have to deal with teachers that would most like we had a couple of years ago in heels and heels.

187
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:31,740
I used to go outside.

188
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:50,260
I have my shoes and I know I want to visit my native.

189
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:54,670
Ever talk to each other?

190
00:46:55,570 --> 00:47:01,500
Yes, do. What does that tell you?

191
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:08,730
She's like, she's not going to do it.

192
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:23,410
Yeah. It's almost like my stance here is believed to be.

193
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:37,080
The answer is. So for the first one undergoing a functional MRI, our brains are experiencing a loss of the peripheral vision.

194
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:50,580
What do you say to anyone whose diagnosis actually you already have?

195
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:57,460
You need to figure out what's going on and it doesn't reduce the impact.

196
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,530
So that means it's not a tertiary.

197
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:10,110
True thing to go back to is if you can find something in one of these descriptions, what you're looking at does not.

198
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:20,220
How is your answer? The MRI will not reduce the impact of disease.

199
00:48:24,790 --> 00:48:32,600
And we don't have an official diagnosis. Just. Thank you for the polio vaccine.

200
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:37,720
Primary guest presents polio.

201
00:48:39,430 --> 00:48:46,090
And for malaria medication for people who do not have the disease, which is the key phrase, or do not have the disease.

202
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,260
Traveling to a location where the disease is endemic.

203
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:58,760
I'm primary. Yes. Google is preventing the disease from developing.

204
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:05,910
The follow up exams to identify metastatic disease.

205
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:21,799
What is this? You're doing follow up exams, so you've already seen that something is going on in your symptomatic the yes diagnosis.

206
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:34,040
You're trying to figure out what's going on. I have cervical cancer surveillance of a patient with HPV secondary prevention.

207
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:40,740
Yes, it is secondary because you're trying to detect it early.

208
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:44,570
They have HPV, but not cervical cancer just yet.

209
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:49,270
But, you know, and the surveillance will not prevent the disease.

210
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:55,760
So it is secondary prevention. Mammography in a healthy 55 year old.

211
00:49:57,810 --> 00:50:01,560
So. Yes. You want to detect it early?

212
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:07,340
Before sometimes. Come on. But a mammogram will not prevent breast cancer.

213
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:14,040
So it is not primary prevention. Sunscreen use on a cloudy day.

214
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:28,050
Yes. If you want to prevent melanoma and other things like sunburn after anti-retroviral medication,

215
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:33,460
such as what you would take for HIV, you already have HIV.

216
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:38,660
You are already infected with the retrovirus. Yes.

217
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:45,870
Using your protection. Mowing the lawn. My guess.

218
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,300
Steroid creams for rheumatoid arthritis and disease.

219
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:58,379
You've already been diagnosed for sharing routine blood,

220
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:12,209
library and condoms for as to use or STIs taking nasal swab and sending it for laboratory

221
00:51:12,210 --> 00:51:19,500
testing for RSV and influenza and a child with symptoms and difficulty breathing.

222
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,100
Diagnosis? Yes. Symptomatic, but not yet diagnosed.

223
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:29,470
You don't know which of these they might have. You might.

224
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:36,640
Getting an X-ray of the hand following reports of joint pain symptoms in your fingers.

225
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:46,230
Diagnosis. Testing for pre-eclampsia in pregnant women in secondary.

226
00:51:46,410 --> 00:51:49,469
Secondary. Routine nutrition.

227
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:54,330
Integrated tests for school children. Secondary.

228
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:01,530
It will not stop the problems, but you may take them before symptoms make themselves known.

229
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:07,310
Pre-Exposure prophylaxis prep for HIV.

230
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:16,450
This is primary because you want it could actually stop the infection.

231
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:23,040
A patient with anemia undergoing bone marrow biopsy.

232
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:27,220
And have anemia. Diagnostic?

233
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,540
Yes. Diagnosis. You're looking to see what's going on.

234
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:38,710
Written by and you've got all kinds of secondary primary.

235
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:44,650
You want to prevent the inevitable development of disease so you maintain your central.

236
00:52:46,300 --> 00:53:00,850
You really do have these infections, among other things, getting an EKG due to the presence of an arrhythmia, sometimes diagnosis.

237
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:13,799
Yes. Getting blood pressure, reduced doctor's visits, despite not having a previous high blood pressure secondary.

238
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,760
We want to detect if you have this fall still asymptomatic.

239
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:26,069
To improve outcomes. Mental health treatment supporters first year.

240
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:33,060
Yes, because you've already been diagnosed with support groups or to reduce the impact of the mental.

241
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:43,340
Fourth thing that's going on dialysis for someone with end stage renal disease is finishing surgery.

242
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:46,950
This will reduce the impact of the renal disease.

243
00:53:48,670 --> 00:53:53,290
Tuberculin can test a newly hired hospital employee.

244
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:07,400
This is secondary. You want to see if there is an asymptomatic situation going on in the fact that a blood

245
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:15,770
glucose meter for diabetes management contracts is tertiary because it's after diagnosis,

246
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:20,240
you have diabetes and the blood glucose meter allows you to manage that condition.

247
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:32,740
And doubts about the risks involved in using land based glazes for ceramics, arguing that she wants to prevent this from happening.

248
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:43,990
Folic acid supplement for a person who is not yet but planning on becoming pregnant to prevent the initial development of disease.

249
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:53,080
This one might be tricky. The HPV vaccine in a patient who has tested positive for HPV high risk type 16.

250
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,540
That is what the question would lead you to believe.

251
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:07,400
But it's actually primary because there are multiple different types of HPV and you're only tested positive for one.

252
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:14,120
So the vaccine will prevent you from getting infected with the other types of HPV.

253
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:24,420
We will not stop or manage the infection with high risk type 16, but the others it can prevent.

254
00:55:26,430 --> 00:55:35,010
Undergoing a comprehensive eye exam with an ophthalmologist following a non passing score on your vision test at the DMV.

255
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:45,070
Yes. Diagnosis because you got the symptom of your non passing score on your vision test.

256
00:55:45,610 --> 00:55:49,720
So you know, you need to do the eye exam and figure out what's going on.

257
00:55:51,540 --> 00:56:06,210
Very good news for someone with conducted Cheerios first year I yes this reduces the impact of disease chronic pain management program for tertiary.

258
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:13,740
Physical therapy following ACL injury restrictions, for sure, you guys.

259
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:17,579
You know, you've already been diagnosed with the ACL injury.

260
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:23,120
That's pretty specific. A biopsy to examine an atypical mole.

261
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:33,519
All right. Know this diagnosis because you're symptomatic with the mold and you want to detect what the disease is.

262
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:43,930
If there isn't seatbelts, primary injury or death, you want to avoid both of those.

263
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:50,570
Occupational therapy following a stroke. That's for sure.

264
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,490
Yes. You're going to stroke. You want to reduce the.

265
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:13,070
Going back to thinking about when you were doing the assignment, which of these did you spend the most time deciding?

266
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:22,800
The trickier more than the others. I think we kind of had a little bit of a discussion on mental health.

267
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:27,720
I guess treatment support groups, you know, with some support groups that are kind of like peer support.

268
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:35,220
Yeah, I guess we kind of have a back and forth on like, well, it could be primary, it could be tertiary know somebody's got to go there for funding.

269
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:40,620
I can of see that for maintaining your mental health without being diagnosed.

270
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:46,020
You want to just stay mentally healthy. You know others.

271
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:56,390
Yes, it was the HPV vaccine when we did, and we didn't know what the HPV high risk type 16 was or what was going on.

272
00:57:56,810 --> 00:58:00,930
A lot of times you need the background information that would have probably gotten me to.

273
00:58:03,230 --> 00:58:11,030
Yeah. I thought a lot about the tuberculosis testing because it would be screening for the individual.

274
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:16,879
But the purpose of like testing employees in the hospital for Tuberculosis is to prevent the spread of it in general.

275
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:20,990
So that kind be a primary role in this case?

276
00:58:20,990 --> 00:58:28,430
It wouldn't be primary because the point is to see if you've got like an asymptomatic infection,

277
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:35,270
like it's dormant in your body, but for the other people it can be seen as primary sense.

278
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:39,490
You're trying to keep the asymptomatic person from spreading to them.

279
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:56,650
So yeah, I can see your point. Depends on the perspective from your employee with asymptomatic case or your the other employees and the others.

280
00:59:01,180 --> 00:59:08,230
All right. Which prevention examples do you think would have the biggest impact on public health?

281
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:19,480
Seatbelts. Yes.

282
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:32,640
Driving around, I think there is plenty of research showing that how to reduce events on the road took a big one as vaccination the polio vaccine.

283
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:45,959
Back when people were not so skeptical of vaccines and got them, some diseases were eradicated for the most part.

284
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,310
And now you see the impact of the entire vaccine.

285
00:59:52,070 --> 01:00:00,230
Information. And there's a polio outbreak around New York City currently, and that's not good.

286
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:12,290
Any others? Mammography for a healthy 55 year old.

287
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:16,250
Catching the cancer early can increase the survival rate.

288
01:00:16,790 --> 01:00:21,560
Very on yes. Screenings to take things.

289
01:00:28,130 --> 01:00:34,190
When you're designing or implementing ideas, implanting ideas, it's like,

290
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:39,680
what do you have to keep in mind when you're designing or implementing a prevention strategy?

291
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:52,420
Accessibility, making sure as many people at risk of the disease can have access to it.

292
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,990
Yes, that's a very big goal. Get the target population.

293
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:06,090
Yes. You very much need to consider these things. How feasible your intervention might be.

294
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:11,790
Yeah. If you can't accomplish it, it could be the best design in your head.

295
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,230
And if you can't actually implement this, it's useless.

296
01:01:19,510 --> 01:01:28,650
I just for some prevention strategies for COVID 19 currently in place.

297
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,899
That's matters. Yes. Okay.

298
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:41,230
Which ones do you think are primary, secondary or tertiary?

299
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:55,690
Think like health education student We could probably go into every category just because there needed to be information of this first stage.

300
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:59,680
Definitely education you can get at every point in this.

301
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:05,570
You can be somebody that doesn't have coverage.

302
01:02:05,650 --> 01:02:08,830
You want to do your best to prevent getting it.

303
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:14,770
So you would do things like the primary prevention of getting nights needed, wearing a mask.

304
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:23,219
Secondary prevention getting tested, even though you're asymptomatic because you think you get exposed and don't want to walk around.

305
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:29,459
Just kind of being a teacher engaged and thinking, Oh, I'm not sick so I can spread.

306
01:02:29,460 --> 01:02:33,450
It is true. And for tertiary prevention.

307
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:44,839
What have we got for that? Others like those new antibody therapies or even a couple of I know Pfizer just like just

308
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:48,560
released a pill that you can take a high risk for severe disease and test positive.

309
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:52,730
Yes. Like hacksaw ridge and then monoclonal antibodies and things like that.

310
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:57,590
Even just like regular flu medicine can lessen the symptoms. Yes.

311
01:02:57,860 --> 01:03:09,300
Things you can do to reduce the impact of disease. That's all we actually have for today.

312
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:17,940
So. Anyone would like to stay in here for an extra 15 minutes or so.

313
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:22,900
So on this submission thing, it has us all as one big group.

314
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:27,220
Oh, I don't know. But if we're on like a 1017.

315
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:31,690
So you have to keep re attempting it to, like, have to come and look.

316
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:39,970
Yeah. Submit your assignments.

317
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:56,490
Oh, yeah. He says, I want to show you something.

318
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:16,160
You know, I realized that I, I looked around and I said, go ahead.

319
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:26,900
And, you know, for next time, you're going to be like, Oh, yeah, I can put it off.

320
01:04:28,010 --> 01:04:37,520
Are we supposed to talk? Did he say we should email him or get what he's got?

321
01:04:38,420 --> 01:05:02,990
I don't care what you I got this this week, it was 77%, you know, at least partly because it was early and you make it bigger.

322
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:12,470
And I think, you know.

323
01:05:17,580 --> 01:06:06,410
It's. I should work on how I can engage the business owners and the union members to, you know, you need to work.

324
01:06:07,260 --> 01:06:22,650
I see what I have to do.

325
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:31,980
Oh, yes, we can. All right.
