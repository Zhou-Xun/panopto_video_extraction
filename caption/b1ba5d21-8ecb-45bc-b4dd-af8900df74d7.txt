1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,750
Probably without based things like I don't see how you were in the same ballpark.

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:14,100
The job is to be very low and for.

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:30,210
Good morning, everyone. Happy Friday. Yeah, we have a lot to cover today, so I'm going to just get started.

4
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,750
We'll take breaks, but I need to get through these two presentations.

5
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:44,190
I have a small brief and I promise to refer to the one that I did for you guys this week.

6
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:53,370
On the gestational weight gain outcomes in pregnancy, which I will just record this afternoon and post a few guys to watch on your own.

7
00:00:55,140 --> 00:01:03,180
So yeah, so for this presentation, we're going to be talking.

8
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,480
So we're basically going to move from metabolic patients to physiologic.

9
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,410
And that's going to be the sort of the underpinning for our discussion today as well as moving forward.

10
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,230
So to understand the physiologic adaptations that occur in the cardiovascular,

11
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:28,020
hematologic and renal systems specifically as they relate to expansion of play,

12
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:39,210
but I want to just acknowledge right from the get go that there is a lot of different adaptations that occur in pregnancy to many systems.

13
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:49,829
We're just focusing on these three systems, specifically to the expansion of blood buying, understand the concept of hemo dilution,

14
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:59,550
and that's going to influence how we interpret the results of biochemical or laboratory tests, or at least some or a couple.

15
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:10,110
We don't actually have a lot of data in understanding how human dilution affects a number of lab tests, but we do, at least for a few,

16
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:15,660
describe the physiologic changes in gastrointestinal system and then understand

17
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,880
why the physiologic adaptations in pregnancy are critical for pregnancy outcomes.

18
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:29,400
So again, these learning objectives are important tools for understanding the material moving forward.

19
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:41,340
So it's a good resource. Before we start, I just want to clarify what we mean by gestation.

20
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:49,830
When we talk about trimesters, I have to say, you know what, when I'm teaching the course, I start to remember, but I forget to.

21
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:56,790
So this is just to help you. So the first trimester well, first of all, gestation in humans is approximately 40 weeks or nine months,

22
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:05,640
and it's measured in trimesters beginning with the first day of a pregnant person's last menstrual period.

23
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:09,570
Okay. So the first trimester is weeks, one through 12.

24
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:19,140
Second trimester and so forth. So we'll be referring to these trimesters throughout the semester.

25
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:30,239
So okay, so the physiologic changes that occur in pregnancy are actually considerable.

26
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:36,630
It's pretty remarkable. I just find this information, this whole topic very interesting.

27
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:44,550
But anyway, that they begin very early in pregnancy, in some cases 3 to 4 weeks.

28
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:48,840
I mean, it's amazing how early some of these adaptations begin.

29
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,970
And these changes are normal with the metabolic adaptations in that presentation.

30
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,210
These are normal and they are regulated by the hormones produced in pregnancy.

31
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,380
Okay. And these physiologic changes are essential.

32
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,229
The ones that we're going to be talking about today to ensure adequate blood

33
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:15,570
volume so that there's adequate nutrient and gas exchange in the placenta.

34
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,300
And ultimately, obviously, that is for optimal fetal development.

35
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,030
So increase blood volume of the pregnant person.

36
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:36,030
Again, the whole reason why we're covering these adaptations is because we need adequate, adequate blood volume.

37
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:45,600
For nutrient and gas exchange. And when I refer to gas exchange,

38
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:57,629
I'm referring to oxygen perfusion from the pregnant person's circulation to the fetus and then from the fetus waste products,

39
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:02,850
including CO2, which it diffuses into.

40
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:07,530
You know, again, the placenta is facilitating this,

41
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:17,879
but we have perfusion from or diffusion from the fetus in terms of CO2 into maternal or the pregnant

42
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:27,390
person's circulatory system for expelling and likewise O2 being taken up by the placenta for the fetus.

43
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,560
So when I talk about gas exchange, that's what I'm referring to, the O2 CO2.

44
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:38,280
And again, these three systems are involved in the expansion of blood volume.

45
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:50,320
I just wanted to show you just a graph of our figure that shows the changes in pregnancy hormones.

46
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:59,370
These are just a select few. And specifically, I just wanted to note estradiol or estrogen and progesterone.

47
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:07,230
So estrogen is the solid black line and progesterone is the dotted line that's near the bottom here.

48
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:18,220
But estrogen and you guys don't need to know the specifics, but I it's I think it's visually helpful.

49
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:25,170
We're going to be talking about the influence of estrogen and progesterone in early pregnancy.

50
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:33,990
And even though it doesn't look like there's much of an increase in either estrogen and progesterone, it's enough that it has profound effects.

51
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:39,509
So I think within a few weeks of pregnancy,

52
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:45,960
progesterone increases equal where you can't really see that here that you think it's not really what's going on in it.

53
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,180
But and the same for estrogen.

54
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:58,230
There is an increase very early in pregnancy in both estrogen and progesterone, even though it's not really evident here.

55
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:06,450
But then you'll notice, like estrogen really increases across pregnancy, like whites and progesterone.

56
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,139
Okay. The reason for going over estrogen and progesterone is because they play an

57
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:21,460
important role in the the physiologic adaptations in the cardiovascular system,

58
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:24,820
specifically the vascular system.

59
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:34,210
So Progesterone plays an important role in relaxing, smooth muscle tone of blood vessels.

60
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,010
So that means that these vessels can vaso dilate.

61
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:53,020
And expand enlarge. Likewise, estrogen mediates distend ability of vessels.

62
00:07:53,020 --> 00:08:01,990
Again, they can enlarge. There's more elasticity of those blood vessels so it can lead to vasodilation.

63
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,970
So both estrogen and progesterone. Contribute to blood vessels being able to.

64
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:24,170
In large. Dilate and essentially be less receptive or less influenced by vasoconstriction.

65
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:34,340
Okay. And then also, estrogen plays a role in angiogenesis, which is just the development of blood vessels.

66
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:42,710
So in pregnancy in particular, the capillary beds are going to expand in part to dissipate heat from the fetus.

67
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:52,610
So there'll be more capillary development. But there's also going to be vessel or vasculature development in the developing tissues.

68
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,919
So the uterus placenta, so the utero placental unit and so forth.

69
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:05,260
So there's expansion of vascular which you'll see later sometimes this expansion of the vascular vascular beds.

70
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:16,790
This means that this expansion in various vascular, whether it's developing tissue or development of capillaries and so forth,

71
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:25,880
to dissipate heat ultimately is just an expansion of the vascular system with this relaxation and angiogenesis.

72
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:34,010
Okay. If you have an expansion of the system, the vascular system, what's going to happen to blood pressure?

73
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:40,130
Right. Yeah, it's going to go down. So you have to build the system.

74
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:48,140
How do we fill it? Add more fluid.

75
00:09:50,480 --> 00:10:00,380
So the changes in the cardiovascular system, also what concurrently happens is the renal system is undergoing adaptations.

76
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,870
And so we see increased water uptake due to sodium uptake.

77
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:14,300
And so we fill the system with more fluid and that leads to increased blood volume.

78
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:23,000
So not only do we increase the plasma, red blood cell volume will also increase.

79
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:29,000
So this is a nice I like this figure provides a little bit of it provides an overview of where we're going.

80
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,430
Okay. Okay.

81
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:45,530
And the reason why we need increased blood volume is because it's volume that facilitates optimal nutrient and gas exchange in the placenta.

82
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:56,420
Okay. Okay. So next few slides, we're just going to talk about a little bit of what we see for changes in the cardiovascular system.

83
00:10:56,660 --> 00:11:05,210
So in the pregnant person, very early in pregnancy, so if you look at this figure on the right, you'll see that.

84
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:10,010
So you can see on the x axis, we have weeks of gestation.

85
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,080
So here's ten. Cut that in half.

86
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:23,390
That's five weeks. On the Y axis, we have total peripheral vascular resistance or systemic vascular resistance.

87
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:31,790
So you can see that by week five or six, we have a drop in systemic vascular resistance.

88
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:37,370
It happens really early in pregnancy. These changes in the cardiovascular system.

89
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:49,040
So systemic resistance or just vascular resistance simply refers to the resistance of blood vessels to the flow of blood.

90
00:11:49,670 --> 00:12:03,350
So it's the resistance that the heart has to overcome or the effort the heart has to exert to overcome resistance of blood vessels.

91
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,510
Right. So if we think about blood vessels and we has a this is by normal blood vessel.

92
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:18,830
If the blood vessel is vaso dilated as resistance go up or down, down, down, there's less resistance with a larger vessel.

93
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:23,810
If we take a vessel and we have vasoconstriction, what's the resistance?

94
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:34,850
Yeah, exactly. So in early pregnancy, because of the changes that are occurring in part mediated by estrogen and progesterone,

95
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:40,520
we have vasodilation and relaxation of smooth muscle tone of blood vessels.

96
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:44,120
We have vessel dilated, larger vessels.

97
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,600
Hence, vascular resistance declines. Okay, so these are consistent.

98
00:12:51,950 --> 00:13:03,620
And again, this resistance, this decline in resistance is essential for allowing ultimately the expansion or increasing blood volume.

99
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:13,370
Okay. You. In addition to decreased systemic vascular resistance, we.

100
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:20,250
An increase in cardiac output. Cardiac output increase of 30 to 50%.

101
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:27,000
Cardiac output is simply heart rate times, stroke volume.

102
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:37,530
Cardiac output increases in part due largely to the changes that occur in the renal system.

103
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:41,320
So if we have more fluid on the in the on board strike,

104
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:49,860
it's going to require more greater there's going to be greater stroke volume and that leads to increased heartbeat.

105
00:13:50,100 --> 00:14:00,360
So cardiac output increases 30 to 50% early in pregnancy and systemic vascular resistance declines early in pregnancy.

106
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:09,720
Those are the two hallmark or key changes in addition to just the changes to the blood vessels themselves.

107
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:13,890
Decrease smooth muscle tone and extend.

108
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:23,090
Okay. Just make sure I covered everything.

109
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:44,060
You know what I wanted to hear? Oh, okay.

110
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,700
Yep. Got it. All right. So those are the changes in the cardiovascular system.

111
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:56,270
The renal system responds to these changes in the vascular system.

112
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:08,870
So a decreased vascular resistance and really basically an expansion of the vascular system we have under filling.

113
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:15,800
Right. Blood pressure would bottom out if there was not a response of the renal system.

114
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:29,840
So this activates the RAAS system, the renin angiotensin aldosterone system, and ultimately that leads to water absorption in kidney by the kidney.

115
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,580
So we have increased. We have fluid retention. Yeah.

116
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,570
And basically what that really means is we have expansion of plasma.

117
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:44,300
So the fluid component of our whole blood or total blood is plasma.

118
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:47,390
So this is just going to result in increased plasma.

119
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:53,450
I mean, obviously, there's going to be increased water or fluid in ram tissues and so forth.

120
00:15:53,450 --> 00:16:02,390
But ultimately it's an increase in plasma. Increased plasma, you increase total blood volume.

121
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:13,460
Yeah. So the adaptations that we see in the renal system, these two begin very early in pregnancy, in some cases 3 to 4 weeks.

122
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:23,720
So anatomically, the kidneys increase in size and weight, largely because we see decreased vascular resistance in the kidneys.

123
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:29,930
So we see increased vasodilation. There's increased renal flow in the kidneys.

124
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:38,200
This leads to an increase glomerular filtration rate or GFR.

125
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,920
So you're going to end up with an increase in filtrate.

126
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:54,909
And the significance of that is that then there's a mild increase in the amount of sodium, glucose, amino acids,

127
00:16:54,910 --> 00:17:02,470
calcium water soluble nutrients that are infiltrate that may not be reabsorbed and are excreted in urine.

128
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:06,520
Okay. We'll get back.

129
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:13,930
We'll circle back to that. But these adaptations in the renal system again are essential for the expansion of the blood volume.

130
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,130
This is just an overview of the system.

131
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:29,860
For those of you that are familiar, we see obviously there's an increase in estrogen levels early in pregnancy,

132
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:34,989
which leads to an increase in renin that increases angiotensin,

133
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:40,600
to which ultimately the important point on this flow diagram is that we get the

134
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:48,220
increase in aldosterone and that leads to sodium absorption from filtrate.

135
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:56,769
That's going to increase water absorption from filtrate back into the circulation.

136
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:07,150
And so we increase the fluid volume of both in circulation as well as of just overall extracellular.

137
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,910
In addition to expanding the plasma volume, red blood cell production A through Powys,

138
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:28,690
this is also stimulated the hormones, several pregnancy hormones that mediate this expansion of red blood cell production.

139
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:38,380
So Aretha polices is stimulated. It's important to recognize that the expansion of red blood cell mass is.

140
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:53,170
It takes a while. So there's this delay. Whereas we might see in the curve that if we were to look at the change in plasma over gestation plasma,

141
00:18:53,410 --> 00:19:02,050
the curve might look well, not quite like that. And it might look something like that.

142
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:12,100
Whereas red blood cell, it takes a while, right? It's delayed and it actually doesn't increase to the same degree as plasma.

143
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:22,600
So with red blood cell expansion, there's a lag time, just an increase in the production to the point that it's measurable.

144
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:31,360
And overall red blood cell expansion is just not to the same degree as plasma expansion.

145
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,350
You got to see that down there. Yes. Okay.

146
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:50,260
So circling back to the implications of the renal system adaptations in terms of nutrition or nutritional status.

147
00:19:50,770 --> 00:20:01,930
Again, there is a mild loss of amino acids, water soluble nutrients and so forth in the filtrate.

148
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:13,360
Again, this is just sort of a byproduct of the adaptations that are occurring in the renal system.

149
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:17,980
Again, there's considerable increase in renal flow filtrate.

150
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:29,950
And so to some of these, it's not clear if the absorption mechanisms in the renal tubules are or the nephrons are just overwhelmed.

151
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,680
I'm not sure exactly the mechanism. I'm not sure they know the mechanism, but there is some loss.

152
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:42,610
Metabolic and nutrient metabolism adaptations, which we'll talk about with some of these nutrients,

153
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,900
mitigate this loss as well as ensuring an adequate diet.

154
00:20:47,440 --> 00:21:02,650
So those two strategies are factors mitigate or reduce the itch issue about nutrient loss in urine.

155
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,559
Okay. Any questions about the renal system?

156
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,430
Cardiovascular. All right.

157
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:16,330
So the last one that I want to go through is the hematologic system.

158
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:21,820
And I think this is all pretty intuitive because these are all, all interface.

159
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:29,110
So the responses to the cardiovascular and the renal system obviously is going to change the hematologic system.

160
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:33,580
So we see an increase in beginning as early as 6 to 8 weeks.

161
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:43,780
There's obviously increase in plasma. And then we also see the stimulus in a re through process and expansion, red blood.

162
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:59,520
Sell volume. One of the issues that occurs with the expansion in the hematologic system and expansion of plasma is that we see hemo dilution.

163
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:08,670
So because we have this sort of differential expansion where plasma is right from the get go is high.

164
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:20,370
So we have sort of a delay. And even without the sort of lag time and red blood cell production, it's not to the same degree of plasma.

165
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,940
We get a phenomenon called human dilution and this is normal.

166
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:35,760
So and this just reflects that the concentration of a biomarker is going to be lower

167
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:40,919
just because it's a proportional difference between plasma and red blood cells.

168
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:50,850
So, for example, hemoglobin is a biomarker that's routinely used to assess for anemia this biomarker,

169
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,250
the concentration of it is lower because of this hemo dilution effect.

170
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:04,200
And so we have specific cutoff values in pregnancy that takes into account human dilution.

171
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:11,550
Okay. So again, this is just due to the proportional difference in blood volume relative to red blood cell volume.

172
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:21,230
Once red blood cell volume catches up, we still see human dilution throughout the whole gestation, but it's not to the same degree here.

173
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,150
On your question, I just want to ask like,

174
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:30,030
how does this impact like generally like if a pregnant woman wants to exercise because I know like hemoglobin,

175
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:37,380
like halo, like it can be hard, like, well, it's not low, not low enough or they won't see anything.

176
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:41,760
Let me show you what the cutoffs are. So this is from the CDC.

177
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:49,110
This is has the cutoffs for hemoglobin and actually is cross light stages.

178
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:56,880
But if you look at the middle of the table, you see the nonpregnant female.

179
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:02,429
The cutoff for hemoglobin is that 12 grams per deciliter.

180
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:14,040
So if if a woman has a blood test and her hemoglobin is below 12 grams per deciliter, then she would be diagnosed with anemia.

181
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:23,370
In pregnancy, you'll see the cutoff for the first trimester is 11 and second trimester is 10.5.

182
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:30,300
That's when we see the you know, we've got plasma expansion, red blood cell volumes, not quite there yet.

183
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,360
So we see this proportional difference. And then by third trimester, we're back to 11.

184
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:43,620
So those are the cutoffs that is not going to impact someone who.

185
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:53,090
Yeah, yeah. The effects of human dilution on.

186
00:24:53,130 --> 00:25:01,200
And we also have specific cutoffs for hematocrit, which is also another test that's used to assess for anemia.

187
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:11,729
There was a Academy workshop a couple of years ago that it's for overall for pregnancy.

188
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:20,820
But it was acknowledging that when it comes to biomarkers in laboratory tests in pregnancy, there's a lot of gaps of knowledge.

189
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:25,680
And one of them, which is the effect of human dilution on other biomarkers.

190
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:29,459
So biomarkers that we might use to assess for iron deficiency anemia.

191
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:42,810
We don't know what the impact is of human dilution on ferritin or iron binding capacity or sam transparent receptor and so forth.

192
00:25:42,810 --> 00:25:50,730
So there are gaps in our knowledge in terms of the influence of human dilution on other laboratory tests of biomarkers.

193
00:25:53,730 --> 00:26:09,330
Okay. Just this is just a very basic overview of the placenta and it's just a reminder that nutrients o two precursors

194
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:18,360
for hormone production and so forth are taken up from the pregnant person's circulatory system into the placenta.

195
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:28,920
In the placenta, the it plays a key role in the development or production of hormones and so forth.

196
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:41,340
And then the nutrients that are enter the fetal circulation, likewise byproducts of metabolism as well as CO2 and other products.

197
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,970
Leave the fetal circulation. Enter the placenta in our.

198
00:26:49,780 --> 00:27:00,100
Then transported into maternal sperm, the pregnant person's circulation for excretion, expelling CO2 and so forth.

199
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:10,600
Okay. The other important point about the placenta is that it plays a key role in dissipating fetal heat into into the pregnant person's circulation.

200
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:16,240
The fetus is going to be generating heat, energy production and so forth.

201
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:22,960
It's going to be so the heat is dissipated via the placenta into maternal circulation.

202
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:32,950
And again, the expansion of capillary beds is going to allow the pregnant person to dissipate, heat out of the store, hands, feet and so forth.

203
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:52,550
This is just a cross section of the placenta. And I just wanted to just give you sort of a visual of the the exchange.

204
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:59,810
So the greenish or teal colored is blood coming in from the.

205
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:07,670
Pregnant person. These are specialized arteries that have been remodeled.

206
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:13,100
They were originally spiral arteries. So, again, this sort of heel color here.

207
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:20,080
These are very specific arteries that were originally what they call spiral.

208
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:29,060
And they've been they're remodeled very early in pregnancy to become these very large flaccid vessels.

209
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:39,710
So spiral arteries are narrow and spiral. These may be are remodeling and they're just large, very flaccid, not receptive to vaso constriction.

210
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:48,380
And the reason is, is because it's the volume of blood entering the placenta that fills the space,

211
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:56,240
essentially surrounds and bathes the structures here that facilitates nutrient and gas exchange.

212
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,520
So it's the volume, not pressure volume.

213
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:09,530
If you don't have adequate volume, there will be inadequate nutrient exchange and gas exchange.

214
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:12,740
And this is where your growth restriction will occur.

215
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:20,780
And in fact, there's been some studies. It hasn't been studied a lot.

216
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:28,099
And there's more interest that there's been some studies that have shown that pregnant individuals who do not have adequate

217
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:40,490
plasma expansion or another way to say this is plasma expansion or total body water is associated with birth weight.

218
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:48,020
So higher plasma or total body water is associated with higher birth weight.

219
00:29:49,190 --> 00:29:59,840
Likewise, if there is lower plasma volume or total body water, depending on how the measurement measured is associated with lower birth weight.

220
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:06,020
So there's a direct relationship between plasma for total body water expansion, depending on how they measure.

221
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:14,720
But it's pleasant expansion, total blood volume expansion and infant outcomes.

222
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:22,910
Okay. So again, it has to do with the fact that this is a system not under pressure, under volume.

223
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:28,400
Okay. And in fact, in some of the hypertensive disorders,

224
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,870
it can be everything from the spiral arteries not remodeling adequately and or being receptive

225
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:42,650
to vasoconstriction that results in less or reduce the volume entering the placenta,

226
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,210
which, again, is going to contribute to fetal growth restriction.

227
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:59,120
Okay. So so again, just sort of recap there.

228
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:05,330
The adaptations in a pregnant person are essential for new vascular needs.

229
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:14,650
So we know that there is expansion of vascular beds, angiogenesis for the placental or a year old placental unit breasts.

230
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:22,130
There is vasculature increases in the breasts, dissipation of heat.

231
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:27,500
So we have peripheral vasodilation and also expansion of capillary bed.

232
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:32,450
And again, this is critical for optimal.

233
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:41,480
And I'm using maternal in this case because the maternal fetal exchange is a phrase you'll see quite a bit in the literature.

234
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:50,390
But this expansion also is important for maintaining the pregnant person's blood pressure.

235
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:57,650
Right. Vascular system has expanded. These are dilation as well with the new vessels.

236
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:03,800
And so we have to build up speed in order to make new blood pressure.

237
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:10,280
The increase in red blood cell mass is required for oxygen requirements.

238
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:16,100
So developing tissues require O2, right?

239
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:29,360
So O2 is with increasing the red blood cell mass here, increasing the oxygen carrying capacity for developing tissues production.

240
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:36,410
And then this these adaptations also compensate for blood loss at delivery.

241
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:46,610
Okay. Any questions about the systems we just covered?

242
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:53,990
Yeah, it's pretty amazing when you think about the process.

243
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,770
All right. Let's motor through the gastrointestinal changes.

244
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:06,770
And then we'll take a break and then we'll move on to energy requirements.

245
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,090
So there's physiologic changes in the gastrointestinal system.

246
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:20,450
And because of the influence of progesterone, particularly this main estrogen, is also playing a role.

247
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:31,640
We have smooth muscle tone changes, so it influences motility and tone of muscles in the GI tract,

248
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,130
and that's also going to influence nutrient absorption.

249
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:40,640
So some of these changes are positive and some of these changes are a nuisance for the pregnant person.

250
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:52,280
So again, because of decreased muscle tone, the sphincters of so here in this case esophageal sphincter,

251
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:56,570
we have decreased tone and this occurs especially by the third trimester,

252
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:08,600
but it can occur earlier and this leads to heartburn reflux of stomach contents and so forth.

253
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:20,240
And then obviously as gestation progresses, you have the, you know, the growing fetus pushing up against the stomach and so forth.

254
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:26,390
So all of this can contribute. So it's not surprising that 30 to 80% of pregnant women experience heartburn.

255
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:35,260
So this just shows an image of the sphincter between the stomach and the esophagus.

256
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:43,399
And again, the softening of that sphincter due to high levels of progesterone and estrogen may play a role,

257
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:52,610
but oftentimes they highlight progesterone. It's going to allow stomach contents to enter the esophagus.

258
00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:04,330
Okay. And this just the figure on the left just shows the prevalence of GERD, which is just gastro esophageal reflux disease.

259
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:11,260
And that tends to we tend to see it in pregnancy. And obviously it's going to be higher as gestation progresses.

260
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:16,479
The fetus becomes larger, pushing up against the stomach and so forth.

261
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,370
So girds is a common issue. Yeah, well, it's like that.

262
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:32,260
So many people experience increased rates of heartburn and you just kind of have to deal with it or would you like to have it so they can treat it?

263
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:41,770
So. So the first step is to just encourage the first one to find out if they're eating small frequent meals,

264
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:49,930
because large meals are going to create that pressure. So small frequent meals are recommended and acids are fine.

265
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:57,610
And for women or for pregnant individuals who have severe or severe heartburn triggers,

266
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:04,060
they can they will prescribe or it can be prescribed proton pump inhibitors.

267
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:20,500
Yeah, yeah, that's right. It actually doesn't even have to just be the inhibitors.

268
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,830
It can be. What's the step down? They're just antagonists.

269
00:36:25,930 --> 00:36:31,690
Proton pump inhibitors, I think are like, is that like ever written down?

270
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:36,110
I don't know that they would go to proton pump inhibitors.

271
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:43,989
So Prilosec and Nexium or the proton pump inhibitors, Pepcid and Tagamet and Zantac or the H2 receptor antagonist.

272
00:36:43,990 --> 00:36:50,140
So they probably start with that. And and then if that wasn't resolved, they would go to the proton pump inhibitors.

273
00:36:55,030 --> 00:37:02,020
Okay. So with the stomach, we see decreased motility and tone again under the influence of progesterone.

274
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:12,280
So and also not only do we see the upper sphincter, but the lower pyloric sphincter is its confidence is also diminished.

275
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:18,610
So you can get alcohol and do it down the duodenum or contents in the stomach.

276
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:30,490
So it's called reverse peristalsis. And again, it just has to do with the sphincters not having the same kind of confidence in prior prior pregnancy.

277
00:37:30,910 --> 00:37:33,430
So this can contribute to nausea and vomiting.

278
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:42,130
And in fact, 50 to 80% of pregnant individuals experience nausea and vomiting, especially in early pregnancy.

279
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:48,040
And that's like the main cause of it. No, probably not.

280
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:55,840
It's I think there's also thought that there's certain pregnancy hormones that also contribute.

281
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,730
Um, yeah, but that doesn't help with that.

282
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:15,190
So strategies to reduce nausea, there's a whole list of approaches and everything from, you know, eating crackers before getting out of bed.

283
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:27,790
Frequent small meals on anything that's ginger based can help everything from soda, tea or ginger snaps for individuals who are not.

284
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:34,850
Showing decline and symptoms with the sort of straightforward crackers or ginger or other,

285
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:44,020
they can try a supplement with vitamin B6 as well as taking.

286
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:48,290
So taking B6 and there was something else that they were supposed to take with it.

287
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:57,170
But anyway, just taking B6 will sometimes reduce nausea wearing a C band.

288
00:38:57,590 --> 00:39:02,110
So sort of the acupuncture or acupuncture site.

289
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:07,100
So a C band then. Very familiar. A C band, yeah.

290
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:11,930
C bands can be worn for people, sailors.

291
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:21,050
And it's a strap that has a little plastic nodule that presses, presses on the acupuncture site and that can reduce nausea.

292
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:28,310
I had no idea when I was pregnant that didn't do a thing for me, unfortunately, but I tried it.

293
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:42,890
There's a great for those of you who, you know, your career plans may be working with clients who are pregnant.

294
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:48,970
The ACOG has a great practice bulletin and I've got the reference down here.

295
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:54,270
They have great guidelines for dealing with nausea and vomiting in pregnancy.

296
00:39:54,270 --> 00:40:01,260
And I think the same one that for those women and pregnant individuals who actually have severe.

297
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:14,970
So beyond just the strategies we discuss, they also talk about other strategies, including medication to help mitigate the the and vomiting.

298
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:26,980
And there's the guideline. Okay.

299
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:32,879
In the small intestine, we see decreased tone and motility again because of progesterone.

300
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,890
But this is positive because it allows more time for nutrients to be absorbed.

301
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:43,530
So in the in our intestine, if food, if that big bolus,

302
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:51,720
the food bolus is transiting slower than other words, it takes more transit time to get through.

303
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,880
That's going to allow more time for nutrient absorption.

304
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:11,670
That coupled with the fact that one of the adaptations that occurs in pregnancy is that we see duodenum, villi height in the small intestine increase.

305
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:18,570
So height increases as well as the amount. And so that increases nutrient absorption.

306
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:33,990
So increased height in the small intestine, coupled with decreased tone and motility, is going to expand and enhance nutrient absorption.

307
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:43,700
The downside to decrease tone of motility is that it can lead to constipation.

308
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:48,420
So in the colon we say see the same issue, decreased tone and motility.

309
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,660
Again, with the food bolus transiting through.

310
00:41:54,840 --> 00:42:02,490
If it's going through slowly, that means there's more time for water to be absorbed from the food bolus out.

311
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:08,280
And so less water, you're going to have a higher risk of developing constipation.

312
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:26,489
And this is particularly problematic in the second and third trimesters of the waist to so how can we reduce risk of constipation?

313
00:42:26,490 --> 00:42:36,870
What would be strategies to make sure that fiber throughout the day you have adequate fiber?

314
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,549
And what else as a doctor?

315
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:54,120
Yes, adequate water. Yeah. What else is one other non dietary approach if yes.

316
00:42:54,360 --> 00:43:02,040
Yes. And so ensure that they're getting adequate dietary fiber water and that they're getting some form of exercise.

317
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:10,380
That being said, I can tell you from experience by the third trimester, I had a high fiber diet.

318
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,040
I was walking all the time drinking lots of water and it still happened.

319
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:28,410
So it can it will. It's just it's and so there's laxatives that are safe to take in pregnancy that work effectively.

320
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:36,540
I took Phillips Milk of Magnesia, which is nothing more than a solution that's very high in magnesium.

321
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:45,660
And just because you have a high sol you load in the milk of magnesia, brings water into the intestinal tract, works beautifully.

322
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:55,860
So just know that they can do everything right and it can still happen.

323
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,510
So. But there's ways to address that.

324
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:12,050
So. There's actually a Cochrane review in 2015 that found that stimulant laxatives might be more effective because it increases motility.

325
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,980
That being said, there were not a lot of randomized controlled trials for it.

326
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:23,090
So but I think it really comes down to trying something.

327
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:26,450
If that doesn't work, there's other laxative types to try.

328
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:38,180
Okay. I like about like herbal use and things like with something like senna or like other herbs, like be like safe or unsafe.

329
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,320
So the short answer is.

330
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,500
If it's not something that's been studied,

331
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:57,490
there is hesitancy in using herbal remedies without knowing what the impact would be on the developing fetus.

332
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:04,560
Yeah. Are pregnant individuals also approved to take probiotics?

333
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:14,350
That it's not a recommendation, but consuming yogurt if they can if they are willing to take dairy.

334
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:23,320
I mean, if they are dairy consumers, because we know that a healthy microbiome is important and we'll be talking about that later in the semester,

335
00:45:23,830 --> 00:45:28,590
that doesn't mean to say that they can't take probiotics if they don't consume dairy.

336
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:37,270
But I mean, I'm all for food first before we try it, before we have to use a supplement.

337
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:41,550
Yeah, but yes. Short answer is anything that say.

338
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:46,450
Yeah. And there's, you know, there's foods that are fermented that I mean,

339
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:57,460
in populations that might be consuming sauerkraut or kimchi or those are all anything that has bacterial fermentation is great.

340
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:07,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In relation to the last slide about taking frequent small meals that have any impact on decreasing insulin sensitivity.

341
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:14,170
It was. So you're concerned about. Oh, so it's just been IBD?

342
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:22,800
Yeah. The short answer is no.

343
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:27,330
Unless okay. Some caveats. That is gestational diabetes.

344
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:40,320
The caveat to that statement is if the pregnant person is at risk for diabetes or if they have,

345
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:49,830
they are showing early signs of glucose intolerance, then but still it's going to be small frequent meals.

346
00:46:51,870 --> 00:46:56,610
When I say small frequent meals, it means that they may.

347
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:03,570
So we have in the United States, generally speaking, we have breakfast, lunch and dinner, but then they include snacks.

348
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:10,530
So snacking between breakfast and lunch and a snack in between lunch and dinner and maybe even a bedtime snack.

349
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:17,400
But those snacks become larger in the meals becomes smaller just because.

350
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:26,300
As you know, it's hard to consume much food, especially as the fetus gets larger.

351
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:33,590
Now, if a person is at risk for diabetes and or is showing signs of glucose intolerance,

352
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:42,650
then the nutrition management for diabetes would be implemented.

353
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:46,700
So it would not mean that the number of males would change.

354
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:54,079
It just means that they may be having to do fingerstick checking their glucose and

355
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:01,310
monitoring the types of carbohydrates they're consuming and making adjustments that way.

356
00:48:01,730 --> 00:48:10,910
Thank you. Yep. Yep. And we will talk more about that with gestational diabetes later on.

357
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:15,379
Yeah, but no, it's an important question. So the frequency of meals wouldn't change.

358
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:19,250
It would just be the the meal itself in terms of what?

359
00:48:19,340 --> 00:48:22,490
Sponsor. Yeah. Yep. Yep.

360
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:29,230
Okay, let's take a five minute break and get up.

361
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:38,930
Stretch, move around, replace her water. Right.

362
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:47,480
You're not gonna take her home today.

363
00:48:59,332 --> 00:49:03,242
Okay, let's move on.

364
00:49:03,412 --> 00:49:09,472
Let's shift gears and we're going to talk about energy requirements and gestational weight gain in pregnancy.

365
00:49:18,682 --> 00:49:26,841
So it's important for you to understand the basis for energy requirements and will highlight.

366
00:49:26,842 --> 00:49:32,542
We'll talk a little bit about that. Describe the components that contribute to the energy cost to pregnancy.

367
00:49:34,162 --> 00:49:39,322
Explain why energy intake requirements differ depending on the trimester,

368
00:49:41,062 --> 00:49:48,052
and then recommend the dietary reference intake drive for energy for the second and third trimesters.

369
00:49:53,062 --> 00:50:05,302
So energy intake in the non-pregnant adult is the amount of energy that is needed to maintain essentially the individual's health and weight.

370
00:50:06,052 --> 00:50:14,632
Okay. So it's basically in a very simplistic term, it's the balance between energy intake and energy expended.

371
00:50:16,272 --> 00:50:29,092
And in the pregnant adult, there's additional energy required for tissue formation and the increase in energy expenditure of the pregnant person.

372
00:50:29,992 --> 00:50:39,802
Okay. So adequate energy is required for development of both tissues of the pregnant individual as well as the developing fetus.

373
00:50:42,052 --> 00:50:45,202
And this is going to lead to weight gain. Okay.

374
00:50:45,442 --> 00:50:50,392
So in this case, there will be a change.

375
00:50:52,192 --> 00:51:08,121
The balance is an equal between input and output. There's a gain of weight that the energy requirements that the Academy essentially used to derive.

376
00:51:08,122 --> 00:51:14,582
These measurements came from studies that assessed total energy expenditure in pregnancy.

377
00:51:14,602 --> 00:51:20,932
There were a number of studies that have assessed energy expenditure across gestation,

378
00:51:21,532 --> 00:51:26,062
as well as the energy costs that are associated with tissue formation.

379
00:51:26,932 --> 00:51:33,052
Again, tissue formation in the fetus as well as tissue formation of the pregnant person.

380
00:51:33,352 --> 00:51:42,052
So again, that utero placental unit breast, but again, it also includes expansion of the vascular bed and so forth.

381
00:51:42,142 --> 00:51:48,592
So we have really sort of two key sources of energy requirements in pregnancy.

382
00:51:48,592 --> 00:51:58,072
It's the increase and energy requirement of the pregnant person as well as the energy associated with tissue formation.

383
00:52:04,402 --> 00:52:12,322
So in terms of the total energy expenditure of the pregnant person, I just wanted to review very quickly total energy expenditure.

384
00:52:12,502 --> 00:52:16,942
T is composed of a number of components.

385
00:52:18,022 --> 00:52:25,042
So I'm going to go to the bottom one. Active activity and energy expenditure, the orange component.

386
00:52:25,852 --> 00:52:30,582
Obviously, this is going to contribute to the pregnant person's energy requirements.

387
00:52:30,592 --> 00:52:37,492
But I will say that almost consistently physical activity levels tend to decline across pregnancy.

388
00:52:38,152 --> 00:52:52,642
Even those who are active in their physical activity, it just tends to decline because as the pregnant person becomes larger and so forth,

389
00:52:52,852 --> 00:52:56,092
they just usually are not able to keep up at the same levels.

390
00:52:57,892 --> 00:53:04,192
So physical activity tends to decline across pregnancy, the thermic effect of food.

391
00:53:04,192 --> 00:53:10,821
So that's the energy required in digestion of food that doesn't appear to change in pregnancy.

392
00:53:10,822 --> 00:53:14,212
So that is not really a contributing factor.

393
00:53:15,352 --> 00:53:25,522
The component that. Contributes the most city e or total energy expenditure in pregnant individuals is based on metabolic rate.

394
00:53:26,752 --> 00:53:34,492
So this is the energy that's required when the body is at rest, 12 to 15 hours after a meal is consumed.

395
00:53:34,972 --> 00:53:41,332
And this is the energy that's required for cellular function, respiratory and so forth.

396
00:53:41,332 --> 00:53:44,482
So all basically the core processes of the body.

397
00:53:47,422 --> 00:53:56,482
So again, the major component of total energy expenditure in the pregnant person is generally the phase of metabolic rate.

398
00:54:00,592 --> 00:54:07,551
This figure shows changes in the basal metabolic rate across gestation.

399
00:54:07,552 --> 00:54:12,652
So on the x axis we have stage of pregnancy or gestation and on the y axis

400
00:54:12,652 --> 00:54:19,791
we have basal metabolic rate and we have this stratify by pre-pregnancy BMI.

401
00:54:19,792 --> 00:54:28,642
And you can see that for all BMI levels, we see an increase in basal metabolic rate across gestation or more so,

402
00:54:29,092 --> 00:54:32,302
or shall I say it's pronounced during the third trimester.

403
00:54:35,532 --> 00:54:42,462
So why are we seeing this increase, this considerable increase in BMR during the third trimester?

404
00:54:43,032 --> 00:54:50,322
And does it have to do with the fetus rapidly developing rapidly development of the fetus?

405
00:54:50,682 --> 00:54:57,492
So there's a lot of tissue formation occurring and so forth.

406
00:54:57,652 --> 00:55:05,802
So there's variability in the BMR early in early gestation.

407
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,972
Some studies show that it can be fairly even in this one.

408
00:55:10,512 --> 00:55:12,881
Some of the lines don't really shift much,

409
00:55:12,882 --> 00:55:20,142
but definitely by the third trimester you see this upward tick of basal metabolic rate and that makes sense, right?

410
00:55:20,472 --> 00:55:23,592
The energy needs are going to be higher during the third trimester.

411
00:55:23,592 --> 00:55:26,652
So total energy expenditure is going to be higher. Yeah.

412
00:55:30,462 --> 00:55:41,162
Okay. So that will address total energy expenditure required or just that component of energy needs in pregnancy.

413
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:46,602
Now we're going to shift gears and talk about the energy needs related to tissue formation.

414
00:55:47,292 --> 00:55:55,762
So the table in the slide is actually from the workshop report that the National Academy produced.

415
00:55:55,812 --> 00:55:59,412
This is the hour drive for energy carbohydrate.

416
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:08,922
And so far there are macronutrients. This is the energy cost of tissue deposition for tissue development.

417
00:56:08,922 --> 00:56:14,712
When I when I say tissue deposition, I simply mean tissue formation during pregnancy.

418
00:56:14,982 --> 00:56:23,202
So in the table, you'll see the primary components of tissue deposition or formation that we have,

419
00:56:23,412 --> 00:56:29,922
the actual grams of protein associated with each of the different tissues in pregnancy.

420
00:56:30,072 --> 00:56:33,402
And these are averages taken from multiple studies.

421
00:56:35,112 --> 00:56:44,562
We think that genes, in fact, in grams that are associated, these are main values associated with each of the tissue types.

422
00:56:46,032 --> 00:56:50,562
So protein and grams, protein content, fat content.

423
00:56:51,972 --> 00:57:02,712
And then they have we have two columns. This is the energy density of those tissues killing calories from protein and fat.

424
00:57:03,102 --> 00:57:16,962
And then on the far right column is the total energy deposition or the total energy associated with protein and fat for each of those tissues.

425
00:57:19,272 --> 00:57:35,472
Okay. I. In terms of tissues that contribute the most to our energy needs.

426
00:57:35,862 --> 00:57:41,562
Which one? But which of the tissues contributes most to energy needs?

427
00:57:47,242 --> 00:57:50,552
And you could button the uterus.

428
00:57:51,452 --> 00:57:57,332
So the uterus contributes quite a bit in terms of protein content.

429
00:58:00,182 --> 00:58:09,632
And in fact, when you look at the calorie associated with it, it's the highest.

430
00:58:11,432 --> 00:58:24,832
But if you look at this bar column here, it's lower than one other and few maternal stores.

431
00:58:24,842 --> 00:58:31,742
And I didn't clarify that for you. But if you'll note, the only place that we have information on maternal stores is in the back column.

432
00:58:32,102 --> 00:58:40,082
So this is where the pregnant person is storing.

433
00:58:40,472 --> 00:58:44,012
So go back to your metabolic adaptations in pregnancy.

434
00:58:44,342 --> 00:58:46,872
Early pregnancy is characterized by one.

435
00:58:47,572 --> 00:59:02,852
And so it's it's characterized by fuel storage because of what, two things normal essentially normal sensitivity of the tissues.

436
00:59:03,482 --> 00:59:06,962
They respond to insulin. But what's the key mechanism also?

437
00:59:07,202 --> 00:59:19,352
So normal sensitivity in early pregnancy tissues that insulin sensitivity of tissues, but increased insulin, insulin secretion, yes.

438
00:59:19,802 --> 00:59:26,972
So when you have higher insulin secretion with tissues that are sensitive to insulin,

439
00:59:27,212 --> 00:59:35,522
you're going to get rapid uptake of glucose in the cells and any excess fuel is going to be stored.

440
00:59:35,912 --> 00:59:48,842
So early pregnancy is characterized by fuel storage and you can see that it's one of the largest tissue formations.

441
00:59:48,842 --> 00:59:53,222
Energy deposition in terms of calories.

442
00:59:53,552 --> 00:59:58,502
Yep. So what exactly are the maternal stores? Where is that in the book at this point?

443
00:59:58,952 --> 01:00:12,172
It just depends. Individual. I notice sometimes when I'm lecturing, I'm going, okay, but it it's wherever it's yeah, yeah, yeah.

444
01:00:17,102 --> 01:00:20,491
There's going to be genetic variation of fat stores.

445
01:00:20,492 --> 01:00:27,902
But essentially it's the expansion of maternal stores that stores that occur early in pregnancy.

446
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:38,722
Okay. So tissue formation in pregnancy is going to include all of these.

447
01:00:38,992 --> 01:00:47,542
They took into account all these different tissue types. So we know that there is energy needs from a protein standpoint, from a fat standpoint,

448
01:00:48,652 --> 01:01:00,352
but certainly it's maternal store or the pregnant person's fuel stores, adipose stores that are contribute considerably to the energy requirement.

449
01:01:05,442 --> 01:01:18,702
Okay. So this is the type of information that informed the National Academy for establishing nutrient or energy intake requirements in pregnancy.

450
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:25,362
Okay. Is tissue formation information and total energy expenditure.

451
01:01:25,842 --> 01:01:31,542
So we can see that in the first trimester, there's no recommended increase in energy intake.

452
01:01:32,292 --> 01:01:46,602
That is, there's no specific requirement to increase caloric intake because weight gain is is there is tends to be fairly minimal in early pregnancy,

453
01:01:47,022 --> 01:01:53,352
but there is variability in that. But I'm just saying, on average, it tends to be minimal.

454
01:01:54,852 --> 01:02:00,072
Second trimester is where we see the first increase in energy requirement.

455
01:02:01,302 --> 01:02:12,702
So again, taking into account the energy costs of protein and fat deposition or tissue formation,

456
01:02:12,942 --> 01:02:31,842
it ends up being 180 calories per day, plus the additional total energy expenditure, which is 160 calories per day today.

457
01:02:32,112 --> 01:02:39,702
Per day. Yeah. Okay. So again, this information total energy expenditure,

458
01:02:39,912 --> 01:02:49,542
then add those up is 340 additional calories per day in the second trimester to meet these energy requirement needs.

459
01:02:51,762 --> 01:02:56,501
And some educational materials, we think, well,

460
01:02:56,502 --> 01:03:07,172
this rounded out the 300 but I do find you guys need to know what the DRI is that 340 additional calories.

461
01:03:08,082 --> 01:03:15,882
And adjustments can be made depending on the client or patient in the third trimester.

462
01:03:16,062 --> 01:03:21,462
We have the same energy cost from tissue formation.

463
01:03:22,402 --> 01:03:27,012
So again, the energy associated with protein and fat deposition.

464
01:03:27,492 --> 01:03:31,332
So it's 180 calories per day, just like in the second trimester.

465
01:03:31,572 --> 01:03:37,662
But where we have an increase is in the total energy expenditure in the third trimester.

466
01:03:39,042 --> 01:03:46,742
That's because of an increase of basal metabolic rate. That's 272 calories per day.

467
01:03:46,752 --> 01:03:53,112
So that increases the energy intake requirement in the third trimester of 450.

468
01:03:55,062 --> 01:03:58,282
Does this change with the claims and.

469
01:03:58,522 --> 01:04:03,762
Oh, yeah, absolutely. Yes. Yeah. It would seem they would increase.

470
01:04:03,802 --> 01:04:15,822
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So let's just double it based on weight gain.

471
01:04:16,482 --> 01:04:17,262
Does that make sense?

472
01:04:18,432 --> 01:04:27,822
Well, the thing is, is it's hard to I mean, there may be I have to go back and look to see if I was actually in or something out.

473
01:04:27,972 --> 01:04:37,932
And I didn't see any specific guidelines.

474
01:04:38,292 --> 01:04:42,312
But there might be something in the report and I get into that.

475
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:50,262
But there are guidelines specific for multiple businesses,

476
01:04:50,292 --> 01:04:56,292
and my guess is that they need to be monitoring as long as a pregnant person in adequate weight.

477
01:04:58,362 --> 01:05:10,852
But I don't think we have numerical guidelines on those in terms of if there is a global pandemic like this is I don't know,

478
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:20,292
this is going to help in pregnancy. Okay. Yeah. If the person is underway and if their pre-pregnancy BMI is low,

479
01:05:20,892 --> 01:05:26,142
if they're considered underweight or undernourished, then they're going to be increasing.

480
01:05:26,142 --> 01:05:30,732
And they may even be increasing their energy intake in the first trimester.

481
01:05:30,882 --> 01:05:34,632
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What happens if.

482
01:05:34,632 --> 01:05:41,082
I don't know, then they won't get the adequate gestational weight.

483
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:46,152
Yeah. And so with in with.

484
01:05:46,452 --> 01:05:53,082
So the presentation that I am not going to get through probably today but I will record it

485
01:05:53,592 --> 01:06:00,102
is gestational weight gain and offspring and infant outcomes if gestational weight gain.

486
01:06:01,652 --> 01:06:05,732
Guidelines are not meant. There's a higher risk of small for gestational age.

487
01:06:05,772 --> 01:06:10,052
There's a higher risk of low birth weight and mortality and preterm.

488
01:06:12,972 --> 01:06:18,562
And there's scenarios where the mother does everything right and the baby still is underweight,

489
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:28,492
was born like overweight or is that like pretty much like, you know, eating them or is it not as like black and white as that?

490
01:06:32,132 --> 01:06:36,332
They are going to be monitoring the fetal growth throughout the whole pregnancy.

491
01:06:36,662 --> 01:06:43,742
So if you play with humans biology, you never say never.

492
01:06:44,042 --> 01:06:52,742
But if the pregnant person has a healthy diet, has gained adequate gestational weight,

493
01:06:53,732 --> 01:07:00,902
the likelihood of their offspring being in a healthy birth weight is high.

494
01:07:01,442 --> 01:07:07,042
Yeah, but that doesn't mean that there couldn't be something that could go wrong.

495
01:07:07,302 --> 01:07:13,722
Yeah. Yeah, because there's just so many factors, especially today.

496
01:07:13,922 --> 01:07:19,952
Environmental factors that could be, you know, that we don't even know about.

497
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:23,132
Yeah. Right. So that's why I say never say never again. Yeah.

498
01:07:23,812 --> 01:07:25,992
Likewise. You know,

499
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:41,612
there's pregnant individuals who gain access or above the gestational weight or pregnant individuals who have a high BMI or high pre-pregnancy BMI.

500
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:45,032
It doesn't necessarily mean they're going to have,

501
01:07:45,032 --> 01:07:54,332
but they're that their fetus is necessarily going to be macroeconomic or at large for gestational age, birth weight.

502
01:07:55,622 --> 01:08:00,802
They're at higher risk. But that doesn't necessarily mean that that's the outcome intended.

503
01:08:01,802 --> 01:08:05,942
So these are all the studies that I provide.

504
01:08:05,942 --> 01:08:09,572
You guys are just that there's increased risk or reduced risk.

505
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:15,352
But there's so many factors that come into play with that.

506
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:24,692
And can you estimate, like for someone who like isn't is eating like the recommended amount and like good fetal growth like,

507
01:08:24,902 --> 01:08:28,352
but sometimes like is there an instance where like they were just routine,

508
01:08:28,352 --> 01:08:33,571
like a lot more water so they would be like gaining on a lot more like water weight,

509
01:08:33,572 --> 01:08:38,401
but that's like interpreted as like overall too much weight gain during the pregnancy.

510
01:08:38,402 --> 01:08:44,342
Or is that like. So if there's a concern that there's actually edema,

511
01:08:44,732 --> 01:08:51,721
then there would be concern that there's some kind of chronic there's some kind of disorder going on,

512
01:08:51,722 --> 01:08:57,842
whether there's hypertension or some other issue.

513
01:08:59,672 --> 01:09:08,462
Are you talking about the concern that the weight gain is really more of the fluid and not other things like fetal?

514
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:14,371
Yeah, cause like, I've heard of, like, some people, like, just gaining, like, a lot more weight than they were expecting,

515
01:09:14,372 --> 01:09:19,652
even though, like, they're, like, eating, like, the recommended energy requirement.

516
01:09:19,862 --> 01:09:27,392
Yeah, it can happen. I had a I had one of my pizza mentors.

517
01:09:28,382 --> 01:09:35,252
She gained £50. And I mean, she was active and she was a healthy eater.

518
01:09:35,582 --> 01:09:39,302
She gained 50, £50 and everybody was scratching their head.

519
01:09:39,572 --> 01:09:45,182
You know, there is there's going to be this variability in all of us.

520
01:09:45,602 --> 01:09:51,632
I don't I didn't I don't know if there were extenuating circumstances in that.

521
01:09:51,962 --> 01:10:00,932
Maybe she was at risk for some chronic disease that may have played a role here.

522
01:10:01,452 --> 01:10:07,112
You know, she had a very healthy infant that was in the normal birth weight range.

523
01:10:07,712 --> 01:10:13,802
So and her glucose levels were normal. So it's very difficult to understand.

524
01:10:15,042 --> 01:10:21,392
Yeah. So that's yeah, it's about yeah.

525
01:10:21,752 --> 01:10:30,812
Kind of along with that. Has there been much research on like genetics and kind of like thinking and just weight gain or like pregnancy?

526
01:10:31,262 --> 01:10:48,872
Yeah. Well, I think there's and the short answer is I haven't specifically actually looked for genetics in terms of gestational weight gain.

527
01:10:55,352 --> 01:11:00,272
I don't know. It's a that would be an interesting question to look at.

528
01:11:00,812 --> 01:11:11,102
I was just trying to think of. Because weight gain in part is fetal tissue.

529
01:11:12,732 --> 01:11:22,752
Pregnancy, tissue and water. So it's possible that there's going to be there's certainly they know that there's variability in the amount of plasma.

530
01:11:23,202 --> 01:11:27,612
So there are some new studies out that are looking that they are actually measuring

531
01:11:28,002 --> 01:11:32,682
water because water is actually one of the largest components of weight in pregnancy.

532
01:11:33,912 --> 01:11:41,711
I don't have that table or that figure, but if you look at the components that contribute to weight, water is one of the largest components.

533
01:11:41,712 --> 01:11:48,942
I think it is the largest component. So there will be variations in water for just the fluid expansion.

534
01:11:48,942 --> 01:11:54,821
And so, you know, of course, there would have to be genetic variations.

535
01:11:54,822 --> 01:11:58,632
Whether or not they've actually studied the genes involved in that, I'm not sure.

536
01:11:58,752 --> 01:12:02,262
But they are. This is an area of research, understanding.

537
01:12:02,292 --> 01:12:09,882
Total body water change in pregnancy as well as plasma expansion is an area that is finally getting attention.

538
01:12:09,912 --> 01:12:14,352
I've noticed an uptick in papers, so that might be a place you could start to look.

539
01:12:15,042 --> 01:12:20,052
Yeah, because that to me is one area where we would see variation,

540
01:12:20,562 --> 01:12:24,642
especially since it's one of the largest components, if not the largest component of weight.

541
01:12:25,762 --> 01:12:37,752
Yeah. Okay. So these are the dry values for energy and they are specific to second and third trimester intake levels.

542
01:12:37,902 --> 01:12:50,322
Okay. I think it's important to note that adequate intake of energy intake in the United States is monitored by gestational weight gain.

543
01:12:51,882 --> 01:13:00,192
Okay. And it's also important to recognize that energy needs need to be individualized.

544
01:13:00,222 --> 01:13:11,051
I don't think anybody in here is surprised by that. One thing that I want to point out is pregnant individuals who are overweight or obese at

545
01:13:11,052 --> 01:13:17,292
conception may need less calories in pregnancy to achieve the recommended gestational weight gain.

546
01:13:18,102 --> 01:13:25,062
Conversely, pregnant individuals who are underweight so have a pre-pregnancy low BMI.

547
01:13:25,152 --> 01:13:28,392
So low pre-pregnancy BMI. That's the way we say that.

548
01:13:28,932 --> 01:13:40,422
So if they have a low pre-pregnancy BMI, they're going to need increased calories to maintain the appropriate gestational weight gains guidelines.

549
01:13:41,442 --> 01:13:46,512
So, again, individualized. Okay.

550
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:56,472
Now, the CDC does not necessarily recommend for for pregnant people who are underweight or have a low pre-pregnancy BMI.

551
01:13:57,462 --> 01:14:05,882
I noticed it was a guideline from the CDC that did not necessarily in states that increased calories are required in the first trimester.

552
01:14:05,892 --> 01:14:14,232
Instead, it was higher calories, about 100 additional calories in the second trimester and about 150 additional calories in the third.

553
01:14:16,092 --> 01:14:21,522
This is where you have to, as a practitioner, use, you know, common sense.

554
01:14:21,522 --> 01:14:33,552
If you have somebody who has a really low pre-pregnancy BMI, you may need to increase their calories even in the first trimester.

555
01:14:33,672 --> 01:14:38,862
Right. So, again, this gets back to that individualization of care.

556
01:14:39,402 --> 01:14:43,332
Yeah. I know you talked about earlier that sometimes during my third trimester,

557
01:14:43,382 --> 01:14:50,502
it's kind of hard to like eat enough calories to link yourself, meaning that those energy needs.

558
01:14:51,972 --> 01:14:59,381
My question is like as individuals experience pregnancy, is there an uptick in hunger?

559
01:14:59,382 --> 01:15:04,692
Things like hunger signals in terms of like your beauty, both yourself and the growing fetus.

560
01:15:05,022 --> 01:15:11,472
Do you increase at all or say I that to be a really modest effort to try to be a part of that.

561
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:18,912
So I don't know the literature on hunger. I will tell you that I had I experienced hunger in pregnancy.

562
01:15:20,172 --> 01:15:25,732
And even though by the third trimester you have to have smaller meals because you just don't have as much room.

563
01:15:25,752 --> 01:15:35,922
I was still hungry. Yeah. But that being said, it also means that the meals need to be nutrient dense because there's just not enough room in a well,

564
01:15:36,012 --> 01:15:38,172
it's just harder to have larger meals.

565
01:15:38,592 --> 01:15:48,012
That being said, I had the most hunger when I was in lactation, and it was the hunger that I remember as a kid, you know, playing outside.

566
01:15:48,022 --> 01:15:55,782
Oh, my gosh, I've always been. Or that kind of hunger I had during lactation I didn't experience during pregnancy.

567
01:15:55,782 --> 01:16:03,851
But I know this variability in that because just from anecdotal, so, you know, every pregnant person is different.

568
01:16:03,852 --> 01:16:11,382
But I think that's an interesting question that it would be interesting if anybody looked into how pregnant.

569
01:16:11,462 --> 01:16:17,102
Individuals respond in terms of do they experience hunger or do they have to force themselves to eat?

570
01:16:17,312 --> 01:16:22,802
Yeah. It also depends on how many experienced are still experiencing nausea.

571
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:26,911
It tends to resolve itself by the second trimester.

572
01:16:26,912 --> 01:16:36,482
But you do hear of some pregnant individuals who have nausea end of the third trimester, and that can be a problem with getting adequate calories.

573
01:16:37,112 --> 01:16:46,322
Okay. Oh, and I'm going to get through gestational weight gain recommendations.

574
01:16:46,492 --> 01:16:51,362
Are you guys go to. You want to stretch for a minute? Get up, stretch and get up and stretch.

575
01:16:53,612 --> 01:16:56,702
Take a couple of minutes. But then I want to get to the gestational cause.

576
01:16:56,702 --> 01:17:01,902
I need to get through this before we can in class. Yeah.

577
01:17:07,132 --> 01:17:20,982
So I want to grab, you know, it's like, you know, have a lot to.

578
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:27,742
And they want you. And what have they done?

579
01:17:30,132 --> 01:17:34,842
I really like. I think I'm just like everybody else's.

580
01:17:35,142 --> 01:17:40,182
Like everybody else.

581
01:17:46,342 --> 01:18:01,132
Yeah. Yeah. And I bought my first premiere and everything like that, but I was only $20, so I was like, Wow.

582
01:18:01,612 --> 01:18:06,011
And I was like, You're one of them. Yeah.

583
01:18:06,012 --> 01:18:13,732
Yeah. Because it's like, kind of like love metal for, like, trying to be like somebody.

584
01:18:14,512 --> 01:18:17,962
Exactly. Just all the people that do it, I guess.

585
01:18:19,072 --> 01:18:30,342
Like me, like like being in the seven news shows I want to thank everyone was like, I think your show, it's like a kind of.

586
01:18:31,912 --> 01:18:40,492
Yeah. It's something there's two seasons and there have been with like, you know.

587
01:18:40,722 --> 01:18:48,212
There you go, panel. So you don't have anything to do with anything.

588
01:18:48,922 --> 01:18:58,902
That's whatever, you know. So and then like this sounds like to me like basically follows a bunch of really healthy people because.

589
01:18:59,262 --> 01:19:02,542
Yeah. And so because they're figuring it out.

590
01:19:04,282 --> 01:19:13,942
Is it because they don't really have any number of resources and it's like a chance is and.

591
01:19:14,512 --> 01:19:22,452
Yeah. So all of them and they're all like they were just doing really well because I have to say,

592
01:19:23,192 --> 01:19:29,662
I feel like it's like, okay, I'm going to go ahead and get started.

593
01:19:32,872 --> 01:19:35,872
Oh, right.

594
01:19:37,522 --> 01:19:44,782
Because gestational weight gain recommendations are, you know, basically I mean, they interface with our discussion.

595
01:19:47,272 --> 01:19:53,542
Let's get started, everyone. I really want to get through gestational weight gain because this really is

596
01:19:54,742 --> 01:19:59,272
directly linked to our discussion on energy intake requirements in pregnancy.

597
01:19:59,272 --> 01:20:04,731
So we're going to talk about the evidence, the form, the basis.

598
01:20:04,732 --> 01:20:15,022
So the National Academy had a initial report in 1990 for weight gain recommendations or gestational weight gain recommendations,

599
01:20:15,202 --> 01:20:22,551
and then it was updated again in 2009. So we're going to go through these two iterations in a way to kind of look a little bit

600
01:20:22,552 --> 01:20:34,822
historically and and then just just go over some of the the basis for their recommendations.

601
01:20:35,452 --> 01:20:47,512
So just to do to clarify, total gestational weight gain is defined as the weight just before delivery minus weight just before conception.

602
01:20:48,952 --> 01:20:55,042
And in fact, if the pregnant person is monitoring their own gestational weight gain,

603
01:20:55,282 --> 01:21:04,492
it would be their current gestational weight minus their pre-pregnancy or rate at conception weight.

604
01:21:05,572 --> 01:21:09,112
So that would give them their gestational weight gain.

605
01:21:18,102 --> 01:21:25,392
Evidence that informed the National Academy formally called the Institute of Medicine.

606
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:32,322
Was that appropriate? Gestational weight gain varies according to pre-pregnancy BMI.

607
01:21:34,872 --> 01:21:47,292
Specifically, studies showed that there is an inverse relationship between pre-pregnancy BMI.

608
01:21:51,712 --> 01:21:57,442
And the amount of gestational weight gain necessary for a healthy birth weight.

609
01:21:58,672 --> 01:22:06,772
Let me say that again. There's an inverse relationship between pre-pregnancy BMI.

610
01:22:10,482 --> 01:22:20,982
And the gestational weight gain needed or necessary for a healthy birth weight or birth weight range.

611
01:22:23,562 --> 01:22:35,862
Okay. So what that means is that pregnant individual with a low pre-pregnancy BMI needs to gain

612
01:22:35,862 --> 01:22:46,782
more gestational weight in order for their infant to be within a healthy birth weight.

613
01:22:52,572 --> 01:23:00,822
Conversely, pre-pregnancy pregnant individuals who have a pre-pregnancy BMI that is overweight or in the

614
01:23:00,822 --> 01:23:12,762
obese category can gain less gestational weight and that results in a healthy birth weight.

615
01:23:13,662 --> 01:23:27,311
Okay, is everybody inverse relationship, lower BMI, higher gestational weight gain necessary for a healthy infant birth weight outcome high BMI,

616
01:23:27,312 --> 01:23:35,592
pre-pregnancy BMI, lower gestational weight gain necessary for healthy infants birth weight.

617
01:23:36,582 --> 01:23:43,902
And we're going to that's one of the key findings that the Academy found that informed.

618
01:23:44,052 --> 01:23:47,002
It's not just but it's one. Okay.

619
01:23:48,072 --> 01:23:59,922
They also determined, based on a multitude of studies, that a favorable infant birth weight outcome was roughly between three and four kilograms.

620
01:24:00,612 --> 01:24:07,631
This reduced infant mortality and morbidity. So prior to 1990, even though so let me take a step back.

621
01:24:07,632 --> 01:24:18,882
In the late 1960s, we had a White House summit that health professionals and it may not just have been the White House summit,

622
01:24:18,882 --> 01:24:24,612
but there was a meeting at the end of the 1960s where health professionals were very concerned,

623
01:24:24,882 --> 01:24:28,692
high infant mortality, largely because of low birth weight.

624
01:24:30,162 --> 01:24:39,882
And it became so there was a great deal of effort from the 1960s and through the seventies and eighties accumulating research,

625
01:24:39,892 --> 01:24:48,822
understanding that higher gestational weight gain contributed to a healthier birth weight.

626
01:24:48,972 --> 01:24:56,862
So what was happening in the sixties and fifties is they were encouraging women to only gain about £15 with the thought that

627
01:24:56,862 --> 01:25:08,052
it would reduce hypertensive disorders in pregnancy that results in a higher risk of low birth weight and infant mortality.

628
01:25:08,262 --> 01:25:12,792
So in the United States with research and that was also accumulating elsewhere,

629
01:25:13,662 --> 01:25:21,432
there was recognition that increasing gestational weight gain was needed to reduce infant mortality and low birth weight.

630
01:25:21,882 --> 01:25:26,291
Okay. So the Academy had to determine, well,

631
01:25:26,292 --> 01:25:34,242
what is a healthy birth weight that's going to reduce the risk of low birth weight and infant mortality

632
01:25:34,452 --> 01:25:44,002
without also increasing the risk of nitrosamine or hybrid weight and having adverse outcomes from that.

633
01:25:44,022 --> 01:25:50,522
So they had to find that sort of sweet spot and it was roughly 3 to 4000 kilograms,

634
01:25:50,522 --> 01:25:58,632
roughly for three or four kilograms or 3000 to 4000 grams to reduce infant mortality and morbidity.

635
01:26:00,882 --> 01:26:09,402
They also took into account average gestational weight gain of healthy pregnancies where the pregnant person eight to appetite.

636
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:20,022
So they looked at the studies that had assessed what the weight gain was, gestational weight gain coupled with normal infant outcomes.

637
01:26:20,862 --> 01:26:24,832
So these three factors were some of the key.

638
01:26:24,862 --> 01:26:34,212
I mean, they also looked at other factors, but these were three of the key sources of evidence that they evaluated.

639
01:26:35,532 --> 01:26:52,211
So the figure on the left is the number of neonatal deaths per neonatal survivors.

640
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:59,082
So this is post neonatal deaths. So neonatal is up to 28 days post birth.

641
01:26:59,802 --> 01:27:02,982
So this is death after the 28 days.

642
01:27:03,282 --> 01:27:09,162
And you can see that with low birth weight, you have a.

643
01:27:09,272 --> 01:27:17,402
Much higher risk of death rate mortality is higher as birth weight decreases.

644
01:27:18,542 --> 01:27:38,462
Like or conversely, we can say that the risk of mortality declines considerably once birth weight increases by 3000 grams by 3500,

645
01:27:38,612 --> 01:27:42,602
we see a substantial drop in mortality.

646
01:27:42,872 --> 01:27:48,032
Note that there's a slight uptick with higher birth weight.

647
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:55,082
So we have now a slight increase in risk of mortality from high birth weight.

648
01:27:55,262 --> 01:28:02,911
So again, it was finding that spot where risk of mortality is the lowest without then a high birth

649
01:28:02,912 --> 01:28:07,502
weight that contributes again to or you start to see an uptick in risk of mortality.

650
01:28:09,092 --> 01:28:13,592
The figure on the right is some data that they found.

651
01:28:14,162 --> 01:28:21,962
This is the relationship between maternal weight gain and birth weight and there a linear relationship.

652
01:28:22,202 --> 01:28:32,461
So they found that, again, a linear relationship between gestational weight gain and birth weight among all BMI categories,

653
01:28:32,462 --> 01:28:42,032
except for the overweight, which actually today corresponds to obesity or obese.

654
01:28:42,962 --> 01:28:49,292
So again, I want to say that there's a positive linear relationship between just maternal weight gain,

655
01:28:50,672 --> 01:29:00,252
weight gain of the pregnant individual and birth weight in all categories except for the high BMI.

656
01:29:05,042 --> 01:29:06,512
We can't see it here so much,

657
01:29:06,512 --> 01:29:19,172
but the slope differs as the BMI level increases so that there's less gestational weight gain required with a higher BMI.

658
01:29:19,322 --> 01:29:30,152
And then ultimately we see that there's basically very minimal relationship with the overweight category.

659
01:29:31,832 --> 01:29:37,922
So this is the type of data that was informing the academy on setting the gestational weight gain guidelines.

660
01:29:38,372 --> 01:29:47,762
Okay. So in 1990, they set guidelines based on a pregnant individual's pre-pregnancy BMI.

661
01:29:47,912 --> 01:29:59,642
And again, it has to do with these strong relationships between healthy birth weight and adequacy of gestational weight gain for,

662
01:29:59,762 --> 01:30:10,482
again, a healthy birth weight. You'll note that for the obese category, they didn't have enough data to set an upper limit.

663
01:30:10,502 --> 01:30:19,592
So we have weight gain as recommended greater than £6.

664
01:30:19,952 --> 01:30:23,702
I'm sorry, this is kilograms. So the tail numbers are in kilograms.

665
01:30:24,002 --> 01:30:31,952
The numbers in parentheses by the pounds. So they had a minimum of £15, but they were not able to set an upper limit.

666
01:30:32,652 --> 01:30:42,002
Okay. So this is the initial this was what the guidelines for gestational weight gain in the 90 in 1994,

667
01:30:44,072 --> 01:30:52,482
which category of pre-pregnancy BMI has the highest recommended weight gain, the football club.

668
01:30:53,072 --> 01:31:01,262
And again, that is consistent with the assumption that there are nutrition stores are low and that they

669
01:31:01,262 --> 01:31:09,242
need to consume more energy to replenish those nutrient stores as well as fuel deposition.

670
01:31:09,902 --> 01:31:15,002
Right. Remember, early pregnancy is an important stage of fuel deposition.

671
01:31:15,452 --> 01:31:22,261
So the Academy set their gestational weight gain requirements higher in part because

672
01:31:22,262 --> 01:31:26,882
of that inverse relationship between pre-pregnancy BMI and healthy birth weight.

673
01:31:27,602 --> 01:31:31,532
But also taking into account nutrient stores and so forth.

674
01:31:34,052 --> 01:31:42,882
I'm going to just zip through these. I think this most of you will be able to this is just showing BMI across time.

675
01:31:42,902 --> 01:31:54,362
I think it was collected from Hanes. And you can see a shift from normal weight to overweight and obesity over time going from 1976 up to 2004,

676
01:31:56,012 --> 01:31:59,582
which is consistent with what we've been seeing with weight.

677
01:32:00,332 --> 01:32:08,552
Also, the rate of gestational diabetes increased from the time the 1990 report came out until.

678
01:32:09,552 --> 01:32:18,282
The 2000 report came out, the academy was reconvened to reevaluate gestational weight gain,

679
01:32:18,282 --> 01:32:22,302
and in that time they found increased rates of gestational diabetes.

680
01:32:22,992 --> 01:32:28,512
Also, they found increased rates of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.

681
01:32:29,082 --> 01:32:40,662
So the lower on the figure on the right sample line is gestational hypertension and the upper line is pre-eclampsia,

682
01:32:41,052 --> 01:32:43,632
both of which are hypertensive disorders.

683
01:32:45,072 --> 01:32:53,742
Gestational hypertension is when the pregnant individual develops high blood pressure but had normal blood pressure in the non-pregnant state.

684
01:32:54,192 --> 01:32:57,282
So they're developing hypertension in pregnancy.

685
01:32:58,512 --> 01:33:04,061
And then pre-eclampsia is another hypertensive disorder that can happen.

686
01:33:04,062 --> 01:33:09,072
These can happen in individuals who may have hypertension prior to pregnancy,

687
01:33:10,032 --> 01:33:20,072
but it also involves there's loss of protein in the urine and there's other outcomes of this

688
01:33:20,082 --> 01:33:29,352
or symptoms of preeclampsia that ends up designating it as its own disorder and and so forth.

689
01:33:30,402 --> 01:33:36,131
But that doesn't apply to if a woman has low blood pressure before and then goes up to normal.

690
01:33:36,132 --> 01:33:42,232
Does that still is that. No, it's not. They actually have specific systolic diastolic cut off.

691
01:33:42,232 --> 01:33:47,972
So it has to be in the. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

692
01:33:52,992 --> 01:34:00,461
So given the fact that they were seeing changes in overweight and obesity

693
01:34:00,462 --> 01:34:05,682
prevalence in the United States as well as concern about chronic disease risk,

694
01:34:07,782 --> 01:34:15,732
the academy reconvened and in 2009 they revised the gestational weight gain recommendations.

695
01:34:16,062 --> 01:34:22,632
More importantly, they revisited the 1990 to see if they needed to be changed.

696
01:34:22,932 --> 01:34:34,272
And and actually what ended up happening is there were no changes made except for the final category, the obese category.

697
01:34:34,272 --> 01:34:47,592
We now have an upper limit. So whereas before it was six, now it's at a kg range of 5 to 9 or 11 to £12.

698
01:34:52,062 --> 01:34:55,832
So we now have an upper range difference.

699
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:05,592
And this over here on the far right column is just the average weight gain.

700
01:35:08,022 --> 01:35:11,052
And this is generally in the second and third trimester.

701
01:35:11,832 --> 01:35:18,822
It's important to note that even though they say roughly £1 per week in the normal category and so forth,

702
01:35:19,302 --> 01:35:23,682
there is so much variability in in how pregnant individuals gain weight.

703
01:35:24,342 --> 01:35:34,182
I mean, I can see from my own experience there'd be times where I would go in and I would gain or I especially later in pregnancy,

704
01:35:34,182 --> 01:35:39,461
where you're seeing the you're going in for prenatal visits weekly or every two weeks.

705
01:35:39,462 --> 01:35:51,252
There'd be times where I haven't gained anything and I get recommended nicely, but then I'd go back and I would have gained four or £5.

706
01:35:51,252 --> 01:35:58,812
So I was doing it in sort of fits in spurts. So the take home point is, is that on average, that's what they you know, there,

707
01:35:59,202 --> 01:36:03,822
I know I knew that my practitioner was looking for roughly a pound a week,

708
01:36:04,302 --> 01:36:10,992
but sometimes I'd go a couple of women that was showing any signs of any increase and then all of a sudden I'd have increased four or five.

709
01:36:11,382 --> 01:36:18,612
So it's important to recognize that this is very highly variable among pregnant individuals.

710
01:36:18,912 --> 01:36:31,811
So these are the guidelines that I just want to emphasize again that these were based on that earlier slide,

711
01:36:31,812 --> 01:36:41,022
that inverse relationship, as well as that strong relationship between gestational weight gain, the linear relationship rate,

712
01:36:42,282 --> 01:36:46,811
the linear relationship between gestational weight gain and healthy birth weight,

713
01:36:46,812 --> 01:36:54,791
as well as that inverse relationship between pre-pregnancy BMI and the amount

714
01:36:54,792 --> 01:37:02,742
of gestational weight gain needed or necessary for a healthy infant weight.

715
01:37:03,192 --> 01:37:09,012
So there has been a lot in the literature about.

716
01:37:09,152 --> 01:37:18,752
Whether or not these guidelines are relevant today, given the fact that we have still very high rates of overweight and obesity.

717
01:37:19,202 --> 01:37:27,932
What keeps coming back from a lot of these systematic reviews and met analysis is that individuals who gain below

718
01:37:27,992 --> 01:37:35,732
the gestational weight gain recommendations or gain above are at much higher risk for these adverse outcomes.

719
01:37:36,632 --> 01:37:38,582
That being said so.

720
01:37:39,942 --> 01:37:49,452
The gestational weight gains by the National Academy appear to be still relevant, but we don't know how relevant they are for different ethnicities.

721
01:37:51,702 --> 01:37:59,712
They are sometimes used in other countries and it's not clear if they are relevant, but they're often used.

722
01:37:59,952 --> 01:38:07,452
So I just wanted you to be aware that there is more information coming out discussion in the research literature about

723
01:38:08,352 --> 01:38:17,472
how can we ensure that these gestational weight gain levels are appropriate for different race ethnicities and so forth?

724
01:38:20,682 --> 01:38:27,581
I'm talking about obesity. I'm talking about overweight because of the risks and so forth.

725
01:38:27,582 --> 01:38:36,642
But I also wanted to circle back to a discussion we had last class about weight, stigma and so forth.

726
01:38:37,962 --> 01:38:46,152
I have two papers on your readings, on your canvas, paint, paper, on your canvas.

727
01:38:46,362 --> 01:38:54,622
Today under optional readings, I posted two papers that address this.

728
01:38:54,642 --> 01:39:01,202
And one of them is a I think they're actually both qualitative because I love these qualitative papers,

729
01:39:01,212 --> 01:39:07,452
because the women are able to say what they're feeling and the quotes are included in there.

730
01:39:07,992 --> 01:39:11,772
It's just, oh, it's heart wrenching to read some of these quotes.

731
01:39:12,582 --> 01:39:19,151
So there's one paper that talks about the feedback from pregnant individuals,

732
01:39:19,152 --> 01:39:25,632
and there's another paper in which the pregnant individuals provide recommendations for health care providers.

733
01:39:25,992 --> 01:39:36,282
So I feel that this is important for anyone who anticipates in their career working with this population and pregnant individuals.

734
01:39:37,152 --> 01:39:43,452
It's important that you read and, you know, learn about the concerns.

735
01:39:43,582 --> 01:39:52,212
Yeah, it's curious how often the pregnant individuals and to few registered dietitian who's a part of the care.

736
01:39:52,722 --> 01:39:59,532
Well, I know that in Michigan Medicine there is a dietician embedded in the Obudu Riding Clinic.

737
01:40:00,702 --> 01:40:06,192
And I know at the clinic that I attended in Tucson, Arizona, there was a dietician embedded.

738
01:40:06,682 --> 01:40:09,732
And I don't know how universal that is.

739
01:40:09,792 --> 01:40:13,362
I suspect that varies depending on the health care system.

740
01:40:17,442 --> 01:40:25,562
So, yeah, I mean, I feel like there should be a dietician embedded in multiple maybe, but definitely, yeah.

741
01:40:26,282 --> 01:40:29,502
Yeah. Just kind of with that like a lot of like public health.

742
01:40:29,802 --> 01:40:34,362
Like dietitians are like a lot of focus on like pregnancy and breastfeeding.

743
01:40:34,362 --> 01:40:39,792
So like there's a lot of white community outreach to support that population, especially like rural areas.

744
01:40:39,832 --> 01:40:57,882
Right. Yeah. And. So it's sort of neighborhood clinics and so forth with our readers is coming by to say hi.

745
01:40:57,922 --> 01:41:10,332
So, you know, it's think it's her own experience?

746
01:41:11,172 --> 01:41:15,932
Well, all right. It's pretty clear my brain's not firing on all cylinders this morning.

747
01:41:15,942 --> 01:41:20,772
So, anyway, many of you know this protein.

748
01:41:21,702 --> 01:41:24,791
But for those of you who don't know, this is our grader.

749
01:41:24,792 --> 01:41:29,052
And this was a greater in community nutrition and the stellar job.

750
01:41:29,052 --> 01:41:37,422
And so I invited her to be greeter in this class and she has a strong interest in pregnancy, lactation and child nutrition.

751
01:41:37,422 --> 01:41:43,871
So yeah, um, all the other thing I really have to say is that we're going to be doing office hours this semester,

752
01:41:43,872 --> 01:41:47,772
which is a little different for people who were in the course I graded for last semester.

753
01:41:47,772 --> 01:41:54,791
So I put together a poll if I can send it to you and everyone can fill it out, just we can find a time that works best for the majority of the class.

754
01:41:54,792 --> 01:42:02,292
I think that would be a nice resource for all of you to have a lunch, but I just want to have a face to my name when you see my comments.

755
01:42:02,622 --> 01:42:06,612
So things like that. So always feel free to reach out my emails on the syllabus.

756
01:42:06,972 --> 01:42:20,022
Um, I'm always floating around sometimes and she, her head is on her body today like mine, which is not clearly I just wanted to.

757
01:42:20,022 --> 01:42:31,122
Oh, we're already late. Can I just say one quick thing? I had some concerns about the exam last week and I've done some emails.

758
01:42:31,482 --> 01:42:38,202
Well, I just want to propose several recommendations to all of you.

759
01:42:38,202 --> 01:42:53,772
And this doesn't justify. I this class, I highly recommend you reframe your mindset about exams and instead focus on reviewing the material.

760
01:42:53,802 --> 01:43:00,162
Notice I am saying focus on reviewing the material because one, you love it.

761
01:43:02,012 --> 01:43:07,332
Two, you want to learn it because it's important for your career goals.

762
01:43:07,652 --> 01:43:19,722
I was in grad school. A professor actually encouraged us to have this friendships our in our how we approach exams.

763
01:43:20,352 --> 01:43:26,622
And it's true if you think about the material in the context of, oh my gosh, I've got to study for this.

764
01:43:27,492 --> 01:43:32,502
It's drudgery, right? Study for exam that implies drudgery.

765
01:43:33,282 --> 01:43:39,792
But if you approach the material, you're learning because you want to learn it,

766
01:43:40,422 --> 01:43:49,362
because you either love it or you need it to do this foundational information for your career, then you're reviewing it.

767
01:43:49,812 --> 01:43:54,372
I encourage you guys. My second recommendation is to review it more frequently.

768
01:43:54,852 --> 01:43:58,752
Spend 10 minutes, spend 15, don't spend a whole hour.

769
01:43:58,782 --> 01:44:02,232
I mean, you can, but that turns it into drudgery.

770
01:44:03,732 --> 01:44:07,211
Spend more time more frequently. Let me rephrase that.

771
01:44:07,212 --> 01:44:18,162
Spend more frequently, less time reviewing the material, because seeing it, saying it out loud and writing it will reinforce it.

772
01:44:18,552 --> 01:44:21,762
But it also helps with deeper understanding and critical thinking.

773
01:44:22,842 --> 01:44:27,182
So for me, in grad school, that frame shift was huge.

774
01:44:27,192 --> 01:44:33,702
I mean, it took a while. Every time I sat down to review that study, I'm reviewing it because I want to learn it.

775
01:44:33,712 --> 01:44:37,292
I had to keep saying, Oh my God, why am I doing this? Because I want to learn it yet.

776
01:44:37,392 --> 01:44:40,542
Okay. No, actually, really, I do want to learn it.

777
01:44:40,782 --> 01:44:45,371
I need it for my profession. So I would have those kind of recordings going on in my head.

778
01:44:45,372 --> 01:44:55,542
And it helped me get through to the point that every time I sat down to review slides, notes, it wasn't drudgery.

779
01:44:55,542 --> 01:45:04,272
I actually found something exciting about it. So I encourage you guys because what happens is you review the material frequently.

780
01:45:04,542 --> 01:45:10,032
You get an energized and excited about the material. You find how it links to your profession.

781
01:45:10,962 --> 01:45:17,172
The grades come because you know it, because you're in the material much more frequently.

782
01:45:18,192 --> 01:45:22,422
So I really encourage not just for this class, but your approach to grad school.

783
01:45:23,112 --> 01:45:32,782
Again, you're always thinking about learning it because you want to do well, and then it's not a really fun way to approach well.

784
01:45:32,832 --> 01:45:43,532
All right, have a good one and have a good weekend, everybody, before you go.
