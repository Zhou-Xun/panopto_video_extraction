1
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:13,500
I love you. Thank you. We're just just talking a little bit about the hurricane that hit Florida yesterday.

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:20,020
It. Highway one again, couldn't see everyone.

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:27,790
So ironically, it I mean, you guys remember my lecture yesterday about the the National Disaster Management Service, right.

4
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:34,270
Which is underneath the Department of Health and Human Services. And you've got the Department of Defense, the Veteran Affairs, and then FEMA.

5
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,980
FEMA's the response agency.

6
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:44,170
To recap, we have basically the incident command system, which happens at usually the highest levels of a state government.

7
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:52,380
So what I wanted to basically give you guys is kind of, you know, well, fortunately or unfortunately, we have a live action kind of event.

8
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:57,640
How many if I said, Ian, what would you guys you guys know what's going on in southwest Florida?

9
00:00:58,090 --> 00:01:06,170
So, so funny thing. My mom lives in Fort Myers Beach, and so she decided to write out Ian inside of her house.

10
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:09,340
Okay, so what was cause I was following that.

11
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:17,799
She's 88 years old. She's very stubborn. Luckily, she has a very solid cement structure that is 18 feet above the ocean.

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:29,170
You're a preparedness thing. Architectural requirements are that all people in the hurricane zone have to have an elevated business.

13
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:39,280
Right. Okay. This is this is just part of the preparedness thing. So anything I think before 1950 probably is not required or something like that.

14
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:47,830
Anyway, the point is, so as you know, when when it started going through Cuba, when it started going through Cuba, it started picking up speed.

15
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:55,660
We talk about the hurricane eye, the negative pressure that brings up the water, which then as it falls on land, becomes that surge.

16
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,170
Right. Surge can be anywhere can get up to 16 feet in some areas.

17
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,639
Okay. And it just brings up this wall of water, just moves it on top of land.

18
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,150
Right. And that's what causes all the destruction and the winds, of course. So I don't have any pictures because this all kind of happened last night.

19
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,350
But I was thinking I'm like, this would be great to kind of kind of talk this through.

20
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,740
So as you remember, like there was a lot of hoopla on the news about Ron DeSantis,

21
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,430
you know, basically preparing for this and just kind of getting getting prepared for this.

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:32,380
Right. So he then called use the Stafford Act, called on President Biden basically for FEMA support for national kind of funds and resources.

23
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,780
Now, the MMS is involved and they have at their disposal all those teams that I mentioned,

24
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,819
all the medical teams, the communications teams, there's like 15 of those emergency response teams.

25
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:48,240
Right. And so now that whole system has been activated before the disaster even happens, right?

26
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:58,410
So everybody's kind of getting ready. Okay, then all you can do like yesterday at like 1:00, Irma, I'm that was last year in Hit Land about 1:00.

27
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,710
Right. So all you can do is wait, right? Winds were like 155 miles an hour.

28
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,500
I don't know what that is. Four kilometers an hour or Richard. Right, but fast.

29
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:16,450
Okay. And the surge was my mom was 18 feet above above the ground, and the water came two feet below her porch.

30
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,300
So that was a 16 foot surge. Everything on the island is now destroyed.

31
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:25,299
Right. So then this is this is what's cool about having a functional response system.

32
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:29,980
Okay? I lost cell phone reception to my mom while she's in there.

33
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:40,710
All those will be exciting details of her smelling smoke. Well, the wind was howling outside, but when the waters receded after that,

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,760
that I hit land and you could just see the hurricane getting destroyed because it gets the power from the ocean.

35
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,350
As soon as it hits landfall, that hurricane started disintegrating, which was really cool.

36
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,040
So we you know, I was texting her pictures of that because she couldn't get cell phone reception.

37
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,200
Somehow we were able to get text. The surge left just massive destruction everywhere.

38
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,090
At four in the morning, I got a call and she said, There's these guys at my door that want me to evacuate the island.

39
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:07,569
I said, Are they are they from DMS? Are they from the government?

40
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:12,640
Yes, they were from the government. They were the search and rescue, the urban search and rescue, the U.S. teams.

41
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,360
So that is a functional response, right?

42
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:20,650
I mean, they're on the ground ready to go. And that's the cool thing. And that's what I wanted to kind of talk to you guys.

43
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,290
Now, you heard today, this morning now Ron DeSantis is putting up all of the cell phone towers that were destroyed.

44
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:31,120
He's getting the cell phone towers out. He's getting food down there. He's getting medical equipment down there.

45
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,410
So that is the function of how an intact response system works in real time.

46
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,190
And that's where we are right now. And then you could tell the rest when you watch the news today.

47
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,750
So that's kind of what I wanted to share with you guys about how how how

48
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:48,940
incredibly fortunate and and important it is to have a functional response system,

49
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,930
not only preparedness. Right. Because we were prepared. You're prepared with architecture, right?

50
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:57,130
We talk about Susan. We'll talk about the Philippines today. I don't know.

51
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,899
I don't know. I don't know the architectural legal requirements of building in the Philippines.

52
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,750
But but it certainly probably isn't to build it.

53
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:11,679
They probably don't build for height for hurricane prevention or hurricane resilience.

54
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,310
Right. That's probably something we need they need to work on or we need to help them with.

55
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,460
Right. So so there's. Preparedness. There was the response.

56
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:25,280
There's planning and all of that mitigation. So again, just kind of wanted to bring that full circle with you guys.

57
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:31,400
I don't have any slides. Again, I was driving here early this morning while I was making phone calls to my mom, so I didn't have a presentation.

58
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:38,270
But but but there you have it. So my luxury last week was actually now I can give you a real world example of how that worked.

59
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,610
Any questions before we start with the Philippines and Susan, Richard and our exercise today?

60
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:48,170
No. All right. Good. Glad I could share that with you. Thank you.

61
00:05:48,190 --> 00:06:12,169
Just important. It seems.

62
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,290
Can you see the screen? Yeah. Brilliant. Thank you. Wonderful.

63
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:23,150
Okay, so before I start, I just want to take you back to last week when we talked about the cluster system.

64
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:29,540
We talked about how a government within a country would declare that they need their

65
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:34,610
international support because the country's capacity is unable to respond to the disaster.

66
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:39,559
They will declare their support to the U.N. The cluster system will be activated,

67
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,060
and then they'll be decisions on which clusters itself will be activated within that country.

68
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:50,750
So let's go to the next slide, please. Using that information, just kind of bear in mind.

69
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:59,919
Sorry. I just want to go to live pictures. I just want you to bear in mind, kind of this system being activated,

70
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:07,810
looking at the national system within the Philippines and looking at the regional hubs.

71
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:17,680
I will talk to you about in a bit. So if we go back to the Philippines response on the 8th of November in 2013,

72
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:27,219
there was a typhoon called Yolanda that was a Cat five storm and the winds were of 195 miles per hour.

73
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:33,040
And then that was recorded. And this was the second largest typhoon that's been recorded as yet.

74
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:40,300
And during this emergency and typhoon, as you can see, looking at the red swirls,

75
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,690
this is kind of as the typhoon is sweeping across through the Philippines.

76
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:51,490
Now, in the Philippines, there are 2000 islands and you can see the track of where the disaster was taking place.

77
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:57,010
And we would be looking at this map. So these maps have been formulated from OCHA.

78
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:03,330
They would not be formulated immediately. They would probably take a day or two to come through here,

79
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:10,960
but we would be able to kind of work out the track of the typhoon so we can see where the most damage is taking place based on that track.

80
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:18,580
So if I can just kind of fill you in with some of the background so, you know, if you can imagine you were being deployed to this emergency,

81
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:24,400
you know, the typhoon takes place, it reaches the news, you get a phone call and you're asked to deploy.

82
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,999
And at that stage, you need to think about all the things that you've got to pack.

83
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,060
So it's not just looking at your clothes and but also do you need to take food for yourself and water?

84
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:41,620
You're unsure of the situation on ground. And do you need to be able to provide your own food for a week or two?

85
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,820
Do you need to make sure you've got water supplies, any medicines for yourself?

86
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,930
What kind of methods that you're going to get into the country?

87
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:58,390
So just think about those. Is a kind of relay the situation to you of what the situation was at this stage within the Philippines.

88
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:08,440
So the storm had basically sweep through this region, which was just under a day, and it caused widespread spread flooding.

89
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:16,960
Two weeks prior to this typhoon, there was an earthquake that had struck within the islands of Cebu and Bohol.

90
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:22,720
Now, Bohol was okay. It wasn't in the past, but Sibi was in the path of of this destruction.

91
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:29,379
So, you know, it's something to bear in mind that we're already having to respond to an earthquake.

92
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:42,070
Within that disaster, there were 44 provinces that were hit, 1.1 million homes have been damaged and 33 million coconut trees.

93
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,600
Now, the reason that's crucial is because this is a huge income for the country.

94
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:57,190
There were 6000 lives have been lost, 180 sorry, 181,803 were missing.

95
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:03,820
And 14 million inhabitants have been affected, with 5.9 of these been workers within the country.

96
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:12,280
So the media stations were able to broadcast what was happening in the morning, but by the afternoon, all of the communications were down.

97
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:16,510
The towns and villages were completely cut off without any assistance.

98
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:23,170
And large parts of later in Samar Islands were without power for weeks.

99
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,729
There was widespread power interruptions. There were a lot landslides.

100
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:33,760
There were flash floods reported. And many of the roads have been blocked completely by trees.

101
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,470
So you couldn't access certain aspects of the islands.

102
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:42,850
453 domestic and international flights were canceled.

103
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:47,380
And the airports, some of the airports, sorry, were closed on the eighth and 9th of November.

104
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:55,300
The ferries were affected. And as you can see, with the islands within the Philippines, you would need to move around to the different islands.

105
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,960
And the relief effort started the next day on the ninth November.

106
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:08,410
Can I have the next slide, please? So these is just some of the pictures that would show the kind of destruction that took place.

107
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:16,209
And as you can see, the houses were you know, it's a very poor country in many aspects of the houses were tin,

108
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:22,490
they were wooden, they were some were brick, but they weren't, you know, not particularly well built.

109
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:27,030
It completely decimated large areas of the islands.

110
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:37,210
Some islands had 90% damage. And you've got those populations then without any shelter, without any schools, without any health facilities.

111
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:45,770
Next slide, please. So once we've been deployed into the islands, you're kind of having a look at what the situation was.

112
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:51,680
Initially, we were looking at the road systems and trying to get some of the trees removed so that we could access

113
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,020
all of the islands and start mapping the situation of what was going on with each of the populations.

114
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:05,000
And one of the one of the things that you often find with these situations is there are additional

115
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,470
public health risks that you come across as you're exploring what's going on in the island.

116
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:16,820
And this was one of them on the islands that I was working on. We had found that an oil ferry had been pushed ashore.

117
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:20,270
The ferry had been damaged.

118
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:26,569
And so oil was leaking out. And this was a huge port for a fishing area of beautiful waters.

119
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:33,290
Before this it happened. Huge volumes of oil, as you can see, was being poured out into the oceans.

120
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:38,600
And we saw a lot of the locals, because it was their livelihood was was in the water,

121
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:45,290
collecting the oil by hand, literally wearing shorts, actually on arrival to the scene.

122
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:52,220
The fumes were unbelievable. And you could stay there for about an hour before you started to get quite a serious headache.

123
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:59,450
So this is one a small disaster that was taking place that needed to be addressed within the Philippines itself.

124
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:04,150
Next slide, please. So here's just another map.

125
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:10,819
So the red circles that you can see, these were the W.H.O. field hubs.

126
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:18,220
So these are the cluster systems that were activated. The main cluster system would have taken place in Manila, the capital of Philippines.

127
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,440
Everybody would initially be deployed to Manila, who was working for W.H.O.

128
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,280
And then you would be sent off to one of the hubs in the islands to support that response.

129
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,280
You would land in an island, say, and it really didn't matter which one you landed in.

130
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:44,950
You land into the island through a plane is usually finding one that is taking international support in and from the island.

131
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:53,409
You would usually have someone standing there with a sign that will say W.H.O. meetings have been held in X location, etc.,

132
00:13:53,410 --> 00:14:03,090
so that everybody could start to meet and coordinate among themselves what was going on, who was present, who was doing what at this stage.

133
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:08,290
Now, this wasn't about who is going out there and providing house supplies per say.

134
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,710
Initially, it was about who is going to access different parts of the island so they can see if there are any needs.

135
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:18,380
You know, is there a population that has needs?

136
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,730
What's the damage like? Are the health facilities functioning?

137
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:30,399
What's going on in the mountains? Do we need to respond to that area or do we need to cross the area off and say there's no assistance required?

138
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:35,050
Let's move on. So the initial response at that stage was getting everybody out,

139
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:42,670
visiting as many of the provinces as possible to see what's happening and to map the populations that had needs,

140
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:47,170
to map what was going on with the health facilities, what was damaged, what was functional.

141
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:52,809
Next slide, please. This is one of the coordination hubs.

142
00:14:52,810 --> 00:15:00,520
So for Ella Ella Island. They all met in the Ministry of Health building and as you can see, that have been completely untouched.

143
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,170
They put up tables and each table represented a different cluster.

144
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:09,480
The cluster team would be at each of the tables.

145
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,290
You'd have health, you'd have communications, water, nutrition, wash, etc.

146
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:19,209
And then on the there was a stage, if you like, within the room.

147
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:25,870
On the stage was where you sat so that you could easily coordinate to share about what was going on,

148
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,440
feeding, not to produce all the maps you needed for your clusters.

149
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:37,300
They would also be able to coordinate with all of the clusters that were present, and you also could discuss with other clusters what was going on.

150
00:15:37,810 --> 00:15:43,210
You could ask them to provide assistance. If you needed assistance, the transport would be sitting there.

151
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:47,620
Maybe there was a tree and you couldn't get to a location. So you need to inform someone.

152
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,090
Can someone remove the tray?

153
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:59,850
And so that would be kind of your coordination hub in the mornings from about approximately 7:00 in the morning and about 9:00 at night,

154
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:07,000
there would be meetings where everybody who was responding on the island would enter into the Ministry of Health.

155
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:14,500
He would have a quick kind of catch up with your cluster feed information that you'd found from that day into the clusters.

156
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,160
And then there would be a briefing that was given about what's been found.

157
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,690
Who's been where? Who's going to respond where next?

158
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,549
And then everybody would either go off for the day to respond to these locations or go off to bed.

159
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:32,500
And, well, often you're kind of typing up your data, what you found, etc., and then you're going off to bed.

160
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:40,239
And it was an incredibly intense period. You know, usually we say three weeks really is a kind of turnover.

161
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,510
But actually what happens is you can't get people out that quickly.

162
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:50,260
And once people know the situation, they want to stay in. So some people were staying, you know, six weeks, three months.

163
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,840
And those people were really starting to get pretty tired.

164
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:59,799
You know, you're sleeping a few hours every evening and then you're going back to kind of really responding.

165
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,030
Remember, at this point, time is of the essence. You don't know who's stuck where.

166
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,710
You don't know if people are under rubble.

167
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:14,320
You don't know what health facilities they have, what water they have, where their access is, and what health facilities at this stage.

168
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:23,840
Next slide, please. So by the 19th of December, it's quite some time in here we have mapped.

169
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:32,200
So this is just in Ireland. But this was happening for every single island within the Philippines where the typhoon swept through.

170
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:36,179
We would be mapping the responses of what's happening.

171
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:43,950
So each of the dots would represent a health activity and the same would be done for Walsh and the logs, cluster nutrition,

172
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:48,850
etc. whether there's an outbreak of disease that we need to be responding to and

173
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:54,929
whether the psychosocial support that is needed within those locations nutrition,

174
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:59,580
primary health care, hospital support, etc. and we would just be able to get a picture.

175
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:04,530
So as you can see, you can see a direct path really where the typhoon has been.

176
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:08,309
And these are really the areas where we've needed to support.

177
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:11,910
And the yellow dots, if you can see, is where we need to do further assessments.

178
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:20,160
Next slide, please. So I just I'm actually just going to open up the screen again.

179
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:30,229
I really just want to hear from your side what you think would be sort of the huge risks within a timeframe.

180
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:35,490
What do you think would be the main cause of death? What do you think the health facilities would be saying?

181
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:40,350
Ryan, could you just lead that, please, and feed it to to make some input here?

182
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:50,640
Otherwise, absolutely anybody will stop. Let's go with some folks who think like drowning.

183
00:18:50,820 --> 00:19:01,380
It's like there's a storm surge and then like structures falling on top of people or like objects flying around, like hitting people.

184
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:07,590
It could be a cause of death. So that was I had that feeling of, I'm going in.

185
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:13,410
If you can think about infrastructures be falling on people's like broken bones, stuff like that.

186
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:19,709
And also just people maybe not having access to their medications if it's like an urgent medication,

187
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,010
like insulin or something, they need to go to the hospital to get that stress.

188
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:37,680
Anything else I say starvation is in the check. Rape or water, sanitation, and probably also lack of access to medical care.

189
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,230
Kind of building off of what you sort of medication.

190
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:48,440
But if people were receiving treatment for something in the health facility or their home care is no longer available.

191
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:59,990
And the other one I was going to say like maybe like infection from like any like family,

192
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:07,040
like bad cuts or something as a result of like all of the damage, those infection from trauma.

193
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,600
Anybody else? Yes, Jacob. Dehydration just from the start of the water supply.

194
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:20,120
Dehydration. Anybody else? It seems, I think that was okay.

195
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:27,710
So from the list. So one of the jokes I had to do a little bit later on was to go through the list of all those that we'd found deceased,

196
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,000
and the majority of the cases was actually drowning and electrocution.

197
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:39,860
And that being that all of the electrical poles, I forgot what you call them, but, you know, that were out of the ground.

198
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:46,520
They had been knocked down in the storm, everywhere was flooded and people were being electrocuted because they were in the water.

199
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:50,330
So it was either electrocution or drowning that we were saying.

200
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:56,570
The injuries that you're talking about from infrastructure was actually what we saw a week later, ten days later.

201
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:02,540
And the reason being was these injuries came about because people were trying to rebuild

202
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:08,149
their homes in very precarious situations and say things were collapsing around them,

203
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,880
they were getting injured and those kind of damages.

204
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:17,540
The other issue that was being raised that was a concern was because of the flooding was the waterborne diseases.

205
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:21,830
It was something else that was that we needed to take seriously.

206
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:27,319
Starvation was not an issue at this stage, but in some countries it would be a major concerns.

207
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:33,800
And this is where you really need to know the health of your population before you're entering a country to see kind of,

208
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:42,200
you know, what access to food they've had in the past and to medications whether your non KD Yeah.

209
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,879
Non-communicable diseases are going to be a concern in that country or whether the

210
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,670
population on the whole doesn't reach the issues that they would raise for those countries.

211
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:59,930
They would die before they would be on meds, etc. So they were kind of some of the issues that we were dealing with.

212
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:04,550
And as you can see from some of the photos, these were the things that we needed to be involved in.

213
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:11,240
There was a lot of minor injuries. This is often a case when you step up and get involved because they capacity within

214
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,350
the country because of the sheer volume of people coming in is just not great enough.

215
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,700
But at this stage as well, this will be a very short lived response.

216
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:24,470
And you would pull out of the minor injury kind of support to those countries quite quickly.

217
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:35,089
Next slide, please. So here is where we would be going around, say the whole island, regardless of where the storm hit,

218
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:42,060
that island would be assessed to find out whether, you know, the health facilities have been damaged.

219
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,010
Now, this is a perfect reflection of a storm. You can see where there's been no damage, partial damage and total damage.

220
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:54,980
Some locations that was total damage completely where the storm passed was Tacloban.

221
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,110
Tacloban and Cebu I think had quite serious damage.

222
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,459
But here on the bulk of it, it was partial damage.

223
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:08,030
And one of the things that the health cluster would look at is working very closely

224
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:12,360
with the shelter team to see if we can really support the health facilities.

225
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,970
Often it is a one payment.

226
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:23,090
You'll provide them with the facilities to rebuild a roof or get the water system back in place, etc. And then that facility becomes functional.

227
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:28,010
It builds the capacity back up of that country to where it was before the storm.

228
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:35,600
And ultimately, you can leave that island in the state or better than what it was when you before the storm had taken place.

229
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:43,950
Next slide, please. The last thing really to just really raise to you is the media aspect.

230
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:49,470
So the media are usually everywhere within an emergency response, whether it's national or local.

231
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,329
A lot of the common situation, as I've mentioned, have gone down, but people want to know what's going on.

232
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:58,049
And so you will be interviewed in these emergency responses.

233
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:05,070
And it's very crucial that you ensure that you are feeding them appropriate guidelines.

234
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:12,660
Now, from a W.H.O. perspective, and for any NGO that is credible in in all honesty,

235
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,620
you do need to go through some training before you start and talk to the media,

236
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:22,290
because the media can twist things or you can say the wrong things that don't come across right.

237
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:31,799
And I'm one of the courses we do. We go into a bit of depth about kind of what happens with the media and how you can get yourself into some trouble,

238
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,210
shall we say, with what you're saying.

239
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:41,159
So this is a very short snippet, really, of the Philippines response and kind of just going through some of the maps with the Philippines.

240
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:49,440
And the reason I like this case study is to say is because it was a response where the government went through the right systems with the UN,

241
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,120
they declared the emergency through the UN. The cluster system was activated.

242
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,870
We had the national and the regional hubs that took place.

243
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,250
All of them were in full communication with the Ministry of Health.

244
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:08,879
Nothing was done without explaining to them what we were doing and without asking permission from the government.

245
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,370
The government was very supportive of the support and they knew what was going on and highly engaged.

246
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:19,649
Once the response was over, there was actually a plan to deactivate the clusters.

247
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:23,220
And again, this is something that we don't see a lot at the time. People stay on.

248
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:30,150
But there was a slow deactivation where you kind of make sure that your health facilities are up and running.

249
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:35,010
Your large volume of casualties that are coming in, have been treated in the hospitals,

250
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:43,230
can now meet the capacity needs that are coming in, the supplies are getting into the country, your drugs, your consumables.

251
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,600
They've got the equipment and technology that they need. And then you can kind of start to move out.

252
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:55,410
In this response, you would declare that they would start to leave and then all the other clusters

253
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:59,790
would start pulling out unless there was a reason for someone to stick around.

254
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:10,350
You may well have people who stay on to do other kind of human, not humanitarian and development work.

255
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:17,610
Sorry, they may stay on to just kind of support some of the communities, in particular your psychosocial services.

256
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,770
Again, in the Philippines, they had an extraordinary mental health capacity.

257
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,129
They were very strong Christians.

258
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:33,209
So I think they had the faith to support them, but they were very much able to really turn to their faith for support.

259
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:41,460
And so they were they were often praying through all the meetings as a support mechanism in order to get them through this process.

260
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:48,270
So dare I say it's probably the wrong terminology, but it was almost one of those beautiful responses that was textbook.

261
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,320
I've never seen one before. They have happened.

262
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:57,540
But this is one of those textbooks responses which was really, from my perspective, lovely to see.

263
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:03,030
And it wasn't so traumatic because it was managed so well. And obviously the situation's horrific.

264
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,450
But, you know,

265
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:11,610
when you go into some emergencies and they're being poorly managed and people are staying around this corruption within the governments,

266
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:20,040
etc., it makes things a lot harder to respond to. So yeah, that's really just a brief snapshot of the Philippines response.

267
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:24,960
Do you want to take questions later on now, Ryan? The questions now on your presentation.

268
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:30,240
Yes. Any questions, Kevin?

269
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:40,410
And I was curious if you could speak about the collaboration between the local and international communities or organizations,

270
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:47,940
because it seems like all these international aid groups come in and set up shop and then start calling the shots.

271
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:57,479
But really, the people who know how to move a tree or help find a food supply or something wouldn't be those people, I would imagine.

272
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:01,469
And I'm just curious where that harmony was. Yeah, good question.

273
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:06,270
So as I mentioned, the relief efforts didn't start to the second day.

274
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:13,560
So we know that at the beginning of any emergency, it's the local community communities that will go in and start the response.

275
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:21,780
They were incredibly proactive. They were really moving a lot of the trees, trying to get the roads accessible for us.

276
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:29,460
But obviously we would have the military actually arrived as well to kind of bring in some of the equipment to get some of this moved as well.

277
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:33,960
But the relationships were very strong and this isn't always the case.

278
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:37,890
They were very appreciative of us being there. What I.

279
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:50,130
Because the issue is that there was, as most responses that are attractive locations, dare I say, or politically kind of interesting.

280
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,950
There was too many people piling in.

281
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:59,570
And so the government made it very clear that if you're not registered, if you don't come and talk to us, you have no rights to be in the country.

282
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:06,390
And so they were getting people at the airports and saying, you need to register with us if you're going to do any work.

283
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,850
So they knew who was coming in.

284
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:17,130
That was quite a few days delay to say there was huge kind of presents arriving, but it was a very positive and strong move of the government.

285
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,010
They wanted us there. They were incredibly supportive of us there so long as we were communicating with them.

286
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:29,100
The locals themselves, quite honestly, were the easiest people I've ever had to work with.

287
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:37,770
They were thankful they would do anything to help. I'm sure we did all four things, but, you know, they just had a really positive attitude.

288
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:43,770
There were some organizations I was the Cluster Health Cluster Lead for that response.

289
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:49,020
And I remember a organization that arrived on day seven.

290
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:56,160
And when we kind of came back to talk about what everybody was doing, they responded saying, Oh, we're doing circumcisions.

291
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:03,330
And I just I literally didn't know what to say because I was so taken aback, thinking, everything that's going on, what are you doing?

292
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,000
So I think there are some things going on that are totally inappropriate in those situations.

293
00:30:09,450 --> 00:30:16,260
But as a general emergency, this was a good one and with good working relationships, quite honestly.

294
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:24,860
There's one question in the chat from Georgina. How was the local leadership response?

295
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:28,620
I'm curious if they stayed with the people and helped with police responses.

296
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:34,340
I'm curious because of cases from other countries where the local leaders flee and leave the citizens helpless.

297
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:40,040
Yeah, they were outstanding. And quite frankly, it's not to say they had full capacity.

298
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:48,800
Sometimes you would need to drive a situation because they didn't understand it, but they were definitely the leaders.

299
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:57,560
We were there as a support mechanism. We were there to support them and bring the capacity that they required.

300
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:06,139
They were heavily involved. They were very present and credit to them, quite frankly, for this response.

301
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:11,630
And with the people that I worked with in W.H.O. situation, it was a really good response.

302
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,980
And I say. Any other questions from the clubs?

303
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,949
Okay, so I went so soon, as was the whole family about that.

304
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:27,360
And I was actually in Tacloban as a physician volunteered.

305
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,170
And at that level, keep in mind that like it.

306
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:38,370
So I from what I understood, a lot of the physicians have left the island with their families as an evacuation,

307
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,810
basically, and then others had family members that were hurt or killed.

308
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:46,470
And so they weren't able to do their job.

309
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,719
Right. And so this is a common thing you see in disasters.

310
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,040
So, you know, it's in just because someone doesn't necessarily participate, you know, it doesn't mean that there's something corrupt.

311
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:06,000
Yeah, absolutely. Just to add to that, I think just to say, you know, 14 million that were affected, six, nearly 6 million of those were workers.

312
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:12,960
So their first response is to their families. They need to protect their family, sort their homes, get everything safe and secure.

313
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:17,129
Now, some obviously will drop everything and go and help in the hospitals.

314
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:20,460
But if your family needs you, you're going to look after your family.

315
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,110
So, yeah, but I mean, that is part of the community. Clear up, isn't it?

316
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:29,760
They are supporting their families and helping to rebuild their homes, etc.

317
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,430
So any other questions? Because I have one question, suits.

318
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:39,420
And just as you were coming on this, can you talk about 20 minutes,

319
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:44,490
talk about how to look after yourself when you're on the response or even working internationally somewhere?

320
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,130
Yeah. Okay.

321
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:54,330
So I think the first thing before you deploy anywhere is to make sure, well, firstly the obvious have your vaccines, but that's quite obvious.

322
00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:01,170
But secondly is to know what you need to take. So in some of these islands, there was no food and water.

323
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:06,570
And so people were turning up, taking the supplies of the local people because,

324
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,560
you know, it was very limited and there wasn't the hotels that they were expecting.

325
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:18,629
And then they were causing a another disaster in its own right, if you like, by taking away the supplies.

326
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:25,840
It was the same with the drugs as well. We were people were coming in, taking all the drugs out, the pharmacies to do their responses elsewhere.

327
00:33:26,190 --> 00:33:29,459
So if you're going into a response, make sure you know what you're taking,

328
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:33,960
whether that's a tent, even because there's no accommodation, whether that's food,

329
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:37,920
whether that's your stock of water for a few days, three days usually,

330
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:43,080
and whether you need to take your own supplies in and depending on what response you're doing.

331
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:49,620
Secondly, and I think for me, this is the biggest factor is your mental health.

332
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:55,830
You will without a doubt see things that will change you forever, and it depends where you go.

333
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,950
For me, the Philippines is quite a healing experience, if you like,

334
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:04,470
because it was done so well and it was lovely to see an emergency response that was so positive.

335
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:12,870
But in other situations like South Sudan and Sudan, where I responded as well, or Syria, they're not so positive.

336
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:19,830
And you will see things that you you don't in all honesty, your mind should not be exposed to seeing.

337
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:27,900
And so I think one of the things we do not talk about and men are the worst at this is the actual need to access mental health services.

338
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,500
When I came off the field from my first deployment,

339
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:38,250
I literally spent a week living with a counselor in order to talk about all of the things and map everything I'd seen,

340
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:44,040
process each of the situations that were quite traumatic so that I was protecting

341
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,280
my mental health and to continue to function in the roles that I've done.

342
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:54,990
I've watched people who haven't looked after the mental health and I've seen grown tough men lying on the floor crying,

343
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:58,680
saying, I just can't get up anymore in the field. I've done it. I can't do anymore.

344
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:02,610
And that's not a rare case that I've seen in my in my career.

345
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:13,319
I think the other thing as well is security aspects in an initial response, unless you've done some serious homework, don't trust anybody.

346
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,870
And I don't mean that in a bad sense. But, you know, the police have been my worst nightmare in some countries.

347
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:22,740
The military have been an absolute disaster and quite terrifying.

348
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:29,070
A lot of the police military have been on drugs, have been drunk with very serious weapons.

349
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:33,389
You know, yes, people can be lovely and not everybody's like that.

350
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:39,030
But just now in a situation, people will be fighting for their life and fighting for survival.

351
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,960
And so I think you just need to be very careful on your security situation.

352
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:53,369
Most humanitarians are injured, killed or kidnaped because they did not stick to the security guidance and say,

353
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:57,030
you know, you will be given a security guidance package. Stick with that.

354
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:02,910
There are huge risks. Car crashes, a massive because of the types of roads you're going in, etcetera.

355
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:07,800
Listen to what people tell you. Sometimes it can seem over the top until something goes wrong.

356
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:14,190
So yeah, it is risky business is to say, but it is an incredible business.

357
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,770
At the same time to be part of. It's moving to a lot of.

358
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,020
No, no, I agree with the with the metal.

359
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:29,670
I mean, the Philippines was was a very basic response.

360
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:40,790
I think it was wonderful to be part of it. But yeah, like when I was in Ukraine in 2000, 30 citizens were all like I was the humanitarians I was with.

361
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,600
Luckily a very, very strict, smart leader there.

362
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,170
And there was a police guy that would have said, we are in the middle, we're walking back from somewhere.

363
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:53,190
I so and I was like, Oh, good, we're safe. It's the police. You like it, whatever.

364
00:36:53,510 --> 00:37:01,610
And it was like, okay, the stuff, you know, you just keep walking and it's, it's,

365
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:07,790
it's you go with like these larger organizations follow this very public space.

366
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:16,110
It's the right thing to do. So yeah. And again, just to kind of reiterate the mental health thing, but I came back from Gulf Bizarre.

367
00:37:16,110 --> 00:37:20,280
The first time I was going to types was like I'd never going to see like the counseling thing.

368
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,230
I eventually went to the counselor, I went to the university counselor because I was doing my Ph.D. They had no idea how to,

369
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:30,780
you know, talk about this kind of things. But there are organizations mostly online,

370
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:38,400
but they have counselors who specialize and work with people who work internationally and in disaster settings like this.

371
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:43,220
Fantastic. Any other questions from the course? Great.

372
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,319
So we are now going to turn over. Come up.

373
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,120
Sorry, Ryan, on the chat. Thanks.

374
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:57,870
So, Georgina, how do you balance your role as a humanitarian while also lending agency, the people you're helping?

375
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,310
So there's no savior complex or at least try to limit it.

376
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:10,020
And it's also say, ultimately, I think you need to listen to the local people and the government.

377
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:14,580
That's ultimately, I think, the bottom line, if you're prepared to listen to people,

378
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,670
I think, you know, you're not going to go in telling people what to do.

379
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:25,440
And there are lots of things that take place now in order to hear the voices of those who've been affected.

380
00:38:29,430 --> 00:38:33,810
I think that's probably the main advice, but I'm not quite sure if I'm answering the question.

381
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:41,100
All right, Georgina, if I answered it. Yeah. Yeah. You have to go, then.

382
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:45,900
Yeah, I think that's the key. And I think I will say one thing.

383
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:52,230
When you first go in and there is an element of arrogance that you think, look, man, I've got this job, I can do X, Y and Z.

384
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,730
You know, I've done this role now for over ten years,

385
00:38:57,270 --> 00:39:07,560
and I feel I know nothing now because you realize how complex, how difficult, how every scenario is unique.

386
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,370
So I think, you know, just be very careful. If you're new in, you will pretty much know nothing.

387
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:17,100
And it's going to be a very dramatic learning curve.

388
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:24,750
But at the same time, when you're struggling that you feel you know nothing and be aware that everybody is on this huge learning curve too.

389
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:26,490
So don't be too discouraged by it.

390
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:33,959
But yeah, I think, you know, if your heart's right and you are genuinely trying to help people, I think that's also a good method.

391
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,630
It's turned into a business these days. So I think that's also changed the mentality of people out there.

392
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:47,450
It's a real move on to the activity next. So we're all sitting here.

393
00:39:48,350 --> 00:39:52,700
Richard Floyd, come over to you briefly just to explain the logistics of it.

394
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:58,760
Yeah. Thank you. Just just to pick up on Georgina's question as well, because I think it's a really good question.

395
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:07,310
I would just add one other tip. Look for look for the people who can who are in the community,

396
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:14,570
who can actually do what you're doing after you've gone and give them a voice at its earliest stages possible,

397
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:18,470
bring them into it and make that decision whatsoever.

398
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:23,930
So we are going to try and put you through a little exercise.

399
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:36,500
I just need to ask you to check your emails to see whether or not you have received an email and that you can click on to it at the moment.

400
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:45,700
If I if I actually show my screen, I can show you how many people have so far joined the exercise.

401
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:56,330
So when you click on the in check on the email which I've sent you and activate the I'd say you're into the exercise,

402
00:40:56,330 --> 00:41:04,870
you'll see that the little blue light will come on. So if your name's not got a blue light by then, I know you're not ready to it.

403
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:13,920
If you haven't got the email, you can't find the email. Just mention that to Ryan and we can do some looks like everyone in group one is just Kevin.

404
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,800
Kevin, have you got the email yet? No. Ryan, maybe we just sent it to you.

405
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:27,890
But I do have these now. This recording. It's Jacob.

406
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:31,820
Jacob in group two. I don't know. Have you got the email? Caroline.

407
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:35,830
Caroline? Beth Parker. I have it open.

408
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:47,700
I just don't believe for some reason. That is about a whisper.

409
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:59,050
So brute force seems to be ready to go. Group one is pretty much ready to go, just waiting for Kevin to run to.

410
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:10,660
And then group three. Ron, let me know when you.

411
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:20,220
Well, actually, I can tell from here. Okay. I think you're pretty safe, though.

412
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,000
I should know. My wife doesn't work on my computers, and I.

413
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:52,770
I'm just going to send the link to people who are still online and I understand why.

414
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:03,420
Someone to keep them. It's a group who's ready.

415
00:43:03,430 --> 00:43:15,490
Group one knows that to. Right for these folks.

416
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:35,330
Yes. You got your email? So I think since Georgina's been sent over there, that's fine.

417
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:42,910
As long as it. And Kevin, if you're only getting it, you can look on that.

418
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,640
Chris, at the end because he's also helped. Hello.

419
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:59,350
I'd say. So maybe Chris Floyd, if you can move on, Kevin, because you're both healthy.

420
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:14,600
So, listen, we have to ask you to better this.

421
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,940
Georgina, what's your goal? Okay.

422
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:27,270
And you know what people say rock and now because they're both serious.

423
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:34,110
So, Richard, I think we good. Okay. I'm just getting what I can do for Georgina.

424
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:40,650
But if I just message just Georgina, I can't.

425
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,810
All right. Okay. If you're ready to go, let's go. I'll make a start. Okay.

426
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:50,640
All right. So what I'll do is I'll just quick.

427
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:57,090
I've just been honest. It very quickly show you what it will look like when the exercise starts.

428
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:08,610
Just go back in here. All right, so I'm just going to share my screen again and this time.

429
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:19,830
So I've got so many windows open. Housing is zoom gone baby game.

430
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:28,440
So just using this is and this is like a test run exercise is not the one you're going to do,

431
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,219
but you will have something like this in front of your screen. It's got some nest written.

432
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:38,340
There's got the title of the exercise and so on. And when I press play to get the exercise started,

433
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:48,390
the picture will go and you'll be taken into what an effect is like an inbox, and you'll see a description of the exercise.

434
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:55,350
It'll tell you what your role is. You can click on below to find out who your team members are.

435
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,580
You can see who the coordinator is. So just very simple little introduction to the exercise.

436
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:06,000
But most importantly, on the left hand side you can see you've got a series of inboxes and basically you're going to get emails.

437
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:13,860
And mostly this is a very simple exercise, runs just on a few injects, but even get emails,

438
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:19,590
some text messages, some social media, some of you will get paper notes down here.

439
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,090
One of you in one role in each group will get a walkie talkie message.

440
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:29,390
I'll show you that in a minute or a telephone call. So these are the sorts of messages that are going to come up.

441
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,400
The whole idea of the software is to give you a kind of a realistic feel.

442
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:36,390
So this is the inbox. This is somebody getting an email, they can open it.

443
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:45,270
And the software is designed to encourage you to make a decision based on the message you've got.

444
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:50,520
And the idea is you chat within the group, you make those decisions as a group.

445
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:53,580
But because the email came to you, you make the decision.

446
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:59,670
And so to make the decision, you just click on that box at the bottom and you've got three choices.

447
00:46:59,670 --> 00:47:07,680
You either submit a decision, just make forward as the decision you've come to, or you can forward the inject to a member of your group.

448
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:12,540
So you may be the health cluster rep and I think this has got nothing to do with me.

449
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,320
I'm passing this on to the boss, the CIC,

450
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:23,370
so you can submit a decision for decision and you can also ignore decisions so long as you say why you're ignoring it.

451
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:27,120
And that's the idea there. So those are the the main options at any stage.

452
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:30,570
You can click on View Decision History to see what decisions you made.

453
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:39,450
So you can see here we've got a text message, we click on it in the inbox, open it up and there is a message and we can make a decision.

454
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:46,229
In this case, I'll just quickly submit a decision. And when you make a decision, you just write it in if you want to.

455
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:51,180
So minimize the box, go back to again. You can have a look at it, no problem at all.

456
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,560
So it's very simple to do.

457
00:47:53,010 --> 00:48:01,260
Here's a walkie talkie message coming in and you can see you can click Accept and then you can have the choice between either repeating the message,

458
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:08,550
say again, over will repeat the message. You can ignore submitted decision or you just say Roger and you click on that.

459
00:48:09,270 --> 00:48:20,969
Once you have either ignored the message or Roger, you've kicked Roger out, the message becomes a brief log in a message log.

460
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:25,440
So instead of having a phone call, you will see a radio log and you'll see the message appears there.

461
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:28,950
So if you didn't get the message clearly, go to the radio log, it will give it to you.

462
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:34,319
As you can see, very simple. This one, I'm forwarding the message,

463
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,719
I'm selecting a this is the message and I'm going to select somebody else in the group and I'm going to forward the message to them,

464
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:43,970
say over to you, I want you to deal with it. You can see.

465
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:50,430
Got some social media, it comes up it looks very similar to Twitter or to YouTube or whatever.

466
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:57,840
And you can see Ron's done some some social media ideas with some text, with some photographs and so on.

467
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,469
He's going to show you a video anyway. At the beginning.

468
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:07,860
At the start. And again, you can decide to either ignore it or deal with it or pass it on paper notes.

469
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:12,210
Looks like that's a telephone call coming in. Looks like that. And then you accept it.

470
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:16,889
The message will play. And then having listened to it, you can save it to voicemail.

471
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:18,900
Go into your inbox and listen to it again.

472
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:28,680
We won't use information requests, but there are other messages that we can create and we also can add documents into the exercise.

473
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:36,570
One last thing which I'll mention is that you can actually chat to each other like a WhatsApp channel.

474
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:44,820
So in this screen here, you've got one player on the left, you got another player on the right and the the chat function, which is this one here.

475
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:49,889
If you click on that, it opens up the chat function and then you can add a chat.

476
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:54,120
You can select all your group or one member of your group or two members of your group.

477
00:49:54,270 --> 00:50:02,700
It's entirely up to you. And then once you click on that, that's open the chats, click on the chat, and it opens the dialog box.

478
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:07,140
So you can quickly ask a question and you can see it immediately comes through here to the second player.

479
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:13,770
They can now read your chat and reply. So you've now got a chat with like a WhatsApp chat going on within the software.

480
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:18,750
You're always in the same room, so you don't really need to use that, but it's there if you did.

481
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:25,259
Okay, so that's what it will look like and run if you're happy.

482
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:29,310
I think we could probably make a start as I showed the intro video.

483
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:35,670
Yep. Very quickly. So you'll all get this introductory message just to get out quickly.

484
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:43,590
You are whatever your role is in Camp 24 letter, of course, bizarre due to direct movement of some refugees to the bus and to Ireland.

485
00:50:43,590 --> 00:50:48,000
There's quite a few empty houses over there and some operations are being decommissioned.

486
00:50:48,360 --> 00:51:04,290
The violence has just intensified in Myanmar and subtitles will come up in a second for the video that is up next to the Bangladesh.

487
00:51:04,290 --> 00:51:18,229
If you are not going to discuss the economic and political issues with politicians after this,

488
00:51:18,230 --> 00:51:26,600
but I think it's just about the work that she was already good enough intended for.

489
00:51:26,670 --> 00:51:33,450
Bill. I think it's good it didn't mention Myanmar political agenda.

490
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:42,450
Trump political persecution for want of a better partnership option just don't to take on the terms of the independent panel.

491
00:51:42,910 --> 00:51:52,270
There's only just got to get to know each other.

492
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:56,520
She could respond to that. He just wants to collaborate it.

493
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:01,530
Actually, we're very special. We're going to get into the way we look at it the other way.

494
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:06,710
I mean, I never get more.

495
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:15,480
I don't want to do it. I don't want to I really don't want to have to have it.

496
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:27,330
I don't have any relation to just a bus this time of year.

497
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:37,230
Which is it when you go to be sure to make your statements with it?

498
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:44,880
I don't want to be affected. Everybody agree with it.

499
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,550
Mostly stop fighting each other to find out about it.

500
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:54,630
You look at all of the shots, it can do it.

501
00:52:54,660 --> 00:53:07,920
I love it. Joel I'm not only getting rid of it, I like to write it, but I want you to do it.

502
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,710
So one of your Bangladeshi colleagues inform you, inform you that there is a new influx of refugees across the next year.

503
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:21,329
It's bizarre because COP24 is new other group and it has availability.

504
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,760
All the new arrivals are being sent to Camp 24.

505
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:30,570
Most children are malnourished, unsurprisingly, because of crop burning food and water insecurity and violence in Myanmar.

506
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:39,149
And as such, most of children are undernourished. Your colleague is concerned and is concerned that the current facilities in

507
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:43,560
the camp are not sufficient and you need to set up new emergency facilities.

508
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:48,290
So, Richard, I think we can get going now, starting the exercise now.

509
00:53:53,370 --> 00:54:05,880
Now what you can do this process, if you show your feet, you'll be able to see exactly what you did before getting anywhere.

510
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:15,500
So are you in a recession now?

511
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:21,930
So let me. Thank you.

512
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:43,880
Richard. Richard? Yeah. Once that is said, we also know there's problem.

513
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:47,810
We're not allowed. Okay, so.

514
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:53,410
And so on. Other.

515
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:57,020
Okay. Let's say at about one minute we'll report back.

516
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:12,530
And we have to give people a situation like that, whether whether not I respond to that person.

517
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:34,500
And as I learned something about this, when I hear you say, I don't know,

518
01:11:34,510 --> 01:12:08,430
I get letters and I feel like we should be required to fill Warner Brothers maybe in the West and check out the other day.

519
01:12:11,390 --> 01:12:16,540
And let's hope you can make it after that.

520
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:23,960
And it's awesome. Everybody can finish off your cup.

521
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:34,100
So what all the questions about what are the terms of the sun so intense?

522
01:12:34,340 --> 01:12:38,400
Yeah. What else could you buy? Yeah.

523
01:12:39,950 --> 01:12:47,689
Yeah. Okay. So what we will do now is we will go through each one of the injects.

524
01:12:47,690 --> 01:12:53,599
And if you can tell us what you did. I will just mentioned correctly and those classes, both ten and 4 minutes.

525
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:55,970
If you need to leave, feel free to leave.

526
01:12:57,470 --> 01:13:13,390
So let's start off with the first and which was this email from a general in the Bangladeshi army for the other injects you do by your.

527
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:18,200
But for this one let's go round by group and each group can talk about the general response to this.

528
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,370
We'll start over here. Okay.

529
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:24,560
So in this scenario,

530
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:39,470
we learn that there were a lot of children that were coming in and we wanted to first determine which children had their mothers with them,

531
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:44,750
which did it. And so kind of organizing my response to that,

532
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:54,530
kind of keeping all the families together in one unit and then finding a safe haven for children that might

533
01:13:54,530 --> 01:14:04,290
have been separated from their families and kind of finding people who would be caretakers for that time.

534
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:17,059
So some other woman or other people who are like approved by or in the social status categories, but that's great.

535
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:21,980
That's a really important angle to think about. Anything else? Do you guys have any other.

536
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:28,800
It's certainly diverse with how we approach each sector respond to this.

537
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:38,070
But I'm not sure if you're looking at. Yeah, great group.

538
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:43,530
Whatever number this group is to do, you have to.

539
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:52,930
So you take a walk? Yeah, just in general.

540
01:14:52,930 --> 01:15:00,640
How did your group respond to this one? I think we really kind of focused more so on the fact that we wanted to all

541
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:08,409
account for the fact the violence that was going on and bringing in the people

542
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:19,600
that were coming from kind of into Bangladesh and give them more housing because it seemed like that was urgent in the Bangladeshi farmer general.

543
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:30,010
So it was kind of making sure that they had proper housing and we didn't seem too happy with the.

544
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:36,490
How the village itself was and the quality of the village integrity village.

545
01:15:36,850 --> 01:15:41,980
So we wanted to make sure that both houses of comfort and they were happy with the place that they were.

546
01:15:44,220 --> 01:15:54,810
Group in the back of that. I think just feel events aware of the situation of Congressman Eric Cantor,

547
01:15:54,950 --> 01:16:04,690
making sure there is space for that kind of fear that was needed for 24 hours.

548
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:13,370
Now, all of that and also the timing. It's mostly like nutritional needs assessment and putting those in place also.

549
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:19,580
Every person has a search to decommission.

550
01:16:19,790 --> 01:16:30,799
So we were reestablishing all of those avenues of care and then the nutrition team ordering the bar, the nutrition bars for the children.

551
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:34,250
But those would be arriving for a couple of weeks.

552
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:44,629
So we were just trying to brainstorm avenues for which to get food piles ready for destruction or whether nourished would arise.

553
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:53,030
And we talked about communicating with local agricultural centers that if they had any excess resources.

554
01:16:53,030 --> 01:16:56,090
But that's our first script.

555
01:16:56,690 --> 01:17:00,320
Richard, any issues, any comments on those that seemed.

556
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:08,940
So we need to move on to having individual cluster leads of pulled out.

557
01:17:09,540 --> 01:17:16,080
So a couple of minutes in the wash cluster got a lead from a note from the manager who's a community leader,

558
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:22,650
essentially saying there's no safe water to drink. Their counterparts aren't helping them.

559
01:17:23,610 --> 01:17:25,259
And they were given chlorine tablets,

560
01:17:25,260 --> 01:17:32,610
but they are taking those like a medicine tablet because some of the wash leads talk about various folks to this.

561
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:46,130
That's basically how people are referred to the health services to get the proper treatment for whatever infections going around.

562
01:17:46,490 --> 01:17:55,050
And then they need to be instructed on how to properly use the chlorine tabs so they don't make themselves more sick on top of having diarrhea.

563
01:17:56,810 --> 01:18:05,209
So that was supposed to yeah, I think it was chlorine tablets point to like there needs to be instructions on how to use it,

564
01:18:05,210 --> 01:18:08,960
but then like what quantity to use because if you're not using enough chlorinated,

565
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:16,880
if your water is isn't chlorinated to the right concentration, then you're not necessarily making a water any safer to drink.

566
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:21,350
If any other leads went to anything else.

567
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:26,930
I think it really highlights over here the importance of the importance of education in Wash.

568
01:18:27,590 --> 01:18:32,060
It happens very often that you give people the closure tablets and they think it's just the medicine tablet.

569
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:39,740
The other issue that comes quite often chlorination is clean water just tastes really bad, so people will taste it and you don't want to drink it.

570
01:18:40,370 --> 01:18:44,900
So making sure that through proper education, you know, they know that this is safe water.

571
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:53,570
If there's such an intolerance of water. Bonnie and Susan, Richard, anything else to add on this one?

572
01:18:55,370 --> 01:18:58,790
I just think with the wash side of things that it's pretty important.

573
01:18:58,820 --> 01:19:01,760
I think we underestimate public health messaging.

574
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:10,100
It seems to be a minor thing, but is an immense amount of work that goes into this, you know, in the wash to a huge part of this.

575
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:15,110
So, yeah, I know you said that, Ryan, but it's just to reiterate, they are crucial roles.

576
01:19:15,950 --> 01:19:24,139
Absolutely. At the same time, the health cluster lead and the nutrition cluster.

577
01:19:24,140 --> 01:19:29,660
We've got a note from the nurse and the nurses saying they're very full.

578
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:36,390
There are about 20 beds over capacity. They are all children.

579
01:19:36,490 --> 01:19:41,530
They are just smaller and don't take up too much space. But you still need staff, photos and other resources.

580
01:19:43,130 --> 01:19:47,350
They'll say that children at home who don't want to come instead taking them to traditional healers.

581
01:19:47,770 --> 01:19:55,450
Is that any way to quickly treat the children, flip free beds at home, and how can they treat the dehydration?

582
01:19:55,450 --> 01:19:58,840
So health and nutritional needs. What did you do for this?

583
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:06,910
For me. I just mentioned that they have like a severe case and maybe they can stay within our treatment center.

584
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:10,990
But the more mild cases, they can stay home with their families and feel more comfortable there.

585
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:17,830
As for nutrition and suchlike like that, we would also bring up the addition of the menu bar and stuff like that.

586
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:21,069
Copy that. Imported. And then we shift to water.

587
01:20:21,070 --> 01:20:28,600
I kind of check that over to our water source in here, but we could potentially import more water and see what our water allocation already is.

588
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,490
Anybody else? Just something we talked about too.

589
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:43,490
Depending on what their capacity for the hospital or whatever resources, resources were a way to treat like acute dehydration, quickly spread it.

590
01:20:43,780 --> 01:20:48,880
So if you're trying to rotate people out quickly, if dehydration is our only issue, you might be able to do that.

591
01:20:49,270 --> 01:20:52,240
But anybody else we mentioned,

592
01:20:52,840 --> 01:21:01,780
like we creating like local hubs near where the works being delivered within the communities and having that help with the rehydration therapy,

593
01:21:01,780 --> 01:21:06,040
just that it's faster, it's something happening in the hospital that it's just like cares.

594
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:13,030
That's also another way to deal with the hydration as well is using oral rehydration solution.

595
01:21:13,030 --> 01:21:14,670
So it's essentially just like a gator,

596
01:21:14,680 --> 01:21:23,140
so like enough salts that it doesn't mess with the body's salt balance of the less severe cases setting the IVC can do that as well.

597
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:31,959
CS Richard, anything to add on to that one? Just remember, you've got community health workers go out and visit people if they're trained up.

598
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:38,230
So it's about training your capacity in your community and if the children deteriorate, then they can bring them back in.

599
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:54,560
Often. And then the CIC would receive a social media post from a local post community,

600
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:58,969
essentially saying that they're a bit upset that refugees are getting all this free food,

601
01:21:58,970 --> 01:22:03,830
water, shelter and everything, but they aren't getting anything at all.

602
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:09,860
And there's a lot of agreement we get from other people in the host community.

603
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:15,980
How did the CIC respond to this? I don't know this.

604
01:22:17,810 --> 01:22:20,810
I don't know if this is the right price,

605
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:27,679
but I actually chose to ignore this because it's it's a bit more it's a public

606
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:36,140
relations and the relationship between the refugees and the people of Bangladesh.

607
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:50,690
And there was a bit of this was a kind of clash between the community and cultures in a lot of different parts of the people of Bangladesh.

608
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:56,149
And the people of Myanmar were in those countries.

609
01:22:56,150 --> 01:23:02,120
So I wanted to focus more on the refugee camp and improve it at fourth, and I wanted to focus on the relationship between the two.

610
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,280
So that's why I chose to ignore it. We did the same thing.

611
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:13,160
And the other thing, however, I was pretty sure that ignoring it was the right course.

612
01:23:13,170 --> 01:23:20,710
I decided that at least it started by trying to open some open communication with local communities

613
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:27,980
and state leadership meetings to explain what we're doing and why we're doing it for this population.

614
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:34,520
But I wasn't confident that that was the right call. Okay, so I guess I just have to comment on that.

615
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:39,950
Yeah, I don't know what the right decision is, but I think maybe not in the immediate aftermath, but maybe weeks.

616
01:23:39,950 --> 01:23:44,180
And like there needs to be discussions about how we can make the whole community, you know,

617
01:23:45,440 --> 01:23:51,559
have a flag and have the same access to resources as we're getting with the refugee communities.

618
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:57,650
Because if there's a discrepancy, there's a chance that violence can erupt because of that.

619
01:23:59,090 --> 01:24:00,860
So not without violence erupts.

620
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:08,630
A lot of is that about six months is that period implications when violence throughout its violent you know is shooting

621
01:24:09,050 --> 01:24:18,350
people die lots of injuries it's a big problem that Richard was just amazing to add on how you respond to this impact.

622
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:21,499
Most people chose to ignore all of the violence.

623
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:24,170
Yeah. For the traffic violence. Yeah. Yeah.

624
01:24:24,170 --> 01:24:32,989
So so one of the things that's a common practice and I don't mean to be touting this fear that I mentioned last week, but it's again,

625
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:40,460
another thing that just brings up is that you always distribute goods on the basis of needs that by your ethnic group.

626
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:47,360
Right. And also hosting the field, treating the host community similar to the way you're treating the refugees.

627
01:24:47,360 --> 01:24:56,480
Because you don't want that because you know, some of it I wouldn't put yourself in.

628
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:00,200
So it's it's a delicate it's always a delicate dance.

629
01:25:00,590 --> 01:25:01,800
And that's what's so interesting.

630
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:07,849
You're dealing with not only all the social issues, but you're dealing with human emotions and you're dealing with politics.

631
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:11,360
And it's so it's a it's a it's it's hard work.

632
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:16,220
So. I'm just moving on.

633
01:25:17,690 --> 01:25:25,280
After about 7 minutes, an email from the W.H.O. to watch cluster saying that the cases of AWB have gone down.

634
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:30,950
But there's a big surge in dengue and the wash cluster should put in place strategies to combat dengue.

635
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:38,510
What are the washcloths to lead to for this book? I caught this too.

636
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:43,840
Why did you. Because they.

637
01:25:44,030 --> 01:25:47,870
They were actually already talking about putting up mosquito nets.

638
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:53,770
And I was sending this over there. So. Because that would possibly help the death.

639
01:25:56,010 --> 01:26:06,319
Well, one source of some serious infection with water containers near or within the house.

640
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:11,660
And so I encourage that bathing or covering those containers so that we're eliminating mosquito

641
01:26:11,660 --> 01:26:16,880
breeding near where people are living and therefore hopefully also limiting infection in that way.

642
01:26:17,660 --> 01:26:22,280
I think it is still the same thing as far as looking for, you know,

643
01:26:22,370 --> 01:26:28,230
asking people to look for standing water and to make sure they're covered and also water statements.

644
01:26:29,070 --> 01:26:36,350
Better control is definitely the biggest thing you can do. Just, you know, that was the actual AP bulletin from a few weeks ago.

645
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:39,980
There is a dengue outbreak over that happening right now.

646
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:46,340
I would love offering to help the city was also can move stake and prepare for it and the clinical side.

647
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:53,510
Great. Excellent. The CIC and the nutrition lead.

648
01:26:54,200 --> 01:27:00,079
Got a text from a six WS saying it looks like the food programs are working towards looking healthier.

649
01:27:00,080 --> 01:27:04,230
People have food and they now have enough supplies to cook from home.

650
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:09,860
Now the CW saw the picture of somebody cooking in their home and a little bamboo cot.

651
01:27:10,610 --> 01:27:21,230
How did the CIC nutrition clusters respond to this? Almost any response to our responses.

652
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:27,890
We're glad everything's going well. And let us tell you anything else.

653
01:27:30,690 --> 01:27:39,260
Yeah. So you just said, like a good. Obviously this idea has got to weigh in.

654
01:27:40,990 --> 01:27:44,410
And then the health cluster chatting to a security guard.

655
01:27:44,410 --> 01:27:53,800
The security guard. So there's a very odd influx of cases, lots of coughing, sneezing, lots of nausea, vomiting and reaction fever.

656
01:27:54,100 --> 01:27:58,240
And he's concerned about this because he might take it home to his family.

657
01:27:59,470 --> 01:28:02,470
How did the health cluster lead respond to this one?

658
01:28:08,120 --> 01:28:15,340
So I said to maybe encourage masking because if their sneezing and all of that, it's one of respiratory and droplet nuclei going everywhere.

659
01:28:15,350 --> 01:28:21,919
So that spreads everybody really easily. Additionally, I need to get some proper waste disposal parents that are vomiting and separate,

660
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:27,470
those who are actually vomiting from those who are just they're sick or like have a rash or a fever or something else.

661
01:28:29,100 --> 01:28:34,440
But we have pretty much like the same thing, which is where PPE is.

662
01:28:34,670 --> 01:28:42,860
Also that maybe like just consulting like any experts on like tropical diseases,

663
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:50,780
just so just in case it's something that like, like anything like that, this.

664
01:28:51,980 --> 01:28:59,850
But then also, just like in the clinics, like she went through, dehydration maybe needs to be prioritized for these patients,

665
01:28:59,850 --> 01:29:02,600
just that they're vomiting and then also have high temperatures.

666
01:29:03,210 --> 01:29:10,560
That's already a problem with people who are like, you know, free of infectious disease that maybe that's something that should be prioritized.

667
01:29:10,950 --> 01:29:16,500
Yeah. So the way this was designed is if you spoke to the CIC Nutrition League here,

668
01:29:16,740 --> 01:29:22,650
you might realize that a lot of coughing and sneezing might be from inhaling smoke inside the houses.

669
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:28,979
And then if you spoke to the mostly, you'd realize that these are cases of dengue over there.

670
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:34,200
So really kind of highlights the importance of talking to your counterparts. You might not always get the full information.

671
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:41,130
It's more like a puzzle, putting everything together. And if only you would have seen this video.

672
01:29:41,230 --> 01:29:49,480
This is actually a video from TikTok from a few months ago and therefore is indicative of a refugee camp pretty much every summer.

673
01:29:49,810 --> 01:29:55,030
And it burns down entire portions of the camps. People get displaced within the camp.

674
01:29:55,540 --> 01:30:02,320
And maybe if you just go around this group by group, talk about the entire group's response to the fire that we have.

675
01:30:03,290 --> 01:30:08,500
We are having supplies for treating birds.

676
01:30:08,990 --> 01:30:16,540
It's things that have to change locations for that imports and water restrictions

677
01:30:16,540 --> 01:30:21,950
because this is also doesn't help with dehydration the same as in most.

678
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:29,500
Necessary there. And then I think also in the post it was mentioned that resources are lost.

679
01:30:29,890 --> 01:30:35,890
So we were able to accumulate in the texts and things that we still have yet.

680
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:44,150
So I'll go out to the area and survey the displaced.

681
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:55,880
Experts say some great examples of.

682
01:31:00,170 --> 01:31:09,870
I believe we kind of respond to them saying that all of us are working together to make sure that there is water,

683
01:31:09,870 --> 01:31:14,430
there are people to help victims or anyone that's injured from this.

684
01:31:14,910 --> 01:31:19,270
And we're doing our best to bring in food and other resources that we can help.

685
01:31:19,290 --> 01:31:27,119
You know, I mean, it was kind of like a multi collaborative thing.

686
01:31:27,120 --> 01:31:31,230
We knew, let's get medics out. There's going to have all the respiratory issues from smoke inhalation,

687
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:35,760
food loss from the fire, potential sue on remaining agricultural that we can use.

688
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:39,749
We talked about resourcing some kind of water input to get that fire out of the

689
01:31:39,750 --> 01:31:42,930
crowd control so we can limit the amount of people present to the district there.

690
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:50,100
Awesome. So I know we have a bit of a time, but before we close up, Richard, to just send any closing comments.

691
01:31:52,630 --> 01:32:00,390
You guys. All they do is that you guys feel the chaos that was like Richard created this.

692
01:32:00,400 --> 01:32:06,430
I think that was the point. Yeah, it it it's incredibly hard, especially at the beginning of these things.

693
01:32:06,550 --> 01:32:14,500
So. Yeah, but it all comes together when Richard sees any closing comments.

694
01:32:15,050 --> 01:32:24,820
I think from my side I was just going to sort of say when we sort of teach about humanitarian operations,

695
01:32:24,820 --> 01:32:28,900
we often ask a simple question, is all humanitarian aid positive?

696
01:32:30,100 --> 01:32:36,040
And it's actually quite an important thing just to remember, even even in this little exercise,

697
01:32:37,880 --> 01:32:45,190
you know, our aid can affect market prices are a can affect tensions between citizen groups.

698
01:32:45,910 --> 01:32:53,889
Aid can legitimize really corrupt leaders and indeed your workers,

699
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:59,710
the people who work within your organization and the way that you deport yourself when you're off duty,

700
01:33:01,120 --> 01:33:05,290
you're seen to be having better salaries, better conditions, driving nice cars.

701
01:33:05,290 --> 01:33:12,790
You've got nice phones, you eat better food. All of these things can impact the community in which you're operating.

702
01:33:12,790 --> 01:33:19,390
So sometimes, you know, you have to ask yourself, what message are my communicating in the way this I'm living and working among these people?

703
01:33:21,430 --> 01:33:27,290
Thank you, Rachel. We will stay as always. Two questions now and Richard.

704
01:33:27,290 --> 01:33:30,640
And to the to stay up here. If anybody will stop them, just step up to the podium.

705
01:33:31,630 --> 01:33:34,750
But thank you so much. And we'll see you on Zoom on Tuesday.

706
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:36,410
You.
