1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,230
Other people. You're not the only mushroom. Mushroom.

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,220
Did you get wind of this kind of you know, you have like a problem.

3
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:14,740
I didn't know what was in the variety. Yeah. I mean, if you look took this name and what it's like, right?

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,160
It's like just a bunch of people asking, oh, is it okay?

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,000
I know. I don't know. And it's like right now, but like, I did it right now.

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:30,230
I answered that if you ever want to go, oh, that was super simple.

7
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:38,820
I honestly just yeah, I like I mean, that's pretty much like a health benefit.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:47,160
Like the first question, I found a piece about it. First question, I was kind of like, is that not enough information or whatever loss?

9
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:56,130
And so that's interesting. It could have been you know, I had a half of how I always I mean, the covariance matrix, like if they were.

10
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:02,850
Oh, right. Yeah, I agree. And I feel like I'm like I like my youngest victim was like, oh, I'm jealous.

11
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:11,090
I mean, there were several that I wrote down on paper that I could argue that I committed in my calculations.

12
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,420
Right. Great. Let's get started. Thank you so much, all of my favorite students.

13
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,240
I really appreciate it. Thanks for starting your break.

14
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,530
Like on time. So.

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,799
Well, I just want to tell you a few things about the projects. Hopefully everyone's going to watch this lecture and listen to this.

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,190
Otherwise, I'll repeat it next week. Yes.

17
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:44,010
But now on canvas, if you go into your project.

18
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,210
Right, you all signed up on this Google doc that was on this page.

19
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:53,520
Now there's a second sheet and it lists your name and which project you're doing.

20
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,880
Like project one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,950
And then now I've given you a group number so that every like there's a project one that's group number one and a project one.

22
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,249
Group number two. Okay. So now everybody has a group number.

23
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:20,580
And when you upload your video to Yellow Dig here, which one super quick high achieving group has done already rise.

24
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:24,690
Which is awesome. Thank you. Right. They labeled it with their group.

25
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:29,159
Okay. So you need to label your group number there because when you look here,

26
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,010
every person is going to peer review two groups and you're referring back to these group numbers.

27
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:41,820
So for example, the this person right here are you an is peer review in groups 13 and five.

28
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:46,560
So you have defined 13, right. That's Project seven of these people, right?

29
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,210
And Group five, which is Project three of these people.

30
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:59,250
All right. So you have to refer to the group number when you post and when you peer review and you can find all that information here.

31
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:09,959
And it is listed if you go into your assignments for one person will upload the video on yellow digg is listed again here.

32
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,320
Please label your video with this group number found in column C.

33
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:18,660
Okay. And if you also go to your assignments and look at the peer review between group,

34
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:26,610
it also tells you like you can find your assignment here, which is just this page book of two assignments.

35
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:32,850
And what you're doing is you're using the scoring rubric which you'll have to download and copy twice.

36
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:38,010
You also make two copies and then you upload your score of the other groups.

37
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,720
Now don't give everybody 100, okay? This is what always happens.

38
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,920
There's like, I want them to do great. Okay, that's awesome. 100. No, please.

39
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,159
Actually critically review it. Okay, it's fine.

40
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,170
If it really is the most amazing project you've ever seen, then maybe it deserves 100.

41
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:58,760
But most likely there's like a little room for improvement. So I want you to.

42
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:06,570
To please review those. Honestly, that other team is not going to see your review sheet, okay?

43
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,500
So nobody will know what you gave them. So be honest and I mean, be nice, right?

44
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:21,870
But be critical and constructive. And so there's also on that document, you have to have like a you have to have at least two comments,

45
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,960
one of which, you know, what did you like about the presentation or what did you think was like?

46
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:36,900
Well, and then what are some areas for improvement? But you'll see you give everybody a score on here and then you can add up a total score.

47
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,110
And so I don't want to see all total scores of 100%.

48
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:51,100
Okay. All right. And then you also do a within group review to try to keep you accountable within your group.

49
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,630
And so this again takes you to a Google doc for which you make a copy and then you can upload it into canvas.

50
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,760
And here you're spelling out who you are and then putting the names of each individual group member

51
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:11,590
and rating everyone from a 1 to 4 on how well they had these how well they contributed to the group.

52
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,100
And then just a few questions about the group dynamics.

53
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:18,069
Okay. And all of these peer reviews completing them.

54
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:28,120
And you're within group peer review, they all go into your grade, your total, your these get some like you did it grade.

55
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:33,960
But then also it's considered when I grade your group, I'm going to.

56
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:42,580
So all of your videos are due December 1st and then we're going to start talking about them the last few classes, the sixth and the eighth.

57
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,540
So I'm going to try to watch all the videos between the first and the sixth.

58
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:55,389
So please get them up on time so that I can then lead some relatively interesting and insightful

59
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:00,430
and useful discussion so that everybody can learn a little bit about all the projects,

60
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:04,570
even if you didn't review them. Any questions on the projects?

61
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,230
Everybody has questions. Is that okay?

62
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,620
Yes. So when do we have to have our peer reviewed?

63
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:24,780
So your peer review needs to be done by the end of the semester so you can worry about your project, uploading your project,

64
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:32,070
and then like it'd be useful if you watch your videos before we discuss them in class,

65
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:37,430
but you don't actually have to submit the pureview until let's see, what do I say on here?

66
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:44,770
I should be like the last day of the. Yeah I have the 12 on here for the pure reviews are do.

67
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:51,260
This should really be do the first. I don't know why it says oh because you have the 13 to engage.

68
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,350
Right? Remember you also have to write some comments on yellow digg too.

69
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,210
But your peer review should be do. The 12th.

70
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,590
Basically, though, when you're done right, like when you've uploaded your video, you might as well do your within group one, right?

71
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,690
Because it's like fresh in your mind how you all did. You can even do it now, basically, and then upload it whenever you're ready.

72
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:17,510
And then the pureview would be good before class on the sixth and eighth, but just before the 13th.

73
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:29,170
All right. So we've always when I've taught this class is my fourth year teaching the class and we've always done these projects,

74
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:35,829
but they differ, but we've never had this many students and so we've always just done the presentations in class.

75
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,590
So this is the first year using this, like I've used geology in a different class, but this is the first way of doing this.

76
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:49,300
So we'll see how it works. We're learning together on that class discussion slash, video upload, but it kind of counts on you doing the work too.

77
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:56,110
Okay. So today we're going to talk about master protocols. If I can keep from blabbering too long, maybe I'll let you leave early.

78
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,580
And then when we come back, we'll talk about mental analysis.

79
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:10,540
And then I have like a whole day on December 1st for to sort of like a catch up, whatever else is left, and I'll fill it with something.

80
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:18,100
Okay. So we finished crossover trials. I want you to have an introduction to what crossover designs were.

81
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:25,419
And today we're talking about master protocols. In particular, we're going to focus on what's called basket designs and umbrella designs.

82
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:33,130
And these are really common, particularly in oncology and have gotten a lot of press and literature in the last 5 to 10 years.

83
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,250
So what I want you to take from this, obviously you don't have a test,

84
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:41,740
but I think it's useful for you all to know when and why you would use these and what are the advantages,

85
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:49,990
advantages and disadvantages of these designs. And in particular, these designs fall into this category of what we call precision medicine designs.

86
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:58,540
So if you haven't heard of precision medicine, this is also like a tag word that's kind of become popular in the last ten,

87
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:08,230
20 years where we have all of this generic and or any kind of information and we're trying to better target the treatment for an individual.

88
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,070
And so these designs fall under that goal.

89
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:20,350
So a master protocol is an overarching protocol that can have multiple objectives that involve coordinated efforts to

90
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:28,839
evaluate one or more drugs in one or more patient populations or one or more diseases within the structure of one trial.

91
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:39,310
So essentially, this is like we write this enormous protocol document that can allow for basically lots of little trials to occur within it.

92
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:46,060
And we're trying to have some efficiency within the structure of if all of these things are going to be the same,

93
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:49,930
then we can just write this overarching document to account for that.

94
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:57,610
So within master protocols, you could have basket trials, you could have platform trials, or you could have umbrella trials.

95
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,160
Any of these could be written within a master protocol, and we'll try to differentiate them.

96
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:11,809
So a master protocol can involve one or more drugs or one or more diseases or multiple drugs.

97
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:17,120
Multiple diseases. And we'll talk about how that is differentiated between umbrella and basket designs.

98
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:26,690
But usually it's either like we have a single disease and multiple drugs or we have one drug and

99
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:33,350
multiple diseases and we're trying to target specific biomarkers of the population or other disease.

100
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:44,570
We can potentially compare drugs to each other, or we might have one control and be comparing each drug to that one control.

101
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:56,370
Basically we're trying to take advantage of this overarching infrastructure or overarching protocol so that we can say,

102
00:10:56,370 --> 00:11:00,839
well, all of these little trials are going to have very similar characteristics.

103
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:05,100
And so we can just kind of all put it all within this one document instead of

104
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,600
having to go through the IRP and protocol development each and every time,

105
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:15,450
however. So like when you think about it, you think, oh, well, that's going to save a lot of time,

106
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:21,059
except for what ends up happening is that you spend so much time up front making sure

107
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:26,070
that this master protocol is appropriate and would allow for all of these ins and

108
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:30,479
outs and multiple little trials that sometimes that amount of time pretrial actually

109
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,690
ends up taking the amount of time it would take to run all of these little trials.

110
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:46,109
So the the you know, it's kind of still questionable whether these are actually more efficient, but they're still really kind of novel.

111
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:55,950
And so they're still all the kinks are being worked through. And so far, it seems like it still could be a useful, useful thing to do.

112
00:11:56,850 --> 00:12:03,840
Okay. So this I took off a deloitte's website and they say that master protocols have these specific benefits.

113
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:10,740
They de-risk programs because you can quickly test hypotheses that you have multiple treatment, arms going.

114
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:14,490
You can look at them more quickly than if you ran one trial and had to run another.

115
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:23,159
You can evaluate excuse me and compare our treatment combinations or competing drugs so you can not only look at drug versus control,

116
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:30,120
but potentially drug versus drug and or combinations of drugs versus other combinations or other drugs or control.

117
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:35,790
Perhaps there's faster time to activation, but like I said, the sort of questions still out on that.

118
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:46,860
I heard a couple of years ago someone from Fred Hutch came to talk about nicer protocols and with cancer designs especially,

119
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,980
and said that they didn't really see those faster time to activation.

120
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,870
But again, as sort of as we learn more and do more of these, perhaps that will be there.

121
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:03,960
There is partners to share risks and costs if there are multiple drugs being tested and multiple pharmaceutical companies sponsoring this.

122
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,720
There is the ability that these resources aren't all within one. One company.

123
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:18,299
There is continuous learning. So these trial designs are usually developed such that as we get new knowledge,

124
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:28,350
we can kind of plug in new drugs or change biomarkers and things within the trial as we as we learn and have new ideas.

125
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,970
And so. Otherwise we would have to finish the trial and then start a new trial.

126
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,990
But here we can say, Oh, there's some new drug. Let's plug this into the master protocol.

127
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,989
So for pharmaceutical companies, there seems to be a cost savings, potential,

128
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:50,300
faster time to activation and quickly, more quickly test drugs for patients.

129
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:58,729
The there is a potential advantage such that before patients would be seen in the clinic and then they might say, okay,

130
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:05,480
you might be eligible for this trial, let's screen you and potentially see if you could actually be in this trial.

131
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,530
Now we have to wait to see like, okay, were they eligible? Could they get it in or not?

132
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:17,389
Or Right, then we could do it again. Here we can just they go through the screening process once and then we can

133
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:21,800
figure out which part of this master protocol are they most appropriate for.

134
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,850
And if they, for example, we find out that they're not eligible, we can kind of plug them immediately into another part of the protocol.

135
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,160
And there's often a control group in the protocol such that we'd still collect their information

136
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,210
and consider them controls while they're basically waiting to get on to some active treatment.

137
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:48,020
For us in academics, this is useful because mostly actually for biostatistician,

138
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,989
because developed methods are still really being developed in this field.

139
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:55,610
So there's a lot of active work and questions about how best to run these designs,

140
00:14:55,610 --> 00:15:02,780
analyze these designs, how you can use these use potential observational data or natural history data.

141
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,809
We'll talk a little bit later about how if there is a single control group, how we deal with that.

142
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:18,049
If cohorts, a new drugs are coming in and out of the study and then patient advocacy groups are particularly

143
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:23,390
interested in these trials because they believe that it has really good advantages for patients.

144
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:31,130
And so they think that if we can get more treatments and find out results faster, that's a good thing for patients in the long run.

145
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:37,819
Okay, so there are these three main types of master protocols. There is umbrella basket and platform.

146
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,750
So Umbrella designs and I always get the umbrella and basket.

147
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,730
Next up, I constantly have to look at the picture.

148
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:51,500
Umbrella design says that we're going to study multiple targeted therapies, so multiple drugs in one disease.

149
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:58,970
A basket design is that we have one drug and multiple diseases.

150
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:05,630
And then a platform design usually just means that there is like more adaptations involved.

151
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:10,700
And so here it says that we could study multiple drugs in the context of a single

152
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:16,010
disease where we can allow for treatments to come in and out of the design.

153
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:21,500
So let me show you some examples. So some pictures.

154
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:25,189
So the umbrella design is like, for example,

155
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:30,739
we're interested in treatment for prostate cancer and then there might be all of these different

156
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:36,530
biomarkers within individuals who have prostate cancer or for which different treatments might target.

157
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:46,670
Or, for example, let's consider lung cancer. There's EGFR patients, there's cross mutation patients, there's this other mutation patients.

158
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:53,480
And so these treatments are precision medicine where they're specifically targeting that biomarker or mutation.

159
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,040
And so for each group of people, we'd have to measure, right?

160
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:59,089
We'd have to get the genetic data on them.

161
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:06,649
Then we could put them within some subtype and then treat them with the specific treatment that targets that basket.

162
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:11,990
Trial, on the other hand, is going to say, here's this biomarker specific treatment.

163
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:14,180
I have this EGFR positive treatment.

164
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:23,060
It targets EGFR, EGFR positive mutations, but anybody with lung cancer could have that breast cancer or prostate cancer.

165
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,259
They could all have that mutation.

166
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:31,880
And we want to see, you know, across these different types of diseases, is this treatment targeting this biomarker equally effective?

167
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,700
Okay. So in a just another, this is the same thing, just another figure.

168
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:44,100
So the umbrella is one disease, multiple biomarkers, multiple drugs.

169
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:51,380
The basket trial is one drug with multiple diseases.

170
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:00,149
And then these are specific titles of trials for which are this type of design.

171
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,090
And we'll talk about the I-spy two battle and long map trial.

172
00:18:05,090 --> 00:18:09,390
I'll give you examples of these umbrella designs and we'll talk about the focus for.

173
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:14,400
And then I'll also give you an example of the NCI match basket study.

174
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:16,739
Okay.

175
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:26,219
So often platform designs get get mixed, not mixed up, but like when people talk about umbrella designs are often also talking about platform designs.

176
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,250
Platform generally just means that things can move in and out of the trials so that as we get more knowledge,

177
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:36,390
we can add in an umbrella, we could add more drugs.

178
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:42,180
So like as a drug, as we find out more biomarkers, as we develop more targeted drugs,

179
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:47,640
we can say, okay, well, in these patients now we have this biomarker for let's add it.

180
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:56,820
So in umbrella trials, we're going to enroll study patients with the same type of cancer or disease.

181
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:03,780
And then we have them assign them to these different cohorts depending upon their filmic information.

182
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:10,109
So we might draw blood, we might, I don't know, do something else to try to get some.

183
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:14,970
It's usually genetic data, but it could be like metabolomics or whatever else.

184
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:22,440
Whatever other omics they're they're measuring out. Often in these trials there's some shared control arm and so usually the patients would

185
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:26,640
come into the trial and there might be some randomization if you have this biomarker,

186
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:29,460
be randomized to that drug or the control.

187
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:39,180
And so there could be a shared control arm such that the shared control arm would include people across all the biomarker mutations.

188
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:49,520
The goal here is to identify new drugs or drug combinations that match these biomarker mutations.

189
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,510
And basically, this is like a phase two space.

190
00:19:53,900 --> 00:20:00,340
So once again, so like this is like a phase two design. We're trying to gather some information about efficacy, right?

191
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:06,559
We're using these drugs. And so we must know that we have the dose. We want to gather some information about efficacy in this biomarker.

192
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:13,070
And then we'd, if it's positive, move into a larger phase three in that biomarker group and compare the drug to control.

193
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:18,590
Yep. And so is the performance of trials having more adaptations,

194
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:26,170
do you still need to explicitly state like all of your hypotheses and treatments you're going to consider before the start?

195
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:32,540
And so you don't have to specify all the treatments you're going to consider, but the protocol is written super generically.

196
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,220
So it could say, like, you know, we're interested in drug versus control.

197
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:41,270
And then these are the general hypotheses, right?

198
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:46,940
We believe that a drug is only worth considering moving on if it has a, you know,

199
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:55,610
improvement in survival by X amount or if it has improvement in response, a lot of based on response by X amount.

200
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:03,160
So there are written not specifically such that you can say, oh, I got this new biomarker, new drug, plug it in.

201
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,700
It just says I have to have a 20% better response rate and then I can move on.

202
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:19,040
So you don't have to know names of drugs or how much your you're doing there, but you still have to have a plan, right?

203
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:24,230
So that like the sample size is calculated, the effect size of interest is known,

204
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:31,160
and then you're just going to keep that the same across all of the potential new cohorts that come in.

205
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:37,070
So like I said, these are usually like phase two designs.

206
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:46,430
They often have utility stopping rules in them so that you could say early on, this drug is not worthwhile.

207
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,260
Let's stop here before we continue to enroll people.

208
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:55,970
And often these are actually like Simon, two stage designs in every cohort.

209
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,580
If it's if there's no shared control.

210
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:06,620
And otherwise, you can have these comparisons between the treatment and control like a two arm trial with futility rules.

211
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,240
Most of these umbrella studies are really only interested in very large effects.

212
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:20,460
And so this is a little bit of an issue that you really are only going to find like homerun treatments in these umbrella studies.

213
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,959
If we are interested in smaller effects, we could still run these.

214
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:33,210
However, the sample size is going to be much larger and it's going to take much longer and it's just going to be a lot more resource intensive.

215
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:37,200
And so the goal with these umbrella studies is kind of more like quick assessment.

216
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,700
And so therefore we're only going to move on if we see these large effect sizes.

217
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,600
These sub studies, though, are generally larger than the basket trials.

218
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:56,350
So even though we want to see large effect sizes, the basket trials we even have would have smaller.

219
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:06,040
So these are going have larger sample size. We're seeing big home in the basket trials would allow for smaller sample size and even larger effects.

220
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,679
Okay. So here's an example. So here's what it looks like.

221
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,990
You are interested in the master. You're a patient, and you can be in this master protocol.

222
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:24,700
You start here and you're screened across any of the drugs that are enrolled in that trial at that point.

223
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,030
So here it's like we're interested. Well, did you have Biomarker A or B or neither?

224
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:34,680
Okay. So this biomarker negative shot on this is kind of like a control group.

225
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:44,310
And so here, if you had Biomarker A, you could be randomized between drug one, two or like the control biomarker B,

226
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:49,949
you could be randomized between this investigational drug three or control and then this biomarker negative.

227
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:58,580
Perhaps they have something that's like biomarker agnostic. And verses whatever they otherwise would have.

228
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:05,080
Now, see, what's happening here is that we can have these decisions for futility before we enroll all patients.

229
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:12,739
We can also potentially, if there are new drugs that are related to those biomarkers, they can enter the trial when we have them available.

230
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,640
So all of a sudden for biomarker A, at some point there's a new drug.

231
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:23,060
And so now if we haven't, so it looks like we stopped drug one, but we're still interested in drug, too.

232
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:29,720
So if somebody comes in after here, they could be randomized to drug five, drug to or standard of care.

233
00:24:30,290 --> 00:24:35,209
And at some point down here, actually, we stopped drug one because it was successful.

234
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:43,010
And so now drug one is the standard of care. So now if somebody comes in over here, they're randomized to drug five, drug two or drug one.

235
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:49,760
And so you can see that sort of like it's a moving target of what the control is potentially

236
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:57,320
and what drugs we might be interested in testing and that people who get enrolled over here.

237
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:01,310
Right. How different treatment options than those who are enrolled over here.

238
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,069
So the sample size is potentially changing.

239
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:13,430
The participant group characteristics are potentially changing and these can cause issues for bias in the analysis of the results.

240
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:16,340
And so that's what a lot of statisticians have been trying to figure out.

241
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:23,150
If we have like one control group and or a changing control group, how do we deal with that in the analysis?

242
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:30,409
Then down here, right, all of a sudden it's like, oh, actually now there's a drug for this other biomarker.

243
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:38,630
And so now we can plug in well, we can have this like other mini trial where if you had biomarkers, you can get this new drug for control.

244
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:48,049
This is all under this umbrella of this master protocol where all of these seems like, you know, at least four,

245
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:57,110
if not five or six different trials are all occurring under this master protocol and that when a patient is screened,

246
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:01,370
they could be in any one of these. They're not separate trials.

247
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:10,590
So the advantages for umbrella trials are that all the patients are from the same tumor type or same disease,

248
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:16,070
and any observed benefit might be more readily attributed to the marker.

249
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:25,709
So this is that is where we could potentially rate where we're looking at within the biomarker group.

250
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:29,670
Is this treatment or control better? And so we're able to say like, well,

251
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:34,139
it's within this biomarker that we can actually see that this treatment is better because

252
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:39,030
we've stratified by biomarker and then we've randomized to treatment versus control.

253
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:47,939
Some disadvantages are that because we can have so many studies, some studies these can be larger size,

254
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,349
especially if we randomize within each substudy if we don't have a shared control group,

255
00:26:52,350 --> 00:27:01,410
but we're randomizing to control versus treatment in each substudy they can require more participants and take a longer time to enroll.

256
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:10,049
If any of these biomarkers are rare, we can have this master protocol going on for a super long time and it's going

257
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:14,100
to take potentially a really long time to get anybody in like Biomarker C,

258
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:18,929
but we could have basically filled A and B and then we're not really doing the master protocol.

259
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:28,799
We're just waiting for people down here. And then, like I said, there are these potential issues with bias where if the treatment landscape changes,

260
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,040
like the standard of care changes and or other treatments,

261
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,370
that patients are getting changes and now they're entering the trial later,

262
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:40,049
they could really the patients could differ from those who originally entered to those later.

263
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:48,090
And it might not be the treatment. It might be the actual patient makeup that we're seeing a difference in in treatment versus control.

264
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:57,510
So this is that sort of illustrated this if we we could potentially.

265
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:09,110
We have if we consider just like arms treatment arm A and treatment arm B and they both have controls, right?

266
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:20,550
We might have those getting the actual treatment being enrolled early, whereas those getting controls getting enrolled across the entire time.

267
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:25,920
And there might be more experimental arms coming into the trial and patients getting those

268
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:32,160
and we're using controls for other treatment potentially for these experimental arms as well.

269
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:38,889
And so it's a little bright. Ideally, you'd have the controls and the treatment groups on on the trial.

270
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:46,290
At the same time, once we start playing with time and start looking at patients on control over here while the patients were on treatment over here,

271
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:51,690
there might be these other issues where the treatment outside of the trial changed or treatment care,

272
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:59,190
the patient characteristics changed, etc. And so now it's not as easy to say, Oh, well, this difference is due to this treatment.

273
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:04,069
This difference might be due to the fact that these patients were sicker or that these patients were healthier,

274
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:09,190
or that these patients had this other mutation, etc. Okay.

275
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:12,460
So here are some examples. So if you seem complicated. Yes, they are.

276
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:19,359
Right. So, yes, these are complicated trials. This I-spy two is a notoriously complicated trial.

277
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:28,380
And if you remember, when we read the adaptive clinical trial set of articles, Don Barry was at one who was vinegary and strange in his response.

278
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,780
He is a part of this I-spy two trial.

279
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,440
The very consultants are very much involved. And so this was one of the first platform trials.

280
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:41,140
This is in breast cancer. It's been going was going on for a very long time.

281
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,640
It's still ongoing. This is currently in phase two, a phase two design.

282
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:52,209
So again, we're looking at are these treatments, is there some hint of it?

283
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:57,970
So we could go on to phase three. So this is being treated in women with early high risk breast cancer.

284
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,540
This is specifically in women looking at neoadjuvant treatment.

285
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:06,100
So this is the treatment you get before you have surgery.

286
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:14,830
And when we look at when we're interested in neoadjuvant treatment, we can use the outcome of what's called pathological complete response.

287
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:19,479
So that's at surgery when they take the tumor out and they actually removed all the tumor.

288
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,540
And the thought is that by giving them treatment prior to the surgery,

289
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:30,730
we've shrink the tumor and we've made it so that it's not all in the lymph nodes and so that they can actually get it all out at the surgery.

290
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,810
And in breast cancer,

291
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:45,999
they think that pathological complete response is a pretty good surrogate or somewhat related to event free survival or overall survival.

292
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:49,270
And so that's why they're using it as an endpoint here. Okay.

293
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:52,290
So what happens is that women come into this trial,

294
00:30:52,510 --> 00:31:00,790
their genetic information is taken and they try to figure out which biomarkers do we have based upon their subtype.

295
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:08,200
They can be randomized across different treatments. So for example, there's a control arm, which is just like a standard chemotherapy arm.

296
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:16,630
Or if they have specific subtypes, they can potentially get any number of experimental arms here.

297
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:22,200
It's just like one through four. And they might also have some follow up treatments.

298
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:29,070
Then they all have surgery and we can measure whether they've had a pathological complete response, at which point this trial is over.

299
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:35,580
So for women, you know, women might not have a pathological complete response, require more treatment, but that treatment is not in this trial.

300
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:43,069
And so the idea is that we can increase the number of agents and targets tested within one clinical trial.

301
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:46,130
So we could have right here, you can see that there are at least five.

302
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:53,720
I'll show you the results where it shows actually 23 drugs have been tested within this master protocol for this umbrella design.

303
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:05,420
We're hoping that we're reducing the time to conclusive results, that we can be not only looking at which treatments are useful,

304
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:11,210
but actually concurrently looking at, well, which biomarkers are related to treatment, success.

305
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:14,660
And so we might have specific biomarker targeted treatments.

306
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:19,969
We might also be collecting biomarker information, randomizing them across the treatment arms,

307
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:24,200
and then going back and kind of mining the data to see who did best on that treatment

308
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:29,810
and coming up with new biomarkers to look further into that in clinical trials.

309
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:35,180
And then in this design too. They're also using adaptive randomization.

310
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,409
So the more they learn about which biomarkers are related to treatment success,

311
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:47,450
the more they're going they're changing the probability of disease so that more of those people would get the better looking treatment.

312
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:56,120
Okay. So this is just a little diagram that you can find on their website about what's happening.

313
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:02,860
It says that new participants breast cancer is classified into one of ten molecular subtypes.

314
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:07,370
So they're getting this omega information, figuring out which biomarkers they have.

315
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:13,219
Then they have this adaptive randomization engine that assigns a participant to a study arm and it

316
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:18,350
gives greater weight to arms that have been more successful and people with a similar tumor type.

317
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:22,160
So a similar molecular subtypes.

318
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:29,630
The endpoint is assessed at the time of surgery based upon that patient's tumor subtype their outcome and treatment.

319
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,500
Then they update their randomization engine, right?

320
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:38,840
They figure out, well, now if a new patient comes in, where should that patient go?

321
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:46,010
Right. Like how can we change the randomization probabilities so similar other patients would get a more effective treatment.

322
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:54,510
If the predictive probability. So this is in a Bayesian framework. And so they find that if the predictive probabilities for an experimental agent

323
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,950
reach a predetermined level of efficacy in one or more of their subtypes,

324
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:03,090
then they declare a success. And that means that that treatment graduates to phase three.

325
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:07,770
Alternatively, they can stop the trial early for futility,

326
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:16,530
either because they have some predictive probability that it's not succeeding and or they've reached a max number of patients in that subtype.

327
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,210
And then they also are collecting all of this disease characteristics, patients and patient information,

328
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:30,210
and they can use that to update the molecular and or just patient subtype for the future.

329
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:37,520
So this is a relatively innovative design. This is one of the first platform designs.

330
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,690
It includes Bayesian analysis, it includes response, adaptive randomization.

331
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:50,149
They're also using a shared control. So if you see here right, there are experimental arms and then there's one control arm.

332
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:55,400
So instead of saying you have this subtype, in this subtype, we randomize between treatment and control.

333
00:34:55,790 --> 00:35:00,229
They're saying, okay, you have this subtype, we'll randomize between treatment in control.

334
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:05,420
But anybody else who has other subtypes would also be in that same control, not a subtype specific control group.

335
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:16,579
And then their decision rules are Bayesian decision rules. So if you remember all I talked about phase two, like the full phase two design, right?

336
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:27,560
We set up these predictive probabilities such that we say if the probability that we see success is greater than 80 or 90% or 99%, we stop early.

337
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:36,709
Right. Is a probability that we see that this should this treatment is never you know is not higher than the control is so high.

338
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:43,190
Then also we could stop early for a futility. So we're going to base it on those rules instead of saying we have like a T test, right?

339
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:52,010
Or so of looking at hypothesis testing or we're developed, we're figuring out the probability of seeing success or seeing failure.

340
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,750
And then if that reached some threshold, we can make decisions. Okay.

341
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:04,940
So I grabbed this off of the website today because last year when I showed this, they only had results for 15 drugs.

342
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,850
So a lot has happened even in a year.

343
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:16,940
So this trial started in 2010 and you can see that they have had individuals on the control arm for the last 12 years.

344
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,500
Right. They're not the same. Right. As patients come in, they're getting randomized.

345
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:23,720
So over time, patients are getting controls.

346
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:33,990
But potentially, if they're going to analyze people from like, say, this Tuckerton app or choose the ten out whatever this drug is, right.

347
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:41,510
They have to decide, are they only using controls that were concurrent or could they use the full control group going back to 2010?

348
00:36:41,510 --> 00:36:49,249
Right. These are some decisions that they have to figure out what is the real the right control group for every comparison here anyway,

349
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,299
what you can see is that anything in purple, those drugs have graduated.

350
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,810
That means that they have seen success in these drugs.

351
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,960
When they look at the drug comparison versus control, it looks like these drugs were efficacious.

352
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:08,420
And so they moved on into phase three. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

353
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:14,270
So seven out of these 23, although it's not really fair because these are all not done.

354
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:21,530
These two, four, six drugs have just recently started and are continuously accruing.

355
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:27,290
Okay anything and GREENE mean that it completed the trial.

356
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:32,510
But since it's not in purple, it means that they completed it and they did not find that that treatment was useful.

357
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:35,930
So it did not move on. But they were able to they completed it.

358
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:42,499
They went through the full sample size, and then they decided these drugs were not they did not see success.

359
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:48,830
They didn't have a high probability of success. Anything in red halted, meaning that stopped early for futility.

360
00:37:49,310 --> 00:38:03,620
So these three drugs stopped early for like either toxicity and or just not seeing enough efficacy and then these ones are still ongoing.

361
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,070
So to what did I say? Seven have been successful.

362
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:16,070
Two, three, four. Five, six, seven have been not successful,

363
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:26,000
but they completed and actually that's really ten have been not successful because they stopped early and then they still have a fair amount ongoing.

364
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:33,080
But you can see that what looks like it was 23 separate trials is actually all included under this master

365
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:39,809
protocol because they're using the same framework infrastructure to run all of these trials and potentially.

366
00:38:39,810 --> 00:38:44,990
Right. All the same control group. Okay.

367
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:51,280
So, Sarah, I'm just curious. This would have like a data safety monitoring board, right?

368
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,660
Are they usually bigger since this is like much more like before 2021?

369
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,860
There's six treatments at the same time, like, they're.

370
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:06,170
I don't actually know the answer to that. I don't. So it.

371
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:15,229
Probably isn't bigger, but they likely have different data safety monitoring boards.

372
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:18,860
So my guess is that there's not just one.

373
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:24,540
There's probably a few. Okay.

374
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,790
So this is another example.

375
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:33,060
This is the battle trial battle stands for biomarker integrated approaches of targeted therapy for lung cancer elimination.

376
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:36,840
So this is an umbrella trial in non-small cell lung cancer.

377
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:40,830
It similarly uses adaptive.

378
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:49,260
I think it uses adaptive randomization. Their outcome is the eight week disease control rate.

379
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,330
And they're they believe this is a reasonable surrogate for overall survival.

380
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:02,460
And they're also using Bayesian analysis. In particular, they're using a Bayesian hierarchical model such that they have these one, two, three,

381
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:10,440
four drugs and five biomarker groups, and they're trying to share information across all of these groups in the analysis.

382
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:18,780
And so that's a lot easier in the Bayesian framework and particularly through this Bayesian hierarchical model where they can say,

383
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:22,220
okay, if you have if you're right,

384
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:26,340
we have these different biomarker groups and if you're all getting the same treatment,

385
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:33,960
then I can look across all of the biomarker groups for the treatment effect to see, and then I could look individually within the biomarker groups.

386
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,909
So these are the results of the study.

387
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:47,730
They had 341 registered. However, a fair amount of those weren't randomized, so there's a total of 255 patients randomized.

388
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,450
They're started with equal randomization.

389
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:58,590
So usually with adaptive transition, there's what's called a burden period such that you just randomize everyone equally across the treatments,

390
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,870
you get their information and then you turn on the adaptive part so you can say, okay, we learned something.

391
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:07,620
Now we can start sending people to what looks like the more effective treatments.

392
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:17,580
So it was about 25 participants per treatment arm, almost 100 total participants for which they had this burden period.

393
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,680
And you can see that here are the five one, two, three, four.

394
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:26,730
So there are four biomarker groups. And then like a negative biomarker negative group,

395
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:37,110
what happens right is that even though this is like 100 patients now we're across four treatments and five biomarkers, these cells are really sparse.

396
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:46,320
So even though now we're going to do adaptive randomization, we don't actually have a lot of information, but they start adaptively randomizing.

397
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:50,580
And what you can see is that there are a lot more people that end up on the sorafenib.

398
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:56,430
So all of a sudden it seems like this treatment must have looked like a little bit better.

399
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:03,239
And more people are all coming in with some biomarker for which it looks like this treatment was more appropriate.

400
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:09,570
So you can look across the rows or the number of individuals with a specific biomarker.

401
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:16,680
So a lot of people with this figure and a lot of away.

402
00:42:16,890 --> 00:42:23,850
Yeah, a lot of people with us and a lot of people getting this sorafenib treatment.

403
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:30,680
Okay. So here's the end results from this trial.

404
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:38,390
This is the number of participants. So the on your right hand side, those are the total number of participants in a group.

405
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:44,140
So on that treatment with that biomarker and you can see total at the end.

406
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:51,030
So for example, right, this biomarker rare, right, you can see that only six total people had that biomarker.

407
00:42:51,050 --> 00:42:59,150
So even though we had this trial across 255 people, there's basically no information of individuals with this biomarker.

408
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:10,970
A lot of people had this VEGF biomarker and most of them we can see most of them ended up receiving sorafenib.

409
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:18,950
If we look right, these are essentially the the response rates of each biomarker group in that treatment.

410
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:25,180
If we look at across the total, these treatments look about the same 34%, 33%.

411
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:32,690
This treatment looks a little bit better. And overall, the often looks even better, especially in those who had cross mutations.

412
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:44,060
But again, this is not a lot of people. This is based on 14 people and almost 100 total across this whole treatment group.

413
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:54,510
So the most promising that they saw from this was this key rasp mutation or key recipe,

414
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:59,400
BRAF mutation in the Saracen group to move forward with an otherwise.

415
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:07,170
They didn't have a lot of information or a lot of evidence that the biomarkers were helping with the treatment effects.

416
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,720
They did, however, out of this trial,

417
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:16,620
remember how we talked about surrogate endpoints previously and how we can show that some endpoints are good surrogates.

418
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:24,210
So usually in oncology, they want to use binary endpoints as surrogates for survival endpoints,

419
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,700
especially for overall survival, because overall survival takes a long time.

420
00:44:28,710 --> 00:44:40,080
Right. Usually there's a long a longer time to to death, even if it's a rapidly a rapidly progressing disease that still takes months or years.

421
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,860
Whereas response you can. Usually see faster.

422
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:51,159
And so what they found here was that for those who had disease control, right, they had better survival.

423
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,930
Their survival curve is higher. And for those who didn't have disease control.

424
00:44:55,930 --> 00:45:02,260
Right, they had a shorter time to death or a shorter survival time.

425
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:05,559
And so because we see this separation in these curves, they said, oh, yeah,

426
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:13,660
it looks like disease control rate is actually a good surrogate for overall overall survival in non cells non-small cell lung cancer.

427
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:20,090
All right. So they had these pre-specified biomarker groups.

428
00:45:21,290 --> 00:45:25,309
And if you look across the biomarkers, right, if you look across here,

429
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:31,550
it's not like EGFR is in the response rate isn't super different, maybe a little bit better here.

430
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:38,750
This one is better here. If you look across here, there's just not a lot of data, right?

431
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:46,370
No data here. And what they found is that actually, if they just looked at EGFR mutation status,

432
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:56,990
this was this these EGFR mutations were more predictive than the overall EGFR group so that they can say,

433
00:45:56,990 --> 00:45:58,850
okay, well, if you had the EGFR mutation,

434
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:06,470
you actually were going to do better across the board on any of these three treatments and not well on sorafenib.

435
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:13,849
And so it was kind of like their pre-specified biomarker groups just weren't super useful.

436
00:46:13,850 --> 00:46:19,760
So they tried to set this up free trial, but it wasn't giving them a lot of information.

437
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:26,120
And one of the reasons, right, we talked about adaptive randomization.

438
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:31,309
When we talked about adaptive randomization, one of the advantages is that it starts to separate the groups.

439
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:36,299
Right. And really. Randomized those to the better performing treatment.

440
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:43,500
When there are big treatment differences, when there are not big treatment differences, you don't really adaptively randomize.

441
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:53,819
There's not a lot of difference. So right, we see that there is actually very similar numbers of patients across these two treatments, right?

442
00:46:53,820 --> 00:47:03,360
A little less here and more here. But these numbers are hugely different because there weren't huge differences in these treatments.

443
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:11,200
Okay. So then there's this long map master protocol.

444
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:15,890
This is actually supposed to be a seamless phase two to phase three. So it's supposed to start as phase two.

445
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:25,940
You find something that looks effective and you can automatically go into the phase three design using those phase two patients in in the trial.

446
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:34,730
This is in lung cancer. Again, their goal was to screen 500 to 1000 patients per year.

447
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:46,099
They had three parallel targeted treatment, arms versus one control and or sorry, three arms, which were a treatment versus control.

448
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:49,249
And then they had a fourth cohort four. If you didn't have one of these biomarkers,

449
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:54,830
you could basically be observed and then maybe a new treatment would come in and you could randomize you some other time.

450
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,500
This launched in 2014.

451
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:07,580
They set it up so that they had around 100 or a little bit less or a little bit more patients in the phase two piece of each substudy.

452
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:12,530
And then they'd have somewhere between somewhere around 300 patients in the Phase three study.

453
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,639
This is not a doctor randomization. This was not done in the Bayesian framework.

454
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,950
This was actually a frequentist platform trial.

455
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:27,559
And their goal here was to actually register these drugs, to get these confirmed these drugs from this master protocol.

456
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:36,080
So this is what it originally looks like, is that we figured out which biomarker you had and based on that you would go

457
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,330
into that substudy and get randomized to the new treatment or the control.

458
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:47,300
And if you didn't have one of those biomarkers, you'd be in this what they call substudy a,

459
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:52,850
where you either get a control or some, you know, maybe a new drug or some other drug.

460
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:56,630
They're just looking across all patients who don't have a biomarker.

461
00:48:58,350 --> 00:49:06,960
Okay. But then so who was involved in this? This was a very massive joint effort, the National Cancer Institute, the Food and Drug Administration,

462
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,710
multiple pharmaceutical companies, all which had these different drugs.

463
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:16,170
There are lots of nonprofits that are interested in lung cancer treatment, tons of patient advocates.

464
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,540
SWOG is a southwestern oncology group. This is a national consortium in oncology design.

465
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,479
So in order to make one of these master protocols happen,

466
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,790
lots of people have to be involved and there has to be a lot of interest in getting this going.

467
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,880
Mary Redman is a statistician at Fred Hutch, University of Washington.

468
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,560
She's really up front. Hutch, I think, has an appointment like most people at the University of Washington.

469
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,610
If you ever have a chance to hear her talk, she talks about the study. She designed the study.

470
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:50,730
It's it's really interesting to hear about. And it's continuous changes over time.

471
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,040
So what happened is they designed the study to look like this in 2014.

472
00:49:56,490 --> 00:50:05,870
And then in 2015, FDA approved immunotherapy, a new type of therapy for individuals who had this type of lung cancer.

473
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,960
So now all of a sudden, chemotherapy is no longer a standard of care control.

474
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:15,960
And so they're they're like basis of the control arms for each one of these sub studies was no longer appropriate.

475
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,340
So they had to go back and figure out, well, what are we? What's the design?

476
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:26,190
So what they ended up doing is they dropped all the randomization to control arm.

477
00:50:27,060 --> 00:50:33,030
So they made all of these studies, single arm studies instead of randomized studies.

478
00:50:34,830 --> 00:50:41,880
And they were assuming essentially that everybody was getting immunotherapy and then we were going to test the chemotherapy on top of that.

479
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:47,310
And we were going to compare that to our history data of like how people do on just that chemotherapy.

480
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:56,160
And then if you didn't have a biomarker, then you got into the substudy where you would get a single immunotherapy,

481
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:59,550
or we could see if we combined immunotherapies and that was better.

482
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:04,110
Okay. So this is this is what happened is that there's actually.

483
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,330
Not randomization. Okay, here we go.

484
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:12,780
So that's the phase two change.

485
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:19,709
So just everybody who is getting the new drug along with immunotherapy and then what they would if that drug looked appropriate,

486
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:29,760
they would go into phase three and test that drug versus probably like the combo of chemotherapy and immunotherapy versus just immunotherapy.

487
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:37,110
Okay. So that that trial, as far as I know, is still ongoing.

488
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:41,550
I haven't seen big results from on map, but I did look that up today, actually.

489
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:51,660
But anyway, that's another a just an example of how you spend all this time designing something and then the treatment landscape

490
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:56,460
changes and you have to redesign it and then you're going to have to continue to update it throughout time.

491
00:51:58,110 --> 00:52:01,910
So the importance of statisticians. Okay. So that was umbrella trials.

492
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,240
Those were all one disease. Multiple targeted treatments.

493
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:11,070
Now, basket trials is one targeted treatment in multiple diseases.

494
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:16,200
And so this, for example, would be, okay, we're interested in we have this targeted treatment,

495
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,249
but people with lung cancer or colorectal cancer or ovarian cancer or multiple myeloma,

496
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:24,240
breast cancer or any type of cancer, they might have this biomarker. And so let's bring them all in.

497
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:28,350
And then we can see, is this treatment effective for anybody with this biomarker?

498
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:32,160
We can also look within each disease subtype. Is this treatment effective?

499
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:37,550
It's these are usually single arm subs.

500
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:44,700
So the studies these are the ones that often use Simon to stage designs such that we enroll

501
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:53,370
patients with with this disease on this treatment and set up a Simon to stage across each disease.

502
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:59,550
We're usually again identifying very large signals of treatment.

503
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:07,740
These often have maybe 20 to 30 patients and each disease subtype.

504
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:14,150
And then there is the possibility that you could over time, right,

505
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:21,300
make this more of a platform where if there are new disease subtypes that you're interested in studying, you can do that.

506
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:30,629
Okay, so these are relatively small in size. We're interested.

507
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:35,070
There's an increased hit rate by enrolling patients with rare molecular features across tumor types.

508
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:38,100
So what we can say is like, well, you have a rare feature,

509
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:45,480
but we can kind of put you in this like catch all group of other cancers with this biomarker and test it.

510
00:53:49,380 --> 00:54:00,210
Where the disadvantages is that. We could potentially decide to go forward with this treatment because we look across all of the disease types,

511
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:03,540
whereas it might actually be one specific disease type.

512
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:10,709
That's really where are the successes. And if we're not accounting for that, right, if we're not accounting for differences in disease subtypes,

513
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:19,860
we're just trying to look across all of them, then we might not see the advantages in later stages if we don't accrue to that similar proportion.

514
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:27,900
Usually because these are small, they require a really high bar, kind of similar to umbrella trials, basically.

515
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:35,700
Baskin Umbrella trials. If you don't have a homerun treatment effects, you're not going to find it because these are mostly single arm studies.

516
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:40,919
You have to have a historical control rate to compare to, for which we know that there are issues.

517
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:45,600
When we talked about phase two designs, right, there are issues in what's the appropriate historical control.

518
00:54:46,710 --> 00:54:49,800
And then one can say that there are issues with multiple testing, right?

519
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:56,190
Because here we have one treatment across all of these disease types.

520
00:54:56,190 --> 00:55:05,429
And if you're going to look at each disease type, right, then we're going to have issues looking across like we're we're looking many times.

521
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:09,659
And so adjusting for that type one error. Okay.

522
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:13,680
So here's this example. It's the MCI match study.

523
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,680
So this is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute.

524
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:28,350
And so any of these master protocols really have to have some overarching sponsor that's not just like University of Michigan or Pfizer.

525
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:36,570
Right. It has to be some group that is just super interested in getting treatments out to people with those diseases.

526
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:44,549
So, for example, NCI or FDA, right, they're often always involved because they're going to be a little bit more objective

527
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:48,300
and be able to pull all of the groups necessary together to work together.

528
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:59,400
So this NCI match, they're interested in multiple tumor types, both solid tumors and lymphoma.

529
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:03,540
This is across 1100 sites. So, for example,

530
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:08,399
University of Michigan were considered an NCI match site so that patients could be

531
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,820
eligible for this trial at Michigan if they if they meet some eligibility criteria.

532
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:19,980
Their endpoints, their endpoint is binary, its overall response rate.

533
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:26,070
And so they try to figure out they get genetic information on people.

534
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:36,270
They figure out your biomarker and they see if we have a drug for which is trying to target that biomarker.

535
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:44,520
So then you'd come in to this this trial and you could be randomized or you could you could just

536
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:49,290
get the study agent and then we'd see whether you have stable disease or progressive disease.

537
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:54,390
If you have progressive disease, then we might put you back into the trial and say, Oh, that one didn't work.

538
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:58,800
Do you have any other biomarkers? Let's get you maybe a different drug.

539
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:04,559
And and this continues for a while.

540
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:07,780
And then we're ultimately interested in three year follow up.

541
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:17,339
So currently there are 39 treatment arms. So this basket trial, right, even though we kind of saw that, that's multiple treatments and one drug,

542
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,309
you could actually have multiple treatments and multiple drugs, right.

543
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:29,790
Because you could be doing this like a basket across multiple, multiple drugs all within this protocol, a platform, master protocol.

544
00:57:31,170 --> 00:57:40,020
So they have 39 treatment arms. Each treatment arm is attempting to accrue 35 individuals so that they can evaluate 31.

545
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,860
They've set this up so they have each treatment arm.

546
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:52,250
They have 90% power to detect an overall response rate improvement from 5% to 25%, with less than 2% type one error.

547
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:55,469
So they're saying, okay, we're doing a lot of these, so we're going to correct type one error,

548
00:57:55,470 --> 00:58:01,440
but we're not going to make it like we're doing 39 of these because then we'd never find a treatment effect, right?

549
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:06,959
So they're not using like a five divided by 39 also because that 39 is probably going to change.

550
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,800
But they know that like 5% is maybe. A little too generous.

551
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:18,710
So essentially what happens is that on any treatment, right, they can enroll 30.

552
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,010
They want to enroll 31 patients across any of the tumor types.

553
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,870
And if they see at least five responses, then they move on to phase three.

554
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,710
And if they don't, then they kill that drug. So this opened in 2015.

555
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:42,480
They actually had the. A lot of people on roll, but then not a lot of people have the targets for the treatments.

556
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:49,479
So tons of people were interested and they got all the genetic material taken and measured and then they were like,

557
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:58,120
Well, we don't have a treatment for you. So a lot of people went into like a control arm or a waiting arm and other people were able to get treatment.

558
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:07,090
They thought that they had defined what they thought were common subtypes or like common biomarkers for which they had these treatments available.

559
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:14,819
And they found out that they were not so common. And so they they feared that they thought they wouldn't have to screen as many people.

560
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:20,020
And then they realized they're going to have to screen thousands and thousands of people to fill the cohorts even of just 31,

561
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:28,969
because these biomarkers were not as common as they thought they were. What ended up happening is, though, they were supposed to accrue 31 patients,

562
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:37,550
they allowed for expansion cohorts on these single arm trials, meaning that they just kept enrolling patients because it looked promising.

563
00:59:38,690 --> 00:59:44,300
There's some literature out there that says you should not do that. You should stop and then do the phase three trial.

564
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:49,340
But often people are like, Well, but we've got to learn more. Like we're interested in if it's disease related.

565
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:52,520
So we want to have more patients across the diseases so we can look at that.

566
00:59:55,010 --> 01:00:00,710
11 sub protocols as of a year ago had reported out and only three of those were positive.

567
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:07,849
So these designs are really nice in terms of being able to do multiple trials at the same

568
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:13,340
time and kind of use this like screening of one set of patients across all these trials.

569
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:17,300
But what you can see is that we're not actually having like huge success rate,

570
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:23,630
but we're learning a lot in a short amount of time potentially than we would had we done all of these trials sequentially.

571
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:32,750
Okay. So there are a lot of statistical challenges and basket trials as well.

572
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:39,919
So one of the questions is, right, we we get patients in here and we measure their biomarkers and then we say,

573
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,790
oh, you have this, you have this like biomarker signature, this target.

574
01:00:43,790 --> 01:00:49,310
So you go there. So first number that you easy they have this biomarker signature and that one and that one and this other mutation.

575
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:56,960
So there's a question of like, how do we prioritize their targets, their multiple targets, and get them to the best treatment?

576
01:00:57,290 --> 01:01:04,579
Fastest. Right. And so this is a statistical problem because if we have these multiple targets and these multiple options,

577
01:01:04,580 --> 01:01:15,290
how do we figure out how best to match them? The there's this challenge where we're really only seeing we're really only sizing these for home runs.

578
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:22,010
So we might actually be throwing treatments away because they're not super effective, but they still might be somewhat effective.

579
01:01:22,010 --> 01:01:30,470
And so there's maybe room for innovation and how we find these sample sizes or how we power for these trials.

580
01:01:32,530 --> 01:01:38,889
Again, there are issues with if we have historical control or some type of control arm in the trial.

581
01:01:38,890 --> 01:01:45,910
But that control arm is not contemporaneous with the treatment arm.

582
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:53,310
How do we best use that data or not bias the results when comparing to the that control?

583
01:01:55,330 --> 01:02:03,370
And then there's also just if we're going to use these types of designs, there is sort of a shift away from this classic way.

584
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:06,850
You do a phase one and then you do a phase two and then you do a phase three.

585
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:12,759
Right? This protocol is saying we're going to do a lot of stuff across a lot of different disease types,

586
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:16,240
a lot of different treatments, maybe do phase two and phase three altogether.

587
01:02:16,630 --> 01:02:20,170
And so for some people who are really used to just like, well,

588
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:25,720
phase one and phase two and then phase three, this seems like too much or not a good idea.

589
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:32,110
And so there might be some unwillingness to be a part of this.

590
01:02:32,110 --> 01:02:38,620
And so statisticians have to come in and say, but look, we can still get robust evidence using these designs in this way.

591
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:44,440
And so it's important for us to be developing methods that are appropriate, that are controlling for the bias,

592
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:53,650
that are accurately powered, to show that we can still get good data from these types of designs, or if we can't be sure that we can.

593
01:02:56,110 --> 01:03:05,110
Okay. So the FDA does these draft guidances. If any of you go and work for pharma, you'll have to figure out the FDA really fast.

594
01:03:05,110 --> 01:03:11,140
So you'll end up working with the FDA at some point, because that's the only way that you can get your drug approved.

595
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:19,450
And so the FDA has specifics in which if you're going to write a master protocol, they want it to look like X, Y and Z.

596
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:27,250
And so they they publish what they call these guidance documents for which they say, here is what we want to see.

597
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,090
The the FDA does this across a lot of different trial designs.

598
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:34,870
So they they also have guidance on adaptive designs.

599
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:39,399
They have guidance for rare diseases. They have guidance for devices.

600
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:45,580
And so you have to become like best friends with the FDA website and really read these guidances.

601
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:50,650
If you're going to work in like a pharma company and have to get your drug approved.

602
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,920
So they say in their FDA guidance for master protocols that they.

603
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:06,840
Like to see or suggests using Simon to stage designs if you're not going if you're going to have single arm trials.

604
01:04:07,230 --> 01:04:12,660
So if you're not going to randomize within the cohorts use a Simon to stage design.

605
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:17,250
They say if you are going to do randomized designs, then use a common control arm.

606
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:23,520
Mostly they say that because it's going to save sample size. Right. But there's you have to account for that in your analysis.

607
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:28,740
And mostly they say use a Simon to stage design because that's what everybody uses most often in ecology.

608
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:33,600
And so they're just like everybody is, is that right? But that doesn't mean that is necessarily the best.

609
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:44,370
And so sometimes it takes a lot of pushback with the FDA to say, but look, if I use this Bayesian design, I can get better results, right?

610
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:51,509
Stop earlier and or come to the conclusion faster or have more patients on this treatment,

611
01:04:51,510 --> 01:04:56,070
etc. than if I use a Simon Tuesday or have smaller confidence intervals.

612
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:03,749
They do say you can use Bayesian methods for planning or modifying sample size, dropping in arm or other adaptive strategies.

613
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:07,890
But if you do that, you have to fully describe your methods.

614
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:13,470
So there is sort of this thought that the FDA does not like Bayesian design and analysis,

615
01:05:13,530 --> 01:05:17,850
that they really only prefer sort of like old school frequentist methods.

616
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,780
They write in their documents that you can use Bayesian methods, but when it comes down to it, they're very critical.

617
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:34,080
They want to see that your priors do not heavily influence your results or your posterior inference at the end.

618
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:45,290
And so it's often quite a. It's just it takes a while to get the FDA on board if you're going to use the Bayesian framework.

619
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:50,780
But they seem to be more interested in rare diseases and master protocols and using that.

620
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:58,190
And then they say, you're going to have to figure out how you prioritize patients on your cross,

621
01:05:58,190 --> 01:06:05,059
your master protocol, because it's not going to be the fact that every patient just has one biomarker signature.

622
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:12,950
And so you're going to have to figure out how you deal with that and prioritize them or use some pre-specified randomization ratio.

623
01:06:15,710 --> 01:06:20,000
Okay. So basket on all the trials are definitely complex.

624
01:06:20,330 --> 01:06:24,140
They take a lot of what we learned in this trial, in this class and put it all together.

625
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:33,680
They're often in this phase to space and their popularity is increasing and there is a large,

626
01:06:33,950 --> 01:06:38,710
a lot of open space and need for improvement and statistical methodology.

627
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:43,280
So if you plan to continue on to your Ph.D., this is and you're interested in clinical trials,

628
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:50,960
this is one area in which there's a fair amount of open questions to address design challenges and analytical challenges.

629
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:59,030
All right. So I gave you 14 ish plus minutes back today.

630
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:06,200
Thank you all for coming to class today. I appreciate it. Have a wonderful Thanksgiving work on your presentations.

631
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:11,460
Not on Thanksgiving, but have them ready and uploaded by the first one.

632
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:27,270
Otherwise, I will see you next week. Yeah.

633
01:07:27,320 --> 01:07:31,610
No. Know I keep thinking of all the things I want to get over.

634
01:07:31,610 --> 01:07:38,840
Break it down for a break.

635
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:42,630
Yeah, yeah. Okay.

636
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:55,160
So we got to after Thanksgiving for all I'm going to give you my house and you guys control.

637
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:03,790
What are you playing? Oh, I'll going to stop one more time.

638
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:15,110
You know, we got to figure out that was the end of the year.

639
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:21,650
I don't know. I really wanted to be like, You're in here.

640
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:31,370
That's what it's like to be on my take it to show that it was better for you to take it out.

641
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:37,280
Yeah, well, thank you for coming.

642
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:46,070
I'm so sorry. This is your group.

643
01:08:46,310 --> 01:08:55,910
Yeah, it's going to happen when I take a go to sleep.

644
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:05,450
I don't think you're going to be on the phone.

645
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:08,180
I mean, it's great if you are for peace, basically.

646
01:09:08,180 --> 01:09:13,940
I want you to in your presentation be like if this is how we would analyze, right, or this is how we power the data.

647
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:18,680
And then it's great to also say here are anticipated problems or limitations or whatever.

648
01:09:19,430 --> 01:09:25,650
I found some of so a problem from both sides.

649
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:33,500
Actually, I am not sure about this for clients.

650
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:37,220
Mm hmm. So. So how how how do I mean?

651
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:46,009
I got to understand this one. So noncompliance just means that patients don't take the treatment as they're supposed to, right?

652
01:09:46,010 --> 01:09:53,749
So either they stop taking the treatment or they decide to take a different right.

653
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:59,470
They stop that treatment. They take a different treatment. Humans, right?

654
01:09:59,480 --> 01:10:03,650
Humans are. Heterogeneous and have their own ideas.

655
01:10:03,650 --> 01:10:09,050
And so you might say, like when you're on this trial and you're supposed to take Treatment X and they might take it for a week and then say,

656
01:10:09,350 --> 01:10:14,690
I don't like that, right? So take it for a week and then say, No, no, I really want that other treatment.

657
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:22,100
So it is also connected with course it can be connected with withdrawals, but they don't have to withdrawal.

658
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:25,489
They could still be on the trial but just not taking the treatment. Right.

659
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:33,140
They might stop taking the treatment, but they're still coming in and saying, here's my blood or here's my response information or whatever.

660
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:42,040
Yeah. Yeah. But if you don't if you're not worried about those things and or you don't know how to deal with them, you don't have to bring them up.

661
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:47,169
Yeah. And we might have more problems.

662
01:10:47,170 --> 01:10:52,150
And I was like, oh, look at the office hours.

663
01:10:52,300 --> 01:11:09,250
Okay, great. I'll see you then. Oh.
