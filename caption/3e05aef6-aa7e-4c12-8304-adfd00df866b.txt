1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,612
Today we're gonna practice using reflective listening across to

2
00:00:13,612 --> 00:00:16,219
addictive behaviors.

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:19,740
Iqmik and meth, you heard me right?

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,888
Iqmik is a substance that is chewed in certain parts of rural Alaska,

5
00:00:24,888 --> 00:00:28,200
particularly when women become pregnant.

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:34,040
It's a mix of tobacco and ash ground up together and then put into your lips.

7
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,340
It has nicotine in it, it is not good for you.

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,030
But many women when they become pregnant in these parts of Alaska near the Bethel

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,790
region where we conducted this study, they are often encouraged by elders to use

10
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:51,340
iqmik to help cope with stress and to help cope with negative affect.

11
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,946
And it's generally viewed as something that is much better than heavy drinking or

12
00:00:55,946 --> 00:00:58,540
smoking cigarettes, that's iqmik.

13
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:02,340
Now let's see how iqmik might come up clinically.

14
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:11,740
Here's a woman telling you about her iqmik use.

15
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,331
So we're gonna roll with the resistance.

16
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:15,040
Go ahead and write out a reflection.

17
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,865
What would you respond to this

18
00:01:20,865 --> 00:01:26,230
woman about her iqmik use?

19
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:31,632
Well, you could reflect back that you feel iqmik is less harmful than cigarettes and

20
00:01:31,632 --> 00:01:33,469
you care about your health.

21
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:40,796
And for you, iqmik is a better option than smoking tobacco, rolling with resistance.

22
00:01:40,796 --> 00:01:47,062
Next case, more iqmik.

23
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:56,440
What would you reflect?

24
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,027
You stop smoking cigarettes because you wanna protect your baby, and

25
00:02:00,027 --> 00:02:04,540
you feel iqmik is a lot better for you than smoking cigarettes.

26
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,874
Now, if you wanna get somewhat inquisitive with your reflections, you can use this

27
00:02:08,874 --> 00:02:13,240
sort of open ended style of reflection that has a little hook on the end.

28
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,491
It's interesting you still call it evil and you wanted to comment on that.

29
00:02:18,491 --> 00:02:24,740
So you leave that little open hook on the end.

30
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:29,624
Now, here is someone telling you about how they were encouraged to use iqmik by

31
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:35,240
their grandma.

32
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,340
What would you say?

33
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,501
Well grandma told you how tobacco particularly iqmik can relieve stress

34
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:45,660
during pregnancy and that makes it feel safer for you.

35
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:50,470
If it's okay for grandma must be okay, just rolling with resistance.

36
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:55,110
We're not arguing, we're not trying to correct this perception,

37
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,512
we're just trying to roll with it.

38
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:01,343
Another iqmik case.

39
00:03:01,343 --> 00:03:04,879
Now, here there's a little change talk.

40
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,688
Here there's a little bit of hypothetical interest and

41
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:15,940
possibly maybe stopping its use.

42
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,921
So we're gonna reflect back the change talk.

43
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:22,540
So, if you were convinced it was bad for you, you might be willing to quit.

44
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,627
However, you're worried how you'll be able to handle your stress.

45
00:03:26,627 --> 00:03:32,009
Another way to say it is, if you can come up with another way to handle your stress,

46
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:34,821
you might be willing to give up your iqmik.

47
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:39,875
Or you're scared of losing your coping behavior,

48
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:45,056
which would leave you unable to handle your stress.

49
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:57,140
Finally, let's go to meth, take a look at this case.

50
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,920
It's pretty intense language here.

51
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,170
So, as you construct your reflection,

52
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,430
try to incorporate the intensity, the struggle, the battle and

53
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:12,218
even the desperation that is clearly evident in this case.

54
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:23,140
Go ahead, write out your reflection or make a mental note of one.

55
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:27,230
So I hope you have something along your lines, this has been a lifelong struggle.

56
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,340
This is a battle for you.

57
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:32,040
You're starting to wonder if you'll ever win.

58
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,990
You're starting to feel defeated.

59
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,040
You're starting to think this will be with you forever.

60
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,440
You're terrified that you may never be able to kick the habit.

61
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,240
However, we also wanna acknowledge the change talk here.

62
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,240
Part of you really wants to give up meth.

63
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,749
Part of you really knows it's not good for you, but

64
00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:58,140
it's really hard to give it up permanently.

65
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,550
So today we've shown you a few cases, one with iqmik and one with meth use.

66
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:09,034
We're rolling with resistance and other reflections can be used to establish,

67
00:05:09,034 --> 00:05:14,214
report and communicate empathy to your client.
