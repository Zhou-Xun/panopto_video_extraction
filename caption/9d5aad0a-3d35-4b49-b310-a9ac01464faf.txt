1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,380
So, how are infectious
diseases transmitted?

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,410
They can be transmitted
through direct contact,

3
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:08,970
which is often called person
to person transmission.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:11,030
And this can mean direct touching, or

5
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:14,890
sexual transmission, but it can also
refer to transmission through sneezes or

6
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:19,110
coughs, even though these pass through
the air on the way to the other person.

7
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,560
But, essentially, if they are not using
any contaminated intermediate object,

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:27,190
then we call this direct transmission.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:30,230
Indirect transmission can happen
a number of different ways,

10
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:33,810
there might be a contaminated object or
surface like a countertop.

11
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:37,410
These types of contaminated surfaces
that may serve as intermediates for

12
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:39,400
transmission are called fomites.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:43,280
Alternatively, transmission might
happen indirectly through food or

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,510
through the environment like we saw with
the example of the cholera epidemics in

15
00:00:47,510 --> 00:00:49,350
London in the Broad Street pump.

16
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:52,755
We could also have vector-born
transmission like we saw with malaria

17
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:59,822
where another species acts as an
intermediate for one step of transmission.

18
00:00:59,822 --> 00:01:03,580
Once exposed there are four
possible outcomes of exposure.

19
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,535
So you might be exposed but
not develop the infection.

20
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:11,170
Alternatively, you could be exposed and
become a carrier but

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,510
not show any symptoms yourself.

22
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,244
You could also be exposed and
develop subclinical disease,

23
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:24,440
and lastly you might develop
full on clinical infection

24
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,548
Another important part of the infectious
process to consider, is these three

25
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:32,430
periods called the incubation,
latent, and Infectious periods.

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,130
So, once your infected there's often
what's called a latent period which is

27
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,990
the time it takes before
you become infectious.

28
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:42,930
And this latent period, may not
coincide with the time it takes for

29
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:46,340
you show symptoms which is
called the incubation period.

30
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,350
So in the example shown here,the
latent period, which is in turquoise,

31
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:54,560
is shorter than the incubation
period in purple.

32
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,780
Which means that in between there is a
period where an infected individual can be

33
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,800
under the radar.

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,970
They can transmit to others, but
are not yet showing symptoms themselves.

35
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,220
And once a person has passed
out of the latent period and

36
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:12,810
becomes infectious, they are said to be
in the infectious period of the disease.

37
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,835
All three of these periods can vary
significantly from one disease to another

38
00:02:16,835 --> 00:02:18,295
or even within a given disease.

39
00:02:18,295 --> 00:02:22,945
So, for instance shown here there's a
number of different incubation periods for

40
00:02:22,945 --> 00:02:24,165
different diseases.

41
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:29,070
We can see that it might be a matter of
a few days, for instance, in cholera or

42
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:34,450
diphtheria all the way to a matter of
years, for instance, with AIDS or leprosy.

43
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,830
And so even within one disease,
it can vary significantly.

44
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:42,507
For example rabies symptom onset, can
happen in matter of weeks to as long as

45
00:02:42,507 --> 00:02:51,200
a year from when you are first
exposed to the virus.
