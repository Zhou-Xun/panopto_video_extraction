1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:07,020
Yeah. I mean and then he up dogs.

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:38,940
Oh, you know, I wanted to spend a long day already, but I opened this morning like I had to be there and I was tutoring my brother.

3
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:47,339
So tugging at us in an accelerated while increasing is just crazy.

4
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,850
Just because. I mean, I'm a [INAUDIBLE] Jedi master.

5
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:57,450
I tell you this. If you want to ask me about things, it just goes.

6
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:03,330
I got well, we'll get we're just going to come with this.

7
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,420
All right. Let's get started before we get into the lecture.

8
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:16,740
Just a couple of reminders. So your second homework is due Thursday, and that is through grade scope.

9
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,059
It looks like 50 of you or so practice submitting to grade scope.

10
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,680
So hopefully that went fine and the rest of you just feel like you know how to do it, which is great.

11
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,010
It's not very difficult. It was just to get you used to it.

12
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,160
So the second homework is that bias coin simulation, if you have any questions,

13
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:49,169
I have office hours today from 3 to 4 I think at or you can ask the GSI phone also the projects you're supposed to sign up for your project group.

14
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:57,930
By today, it looks like 61 people signed up, but I'm pretty sure there are more students in the class.

15
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:05,820
If you're auditing this class, you don't need to sign up for a project. But if you're not, please make sure that you're signed up for a project group.

16
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,930
The project is really due at the end of the semester. However, you can start working on it at any time.

17
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:20,240
So I encourage you to connect with your group and start at least making a plan for when you meet,

18
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,450
even if that's not until after fall break or around Thanksgiving.

19
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:35,730
But I probably wouldn't wait until Thanksgiving to start this. Are there any other questions about general course things?

20
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:48,899
Okay, trying out something new speech is like we're apparently supposed to be recording this lecture without me having to say that it is.

21
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:56,190
So I hope it's doing it. It looks like it was recording part of the class before, so we'll see how that worked out.

22
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,880
And if it's messed up, we'll make sure it's correct Thursday.

23
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,219
But this recording may be wonky is what I'm kind of warning you.

24
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:13,470
So if your friends aren't here, which looks like a lot of them aren't, please just let them know what they missed if the recording is messed up.

25
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:22,560
All right. So last time we were talking about we we're starting to talk about model based phase one designs.

26
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,110
Right? Originally, we were talking about algorithmic phase one designs, primarily.

27
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,439
What was the design call that we talked a lot about? Algorithmic design, three, three plus three.

28
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,200
Right. Which is also known as stores a design.

29
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:46,530
And then we moved into this hybrid type design, which we can see pictured here, right where we have a model.

30
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:50,970
But we can also pre specify the.

31
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:58,920
What would happen in this type of trial design based on if there if we see DLT use or not.

32
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:03,120
And what was this type of this first hybrid model based design?

33
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,360
What was it called? Do you remember?

34
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:15,660
You can look at your slides. Physical.

35
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,360
Some of you have the answers right in front of you and you still don't want to say the answer.

36
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,000
What is it called? The empty. What does that stand for?

37
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:41,180
Was the m modified? Was the t toxicity p probability ie interval interval grains modified toxicity probability interval empty i designed.

38
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,050
And what were some defining features of the empty I design?

39
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,010
It's hybrid. It's hybrid. Yeah. What else?

40
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:55,260
Calculate all of the things before and just hand it to the investigators and say if this happens, this is what you got.

41
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:59,180
It can almost be like an algorithmic design because you can give this kind of figure to that.

42
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:08,340
And what else about that empty design only uses like the current ghost level, it doesn't share information across.

43
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:19,220
Exactly. So the empty I design only uses the information on that current dose level to decide what the probability of toxicity is at that dose level.

44
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,050
Once you change dose levels, right, once you move to a different dose level, you start all over.

45
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,070
If you go back to that other dose level, you can use all that information that exists there,

46
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,300
but you can't use any information from like dose three or four if you're on dose two.

47
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,290
Right? So it is a model, but it's a a limited model, right?

48
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:43,910
Just by that dose level. Okay.

49
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:49,490
So we were talking about the modified toxicity probability interval, how we change doses.

50
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,250
So it's really important in these phase one designs we know how does the next dose how are we going to assign the next dose?

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,490
Right. And then also at the end of the trial, how do we estimate the MTD and what's the MTD again?

52
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,990
That someone tolerated those. Thank you. So we want to know at the end, right.

53
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,309
What what's the maximum tolerated dose, which we also consider the recommended phase two dose?

54
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:22,880
That's the dose we want to take into the next phase of trial to start looking at is it really safe and does it look like it could be effective?

55
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:31,489
Does it look like it also has some efficacy? And so we talked a little bit about how if we leave that empty,

56
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:38,000
empty as it is with the posterior distributions that would result without constraining them,

57
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,479
that we can get some really funky results such that the dose levels have differing amounts of information,

58
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,480
all known based on the different number of people who are on the doses.

59
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:55,760
And we can get these these estimates that really don't match with our assumption of as dose increases, so does the probability of toxicity.

60
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:05,299
And so therefore we want to constrain the posterior distribution so that we have this dose response expected outcome where as dose increases,

61
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,200
toxicity increases. Okay.

62
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:15,660
So that MTI was this model based alternative, but we could pre specify those tabular outputs.

63
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:23,610
There is no sharing between the dose levels and because if you don't constrain the posterior, there could be these.

64
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:29,120
Or even if you do actually there could be these disconnects between the dose assignments and the final decision.

65
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:35,190
So you can have more people on a dose that isn't that than the MTD that you choose.

66
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:41,550
And ultimately we'd really prefer to have more patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose.

67
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:46,440
Right. We want to think that we're not treating too many patients with a dose that's too toxic.

68
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:50,370
We're not treating too many patients with a dose that's not effective.

69
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:54,480
Right. And so we prefer to treat them at the MTD.

70
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,670
So we answered these questions and we saw how the numbers help us make decisions about what we would do.

71
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:07,680
Right. So the statistics are going to help us make these decisions that actually impacts the individuals in the trials.

72
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,710
So that we said, all right, so that's like the baby step into this model based design.

73
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:21,540
Now let's actually get into the model based designs. And so these model based or regression, model regression, whatever you want to call it,

74
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:30,720
they're going to use the data from patients that we're going to update these estimates of the probability of toxicity at each dose level.

75
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,950
It's just going to help us make the decision as to which dose level to give next.

76
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,590
And then once we've reached some maximum amount of patients that we want on our trial,

77
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:46,260
we can estimate the maximum tolerated dose by looking at the probabilities of

78
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,640
toxicity across the dose levels and comparing that to our target toxicity level.

79
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,390
So we want to model that dose toxicity curve.

80
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:04,740
We want to have this curve in our head of what is the relationship between the dose level to the probability of toxicity.

81
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:12,690
And we want right. This is a monotonic function such that as dose increases, so does the probability of toxicity.

82
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,689
Our maximum tolerated dose or recommended phase two dose is defined as the dose level,

83
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:24,300
with the true probability closest to our target probability and usually our target probability.

84
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:31,290
We'll talk a little bit more about that in the serum slides, but it's usually somewhere between 20 and 35%,

85
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:38,510
and that's going to change depending on the drug, the disease setting and what the clinician thinks is acceptable.

86
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:45,880
It could even be lower than 20%, but that's often what we see. So we're going to we have our model.

87
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:51,360
We're going to update the model with the observed data that we see, whether the patient has a DLT or not.

88
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,309
And then we can have these new estimates of the probability of toxicity at each dose level, make a decision about what the next patient,

89
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:07,050
what dose level that next patient gets until we've reached that maximum number of patients and estimate our maximum tolerated dose.

90
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:18,900
All right. Again, our assumptions are that as dose increases, so does the probability of toxicity or the probability of dose limiting toxicities.

91
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:29,390
We are going to use the notation such that we're interested in that probability of toxicity at dose level.

92
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,670
And we're going to call that P hat subject. So P for probability is blinking lights.

93
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:43,010
I don't know how to fix that. You could turn lights off, but then everybody would fall asleep.

94
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:51,319
So let's just keep it on our current estimated maximum tolerated dose, right?

95
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:57,290
We can figure out what we believe the maximum tolerated doses after every individual patient comes into our trial.

96
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,170
And that's going to be right.

97
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:08,959
We can compare our estimated probability of toxicity at that dose level to the target toxicity level and whichever one is closer,

98
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:12,590
that's the one that we believe is our current maximum tolerated dose.

99
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,499
It can be that that becomes the next dose assignment for the next patient.

100
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,239
However, we talked a little bit about safety constraints such that if we started out like

101
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:28,100
dose two and now we estimate that dose five is the maximum tolerated dose,

102
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:34,040
we might not actually want to go to those five. We want to go to go stepwise, go three and four and five.

103
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:42,760
And we'll talk more about those constraints in the next lecture. And so as you can see you right our estimate a maximum tolerate dose that's

104
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,330
going to change it could potentially change after every individual patient.

105
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:51,490
But hopefully what we're doing is it changes a little bit right as we first start.

106
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:57,040
And then we we get closer and closer to what we believe those probabilities of toxicity are.

107
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,240
And we stick around that maximum tolerated dose in our dose assignments,

108
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:06,070
hopefully relatively quickly so that we're treating more patients with that

109
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:11,680
dose level that we think is not too toxic and also likely to be efficacious.

110
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:21,560
So why do we want to move into this model based realm as opposed to the algorithmic design or even the empty?

111
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,800
And why is that?

112
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:29,330
Now we want to be able to actually use the information across all Windows levels.

113
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:38,059
Right. So if we use information across all the dose levels, we can have more we can be more efficient in our estimates of the maximum tolerated dose.

114
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:46,070
And we're sharing information so that we can have more information, especially since we assume that as the dose increases,

115
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:52,730
the probability of toxicity increases, we can utilize that information and help that can help us get these estimates.

116
00:12:54,900 --> 00:13:01,650
Model. These designs generally are so that the patients in the trial actually have a

117
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:07,260
better chance of being treated near or at the maximum tolerated dose level.

118
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:14,819
And we'll see that as we show results. But that's why one reason why statisticians prefer these designs,

119
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,870
because we can actually run these simulations and then show you that there are more more

120
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:23,640
patients on average are treated at or near the MTD than if you just did algorithmic design.

121
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:30,030
And so statisticians, if you're trying to show a clinician investigator like, hey,

122
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:33,870
we might want to consider this other type of design, this is a great way to do that, right?

123
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:40,679
You run the simulations, you can run a three plus three next to like a continual reassessment design and show the average number of

124
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,320
individuals treated at the MTD and very easily show the benefit for the patients involved in the trial.

125
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,450
Obviously, as with any any study, right?

126
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:59,560
As we get more data, we have better estimates. And so our confidence is going to grow in what we believe the maximum tolerated dose is.

127
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:09,610
And also, we have a higher probability of identifying the true maximum tolerated dose in model based designs than in the algorithmic designs.

128
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:13,900
Right. Remember when we saw those confidence intervals around the probability of toxicity for

129
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,600
the three plus three design and it was like 0 to 64 or 0 to 73 or something like that.

130
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,970
They're massive, right? We're hoping that these model based designs are actually going to create narrower

131
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,800
intervals so that we feel more confident that we actually have identified the true MTD.

132
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:38,710
So we have better efficiency. We have more flexibility than algorithmic designs.

133
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:47,020
So we'll talk about some special, special versions of model based designs next.

134
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:55,080
Thursday, I think, and those can account for late onset dose limiting toxicities.

135
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,100
Remember, we talked about in cancer, the more you get a drug, the more likely you might have a dose limiting toxicity later.

136
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:13,020
Is that a cumulative, cumulative effect? And so normal designs, algorithmic designs and regular model based designs usually look for quick deal use.

137
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:18,810
But we can have designs where we actually account for whatever information we have observed.

138
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:24,990
And that would be one type of design as the time to event continual reassessment method.

139
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,330
So if you're taking survival data, you might know, right, that your outcome is time to an event.

140
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:35,969
And so the tight CRM actually, instead of thinking about just DLT as yes no,

141
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:43,620
it thinks about it in the survival way that, you know, how long has it been since they haven't had a DLT?

142
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:49,050
And let's take into account that information so that it's not just they didn't have one yet.

143
00:15:49,440 --> 00:16:01,350
Right. Or they we can't count them yet. And we won't talk about specifically in lectures about how these model designs can consider drug combinations,

144
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:08,100
but they can, in one or two of the at least one of the projects considers drug combinations.

145
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,889
And so you could take it any you can take it multiple ways that project if you signed up for it you

146
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:20,760
could try to fix one of the dose levels and just let one vary and use a standard model based design.

147
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:29,620
Alternatively, you could look at both of those dose levels changing and use a specialized version of these model based designs.

148
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,450
So you have to do some research into what those designs look like and present terms to the class.

149
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:41,820
They tend to count a little bit more for patient heterogeneity. You can add things into the model like potential confounders, right?

150
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,570
But these are still small samples. You have to be careful with doing that.

151
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:53,069
And there are designs where you might not be interested just in toxicity as the outcome,

152
00:16:53,070 --> 00:17:00,120
but you also want to think about the toxicity efficacy tradeoff and start to model efficacy and phase one as well.

153
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:09,480
And so there are a number of designs that consider the this joint outcome of toxicity and efficacy,

154
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:13,709
and they call that variance of the maximum tolerated dose.

155
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,050
They're looking for the optimal biologic dose that's obesity.

156
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:26,459
So the optimal biologic dose don't mess up those letters in that one or you'll get something else.

157
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:36,930
Right. Okay. So the philosophy of regression based phase one designs is that we're going to have this dose response relationship,

158
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:43,200
this model, but we can't make it really complicated or complex because we still have small samples.

159
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:49,440
And so it's not going we're not really trying to optimize that entire curve.

160
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:56,790
We're not going to say, okay, we want to do a really good job of estimating the full dose response curve.

161
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,379
What we really want is to do a really good job of estimating near that.

162
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:12,630
MTD And so most model based designs are going to give up on the global estimation for local estimation such that we

163
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:19,350
get to the MTD quickly and then we really focus on the MTD and get a good estimate of that probability of toxicity.

164
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:32,550
And so this local efficiency prioritization will be in these one parameter model based designs which we're going to focus most on.

165
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:43,110
Now, you can try to have a better, a better global efficiency with the full curve using two or more parameters in your model.

166
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:48,299
But like I said, usually we have small sample sizes and so we're willing to give up that global that

167
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:54,180
global estimation or global efficiency for local efficiency to really hit that.

168
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:59,430
MTD So we're going to focus on these one parameter models, but know that others do exist.

169
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:10,950
Okay. And the one parameter models I'm going to show you three here and we're going to mostly focus on two out of three.

170
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:16,510
Bless you. But these are all different ways of essentially modeling binary outcomes.

171
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:22,690
Right. So you already mostly are very familiar with this type of model.

172
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:26,770
So if you have a binary outcome, yes, you have a DLT or no, you have a DLT.

173
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:30,190
Right. You can model it with a logistic regression.

174
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:34,060
Right. That might be the the one that first pops into your head.

175
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:41,440
Alternatively, you can model it with a probit regression or you'll see that we could use what's called a power function.

176
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:46,810
And we're primarily going to focus on the logistic model and the power model.

177
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,040
So the logistic model, right.

178
00:19:51,040 --> 00:20:01,120
I would just instead of writing it as logit P or log a p over one minus P to solve for p, write P the probability of dose limiting toxicity.

179
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,010
And here I've added this constant.

180
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,239
So this constant is something that's fixed. It's not estimated.

181
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,720
And we get to specify as the modeler. And so we'll figure out what do we actually think that C should be as we go.

182
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:21,390
And then this beta is the parameter that we're trying to estimate.

183
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:27,670
That's what's going to be updated every time we fit the model, when we have the data about is there a toxicity or not?

184
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,740
And this is so j is something that we call a skeleton.

185
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:37,360
And so the skeleton is the probability.

186
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:45,489
So prior to the to the trial starting, you're talking to the clinician and you say, okay, so we're going to have four dose levels, right?

187
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:53,080
You decided that for dose levels is appropriate. Now, what do you believe are the expected probabilities of toxicities at those four dose levels?

188
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:58,840
And so the clinician says, you know, based on research, from my experience, from prior trials,

189
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:03,730
whatever, I think that it's ten, 20, 30 and 40% at these four dose levels.

190
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:12,970
And so this ten, 20, 30, 40% is what's called the skeleton, that initial expected level of probability at each dose level.

191
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:21,160
Now, once we have that skeleton, we actually have to solve for what we call a dose label.

192
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:31,570
So it usually doesn't make sense to actually use the units of the dose like 20 micrograms, 100 micrograms or whatever as our D.

193
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:35,350
It also usually doesn't make sense to use dose as one, two, three, four.

194
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,690
We actually want to set up the model so that the scale is correct.

195
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:48,070
So we get this skeleton and we've specified C and then we solve for D,

196
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:53,500
which is not going to be the exact dose quantity or some numeric value we've given it.

197
00:21:53,800 --> 00:22:00,610
It's what we call this dose label. And so in some instances, it happens to match the skeleton.

198
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:07,570
And in other it's actually a little bit different. Just like an indicator function, it's not an indicator function, it's actually a value.

199
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,930
So it's not like that. It's not an indicator that the dose levels one or dose level is two.

200
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,730
It's actually going to be something like 0.35 or 0.25 or whatever.

201
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,389
I'll show you a little bit. Hopefully it'll make a little bit more sense as we go along.

202
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:26,440
And if you still have a question about what it is, let me know. Yeah. Is there a range for that value?

203
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:34,660
Big question. I don't I mean.

204
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:42,400
No, I don't think so. I think that often you'll see that it ranges in between zero and one, but it doesn't have to.

205
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:50,950
And you can always, once you get the skeleton and you specified your constant, you can always solve for this dose level.

206
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,790
And again, I'll show you some more, especially as we go to this lecture and hopefully it becomes more clear.

207
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:01,880
But so you can see right in these two plots we have.

208
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:07,130
So here we specify the constant of three. And here we specified a constant of one.

209
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:25,010
And then otherwise, we have this logistic model where we're looking at a graph of the essentially dose label versus the probability of toxicity.

210
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:31,490
So here we're seeing like you can look at these little dots as different dose.

211
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,060
They're indicating the dose levels are like dose one, dose two, dose three, dose four, dose five, dose six.

212
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:48,830
And we can see that what we expect if beta was estimated to be zero, we'd expect for this like say dose three, the probability of toxicity is .22.

213
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:58,129
So this, this label down on the x axis is actually just if you right across to the y axis and read down, right?

214
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:04,690
So at dose three. So on this chart, it happens to be but just the way that we've set it.

215
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,850
So we're setting this up so that we expect the probabilities of toxicities up front.

216
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:14,450
Right. Our skeleton is that dose one has 12% toxicity.

217
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:18,440
Dose two has, I don't know, 18%.

218
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:24,530
Dose three has 22%. Dose four is 30%. Dose five, 40% in dose six, 52%.

219
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,309
And you can see that if we actually put a distribution on the speed of parameter,

220
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,830
which we're going to do because we're going to work in the Bayesian framework.

221
00:24:30,950 --> 00:24:36,530
So if we put a distribution on this beta parameter, which is normally distributed,

222
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,360
normally distributed with means zero and some variance sigma squared, right?

223
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,020
All of these red lines are like draws from, you know,

224
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,260
this is the distribution of beta and I'm drawing a random beta that I fit my model here and that's the line that I got.

225
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:57,890
Okay. And so you can see that this is like the distribution around the expected toxicity

226
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:04,280
dose toxicity curve that we could have if we have this prior distribution for beta.

227
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:08,270
And then here you can see how it changes a little bit with a different constant.

228
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:15,410
So all we've changed here from C was three and here is one and they look very similar,

229
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:27,200
but there's maybe a little bit wider of the distribution around this line here for this larger C.

230
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,530
Okay. So we can similarly do this if we have a different model.

231
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:40,250
So instead of saying that we want a logistic regression, we could say that, okay, our outcome is binary, I'm going to use appropriate regression.

232
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:49,880
And so here is our model. And so this is like write the cumulative normal distribution.

233
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,130
And again, we have this fixed constant and we're interested in estimating beta.

234
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:03,530
And we have the skeleton, the skeleton, again, a step from the investigator, the initial probability of toxicity expected for each dose level.

235
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:12,580
And so here we can see that this changes the relationship between the expected dose and the expected probability of toxicity a little bit.

236
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,680
And again, it's just showing that if we took rent of drawers around data, how is it changing?

237
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,150
And here, the constant history. And again, here, the constant is one.

238
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,950
Okay. And then this is the last model that we'll focus on for this relationship, which is called the power model.

239
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,870
And often we work with this power model because it's really it's the start of it

240
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,810
is more intuitive such that the skeleton is actually equal to our dose labels.

241
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,329
And so we often use this because it's sort of easy to is an easy start.

242
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:57,300
We don't have to additionally solve for low labels. So here the probability of toxicity is just the skeleton to the exponential beta.

243
00:26:58,470 --> 00:27:01,950
So our skeleton is the probability of dose limiting toxicities.

244
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:10,320
And again, here is the relationship that we're setting up between our dose levels and our probability of toxicity.

245
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:17,819
Okay. And these graphs might you might be like, I don't understand these as we go through the serum,

246
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:22,139
I think what's happening and how these graphs work is going to make a lot more sense.

247
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,070
So just hold tight and then we'll obviously ask any question.

248
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:31,380
But then also if you aren't sure what your question is yet, hold tight and hopefully it'll be answered.

249
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:39,420
Okay. So we conduct to conduct the trial.

250
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:48,360
We have that skeleton, right? We ask the clinician how many doses, what are your expected probability of toxicity at each dose level?

251
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:57,209
We have this model. We specified the consent. Now a patient comes in and we enroll that patient on the current dose,

252
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,920
which is generally to start going to be either the lowest or second to lowest dose.

253
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:06,720
And as we move, it might be that dose closest to the maximum tolerated dose.

254
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:15,150
Then all of our as patients come in, our current data looks such like why is do you have a DLT or not?

255
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,570
And it again is the number of individuals on a dose level.

256
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,910
And so we could have why? One, we have two sets for each dose level.

257
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:31,280
So we have the number of deal to use on dose one, the number of individuals on dose one we had.

258
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:38,070
Y two would be the number of deal t's on dose two and two would be the number of individuals on dose two all the way up to a dose.

259
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:41,680
K We're going to fit our model.

260
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:49,320
So either a logistic model, the appropriate model, the power model with all of our current data and we estimate that beta parameter

261
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:56,430
to get better hat than we put in our estimated beta hat into our model.

262
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:04,110
And we find the estimated top toxicity levels write the estimated probability of dose limiting toxicity at each dose level,

263
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:09,930
and we'll figure out which one is closest to the maximum tolerated or closest to the target toxicity level.

264
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:20,590
And we can assign the patient to that level. So how do we use this data to estimate our parameter of interest speed?

265
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:33,130
So suppose we have this power model, so theta equals e to the beta and our outcome is whether the patient AI has had a DLT or not.

266
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:41,590
And here I'm going to say that exercise is some value within this skeleton of dose.

267
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:47,620
So the expected probability of toxicity for dose levels, which is also,

268
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:52,930
since we're using the power model, is also the probability of toxicity at this level.

269
00:29:53,710 --> 00:30:00,760
And so we're looking or modeling the probability that there is a DLT given your theta.

270
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:07,120
And so this is excited to the theta, right? I just I could have wrote, I could have written E to the beta, but I just wrote XYZ.

271
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,510
So now my. What does this mean?

272
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:17,940
This this power model means that my probability of DLT is just a really variable, right.

273
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,990
And the probability of choice dose limiting toxicity this excited Athena.

274
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:31,560
So one way in which I can try to solve for theta right or estimate this theta as by using maximum likelihood.

275
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:38,860
This is probably the first where you would attack this problem given you're in a program where primarily you learn frequentist methods, right?

276
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:48,579
So you take your 6012 knowledge, you apply it to this knowing that you have this Bernoulli variable, right?

277
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:55,930
And you try to solve for theta, right? So you have the likelihood you can take the log, likelihood you can take the derivative of that.

278
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:01,150
And then I'm not going to spend time here, but I think it's worth your while to solve,

279
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:07,180
try to find, solve the score function for the maximum likelihood estimate of theta.

280
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:11,499
I'm going to cut to the chase. We're going to assume that exercise is equal to X.

281
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,770
That's going to help you solve for that in this equation.

282
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:30,010
And what you'll find that you get is a function where the numerator deals with the log of y bar and the denominator.

283
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:39,770
Deals with X. Okay. And so once the numerator deals with the log of y bar.

284
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,250
Y bar is the average rate of deal to use. Right.

285
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:49,490
Once you know if y bar is zero, meaning that there's on average no deal to use.

286
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,620
Right. And you have a log of that, you can't take the log of zero.

287
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,660
Right? So your theta is is not you can't solve for it.

288
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:08,570
Right. There's no maximum likelihood estimate for that. If you're why a bar is one such that everybody had DLT right then.

289
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:16,000
Log of one is zero and so now you're maximum likelihood right then.

290
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:22,160
So your maximum likely the estimate of theta hat is zero that e to the beta.

291
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:32,360
And so now your your skeleton is just saying one like every right, the probability toxicity for every dose level is one.

292
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:37,860
Which doesn't help you choose a maximum tolerated dose, right?

293
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:44,490
If you're on these edges, then you're not going to get good estimates of the maximum tolerated dose.

294
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,300
Your estimates of the probability of toxicity are are not useful.

295
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:54,150
So using maximum likelihood is not very helpful.

296
00:32:54,300 --> 00:33:00,720
Potentially in this realm. What you can do is you can start to run.

297
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:12,990
Your trial is like a three plus three until you get this theta hat, which is not going to be on these edges, on this perimeter.

298
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:18,899
Right. And then you can switch to maximum likelihood estimate, but that doesn't really help you.

299
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:24,320
If you wanted to run a model based design to show that you could have more people onto TB,

300
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:32,700
that you are more likely to find the MTD right to start with a three plus three and then to switch is some sort of hybrid situation that's

301
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:39,899
likely not going to optimize treating all the people at the near or treating more people at them and having a better estimate of that.

302
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:52,500
MTD So this is one reason why we're going to use the Bayesian approach for trying to analyze this data and finding the estimates of this data and

303
00:33:52,500 --> 00:34:03,660
using it to assign the dose estimates and find that MTD So instead of using the maximum likelihood estimation and having these issues on the edge,

304
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:12,930
we can use Bayesian analysis which says that before the trial we're going to specify our prior beliefs about the parameter.

305
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:22,110
So we're going to say, what do we believe the prior distribution of theta is before we even start so.

306
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:32,370
In terms of if we're using a power model, which we often will, if the prior at theta equals one is high.

307
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:36,330
So if we have some like imagine, right? We have the data, right?

308
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:42,540
We have some estimate that theta and theta equals one. So we have this like really condensed bell curve around it.

309
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:49,560
So there's a lot of mass at that equals one that would be that the prior update equals one is high.

310
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:56,880
And that would say that we're really confident in our skeleton so that we really believe that the clinician,

311
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,530
their first guess at the probability of toxicity across these doses is a really good one.

312
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:06,480
Right. That's going to give a lot of weight to our prior our prior beliefs.

313
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:15,330
Usually we want to give some weight to our prior because, you know, it's based on expert opinion, it's based on previous information.

314
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:19,460
However, we usually also want the data to speak for itself, right?

315
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:23,040
We want the data. We want to see what happens to the individual patients.

316
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:29,010
We want to get the information about whether they had a deal or not. We want that to really tell us about the probability of toxicity.

317
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:32,490
So we usually don't want to put too much weight on our skeleton,

318
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,140
but it can be useful and help us with the efficiency of these estimates if we put some weight on it.

319
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:41,610
So we have this prior now we're going to collect all the data on the patient.

320
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:46,979
They come in, they get the dose. We see if they have a dosomething toxicity or not, be in the update or model.

321
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:50,490
So we have our prior, we have our observe data, we update the model,

322
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:56,370
we get the posterior, and as we collect more data, the influence of the prior diminishes.

323
00:35:56,670 --> 00:36:04,350
The data speaks for itself. And it gives us these the posterior distribution of the probability of toxicity.

324
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:11,700
It really gives us posterior distribution of data. Right? Which gives us the estimates of the probability of toxicity at each dose level.

325
00:36:14,530 --> 00:36:19,870
So you can imagine, right, that ideally you'd be a later patient in the trial.

326
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:20,750
Right.

327
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:30,010
If you're one of the initial patients in the phase one design, you're getting a dose level that we think is safe but unlikely to be efficacious.

328
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:36,190
And as you're a leader, patient in the trial, you're more likely to be treated at the maximum tolerated dose,

329
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:44,320
which we believe is going to be likely to be the tolerable and also the most efficacious dose.

330
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,690
And so you don't ever know what number of person you are in a trial, unfortunately.

331
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,010
But ideally be like, Oh, this trial has been going on for a year or two.

332
00:36:53,020 --> 00:37:00,090
Hopefully, you know, I'm getting closer to that. And this is the inside knowledge for you all if you're going to participate in a trial.

333
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:06,370
Right. Figure out how long it's been going on. And that might affect your decision to be in a if it's a phase one trial.

334
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:13,530
For an adaptive trial. Okay. All right.

335
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:22,260
So we talked about the MTD a lot. Can you do poll everywhere and tell me which statements?

336
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:30,180
So any almost any number, any individual one could be true and or three or two could be true.

337
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:18,870
Try to get like 15 at least answers.

338
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:37,490
All right. So before I show them at least. So a little bit across the board, people deciding to change two different things.

339
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:41,840
Okay. So it looks like people might think that.

340
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,890
So it's what phase one dose escalation trials are primarily looking for.

341
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:53,030
So that's definitely true, right? Definitely true. Check that's included in a and then options.

342
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:57,740
The most toxic dose level being studied in a trial.

343
00:38:57,890 --> 00:39:01,310
Is that true? No. Okay. No, I believe it is. And that's right.

344
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:07,970
It's not it's not necessarily true. Right. You actually hope that it's not the most toxic dose just in the trial.

345
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:16,660
It's actually a dose that is. It has a level of toxicity which you believe is tolerable for individuals.

346
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:20,380
Right. That you would move forward to. And that might be the most toxic in the trial.

347
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,900
However, you usually have more toxic dose levels so that you could go up there and go down to find MTD.

348
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:30,770
Okay. So then the question is, is D correct or not? Okay.

349
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:35,500
No, we didn't talk about the we'll go back to D, we'll go back to be.

350
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:42,010
So let's talk about D because that's all of you think that's true or most of you think that's true to the largest

351
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:47,560
dose level in a trial that induces dose limiting toxicity in a pre-specified fraction of the study population.

352
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:55,930
So that is correct, right. The dose limiting toxicity, the maximum tolerated dose is that dose level that you want to move forward with.

353
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:02,470
That's usually going to be that dose level that has the the probability of toxicity closest to your target level.

354
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,890
So D is correct. Okay. So is B correct or not?

355
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:15,450
A lot of you thought, yes, saying it's a statistic, a function of the dose toxicity data collected in the trial.

356
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:22,889
So who would argue so if somebody said yes, why do you argue?

357
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:32,520
Yes. Or alternatively, since nobody's initially volunteering, somebody said no.

358
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:36,420
Why would you argue? No. So who wants to argue their point? Their position?

359
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,060
No. Wrong. Well, there's kind of a wrong answer here. Like it's all.

360
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:45,030
We don't care, right? It doesn't matter. We're here to learn. Yeah.

361
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:52,680
It seems like the media is, you know, like a dose is just a quantity and not necessarily a function of something.

362
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:58,860
Got it. So that's the argument for it. Should it be in there? Does anybody want to have a counter argument?

363
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:02,100
And then I'll let you know which I thought was the right answer.

364
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:12,149
Calculating the probabilities based on the data that you're collecting and you're using distributions to do that,

365
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:19,500
and then you're minimizing over them. So you're really just taking in data and then taking the minimum of some function of that data.

366
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:29,670
So that's what I think would be a statistic. Yeah. So I would actually say that the so what you're saying is not wrong what you're doing.

367
00:41:29,970 --> 00:41:37,680
However, I would argue that the initial answer was correct such that the maximum tolerated dose is a dose level.

368
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:43,380
What you are estimating, right, what you described or you're estimating the probabilities of toxicity at each dose level.

369
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:49,920
But the maximum tolerated dose is a specific value of the dose in which you choose, right?

370
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:56,340
So I would say that it is not a statistic and that the correct answer would have been f however I see

371
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:01,320
right you are what you are saying is correct in terms of how you calculate the probability of toxicity.

372
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:08,860
Okay. So the empty. Empty. I always say empty.

373
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:13,990
But it's empty API that's hybrid, right? It combines the Bayesian model based with algorithmic.

374
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:25,930
The dose decisions are only based on that dose level. And there can be this disconnect between the final empty TD and that MP and because

375
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:30,669
of that monitoring issue are constraining the posterior model based designs,

376
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:35,680
which we're really going to talk about next. And I had it on to not talk about until Thursday, but we're going to get started now.

377
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:43,180
They're going to model that dose toxicity curve. We're going to focus on the one parameter models that look at the local efficiency

378
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:48,580
or looking to get to model the MTD well and not necessarily the full curve.

379
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:57,340
And why statisticians, when they if they've had the chance to learn about different phase one designs,

380
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:01,690
why we prefer model based designs is because they're more efficient,

381
00:43:01,690 --> 00:43:11,320
they're flexible, and they're often easier to extend to more specific situations or more complex situations than the algorithmic designs.

382
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:21,850
All right. Any questions? Yes, sir. Is the sample size usually a little bit higher or does it take any more time to run a model based design?

383
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:27,340
Oh, good question. Yes. Usually the sample size is higher for a model based design,

384
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:33,999
but that's because of how we feel like it's really not adequate for a three plus three year algorithmic design.

385
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,040
Right. The algorithmic design, the sample size is based on the three plus three rules.

386
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:44,379
We don't pre specify the sample size and the algorithm. I mean, in the model based designs,

387
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:50,650
we have to pre specify the sample size and usually we make that a little bit bigger than what we would

388
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,520
see in a model based designs because we know how terrible the model based designs are estimating 90.

389
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:04,070
But it doesn't it doesn't necessarily have to take longer.

390
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:11,389
And you'll especially see that in a time to event continual reassessment methods.

391
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:16,820
So we'll talk about that next Thursday. Any other questions?

392
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:26,950
Okay. There are a bunch of extra slides on this one which you can look into if you want.

393
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,300
They may or may not make sense to you. I used them last year and then I decided when I was putting this together that I didn't feel

394
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,490
like I felt like there may be more confusing than helpful and so I just didn't present them.

395
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,910
But you're welcome to look at them and to ask any questions about them to Fong or myself.

396
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:44,460
If you're interested. All right.

397
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:50,110
So. We will move on to the continual reassessment method.

398
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:54,759
I forgot until like right before this class that we were going to have time for this.

399
00:44:54,760 --> 00:45:01,510
So sorry, I only posted these right before the class, but I did post the slides in a PDF version of them, so you should be able to access them now.

400
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:10,960
We won't go all the way till 120 will stop a little bit early, but I want to get a little bit into this before Thursday.

401
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:21,280
So today we're going to really get into the continual reassessment method or CRM design and we're going to figure out

402
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:26,440
how does this design make those decisions and how do we figure out what the maximum tolerated doses from the design.

403
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,940
So those are those two really important points for how you should be able to answer those.

404
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,650
How do we make those assignments? How do we estimate them to be for every phase one trial that we talk about?

405
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:39,579
Right. These are your points for the test.

406
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:42,639
What I could ask you, by the way,

407
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:48,550
your study guide for the test is if you take the lecture objectives from each lecture, that would be your study guide.

408
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:54,160
Okay. So if you go back and you put together all of the lecture objectives, those are what I think are the important points.

409
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:58,959
I want you to be able to describe the pros and the cons of this year of design,

410
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:08,710
so the benefits and the disadvantages will go through the steps of implementing a CRM, and we'll figure out how these different pieces are chosen.

411
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:13,569
I'm not on your tests going to ask you like you can't have a laptop, right?

412
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:18,940
So you can't run simulations or solve for I'm not going to ask you to solve for numbers.

413
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:25,300
I'm not going to ask you to actually do the math. It's more about the concepts and decision making for your tests.

414
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:31,900
And then Thursday or actually probably next Tuesday,

415
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:37,420
please do bring your laptops or tablets or whatever you have our studio on because

416
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:43,810
I'd like you to actually play with the R code and see how how the serum works.

417
00:46:46,550 --> 00:46:51,890
Okay. So you're you're going to feel like I'm a broken record just saying the same thing over and over.

418
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:58,940
But this is how important these points are. Okay. So the maximum tolerated dose is that dose expected to produce some degree of medically

419
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:04,440
unaccepted an unacceptable dose limiting toxicity in some specified proportion of patients.

420
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:10,300
That specified proportion of patients is our target is our target level.

421
00:47:10,310 --> 00:47:17,390
Right. And so we talked about the rule based or algorithmic designs, three plus three especially.

422
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:21,050
And then we started moving into the model based designs.

423
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:28,820
And the three plus three is going to use these cohorts of three and then come up with these really uncertain estimates of

424
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:36,980
the MTV model based designs to you're going to see we can have wiggle room with two cohorts if it's 1 to 3 or whatever.

425
00:47:37,730 --> 00:47:42,170
So they're just much more flexible and we're going to have better estimates of the maximum tolerated dose.

426
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:53,490
So we'll focus on in the model based designs, at least today and Thursday, on the continual reassessment method.

427
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:58,740
The next week we'll talk about some extensions, the tight zero, and also something called E walk.

428
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:06,660
I think those are the only other model based designs we'll talk about, but there are others that exist out there.

429
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:15,139
So our serum is going to combine our available trial data also with this prior information or prior beliefs we have from

430
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:22,630
previous from asking the clinicians about their beliefs or from what we've gathered from previous trials or studies,

431
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:27,860
we're going to put those things together to get our posterior distribution of the estimates of toxicity,

432
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:32,720
and that's going to help us with the dose assignments and with estimating the maximum tolerated dose.

433
00:48:33,230 --> 00:48:41,750
As we've mentioned, or as I mentioned, we're more likely to recommend the correct maximum tolerated dose to go into phase two.

434
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:49,280
Also more likely to treat more patients at that maximum tolerated dose with a model based design than an algorithm design.

435
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:58,129
So this year a method was proposed by Oakwood like Quigley and Fisher in 1990.

436
00:48:58,130 --> 00:49:04,400
So it's been around for quite a long time, which is again another surprising fact for like, why isn't it used more?

437
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:12,979
Remember I put up those that information about like even in the 2000 is 97% of cancer trials.

438
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:17,270
We're using three plus three. And now it's probably in the eighties, 80%.

439
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:20,149
But with all of these great statistical properties,

440
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:26,930
it's surprising even it's been around for 30 plus years that we're not using this kind of design more.

441
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:33,299
Um, and then and also the continual re assessment method and, and types your um,

442
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,780
in particular we have a lot of expertize here at Michigan and Ohio State.

443
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:40,950
So Tom, Brian, Phil Boonstra, Matt Skipper, Jeremy Taylor,

444
00:49:40,950 --> 00:49:51,090
they all are experts in phase one design and have made really amazing advances in like the continual re-assessment method or type CRM.

445
00:49:51,840 --> 00:50:00,360
And so it's I think, always neat to see that while you may not have a lot of connection to a lot of the faculty members,

446
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:06,450
you're in a department that has individuals who are world renowned experts in many, many areas.

447
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:12,480
And so this area, phase one design research, we actually have several individuals who are expert in that area.

448
00:50:14,670 --> 00:50:22,170
So the continual reassessment method is a creative application of regression or model based techniques.

449
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:24,090
Two, phase one, dose escalation.

450
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,520
And we're going to formalize the model based phase one design by we're going to talk about how do we choose the model.

451
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:33,140
So is it probit logit for power?

452
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:39,030
How do we make the dose assignments and how do we estimate the maximum tolerated dose?

453
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:49,890
Or how do we move forward with the recommendation of the MTD? So the serum has been studied for a long time and there's been a lot of improvement.

454
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,879
So things like, okay, well you can get an estimate of the skeleton from a clinician,

455
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,340
but there might actually be other ways for which we could find or choose the skeleton.

456
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:06,549
And there's a whole article on that we can talk about what's the best model to use?

457
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:14,590
There is a whole manuscript on that we can think more about, Well, what prior distributions should we use for our parameters?

458
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:21,129
There's a whole manuscript on that, and these are just example manuscripts that were like the first answering these questions.

459
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:26,740
But I'm sure there have been subsequent manuscripts improving upon or thinking more about these as well.

460
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:36,250
And the reason why we want to think specifically about these components is because ultimately we want to optimize all

461
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:45,760
pieces of the model so that we're more likely to treat individuals closest to MTD and find the MTD as fast as as we can.

462
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,939
And we want to make the most appropriate dose of Simon.

463
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:58,060
So we're not going to treat too many people at a doses that would be too toxic for doses that are likely some therapeutic and not remotely toxic.

464
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:07,270
Or we would probably rather take treat people at the safer doses, but yet we know that there's likely to be little clinical benefit.

465
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,660
And so that's why we don't want to do too much of that either.

466
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:20,650
Okay. So again, so that's a million times but we we have some prior information,

467
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:24,460
some prior belief that we start collecting the data about the dose limiting toxicities.

468
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:32,830
We have a model that we believe is a representation of the relationship between the dose level and the toxicity level.

469
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,809
We start getting the information from the patients about whether they had DLT or not.

470
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:41,590
We put that into our model, combine it with our prior and outcomes,

471
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:51,309
is updated estimates of DLT probabilities within our posterior and we just keep doing this with every individual who comes into our trial, right?

472
00:52:51,310 --> 00:52:55,000
So every individual, every time we learn about whether there is a DLT or not,

473
00:52:55,000 --> 00:53:05,740
we update our model and find new estimates and that will help us with the dose assignment and then also at the end with estimating the MTD.

474
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:16,860
So I kind of just keep saying, you know, so we have these dose levels, right?

475
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:24,130
But I just said, well, the number of dose levels is set by the clinician or the number of dose levels is dependent on the treatment.

476
00:53:24,430 --> 00:53:29,460
And that's really what it is. Statistically, we don't usually have a say in this.

477
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:37,060
However, if the clinician comes to us and says, I want to look at ten doses in 20 individuals, you might be like, That's a bad idea, right?

478
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:41,590
Like maybe you're either going to have to decrease the number of doses or you're going to have

479
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:45,489
to increase the number of individuals because you're not going to get a lot of data out of that,

480
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:51,460
right? You're not going to get very good estimates. And so as a statistician,

481
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:59,770
we just want to be like a sounding board for the clinician investigator who's talking about the dose levels of interest to say,

482
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:04,540
you know, if there's too few, we're not going to estimate the MTD well,

483
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:11,469
and if there's too many, then it's going to take a really long time to get to the MTV and we're going to use a

484
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:17,500
lot of people on sub therapeutic doses and that we can make this trial run super long.

485
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:23,709
This others might be like in this treatment or this treatment might not be useful if that's the case.

486
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:31,030
And so we usually just want to help guide a little bit, but that number is often set by practical reasons.

487
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:39,010
So we talked about how right if it's a pill or something, you have to like drink, right?

488
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:43,239
That might only if it's a pill, it might only come in a certain size.

489
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:46,720
And so you could like cut it and or something that would be really difficult.

490
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,750
And it's something you drink. You can probably only drink a certain amount, right?

491
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:54,160
If it's an I.V., probably similarly, you can only put a certain amount in an individual.

492
00:54:56,020 --> 00:55:03,969
And so usually these are set by what's feasible, what's practical, also resource intensive.

493
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:14,440
So like if the medication is really, really expensive, usually can't look at very big doses of it or that many doses of it.

494
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:19,450
And often drugs are very similar to previous drugs.

495
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:24,429
And so we have some idea about what dose levels to test based on what that drug,

496
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:29,800
what other drugs were similar and how they were tested, what what levels were tested.

497
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:36,669
So as I said to you, right in statistics, often we're making incremental improvements on statistical methods similarly in drugs.

498
00:55:36,670 --> 00:55:40,090
Right, for often making incremental improvements on drugs.

499
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:46,840
So it's not too often that it's like, wow, this is a whole new type of drug that we have no idea what's going on.

500
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,870
And we have to only rely on mice, on mouse data.

501
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,570
It's usually like, Oh, this is similar to this other thing.

502
00:55:54,700 --> 00:56:03,250
In a review from 1997 to 2008 of 197 Phase one trials, the median number of doses was five.

503
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:12,430
And so you can see that there some trials used as few as two doses low in a high dose, while some use as many as 12.

504
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:19,530
But on on average, generally about five dose studied four using the continual reassessment method.

505
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:24,190
Specifically, the recommendation is to use 4 to 8 doses.

506
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,240
So this is where you start thinking about like, all right,

507
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:34,730
we have all these great statistical reasons to use cream and we see that the three plus three is not that great of a design.

508
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:38,110
However, if you're really only interested in two or three doses,

509
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:48,100
the three plus three might be more appropriate and the serum is likely not going to be worth it in some way.

510
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:54,790
It's really much a much more it's much more advantageous with around 4 to 8 doses.

511
00:56:56,710 --> 00:57:02,140
By the way, the I'm sure you haven't read it, but hopefully you are reading the suggested readings.

512
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:07,870
But this one is in technically until Thursday. The there are two readings for serum.

513
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:13,000
I recommend that you read both of them, but if you only read one of them, please read the Wheeler article.

514
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:20,379
It is extremely well-written and very clear and tells us all about these practical suggestions

515
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:25,720
for running continual reassessment methods so of the continual reassessment design.

516
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:34,720
So if you. I think the other one is the original Quigley paper, but if you only read one of them read the real thing.

517
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,650
A lot of it is summarized in this lecture, but I just think you get a lot out of it still.

518
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:44,860
Okay, so we have the number of doses basically set by the clinician and practical reasons,

519
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:48,910
and we've just guided that into like that's too many or that's not enough, perhaps.

520
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:55,750
How do we set this target toxicity level? This, again, is something that's usually set by the clinician.

521
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:00,910
And so this depends on the disease. It depends on the treatment.

522
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:03,489
It depends on the availability of other treatments.

523
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:09,580
So if we're in this area testing a new treatment where there are lots of other options for patients right now,

524
00:58:09,610 --> 00:58:13,690
you likely don't want a very high toxicity rate because they could just go take something else.

525
00:58:14,350 --> 00:58:16,030
And so that's going to come into play.

526
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:23,739
It's going to matter whether the individuals in the trial are healthy or sick or the individuals who eventually take the treatment are healthy,

527
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:29,830
are sick. And then, of course, it actually depends on a definition of dose limiting toxicity.

528
00:58:30,250 --> 00:58:33,660
So if a dose limiting toxicity is like a headache, right,

529
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:40,510
we might be more willing to have a higher percentage of that than if the dose limiting toxicity is stroke, for example.

530
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:48,230
Usually a stroke is really that. We don't want that even until you have like Von DLT, right?

531
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:55,720
We really don't want 30% of strokes, but often DLT is more like white blood cell count and things like that.

532
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:03,070
And so, like I said, this is usually between 20 to 35% this target toxicity level.

533
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:12,280
This Wheeler article recommends if you're using a serum that the target toxicity level is between five and 50.

534
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:21,430
Okay. So 50 might be if it's a really low level, mild dose limiting toxicity, it certainly wouldn't be something more extreme.

535
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:27,600
And 5% might be if it's a little bit more of a moderate DLT.

536
00:59:27,610 --> 00:59:30,560
But you're tending to treat healthy patients, right?

537
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:38,050
Or it could be if it's a really severe DLT that you really don't want need to have, but perhaps it could occur.

538
00:59:42,210 --> 00:59:48,270
Okay. So the the serum design, we're going to have this prior guess of our dose toxicity curve.

539
00:59:49,050 --> 00:59:55,530
We're going to assign our first patient either to what we believe the MTD is or a lower dose.

540
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:03,060
We follow that patient for whatever amount of time that we need to follow them to observe if they would have a delta or not.

541
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:06,060
So that's also pre-specified by the clinician investigator.

542
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:13,410
Then we take that information about whether they had a DLT or not. We put it into our model with our prior belief.

543
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:22,110
We update that model set and we now have these posterior estimates of the dose of the probability of toxicity at each dose level.

544
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:25,559
So we could say, okay, now what's the next the newest MTD,

545
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:30,420
that level that's closest to our target toxicity level, and we could assign that to the next patient.

546
01:00:30,450 --> 01:00:37,320
We'll talk about the safety constraints in a little bit. And we just keep doing this until we've hit our target sample size.

547
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:43,590
And so I think I'll talk about what that target sample size is next or soon.

548
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:49,440
So we set like, you know, maybe it's 20 patients, maybe it's 30 patients that's going to depend on the number of doses.

549
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:55,740
And once we've hit those 30 patients, then we'd say, okay, we've completed our Phase one trial.

550
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:59,160
We can now look at our model, all the accumulated data,

551
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:09,600
and figure out the probability of toxicity at the dose levels and choose the MTD such that that's the one where the target,

552
01:01:10,050 --> 01:01:14,850
the toxicity level is closest to our target. All right.

553
01:01:14,850 --> 01:01:24,120
So let's go through a step by step example and then we'll we'll end in like 10 minutes.

554
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:31,860
So. So this was a recently published 2019 series.

555
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:36,000
And so that's still fine. So this is a Phase one B study.

556
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:40,499
Now, don't worry about the B there. We're just going to call all phase one studies.

557
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:45,520
Phase one studies. Some people delineate whether it's a phase one A or phase one B, it doesn't matter for us.

558
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:54,120
Okay. But this is a phase one study of this treatment, this new treatment in combination with a standard treatment.

559
01:01:55,140 --> 01:02:00,330
And so they're going to keep the standard the docetaxel the docetaxel ad.

560
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:06,900
And I say these ones correctly. We're going to keep that standard treatment fixed at 75 milligrams per meter squared.

561
01:02:07,170 --> 01:02:13,290
So we're only looking at what level of this new dose, this new treatment should we have.

562
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:20,580
So we don't have to escalate or change the standard treatment level we're just looking at in combination with this new treatment.

563
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:29,249
What's the new dose of the what's the dose of the new treatment that was set that the target toxicity rate

564
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:36,570
was 20% and the maximum sample size was 20 individuals and they were looking at studying for dose levels.

565
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,790
So dose level, one, two, three, four.

566
01:02:38,790 --> 01:02:45,150
And this is what the dose level is in terms of like milligrams per meter squared or whatever of this new treatment.

567
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:56,550
So the first thing that we could do is start with the skeleton for the probability of the dose letting toxicities at each dose.

568
01:02:57,460 --> 01:03:02,250
Right. So we asked the clinicians at each of these dose levels, one, two, three, four.

569
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:12,600
Right. With this amount of drug already combined, combined with the standard drug, what's the dose level dosing, toxicity, probabilities you expect.

570
01:03:13,140 --> 01:03:23,070
And so they could come back and say it's 20% at dose one, 31% at dose to 42% at dose three and 53% at dose four.

571
01:03:23,430 --> 01:03:30,450
Now, honestly, if we started there, if I started a trial and they told me that 20% was the target toxicity rate,

572
01:03:30,450 --> 01:03:34,290
and then they told me that these were the expected toxicities. I would say, okay,

573
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:43,200
need lower doses or you really need to reset that because I don't want to start the patients on a dose that is the target and we have nowhere to move.

574
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:51,780
Right. So so this is a bad example in the sense of like if this was really the expected levels of toxicity,

575
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:55,830
you'd want at least one additional lower dose in this trial.

576
01:03:55,930 --> 01:04:00,150
Okay, but let's just go with it.

577
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:07,079
So we're going to use the accumulated data of the patients, whether they have a DLT or not, to update this parameter.

578
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:16,480
And so what model am I assuming here, based on what you can see here for the dose response, the dose toxicity curve, our yeah.

579
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:24,020
Power model, right. Because the power model is a simple s j and a skeleton to the data or I just called it alpha here.

580
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:28,200
So sorry for the inconsistent notation, but just any, any parameter.

581
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:32,310
Right. Just pick your favorite Greek letter. Put it in as our parameter. We got the power model here.

582
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:37,169
So I have my new write.

583
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:48,870
My model is s to the alpha and so I can specify it here because the power model allows us to have that skeleton be the dose labels as well.

584
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:55,649
And so I'm starting with what if we have graph it, right?

585
01:04:55,650 --> 01:05:02,370
This is my expected relationship between dose and probability of DLT.

586
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:06,779
Now you'll see that I have like dose level down here.

587
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:18,480
But actually the more appropriate thing would be to use the dose label so that on the x axis you would actually see .2.2 would be 0.3, 1.42 and .53.

588
01:05:22,730 --> 01:05:27,170
So that's going to change the shape of my curve a little bit, right? It's not going to look like this.

589
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:35,430
Equally spaced. Linear thing. All right.

590
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:43,170
So first patient comes in, we put them on dose one and they do not have a DLT.

591
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:50,400
Okay, so my my table here is showing me the number of DLT is slash the number of people on the dose.

592
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:55,290
Okay. So there's zero. DLT is one on dose one. So I can update my model.

593
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:58,529
I can now estimate Alpha based on that information. All right.

594
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:04,260
Essentially, I'm saying like zero equals 3.22 alpha and I can solve.

595
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:08,370
And so I get that alpha is 1.31.

596
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:18,170
And so now I can read estimate my probability of toxicity at each dose level using this power model at my new estimated parameter alpha.

597
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:22,340
And I get these updated probability of toxicities at each dose level.

598
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:28,530
So now the probability of toxicity based on my prior information and the fact that one person was

599
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:34,499
on dose one and didn't have a deal t is now I believe that actually it's not 20% at dose one,

600
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:37,840
it's 12%. And actually, it's not as high as 31%.

601
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,409
At dose two, it's actually 22%. Right.

602
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:46,530
So you can see that while I thought they were or the clinician thought they were high, somebody came in, didn't have a deal to either lower right.

603
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:52,800
And combine the prior with the observed and I get these lower but it's not as low as zero because the prior has some influence.

604
01:06:53,370 --> 01:07:00,450
Right. Okay. So here's my my previous initial is now I'm doing my initial skeleton estimate.

605
01:07:00,870 --> 01:07:05,729
And with the updated data right now my new curve is like the red curve.

606
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:10,860
I've updated it and this is now my relationship between dose and toxicity.

607
01:07:11,700 --> 01:07:15,960
Okay. The second person comes in and we decided that we would escalate because.

608
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:20,640
Oh, yeah, sorry, I skipped over that. Okay, so now how do I decide my dose assignment?

609
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:24,240
Right. I have these updated estimates of the probability of toxicity.

610
01:07:24,600 --> 01:07:31,650
I'm going to choose the level that's closest to the target toxicity level that I set.

611
01:07:32,130 --> 01:07:36,690
And you might have some safety constraints like you're not you would not go over that level.

612
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:41,160
If that was a safety constraint, I would have to put the second person on dose one again.

613
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:43,560
Right, because my target level is 20%.

614
01:07:43,650 --> 01:07:52,530
But usually we allow a little bit of flexibility such that like these we have some like small epsilon, 2%, 3%, 5%.

615
01:07:52,950 --> 01:08:00,929
That is the estimate is whether or not will assign that person. So since 22% is very close to 20%, it's not too much over.

616
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:04,610
We'll find the second person to dose to. Okay.

617
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:07,580
So the second person comes in to get those two and they do not have a deal.

618
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:17,150
So again, now I have right two people, Windows one, Hondas, two, they don't have deltas I can solve for alpha.

619
01:08:17,570 --> 01:08:20,480
So my new estimate of alpha is 1.64.

620
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:31,550
And you can see that I can right now update my model for each dose level and I get these new probabilities of toxicities at each dose level.

621
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:36,499
And you can see why we like the power model, because it's very easy to once I get the estimate,

622
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:40,760
I put it in and I get these very simply right, get the probability of toxicity.

623
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:44,690
If I use a logistic model, we're going to be doing more transforming to get this level.

624
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:53,990
Okay, so now my new curve, the green one is from after one patient, the red ones after two people.

625
01:08:54,410 --> 01:09:00,380
And I see that now even those three is within 5% of my target toxicity level.

626
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:07,130
And so I'll put per patient three on dose three because I feel like that's actually safe enough.

627
01:09:07,640 --> 01:09:15,280
So this clinician, right, in this example, a clinician, it's only three patients, but so far it was like highly overly conservative.

628
01:09:15,290 --> 01:09:20,299
Right. Really overestimated the probability of toxicity for the three doses.

629
01:09:20,300 --> 01:09:25,070
Although of course we know we only have three people, one on each dose, so it could definitely change.

630
01:09:26,450 --> 01:09:34,040
Okay, so no dose. So we had we put that next person, the third person on dose three.

631
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:38,629
Now let's skip forward. We put them on dose three and they didn't have a deal.

632
01:09:38,630 --> 01:09:46,340
T We updated the estimates. Now you've actually put three people on dose four and at this point we have one DLT.

633
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:54,560
Okay. So now I have one person on dose, 1 to 1 person on all the doses.

634
01:09:54,560 --> 01:10:01,580
One, two, three. No, DLT is three people on dose four one dlt and my alpha is estimated to be 1.78.

635
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,250
So I update my probability of toxicity at each dose level and I find that the target,

636
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:11,150
the probability of toxicity for those three is the closest to my target level.

637
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:19,760
Right. It looks like dose four is two toxic dose three is the closest within 5% to 20%.

638
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:25,549
And so again, the green curve is after five patients.

639
01:10:25,550 --> 01:10:28,879
And then we had a delta. So you can see the curve moved up. Right.

640
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:40,910
It shifted up based on that. Six patients who had a DLT in the dotted line is that target level, which is at 20%.

641
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:49,630
Okay. So after we've treated 20 patients, this is what the data looks like.

642
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:56,260
One was treated at dose. One didn't have a deal. Five were treated on dose two, and none of them had a delta.

643
01:10:56,830 --> 01:11:03,280
11 were treated on dose three and two had Delta and three were treated on dose four and one had a delta.

644
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,930
And so you can see this graph just shows that pictorially, right?

645
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:20,440
How we on the Y axis, how we change dose levels and then it's not full circle four is that there is no delta and up filled in circle state.

646
01:11:20,560 --> 01:11:28,270
We saw Delta on that dose. Yeah. So is that Alpha coming just directly from the data and some sort of monoclonal or whereas.

647
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:31,960
Yeah. So the alpha is coming from the data but also combined with the prior.

648
01:11:32,680 --> 01:11:35,709
Right. But the prior and it's through the power model.

649
01:11:35,710 --> 01:11:43,420
And the power model, the prior is coming in at what we believe the dose limiting toxicities are to start.

650
01:11:43,780 --> 01:11:49,359
And then through that power model with the information about the patients on the dose levels,

651
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:55,960
we get that alpha and with that estimated alpha we update the probability of toxicities, make dose assignments.

652
01:11:56,350 --> 01:12:03,460
And so now we have all of the data, right? And we have this final estimate of alpha based on all of the patients.

653
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:12,220
And we see that our estimated probability of toxicity at dose level, one, two, three, four is 4%, 10%, 18%, 28%.

654
01:12:12,670 --> 01:12:22,450
And so now we can find our MTD by saying, well, dose three has 18% probability, that's of toxicity and that's closest to our target level of 20%.

655
01:12:22,450 --> 01:12:25,930
Therefore, our dose level three is our maximum tolerated dose.

656
01:12:26,620 --> 01:12:34,749
And you can see that we treated most of our patients, right, 11 out of the 20 on dose level three.

657
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:43,780
So with this model based design, more patients were treated at the MTV and there is a small number of dose limiting toxicities.

658
01:12:43,780 --> 01:12:50,650
Only three, right. And only three people were treated at that higher level than the MTD.

659
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:59,590
Yeah. So for the very first patient they started their dose at the target level.

660
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:06,760
Was that normal. Can be. We'll talk about I think I have a slide in this one that talks about safety constraints.

661
01:13:07,150 --> 01:13:11,310
So you either would start in the old school like the way that if you read the old

662
01:13:11,330 --> 01:13:16,660
Quigley article he was going to say start at the MTV that the initial estimated MTD.

663
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:20,860
However, then people said, you know what, that might be a really bad guess.

664
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:27,850
And so really what you should do is maybe like think about what your target MTD is and take a step or two down and start there.

665
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:35,320
Because if you allow for dose escalation after just one individual, you'll get to that right?

666
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:41,200
Even if it's just two dose levels, you'll get to that MTD quickly. All right.

667
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:51,640
So we'll stop. Let me see. Well, I think we'll stop here and we'll start with next class on Thursday.

668
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:57,400
So I want you to summarize. Then we'll look at these simulations which go through that faster.

669
01:13:57,410 --> 01:14:12,960
So we'll see the. You can play with the form if you want to. And then we'll continue talking about the CRM and also remember how you use.

670
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:37,130
Here's the deal. It's all based on what you did.

671
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:54,780
A lot of this is concerned about how they have to work.

672
01:14:55,050 --> 01:14:58,400
I've never used to have like a message.

673
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:30,990
It's not like it's like, you know, I feel like I'm like, I can't go on like this happens.

674
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:51,100
We'll talk about a lot of things you should do.

675
01:15:51,990 --> 01:16:20,050
So there you go. Male You know, it's like generally I mean, guess when I say, you know, she's like, it's okay, but you should be using only period.

676
01:16:23,370 --> 01:16:40,049
So I think it's important for me to use this model to use prior planning to do something.

677
01:16:40,050 --> 01:16:51,840
That's right. So we'll talk about it on our lunch hour at all.

678
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:57,980
Yeah, that was actually it was outside doing Thursday.

679
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:13,020
Tuesday. It's through the model strategy. Essentially, we have to go even higher quality and it's solving for sure.

680
01:17:15,480 --> 01:17:22,950
As far as we're concerned, we just want to make sure for the homework you didn't like, specify a dessert.

681
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:29,380
So to use a random yes for this and they I think I have an idea.

682
01:17:29,410 --> 01:17:32,460
So simulations or results should be.

683
01:17:32,940 --> 01:17:42,570
Yeah, they're mainly statements. So they're like a little order with an answer says, I think I'm gonna go do something.

684
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:53,910
You comes from parents who said, you know, I have to ask that immediately.

685
01:17:54,570 --> 01:18:03,570
So based on like something that I want to make sure I have my question.

686
01:18:03,660 --> 01:18:16,850
That's good to know. Yeah. I don't know if I have like the most to show the through is like three lines or is not organized.

687
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:21,870
Oh, yes. Yeah. Okay.

688
01:18:25,290 --> 01:18:29,099
I'm sorry. Yeah.

689
01:18:29,100 --> 01:18:32,250
So I. I went for a couple of purchases.

690
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:35,550
Oh that should have been dose three, four, four person three.

691
01:18:35,610 --> 01:18:41,639
Yeah. And then this one says okay that person got it and we didn't have a DLT, so we want to use this four.

692
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:46,350
So I left office. So when we go to those four, we run by one.

693
01:18:46,380 --> 01:18:50,970
Yeah. As a new person, we can't zero anything in one person.

694
01:18:51,210 --> 01:19:12,720
We don't get the office and, and you just want to determine which nodes we need to see because that way of looking into all these all kinds.

695
01:19:17,080 --> 01:19:20,150
This is a real home. Not nothing.

696
01:19:20,230 --> 01:19:26,860
Good news. So when I think that my mouth was completely.

697
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:32,520
The law of the land, which seems rather unusual.

698
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:52,240
Well, we wouldn't want you to run out of batteries, but we would like to be yosri java audio for this issue.

699
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:56,870
And after all, the commodity for the.
