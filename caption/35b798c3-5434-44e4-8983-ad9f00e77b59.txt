1
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:06,500
OK, welcome to biostatistics about twenty one.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:13,610
This is the lab zero, really walking through the tutorial, I'll be doing the environmental health science tutorial,

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:18,920
but they're all the same, regardless of which dataset you're using. So just have your wits.

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:24,590
You're going to open this are our studio should have that installed and loaded and ready to go.

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:31,280
You need your data set that you're going to be using downloaded and ready to go and you're going to need this ah tutorial.

6
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,750
All right. So first, let's start with a couple couple of things real quick.

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:42,010
Just this. Our studio environment, this area right here is called the console.

8
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:46,340
OK, this is where we're going to be writing code at a command line.

9
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,960
A command line. Is this this little carrott feature.

10
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,030
Right. That's got the cursor right. So we're going to be writing code in there.

11
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:58,880
So, you know, in the most simplistic things you can use are to do things like that.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,560
There's a calculator. So I do like two plus two equals four.

13
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:12,740
All right. See, so you can do things like save variables X equals two when you save something as a variable.

14
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,340
OK, what you'll notice is that information pops up here.

15
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,960
This is telling you that you've got information stored in our OK,

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:28,850
so BRESEE that so it's saying if you've got something called X and it's taking on the value of two, then I can then use that value X.

17
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:36,410
So if you look down here, I can say X plus five is equal to seven.

18
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:43,180
Right. So are you taking that X, substituting the two in for it and making it a seven.

19
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,110
It as a calculator you can say more complicated data structures that are.

20
00:01:48,110 --> 00:02:00,560
So for example you can do something like Y equals and instead of one number I could save a list of numbers like one three five seven.

21
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:09,980
OK, so what I've done here is I've wrapped these numbers in something called CS CS four, combine or concatenate, OK?

22
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:15,920
And so now if you look up here, I'm saving the value of Y.

23
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,520
All right. But instead of it being just a single number two, it's got one, three, five and seven because you can store more complicated things.

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:31,340
Right. We're going to read the data set and you'll see that's going to have thousands of rows and maybe a dozen columns or something.

25
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,510
But you'll see it pop up there. You can then do things like this.

26
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:42,560
You can do, say, Y plus five an hour does what you want it to do.

27
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,890
Right. If you wanted to add five, you know, you're saying five plus one six five four three eight five plus five.

28
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,110
Stand by for seven 12. OK, so you can use R as a basic calculator.

29
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:58,460
So when you're doing your homework, feel free to use a calculator, you know, if you got your computer open.

30
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:08,200
Anyway, what we're going to focus on now is using our something a little more sophisticated as a statistical software for data analysis.

31
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,590
OK, so the first thing we're going to want to do is I'm going to ask you to and I hope many of

32
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,440
you already did mistake because this this is the stuff that can get a little bit dicey.

33
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,520
It can be difficult. But what I want you to do is run this. If you if you've already done this, install packages for Tiny.

34
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:31,810
Don't do it again. If you haven't run it, I'm going to want you to run it because all you have to do is copy this.

35
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:40,520
And you pasted in. Copy and paste it in there.

36
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:48,740
You an answer now? I had already done this and hopefully it will start downloading a bunch of files.

37
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,480
So what's it doing?

38
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:59,810
So when you download are comes with a bunch of built in code for functions, things like the need and histograms and box plots and stuff like that.

39
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:06,950
There's way more that you want to be able to do with R, right? Actually, people can write their own functions and they're just sitting out there.

40
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,540
People post them on the Internet.

41
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:17,240
When you do this, install packages, what it's saying is, hey, there's a whole set of functions that fall under this this package called Tidey Verse.

42
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:25,410
I want to use them, go get them, download them to my computer and physically put those files on my computer.

43
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,330
OK, and that's all you're doing, that you're setting it up.

44
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:36,920
Now, there's a lot of money. Sometimes it takes a while to download. Once you've downloaded them to your computer using that install packages,

45
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:42,600
that then what you need to do is you need to tell r OK, now it's physically here.

46
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,810
Now I want you to take those that code those functions and bring them into my current session.

47
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,450
OK, so this is a stuff that you need to run every time you start in your session.

48
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:58,700
You don't need to re download them. Right. Downloads a one time thing loading it into your current our session.

49
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,220
That's something you want to do every time. So that would be this library. Tiny first step.

50
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,110
So you can copy that and paste that in. I already did it.

51
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:15,680
OK, what you can see what the output looks like right here. So it'll depend what your output looks like sometimes.

52
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,670
Usually you'll get just something like this is the first part.

53
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:27,230
I got a bunch of warning messages. OK, so it's telling me is that some of these things were made under older versions.

54
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:33,290
I'm not using my version of R on my laptop. I don't know when this version of our studio and Argott updated last time.

55
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,750
If you just installed our in our studio, you should not run into these problems.

56
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:45,100
Got. How are we doing?

57
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:53,000
You don't need to be shy because of recording. Remember what I said, you've got questions you need to ask and answer.

58
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:02,090
All right, so next step, we've got our studio, what we've done is we've got it ready to do our analysis.

59
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,750
So what's the first step? The first step is reading in the data.

60
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:18,230
So what I want you to do is first get this idea that our lives in a certain place on your computer, OK?

61
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,680
And when you start it up, that's where it's looking for files, right.

62
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,000
Or doesn't know where your specific data file is.

63
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:37,220
So what I want you to do is to get W.D. parentheses and hit enter.

64
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:43,970
There's going to look different for everybody. Get means, go get something.

65
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,230
WD stands for Working Directory. OK, this is a function. I'm asking you to do something for me.

66
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:58,970
I'm saying tell me where you're currently looking for files and whether it returns the path of where it's currently looking.

67
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,900
So, you know, the C drive and then the user's folder that Z.

68
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,030
Right. So you probably have your name here somewhere if it's your own computer or something.

69
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:17,200
And then the documents folder, because that's where it's currently looking at question time, you know.

70
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:26,390
No, no. I'm just telling you that you can use this function to find out where you're looking at right now.

71
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:31,220
What we want to do is we want to say, well, my ah, my data files not here.

72
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,120
It's somewhere else. My computer. I need to tell ah where it is. So now this is going to be different for everybody.

73
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,360
OK, and so I did this while I was waiting.

74
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,880
I just made a folder called Bias that five twenty one on this desktop somewhere.

75
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:56,030
I wouldn't have it on my desktop, my regular computer where I put it here and if I double click on that, I get to this, this folder.

76
00:07:56,030 --> 00:08:01,790
I made it some call a some folder called Labbe here. OK, I would highly recommend you do this for this class.

77
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:08,600
Make a folder for Basnet five twenty one, make a subfolder for lab, make a subfolder for homework package and be needing the space.

78
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:20,210
Keep yourself organized. This is good, good skill anyway to have a double click within lab and now I can see where I put that data file at CSV file.

79
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:23,960
So this is a CSB file stands for comma separated. Right.

80
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:32,060
It just means that it's a text file. But if you looked at it the way that you could tell where one column ends and the next column begins.

81
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:41,420
Perkowitz That's a separate. So now you somehow need to get this location to R if you're using a window is the

82
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:52,650
easiest thing is to just do this right is to just copy this thing right here.

83
00:08:52,650 --> 00:09:06,150
You're going to say now, instead of get W.D., you're going to say set W.D., you're going to put parentheses, you're going to put it in double quotes.

84
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,460
And this is annoying, but you actually have to turn all these slashes around.

85
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:17,720
So instead of being a slash to the left, they need to be a slash to the right.

86
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:27,000
OK, so now I notice I'm telling it a location that I wanted to look at, look for on my computer.

87
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,780
If I hit enter with WD, nothing happens.

88
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:39,510
I didn't get an error, anything. OK, but if I rerun this command, get W.D., which I don't have to type all the way out, I can just press the up arrow,

89
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,360
see the apparel that you recycle through all the previous functions, carbonized programmers and lazy people.

90
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,960
Right. So they put all these little shortcuts into to speed things up, get go back and get the leg.

91
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:58,500
And now notice now R says, here's where I'm looking for philes.

92
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,540
OK. All right, now, there's lots of people that have Max.

93
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:11,190
Here's the problem. I'm not a Mac user. Somehow you need to be able to figure out how to grab the location of that file.

94
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:20,730
So I can't do it on the screen up here. If there is somebody who's a Mac user who's kind of experience with this, I would love your help here.

95
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:25,740
I think what you can do is you can if you find the file that you're looking for,

96
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:35,400
I think there's like off to the right in here, right where it says we file correct it anywhere.

97
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:41,180
And then if you click on that, where I believe that's going to do for you, is that the right?

98
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,840
How would you feel if you just all the same?

99
00:10:44,840 --> 00:11:00,870
I think some of customers seem like a little bit more to.

100
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:12,680
You know, I mean, you know, this is a step down Nordstrom, and this is how do you decide?

101
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:19,040
You got a location of your shoulder goddess.

102
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:30,330
You have to see us anymore. So where are you?

103
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:35,410
So how do they grab your economic recovery?

104
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:40,050
And who's the who's this person looking for that person?

105
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:47,540
How you how do they grab you? Copy that. That's where we're.

106
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:54,940
So they've got the location of where. Oh, yeah.

107
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:03,760
So I think it's 7:00 a.m. here on the desktop, so let me just ask you this.

108
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:17,580
You drive. Oh, yes, Sense is busy trying to remind users of your idiot.

109
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:34,190
No, no, no. Also this this is one more what that location is the reason that so many.

110
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:43,040
The federal government doesn't think it should be there and so on, but.

111
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:49,750
Look over here. Yes, this is a story that we're going to be.

112
00:12:49,750 --> 00:13:00,300
So here's the here's a little try this, too, if you're if you're having trouble.

113
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:14,820
They do. So if you're having trouble, you can always try this year at a session at the top.

114
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,960
You can click on a session and then go to set working directory.

115
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:29,090
And I believe if you do this, choose a directory, write something like this should pop up and you can find your way there.

116
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:35,810
So this is this is where I was, and if I hit open, it'll actually run that set would command for you.

117
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:41,910
This is nice because it'll help you get started, right. We'll get you set up to help you find that path for you.

118
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:47,510
OK, so this is this is like a this is about computer architecture, right?

119
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:57,080
It's understanding your own computer. OK, we're we're files on.

120
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:08,700
Where did you go? So it was a good session. Sessions set working director, said she's director,

121
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:20,310
this window pops up and you should be able to find where your file is or where your folders are going to ask, how do you know?

122
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:26,010
Correct. So the way you know that it works is if it writes this right.

123
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:34,870
But then try typing W.D. again and you should see that it's changed its location.

124
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:39,940
Let me guess, yeah.

125
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:50,560
Remember, what I was doing here are saying, you know, you have to remember our is a program that lives in a specific place on your computer.

126
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,220
Your data file can live anywhere on your computer. You need to tell it, hey, this is where you need to go to find the file.

127
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,380
I'm looking for for this specific analysis. OK, here's the good thing.

128
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:09,880
Once you do this process one time, OK, we can write code so that you don't have to repeat it.

129
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,300
So once you've got this one I want you to do is go up to this little green arrow here in the top left,

130
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:26,400
right back, and we're going to open something called our screens. And this window are open right here.

131
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:33,730
For everybody thought this piece down here, it's called the console.

132
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:41,830
What if if you click this this green button to the screen right here in the top corner and then horsewhipped?

133
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:46,840
Yes. So this area right here is called the console.

134
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,310
This is like sort of where the code gets run. It's like where the action happens. Right?

135
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:58,120
This area up here is called the editor. OK, so what you can do is you can type code up there and you can save it.

136
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:03,820
Whatever happens here gets lost. Right. So when you close are this just gets wiped away.

137
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:06,860
But you don't want to lose the stuff that you just learned how to do. Right.

138
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:11,170
You want to save it so that when you come back next time, you don't have to go through the same process again.

139
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:16,720
Right. So what I want you to do is grab the important pieces of code that you just used.

140
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:25,610
So library time inverse. Copy that. Pasted up top.

141
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:37,360
And then this W.D. Command copy and paste it up top.

142
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:48,460
This is people people have heard about reproducible research in the world of computational research code makes things reproducible,

143
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:53,050
trying to repeat button clicks, not super, not super reproducible.

144
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:58,590
Right. And screw that up. You got to remember what happens this. Now you can just run and it's going to work.

145
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:02,590
OK, so what we're going to want to do, sieverts, it's untitled. It's in red.

146
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,080
That red is sort of warning you that it's not safe. So you can hit save notice.

147
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:19,230
It's going to take you to that that current working directory right away. Save this as something, say, Labbe zero zero.

148
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:23,830
You want to call it DOT. Oh, OK.

149
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:27,430
That's an extension file extension somehow.

150
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:31,930
How something like that PDF all that thing does is that when you try to open it,

151
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:37,360
it tells the operating system what program to go get so that it knows how to use it.

152
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:42,130
Right. If you try to open this with, you know, Excel, if you like, what the [INAUDIBLE] is this thing?

153
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:46,930
Right. When it sees that R, it says that's that's that's an art studio thing.

154
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:54,580
You said enter and you'll notice that in that folder, your work where I was working.

155
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:57,880
I see. Right here, OK, and so when you come back,

156
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,940
you should just be able to double click on this R and this is just pop open in are this stuff will be emptied out here.

157
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:11,500
Right, because that gets lost in the console. But this stuff will be right here and you can always rerun this code by.

158
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:19,630
There's a couple of different ways. If you want to run multiple steps at once, you can highlight them and then click run.

159
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,610
So what happens is when I click it up there, nothing looks different up here.

160
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:28,510
Remember I said the magic happens down here, but it ran those lines of code right here.

161
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:37,570
I did already install Adami Roaded Tiny, so nothing changed, but it again ran that line of code for setting my working directory.

162
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:47,420
Good. Inside. All right, so the next step is going to be we're going to read in our data file.

163
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,840
OK, so remember, the data file is here.

164
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:57,990
It's a CSV file, just a text file where data columns are separated by commas.

165
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,840
Now we're going to do is reading it to heart.

166
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:08,070
So if you look at your tutorial, OK, we're going to use something called the read underscore kesby function.

167
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:17,710
So you read in what kind of file am I going to read in a C S.V. So this function knows, hey, when I read this and I'm reading in a text file,

168
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,590
I'd be looking for commas because commas are going to tell me where I do my where I pass the line,

169
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:29,970
where I know where one variable ends and the next one begins. You have to say it as something you can say.

170
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:34,140
This is anything you want to say it.

171
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,690
As I often when I read things and I'm doing this quick,

172
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:43,770
I just use like a little lowercase D because it's quick when I have to retype stuff later on, I'd rather write something short.

173
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,340
When you learn about coding, naming things something short is always great.

174
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:55,350
It saves you typing memory. Coders are lazy people. Now I need to just make sure I tell it where where I want it to look.

175
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,010
OK, so when I made this file, it was a little bit different.

176
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:05,250
I had a subfolder for data. You probably don't need this right now and I actually don't need it right now.

177
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:18,250
But what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over here. I'm going to grab this.

178
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:24,820
Copy paste it in here. I'm going to get rid of this data piece because I don't need it now.

179
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:31,600
The reason why I don't need it is because in my present working directory, the files right there on my own personal computer,

180
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,950
I had like a sub folder called Data that the data file was and I was just pointing it through them.

181
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:45,700
I don't need to do that here. Right. This extra little piece right here and a little N.A equals beginning end quote.

182
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:53,440
This is telling this function. There is missing data in this file and the way it's coded is that's a capital A.

183
00:20:53,440 --> 00:21:01,600
OK, so you'll note and if you go back and reread this, you know, I mentioned that other options sometimes are minus nine.

184
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,660
That's a common option.

185
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:10,780
And like in Theta minus 90 percent data or just blacklight two commas in a row means there's nothing there for this specific one.

186
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:14,500
Has that once I've got that there.

187
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:20,200
The other thing, the way you can run this is if I have the cursor just on that line and I hit run, it'll run just that line.

188
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,940
I can also hit control center and it'll run that line.

189
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:37,480
So when that happened, oh, wow, this is an older version of a tiny person, you're probably seeing something that looks more like this than what I got,

190
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:42,070
because, again, this this is old it's probably hasn't been updated in 18 months.

191
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:48,470
Right. But it should look like this. It's telling you what. It's red in red in a dataset set.

192
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:52,790
So you should see up in this corner now, whenever you named it,

193
00:21:52,790 --> 00:22:00,770
if you needed capital Vata, you'll see that if you need it something else, it'll be that.

194
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:04,790
In terms of what you're seeing on the screen, remember what we talked about in class,

195
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:09,080
we talked about the difference between categorical variables and numerical variables,

196
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:16,460
are will actually look at what it's reading in and it's going to do its best to figure out what kind of variable it is.

197
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:21,770
This R stands for character. OK, so it thinks these are categorical variables.

198
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:27,080
These are like words and stuff. So are these things are terrible names.

199
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,190
These are the names that enhance games that we're going to learn how to change the names later.

200
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,730
But this a gender, right?

201
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:41,240
RIAA is the name of the survey from NHANES, and that's the gender variable.

202
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:49,250
It's another one. So, you know, some of them are. So here here in the next row is DBL stands for Double, which is a data type for computers.

203
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,820
But it's a no, it's a numerical variable. So these are the list of my numerical variables.

204
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:00,480
Right. So here you can see our I.D. each year that somebody's age in years.

205
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:07,940
Here's BMX, BMI. So that's some study or some survey or something that where the data was stored was in something called BMX.

206
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:15,920
And this is actual BMI. The definitions of these are in that introductory file that were filed that's on the site.

207
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,980
So you're not supposed to look at those, know exactly what they are. Right. But I'm giving you that right.

208
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:30,180
It's in that introductory file. All right, OK, so the next thing we're going to do is let's take a look at our data.

209
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:38,010
There's two ways you could do this. One way is you could use an actual function like you.

210
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:44,400
So notice how I'm putting my coat up in the editor, right, so that I can keep saving it right.

211
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,200
Because remember, if I just take it down here, it's lost, right? It'll run, but I can't get back to it.

212
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:54,000
I kind of like to use the console down here to type when I'm trying to, like, test stuff out.

213
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,170
And then if I get a code that I like and it's working, then I'll put it up on top.

214
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:02,670
So I sort of freeze it. Save it. OK, so there's this new data.

215
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:08,080
If I hit that, what'll happen is this window will open up.

216
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:13,140
You didn't lose your script. It's still there. Just made a new tab and that's where your data points.

217
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:18,330
Alternatively, you can just double click that data over here, put it on the same thing.

218
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:26,010
So this is now a view of your data set, right? So you've got you've got way too much data to do anything with by eye.

219
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:31,230
Right. You know, to scroll down and down. But this allows you to at least see what's going on.

220
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:36,720
You could see right here, right here some of these things like shaded and that's missing data.

221
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:47,460
OK, so are properly interpreting where you had missing data and like that shaded is just helping you see that this is missing data values.

222
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,090
And now it's going to run some basic functions on R are on the speaker, so,

223
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:57,330
you know, the first one is so you want to know how many rows and columns there are.

224
00:24:57,330 --> 00:25:03,420
So there's a there's a function called Dinn, which stands for dementia.

225
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:09,210
So I can either know if I want to just run it down there because I feel like I don't need to save it could just run it down there.

226
00:25:09,210 --> 00:25:12,960
So it returns to numbers, the first numbers, the number of rows.

227
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,030
So in my data set in each state is that it's one thousand nine hundred ninety three.

228
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:23,600
So that's how many samples there are. Ten is the number of variables there are.

229
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:30,510
OK, so you could have seen that a couple of places where you're in this view, it's also right here,

230
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:36,030
you know, one thousand nine hundred ninety three entries, ten columns right up here.

231
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,390
It also says if it was a couple of days, I'll say it's good that they're consistent.

232
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:53,890
Right. All right, any questions just make making sense, get a feel for what I was going to do, but I'm telling you,

233
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:59,660
that was the hardest part, getting it installed, finding your file directory and reading it.

234
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,730
And you've got all of that saved now up here.

235
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:08,020
This is easily reproducible. OK, you've gone through that hard part.

236
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,970
Now we're going to get into trying to analyze this code or analyze the state a little bit.

237
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:16,660
So the first thing we're going to start with is the numerical variable of age.

238
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:24,470
Everybody has age in their data set, no matter which one you're looking at. What did I say in class and lecture?

239
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:28,450
What's the first thing we should do? Let's make a picture. Right. Let's see what this data looks like.

240
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:32,860
So we have a numerical variable. A histogram is a good picture to make.

241
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:39,850
So what I want you to do is copy this code right here all the way across.

242
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:55,370
Copy that. Feel free to put it up here in your editor so you can save it and then run.

243
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:02,090
So what happened? You have a picture pop up in the bottom right corner, you had the histogram that you wanted to make.

244
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:04,520
That histogram that you're seeing on the screen might be different.

245
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:13,070
If you're using nutrition or VHS or using that video freak out, whichever one you're using, the the tutorial should have the picture, right.

246
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:18,830
It should match what you're seeing.

247
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:35,310
One thing now, what I want you to do is copy that line of code and now get rid of some of this other stuff so all you have is his data dollar sign.

248
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:46,230
One side. This is a function of what we're doing is we are, we are we are asking are to create a histogram for us.

249
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:52,200
There is a function that exists called hest. OK, how are you supposed to know there's a function called hest?

250
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:56,190
I'm telling you. OK, you just learn about more functions as you start using.

251
00:27:56,190 --> 00:27:59,220
Ah, OK. So you just can't keep track of them as you go.

252
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:05,880
What it needs to run the minimum amount of information it needs to run is a list of numbers that it can create a histogram on.

253
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:09,850
OK, and so that's what I'm sending it right here. So how do I do that.

254
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,480
What's like sort of the syntax for doing it?

255
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:21,930
So I'm saying, look, in the data set called data that's out there, the dollar sign is saying once you're in data, go find this variable.

256
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:29,850
It's one of the columns. So it's that OK and actually has this really nice feature with ah that if you get

257
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:34,110
sort of part of the way and you want to avoid a spelling mistake or you're lazy,

258
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:41,670
you can just hit the tenth feature and it helps you autocomplete. OK, so like here, once I get the RPI, well there's a couple options,

259
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:47,600
but I can look and I could say that I wanted each year and then a lot of completely.

260
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:54,840
But remember there's a lazy build in all these little tricks to to make fewer keystrokes.

261
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,100
But one of the biggest sources of mistakes you can make in coding is spelling errors.

262
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:07,620
OK, you know, you think you get it right. But if you tell it the wrong name, the computer always does exactly what you ask it to do.

263
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:14,070
So if you give it the wrong variable name, it's going to go look for that. It's not going to figure it out.

264
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:25,260
Look, I had entered it'll create a histogram, right, looks exactly the same, a little bit uglier, though, because look at this.

265
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,640
I don't like this, right? I like that they're not turning that in on the lab.

266
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:36,260
It's down here, too. So how do I pretty up these plots? Well, you can add in additional arguments to free them up.

267
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,430
OK, so that's what we did at this previous line with Maine equals histogram of each variable.

268
00:29:41,430 --> 00:29:47,180
X Leape is the X label. OK, so you remember if we ran that it would still be nice.

269
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:53,990
So you can actually go back and look at previous pictures you made using this little arrow right here.

270
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,620
OK, so that's what happened when I ran this code, right? So the plot itself looks the same.

271
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:02,940
But look, now I don't have that like cryptic data dollar sign down here.

272
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,590
I have it. OK, good question that people ask.

273
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:12,020
Well, how was I supposed to know I could do that? And it just becomes you experience.

274
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:17,370
So one of the things you could do that is if you're curious about a function and what its options are,

275
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:26,740
you can do a dollar sign, do the function me hit enter and then you'll have a window pop up.

276
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:38,070
OK, so this help window is set up and try to in order to help you see what kind of options there are for the highest function, which makes histograms.

277
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,980
So these are all the different options that are in there.

278
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:48,680
It's tough to look at it first, but if you keep scrolling down, they start giving a little bit more detailed breakdown of what's going on.

279
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:53,550
OK, so we use the ME and the X label, right.

280
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:57,540
Of the main title in the Axis labels. Lots of different other things you can do.

281
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,030
You can change the limits of the X and Y axis.

282
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:09,720
Using X gives you a little bit more details and then they will often also give you example, usage rights if you like.

283
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:16,020
I kind of make sense, but not exactly. Keep scroll down and you might be able to find some examples in there that you can copy and paste.

284
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:23,580
Right. And you can get an idea from what's going on. OK, do you have a question?

285
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:29,240
OK, good, good. If you're all right, you're stuck.

286
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,640
Another good thing you need to be comfortable doing is using your friend Google.

287
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:42,160
OK, open up the browser, type in put putting your question put in an error message that you're getting.

288
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:46,240
I guarantee you you are not the first person to attach this problem.

289
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,910
There are websites devoted to debugging code in every programing language there is OK.

290
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:58,990
They're often written in such a way that you don't have to be an expert to be able to understand what the solution is.

291
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:06,580
Right. So learn to help yourself, learn to be. You know, it's totally fine to ask, but learn to be self-sufficient, do what you can.

292
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:12,340
It'll speed up your own analysis. Right. And also help you understand things a little bit better.

293
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:20,450
Whenever I'm in the console, when I hit the satellite. So that means you didn't close off your parentheses.

294
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:27,310
OK, so if you go like, for example, this if I take this.

295
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:33,980
So what you can do is, for one, you can either hit escape or if you can close it off if you want.

296
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:40,190
But if you just did this, you also could to escape and at all clean you up, you back, back.

297
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:44,140
Just it's just wanting you to that you need to have parentheses to close it.

298
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,560
That's how hard this is. This is what I need. All right.

299
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,940
So next thing in the tutorial, remember,

300
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:55,240
we set up our histograms when we look at numerical data and the way to look in numerical data is with the box plan.

301
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:00,040
So there's a function called, you guessed it, box plot.

302
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:06,070
So just grab that copy, paste it in there.

303
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:11,860
You should get exactly what you're seeing on the screen.

304
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:17,960
You can do different things with this. You know, there's other options.

305
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,910
One blue box plot. There you go. You can make yourself a blue box, but you want to find out what other features there are for box plots.

306
00:33:24,910 --> 00:33:34,030
Just go look at the features, OK? I will tell you, for the purposes of this class, something like this is fine, OK?

307
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:39,430
You don't need to worry about being super fancy. You can complete the homeworks in the labs with these basic pictures.

308
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:47,020
OK, I encourage you to try to branch out because color is a very important way of presenting information,

309
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:53,620
especially if you've got multi variables in a plot. OK, but for what we're doing, that is totally fine.

310
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:57,700
A pretty good box to work that. All right.

311
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:01,390
So remember what we talked about yesterday in lecture? We talked about pictures are good.

312
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:07,390
Sometimes you need descriptive statistics to be able to describe your data.

313
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:11,500
What was the first one we talked about for numerical data? We talked about the mean function.

314
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:17,580
OK, so what I want you to do is copy that code for me.

315
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:29,320
Copy it. If you want to put it up here, you want to save it.

316
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:37,340
That so, again, I ran it from up here, but the magic happens down here, OK, and it returned me to me.

317
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:44,300
So what is it saying? It's saying the median age is about forty three. Let's look at this box plot.

318
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:50,180
What's this bar represent? This is the median, but this is pretty symmetric.

319
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:54,620
Right. And probably about the same. It's about a forty three percent excise.

320
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,960
So we've got a little bit of extra stuff in here. Right.

321
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:05,240
At the very minimum we show you at the very minimum which you need to pass to the main function is just a set of numbers that worked.

322
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,450
The issue is sometimes you'll have missing data in your set of numbers.

323
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:14,810
Somebody his age didn't get recorded maybe for one of your data sets. That's the case.

324
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:20,510
You can try it when that mean function, when you pass it.

325
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:24,560
That first argument, it's saying I'm just expecting numbers here.

326
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,900
If it's something that's not a number like an any, it's like I don't I can't fairly nail into this.

327
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:36,860
So I'm just going to freak out and I'm going to determine what this is doing in a dot or in and is missing.

328
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,720
What do you think R.M. stands for? Remove it saying just remove the missing values.

329
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:47,630
That's OK. I'm all right with that because, you know, just just get the some of the non missing values, OK?

330
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:51,200
I didn't need it in this situation, but it's good coding practice to keep it there.

331
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,320
I was kind of trying to protect you because sometimes if you're not careful,

332
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,440
you might not notice that there's missing data or is just trying to protect you,

333
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:05,210
that we talk about standard deviation yesterday or I'll compute standard deviation.

334
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:15,620
What's the what's the function for that? It's best to just copy that pasted in the computer for you.

335
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,950
Like, can you make notes. Yeah.

336
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:23,320
So so what you can do up here. It's great question. Thank you.

337
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:30,200
Your editor, you can use a pound sign or hash tag, OK.

338
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:38,510
And you can say I want to compute the mean age.

339
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:43,980
OK, so it's going to be green. That green means that that's just for your eyes.

340
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:47,100
That's just for human eyes are not going to run it at all.

341
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:55,880
OK, so if I take this and I'm going to highlight all of this and I hit run, are you going to ignore that line with the with the pants on?

342
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:02,390
And I'll just run to me. You'll see it showed up here because like like start with the Pouncy, not for me.

343
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:06,680
OK, watch what happens if I remove that Pouncy OK.

344
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:13,190
And I try to run the same piece of code or it's going to be like I don't, I don't know what this means.

345
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,880
That's not for me. It's not computer code. Right. Great question.

346
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:25,040
Right. Right. And comments like this are important to help you when you come back later to understand your code.

347
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:33,440
I think that one of the one of the biggest favors you can do to your future self is to write is to write comments in your code.

348
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,910
You'll be very mad at yourself if you come back later and you're like, what the [INAUDIBLE] was I trying to do here?

349
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:42,260
If I just take in a couple of seconds to comment this, I would have been good.

350
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:49,810
So that's a great question. Thank you.

351
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:58,900
We also talked about the five no summary yesterday, Ardell, compute that for you, OK, so slightly more complicated for output.

352
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:04,750
So I have no summary.

353
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:16,440
I can run that you should. Something like this is problem with this.

354
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:24,380
There's six numbers. What do they throw in extra? The mean right, that's all right.

355
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:28,420
We like the mean, we'll let it join us. OK, so yes, this is pretty.

356
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:33,750
You saw it. So this one, you know, there's there's like nineteen hundred numbers in here.

357
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:38,460
You know, you're not going to answer those one by one in a calculator. Look how easy it is once you get in the car.

358
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,390
I can do this this five. No summer.

359
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:46,770
Remember the quartiles I talked about yesterday said you never have to do it by hand, you never got to do that for you.

360
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:52,080
But now I know with the smallest ages, I know what the largest the ages.

361
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:56,190
I know where the middle 50 percent live.

362
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:59,640
And I know look at this. Forty three and forty three point thirty six.

363
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:05,490
Those are pretty equal. What does that tell you. What is this distribution? Probably symmetric.

364
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:13,020
Right. And we've got this box spot that looks pretty darn special. All right.

365
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:21,790
On the categorical variables. So we have this gender variable.

366
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:30,370
So what did we have to do, the first step is if you remember what it looks like, got a whole bunch of male females down here,

367
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:35,440
we're going make a table of tents where you can see in my coat and actually I've actually put in

368
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:45,040
comments there for you so you can even grab those that you want to put into your your arsenate.

369
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,380
While you're doing this, take a second save save your work, you don't lose it,

370
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:56,560
you'll notice that it went from red to me and went from red to black, just meaning that you're good now you're safe.

371
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:04,820
Once I do something, you don't go back to red. So, you know, it's just just telling you, you have to save this.

372
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:12,340
I this piece of code, it's going to take that that gender variable.

373
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:24,790
And it's going to summarize it for me, as Katz also tells me how many levels there are and only saw two levels in their.

374
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:30,140
The cats are nice, the counts mean that you have to do some kind of work in your head.

375
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:35,290
You've got to do some kind of work in your head to do the comparison here.

376
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:45,890
You know, it's much nicer if I can look at proportions. So what you're going to do right, using this code, you're going to take that table, right?

377
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:52,760
This is the code. You just use this table and then pass that to something called prop that table.

378
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:59,060
So it's expecting a table of cards, but it will complete the proportions for you.

379
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:10,990
So if I look in this, what it's saying is fifty one point six percent of female, forty eight point three percent.

380
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:20,060
So descriptive statistics, I want to make a plot.

381
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:32,270
Categorical data will make a ballpark. As a got closer to shore.

382
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:38,980
So now I've made a bar plot to show them, and I notice I put I put a couple a couple extra features in here.

383
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:44,140
Right. Didn't need all these things in its simplest form.

384
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:51,710
All I needed to pass it bar plot was the table that I created with the count financer up to here.

385
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,450
Here's what I did see.

386
00:41:52,450 --> 00:42:01,580
Here's the problem I had I have parentheses for table, but I did close off the parentheses for Barpak, so I need to close those off.

387
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:08,200
OK, we just got this, you know, not exciting looking, but this is fine.

388
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,230
You can make these things a little bit more exciting looking.

389
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:18,910
You know, if you want to say you want to make both of them orange, you can do it like that.

390
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:28,660
You can always go back to this and you can say, remember that C notation, OK, over here with the red in the blue,

391
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:35,620
C takes things and it sort of puts them together in a list and it's saying, hey, there's going to be two bars because it knows it from over here.

392
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:47,080
I was the first one to be red. I went the second one to be good. So sometimes you to play around a little bit to make this one.

393
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:52,030
All right, so now this piece is a little bit different per lab we're going to look at for me,

394
00:42:52,030 --> 00:43:03,490
this is the dire quality lab some people might have like education or something in your labs.

395
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:13,220
OK. So this made the table, why don't I like this the way it looks?

396
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:19,660
What don't I like about that? It's out of order, right?

397
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:25,190
This is an ordinal variable. OK, we know that things don't go in excellent.

398
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:31,780
They're good for very good order. Right? What order did it put it in? Alphabetical.

399
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:36,640
Right. If you've got nothing else to do, you got a bunch of words and will put them out there in order to get it right.

400
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,500
That's not going to help us. Right. So what we want to do is you want to tell our friends.

401
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,670
So here's here's the corresponding picture. If you looked at. Right. I can't make any sense of this.

402
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:50,450
Right. These things are a lot of water. Right. Let's find you know, the thing is, R just doesn't know this.

403
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:55,150
All in all you to do is write a line of code to tell our hey, that's an ordinal variable.

404
00:43:55,150 --> 00:43:59,560
So there's a function called ordered back and I'm giving you the syntax.

405
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:07,540
You're going to pass it the the variable that you're interested in and then you're going to tell it the level that the orders are,

406
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,840
the order that the levels going right. So poor they good. Very good.

407
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:15,730
Excellent. OK, so I think some of you have like education or something like that.

408
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:21,190
Just take that line of code. Copy it. Run it.

409
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:27,120
And it looks a little weird because there's some like lines hanging over there.

410
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:36,730
Now use your little cheat and type up twice to get back to this table command.

411
00:44:36,730 --> 00:44:46,570
So the fact that table, it'll remake my table. Same numbers, but now they're in the proper order right now.

412
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:50,290
Are says, yeah, OK, you explain this to me. Now I get it.

413
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:55,540
This is an ordered variable. So any time I do something with this, I'm going to keep them in this order.

414
00:44:55,540 --> 00:45:05,510
That includes. Making a barfly.

415
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:11,690
So now when it comes like now, when it makes the bar plot, it sorts them in the proper order, so it makes sense.

416
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:17,810
Now, this is much more interpretable. What's going on? OK, there's a couple of questions.

417
00:45:17,810 --> 00:45:23,990
So you have to do this. Oh, this thing right here.

418
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:30,740
Yes. So all you have to do is go back up and then the underneath it was going by.

419
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:44,000
Yup, yup, yup, yup. The question now is what is the argument.

420
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,250
Oh, this one right here. Yeah, it's a good question. So here's what you could do.

421
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,960
You could do questionmark or plotted to open up the helpage, you could Google it.

422
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:59,480
All this is doing this is changing the font size over here.

423
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:04,400
So actually I ran into a little bit of problem where these got a little bit squished

424
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:12,210
and so I had to just shrink them down a little bit just so they fit nicely, I'm sure.

425
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:20,660
Here, watch this. Makes it bigger.

426
00:46:20,660 --> 00:46:25,250
But what happened here was like, I can't fit very good in here, right.

427
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:30,320
So the default is one and who knows, maybe if I get rid of this, maybe this will work on this one.

428
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:35,600
It worked, right? This is that's a computer specific thing.

429
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:39,170
It kind of depends on your own computer and how things are.

430
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:51,020
Right. When I was making it, I needed that point now for it to fit.

431
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:57,770
All right, so we got one minute left, so I'm going to I'm going to do the last last piece on here, this basic data manipulation.

432
00:46:57,770 --> 00:47:04,010
When you come to lab next time, what's going to happen is there's there's just a little bit left here that needs to be done.

433
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:12,650
I want that you want to look at it on your own. OK, but then there's a set of questions, OK, this is sort of the work part of this lab zero.

434
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:15,980
What we've done to this point and we just copy and paste. Right.

435
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:21,560
Has much better things where these questions are going to ask you to take that code that you'd be copying

436
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,900
and pasting and making little changes to see how to edit the code that you can do something different.

437
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:31,230
So, for example, we've already computed descriptive statistics for age.

438
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:38,420
This is like a computer for BMI. All right. So what, you can use the same function, that same summary function.

439
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,810
Now you just need to think about. OK, how do I change my codes?

440
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:49,430
Instead of passing age? I pass by like, let's end with this this basic renaming variable.

441
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:53,960
So as we said, when you look at these variable means they're kind of hideous.

442
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:58,100
I highly, highly recommend you change them so that it's something that you can remember.

443
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:02,530
It's easier for you when you make plots than those names will show up on the plots.

444
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:05,060
Looks so much nicer.

445
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:16,220
So we're going to use a function called Reaney to rename, which is within that that deployer package, which is part of Tidey versus you download it.

446
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:23,180
So here's what's happening here, bypassing that whole data matrix to the function.

447
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:28,400
And I'm saying I want to rename this grid a year.

448
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:33,980
Just call that thing page. So this yellow part is what my new variable name is like.

449
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:44,170
This would just create if I can just rename by itself, show you what it does.

450
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:49,450
It just sort of does it at the command line, but does it make any changes to my existing data?

451
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:54,520
I want to catch that change. OK, so the way I catch that change is I'm going to say, well,

452
00:48:54,520 --> 00:49:00,250
just just rewrite save it as something called they're essentially just overwrite my existing data.

453
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:08,380
Right. And in it, change that. OK, so let me just grab this whole thing.

454
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:16,880
OK, nothing happened down here, OK, but it's OK if you go up here, you actually have to close this and then reopen it.

455
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:24,000
But if you reopen it, you can see now that hideous name is now replaced with something simple, like eight.

456
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,650
OK, you can do that for all the variables. Right.

457
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:35,950
And I would I would highly encourage you in your R script to do something like that right up at the top.

458
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:44,830
You know, I like to do this. I like to have like this set up in my R script where, you know, I have all my setup steps.

459
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:50,890
Right. And then I'll put a line of comments like this so that I know I'm separating it from my analysis.

460
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:55,990
OK. And so right in here, you know, I'm saying, OK, I'm finding I'm finding my directory.

461
00:49:55,990 --> 00:50:05,650
I'm reading in my data. I'm changing some variable names, you know, and you can you can even change other variable names.

462
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:06,940
You can just do other lines of code.

463
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:12,910
There's some there's more some more like stylistically fancy ways of doing where you could just repeat this line and just,

464
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,680
you know, put a new variable name. Right. So, for example, you could do it like this.

465
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:24,300
You could do the MRI to be like equals.

466
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:32,380
This will be annexed by.

467
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:37,570
If you run that, that will make that change for some reason, this updated it, but it sits right there.

468
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:45,030
So that makes sense because let me show you something.

469
00:50:45,030 --> 00:50:52,120
I know it's inauthentic. Let me show you something real quick so I can see this. I can close out of our studio.

470
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:57,250
I would I would encourage you to not save workspace images because you can get yourself into trouble there.

471
00:50:57,250 --> 00:51:07,930
So I would say don't save. But if I go to this r r zero hour file, I'll double click this.

472
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:13,810
So the first time you do this, your operating system might say, I've never seen a dot half hour before.

473
00:51:13,810 --> 00:51:18,280
What am I supposed to do with this? You know, you just tell it, hey, look, how do I open this type of file?

474
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:22,930
This is what Microsoft asks Windows. My Mac might need something different.

475
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:29,360
I just click our studio and now it knows, boom, it's going to open it up like that.

476
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:34,600
OK. Notice that the icon changed board as well. It became like the little R logo.

477
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:38,140
So it knows. Now here's my here's my file. Right.

478
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:50,970
Here's my R script. Notice this is blank. I lost everything in the console, but all I have to do to get back where I was was highlight this hit run.

479
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,990
But it did all that stuff that we just did, I can hit data.

480
00:51:54,990 --> 00:52:00,840
Look, there's My Age is rename, IBM is renamed and I can get right back into my analysis.

481
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:05,910
I want to see that histogram again. Oh, why did this work?

482
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:16,680
Because we changed the name of histogram, right? We changed it to age. So I would have to change that to that.

483
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:23,250
So, you know, look at look at what's your what's your errors, right, so you might have to go back through and some of the stuff that we did,

484
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:27,450
if you have, you've changed the name of your variable, just updated it.

485
00:52:27,450 --> 00:52:31,760
And it looks like this. So we're a time we're actually over.

486
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,510
So I'm going to stop here and stop recording.

487
00:52:35,510 --> 00:52:38,505
Hopefully this was useful to remember next time and.
