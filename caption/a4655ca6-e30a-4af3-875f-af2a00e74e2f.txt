1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:13,260
I desire to reconnect with you this morning.

2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:28,830
Happy Monday. Everybody had a great weekend. Today we are going to talk about the food and nutrition service.

3
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:39,060
And I'm only going to touch upon it briefly, but it's it's an important agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

4
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:50,970
And we've actually you'll be hearing from Food and nutrition and fitness dietician it's November 7th,

5
00:00:51,300 --> 00:01:01,740
I think should switch from the second to the seventh. She will be visiting us via Zoom and talking more about critical programs at

6
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:08,250
the community level for our nutritionally at risk individuals and communities.

7
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,740
And there's some very key programs through the Food and Nutrition Service.

8
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:27,900
So today the focus is on our Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which is a one of the key assistance programs in this country.

9
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:35,550
But I do want to first just kind of briefly go over the other programs in the U.S.A. Food and Nutrition Service,

10
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:40,680
sort of umbrella with Markle Miller from food gatherers,

11
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:49,500
our food recovery food, our key food recovery organization here in Washington, our Markle will be visiting us on the 19th.

12
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:57,629
She can also fill in some gaps with some of these programs because they're administered, many of them not administered.

13
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:04,470
But food pantries. Food banks often participate in a number of these programs.

14
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:11,370
So Markle can also she'll actually talk about them, too, and share a little bit more insight on that.

15
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:15,060
So we'll revisit some of these topics just as a heads up.

16
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,050
You know, for all of you here in nutritional sciences,

17
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:28,769
it's important that you get comfortable with the agencies and the programs that we

18
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:34,710
have available to help those that are nutritionally vulnerable in communities.

19
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,249
So, you know, we're talking about it today.

20
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:44,610
We may not revisit, but it's something that you all want to make sure you're comfortable and familiar with,

21
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:55,229
and especially for those of you that will be working specifically in community settings and so forth.

22
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:00,600
So just so just a quick overview.

23
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,000
Stephanie Langa will be visiting on Wednesday in person.

24
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,639
She'll be talking about one of our important programs with women, infants and children.

25
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,290
So that's a special supplemental nutrition program for Women, Infants and Children.

26
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,229
A reminder that on the 14th you have the opportunity to turn in a rough draft

27
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:30,990
of your demographic economics section of your community assessment report.

28
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:40,380
It doesn't have to be done. It can be obviously a work in progress, but this is an opportunity to get some feedback.

29
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,820
So ideally, if you could at least get a couple of the indicators, you know,

30
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:51,870
into tables and have some text where you talk about you highlight some of the key findings.

31
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:01,200
And if you also review your instructions, just as a quick aside, make sure you read the instructions for this assignment.

32
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,780
I know they're long, but they're your instructions for the assignment.

33
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:10,860
You should not be following the examples.

34
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,170
There's two examples of a needs assessment.

35
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:21,990
They're great resources for you, but their instructions might have been slightly different, and so you should be following your instructions.

36
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:30,360
Those two examples and of course resources are great for, Oh, how do I write up my findings?

37
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,419
You know, when I get to it, when I have income, how do I discuss it?

38
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:44,040
Well, there's two great examples. How do I discuss or how do I link the nutrition topic or health topic to the indicator or the my findings?

39
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:55,470
This two great examples, you know, that you can use those are great resources, but I don't want you to rely on those as pseudo instructions.

40
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,010
Your instructions are on canvas for that assignment.

41
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:03,920
So. Just a reminder that you can turn in a rough draft for listeners.

42
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,760
Feedback on the 48 reminder there's no class next Monday.

43
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:15,300
We have a very brief fall break. And then on the 19th, Mark Hamill, it will be coming.

44
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:23,220
So again, if you have questions that I can't answer today regarding any of the fitness programs or SNAP,

45
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,640
Markelle is a great resource, so write them down.

46
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,010
Last year, a couple of students had some very specific administrative questions about these programs,

47
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:38,190
which I've never administered, so I didn't know that she wrote them down and Merkel was able to answer them readily.

48
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:42,360
So just jot them down and bring your notes on the 19th.

49
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,990
Any questions about what I covered so far?

50
00:05:53,280 --> 00:06:05,190
This was a posting that came through on my email of a research project that was done here at the university,

51
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:14,129
and I thought it was very appropriate to highlight since we had just been discussing food

52
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:24,810
insecurity and this is a paper or a study that was surveying older adults and not surprisingly,

53
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,360
you know, with inflation and so forth,

54
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:36,510
three quarters of people over 50 in the United States said the rising cost of groceries have affected them somewhat or a lot.

55
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,940
And nearly a third said they're eating less healthy because of increased food costs.

56
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:49,379
And, you know, here we have the director of the project, a physician at Michigan Medicine,

57
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:55,290
saying, you know, our one of our most vulnerable populations in a community is our older adults.

58
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,860
They're usually on fixed incomes, most of them, if not all.

59
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,360
And inflationary costs of a rise, increase in inflation, food prices, you know,

60
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:12,870
it's going to impact so relevant for this course and relevant for us to be thinking about.

61
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:22,980
We'll be talking more about organizations that are that we have to help older adults and that will come later in the semester.

62
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,680
But I just wanted to call your attention as a link if you're interested in reading more about the study.

63
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:40,900
Okay. So the key point for this is for you to, one, understand a little bit about the USDA, the structure.

64
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,650
I'm going to show you an organizational chart,

65
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:51,910
but it's important to understand the different programs through the Food and Nutrition Service Agency as well.

66
00:07:51,910 --> 00:08:00,220
And then we're going to spend we're going to focus the rest of the class on SNAP, our Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.

67
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:11,380
So, you know, this is one of those slides where you just want to cross your eyes because there's just so much information here.

68
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:20,770
But but it's important for all of you as professionals to know what goes on in the USDA.

69
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:32,380
So at the very bottom here and I don't know how well you can see it, but we have a number of undersecretaries,

70
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:44,320
everything from farm production and conservation and the agencies involved to the undersecretary for Food, Nutrition and Services, F.A.

71
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:51,610
Right here, we have food safety, which Jen Nord will be talking a little bit about.

72
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:59,320
And then we have some regulatory agencies. We have those, the Forest Service, so our natural resources and environment.

73
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:03,909
So this is rural development over here.

74
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,330
Undersecretary for research, education and Economics.

75
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,080
We have the economic research service here at the bottom, the IRS.

76
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:18,010
That's the agency that's involved in assessing food security in the United States.

77
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:27,490
Okay. So some of these agencies are by the end of this class, you will be familiar with some of these agencies.

78
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:35,470
And again, if you're going to be working in the United States, especially if you're working in any kind of community setting, it's important.

79
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:42,580
Well, any kind of setting, it's important for you to know the different departments and their various agencies do.

80
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:47,380
So we're going to focus today on food and nutrition service.

81
00:09:52,340 --> 00:10:02,120
So broadly speaking, the role of finance is to increase food security and reduce hunger.

82
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:09,490
Also improve health, the intake of foods and education.

83
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:18,820
And we have 15 different programs that fall under this mission.

84
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:27,190
And. So does anybody can agree, think off the top of their head what those programs are.

85
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,950
I mean, we've already talked about one.

86
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:40,750
So our Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, is one of those small lunch programs like School Lunch Program and Work.

87
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,760
Some of the others are a bit more obscure, but you do need to be aware of them.

88
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:57,020
Yeah, I'm. I'm thinking how fresh, but I don't know.

89
00:10:57,020 --> 00:11:03,740
That's like California where they're like assistant for receiving, like, produce.

90
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:12,260
Yes. So that actually so would have to go back and look how fresh may be administered through one of these programs,

91
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,560
or it might be its own nonprofit organization.

92
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,930
My guess is, even if it is if it partners with one of the or at least one or two in these.

93
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:36,290
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm going to start with over on the far right.

94
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:42,560
So on the far right is our special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children.

95
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:53,510
It's a mouthful, and we tend to refer to it as women, infants and children going, okay, this is a well, first of all,

96
00:11:53,510 --> 00:12:06,620
it's a phenomenal program, but it's also a very critical program for providing nutritional support and in some respects,

97
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:18,640
help support for women, low income women who are pregnant, postpartum or breastfeeding, as well as infants and children up to five years of age.

98
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,670
And so it provides nutritional support.

99
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:34,280
It provides supplemental food to supplement their diet, provides education, it provides health care referrals and so forth.

100
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:45,169
So it is a critical, critical program in communities for women and children, specifically women who are pregnant.

101
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:48,500
Postpartum and breastfeeding also provides breastfeeding support.

102
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:55,430
So Stephanie on Wednesday is going to be talking about the program.

103
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:59,330
She's a dietician with one of the programs outside of Detroit.

104
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:11,390
And so she's going to come in and talk about way over here on the far left is the farmer's market nutrition program and that is associated with work.

105
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:18,680
So this is a program that provides coupons for women or for weight participants.

106
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:26,690
So caregivers, if there's children or if it's women who are, again, pregnant, postpartum or breastfeeding,

107
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:34,520
they can receive coupons to use at the farmer's market to increase their fresh produce intake in their diet.

108
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,620
The Seniors Farmers Market is also administered sort of under the same umbrella.

109
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:48,210
And this is for our seniors to increase their fresh produce intake.

110
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,070
They, too, can receive coupons to use at farmers markets.

111
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:55,330
So.

112
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:10,110
And these are some of the programs that maybe folks aren't quite as familiar with unless you work for a food bank or a food pantry or food recovery.

113
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:14,340
You may not be as familiar. So I'm just going to go over these briefly.

114
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:21,700
Each of these programs, if you go into. Food Nutrition Service link.

115
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:29,710
There will be a tab at the top that says programs. If you select programs, you can then access fact sheets.

116
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:32,799
And there are really nice overviews of each of these programs.

117
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:39,940
So I highly recommend, you know, that you just get familiar with the programs, ah, and so forth.

118
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:53,410
But briefly, the food distribution program in Native American communities is basically they provide food commodities to indigenous communities.

119
00:14:54,430 --> 00:15:04,930
It's provided once a month and it comes in the form of the food package and again, it's just to supplement their dietary intake.

120
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:14,979
One thing that I want to highlight about this, one of the criticisms, so when I was working in Native American communities,

121
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:23,950
there was a lot of criticism that these foods were just not foods that indigenous consume, you know, consumers eat.

122
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:29,950
You know, I remember one woman saying, you know, we get these big jars of peanut butter.

123
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:33,850
Well, my kids will eat it, but I don't like peanut butter.

124
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:43,510
It's peanut butter. It's not something that part of their meal or eating habits.

125
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:54,130
So one thing that's really improved is they are now they are they now carry indigenous or culturally relevant foods.

126
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:00,940
They carry bison blue cornmeal, which is blue cornmeal meal.

127
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:12,250
It's the one of the key grains for especially communities in the southwest, for communities along the Pacific area.

128
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:20,950
They have salmon for those communities that cultivate or harvest wild rice.

129
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:34,210
They carry wild rice as well. So they are carrying foods that are consumed by indigenous communities to supplement those commodity foods and so forth.

130
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:41,260
So that's an improvement in this program. How has this program interacted with the nutrition program?

131
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,650
I don't know, because with it being administered through the USDA, I don't know.

132
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:50,740
But I know what you're talking about and it's possible.

133
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,600
And it may be that they have interfaced somehow with the USDA.

134
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:03,910
Typically what happens is these are administered so that the food is available,

135
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:13,090
but it's actually administered and distributed by local agencies like local tribal organizations and agencies.

136
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:18,190
And so it's possible. But those organizations, agencies are partnering.

137
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,120
Yeah. Okay.

138
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,410
The next to it is the Commodity Supplemental Food Program.

139
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:31,720
This is actually very similar, except it's for older adults in the community.

140
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:35,170
And so they can receive a food package once a month.

141
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:43,690
Typically, it is administered through food pantries or food banks or the Agency for Aging.

142
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,680
And that's a question I will have to ask.

143
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:56,560
MARKEL Like in Washtenaw County, how is the Commodity Supplemental Food Program administered for our older adults?

144
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:12,880
Because I'm not sure the Emergency Food Assistance Program or TI Farm is one of the key programs for, again, providing USDA foods produce.

145
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:19,090
They purchase foods from farmers and other distributors and it's distributed to

146
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:24,640
the states and typically it goes to some of the key food banks and so forth,

147
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:29,290
for then further distribution of smaller food pantries and so forth.

148
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:38,830
So it plays an important role in providing food to the food banks that then can distribute it through the food pantries.

149
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:47,710
And this is another one that I'll have Michael elaborate a little bit more on in terms of how this administration and so forth.

150
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:57,610
And then again, as Nicole had mentioned this, the programs in the schools, which I have highlighted here,

151
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:04,599
the school lunch program, the school breakfast program, we also have a summer food service program.

152
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:12,280
For those of you who attended the poster session last week, two weeks ago, when was it?

153
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:16,420
Friday. Now it's two weeks ago. Are you ready to go?

154
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:24,710
We had some students or. One student I saw participated in the summer food service program.

155
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,750
Food gatherers administers them.

156
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:39,620
And then there's also child and adult care food programs, that is for child daycare centers that participate with this program.

157
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,299
And there's also for older adult adult care centers that participate.

158
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:51,080
And so they get reimbursed if they are providing healthy meals and snacks at these centers.

159
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,389
But we have some it coming from food and nutrition services.

160
00:19:56,390 --> 00:20:02,180
Who's going to spend more time talking about school lunch program and these programs in November?

161
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,960
We'll revisit this a little later.

162
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:14,720
This is a nice resource from Feeding America that just highlights some of the programs.

163
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,490
I can't remember if there's more to this table that I just truncated you, David,

164
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:24,830
but it just does a nice job of just providing an overview of some of the key programs.

165
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:30,470
It's, you know, who the target population is.

166
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:38,270
Does it supply foods to the food banks for further distribution and so forth?

167
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:44,000
So it's just another way to review this information.

168
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:55,030
I think that's yeah, that's all I have for those programs. Any questions you can see for some of these programs,

169
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,129
it's much more evident if you're working in a food bank or a food pantry or for one of the agencies,

170
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:06,530
like if you're working for the Agency for Aging, you will be working with some of these.

171
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:13,310
And it's again, it's all that sort of administrative. But we can have Markel kind of touch upon some of those programs when she comes in.

172
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:29,790
Okay. So today the rest of the class I want to focus on snap as well as Snap Ed and that we'll talk about at the very end.

173
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:37,469
So Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP was formerly known as food stamps.

174
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:42,120
And it's our largest nutrition assistance program in the United States.

175
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:48,720
And its sole purpose is to reduce food insecurity.

176
00:21:49,380 --> 00:22:01,080
Right. I mean, obviously, we want to improve healthy food intake, but first and foremost, it's to reduce food insecurity.

177
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:06,300
And it's federally funded through the farm bill, which the farm bill is.

178
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:18,660
Updated. In a word, I wanted this thing in every five years we redo our farm bill.

179
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:23,249
Some very interesting way of saying it, but that's essentially what it is.

180
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:29,880
It's every five years their farm bill is addressed, updated and so forth.

181
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:36,380
Just to give you an idea, our farm bill supports agriculture and food policy.

182
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:46,860
But if you look at the pie chart, over three quarters of it is for nutrition programs, specifically SNAP.

183
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:52,890
But it also includes those other programs that I just touched upon in those previous slides.

184
00:22:53,250 --> 00:23:04,050
So it provides funding for farm, it provides funding for money for the foods for indigenous communities as well as our older population.

185
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:10,890
So but that brownish rust area, that's three quarters of the pie.

186
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:26,700
Most of that is funding for SNAP. For those of you not familiar with the farm bill and just how, you know,

187
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:35,340
it gets into a little bit more detail at the very bottom of your campus page today under optional reagent read readings at the very bottom,

188
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:40,140
there's a primer on the farm bill and funding for nutritional programs.

189
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:45,480
So it's a nice little resource for those of you that want to look into that a little bit more.

190
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:58,260
Okay. So as we could assume right now helps the most at risk, nutritionally at risk individuals in our community.

191
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:07,110
So two thirds of folks that receive SNAP are children, seniors or people living with disabilities.

192
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,380
And SNAP is intended to supplement.

193
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:29,970
Their food dollars. One of the other aspects of SNAP that a lot of people don't realize is that it also supports local economy,

194
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:42,420
businesses and farmers because SNAP is distributed as money on an eBay card, basically like a little credit card, but it's a food cart.

195
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:53,490
And so SNAP users or SNAP participants will be using their cards in some type of retail setting to purchase produce.

196
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,680
And it may be produce from a local farmer, but you're supporting the local economy.

197
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:03,420
And so SNAP actually contributes quite a bit to the local economy.

198
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:11,490
But they say here every $1 and snap benefits helps generate a dollar 50 to 180 in economic activity in a community.

199
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:26,010
So again, it provides monthly benefits to eligible individuals using a debit card, just like a little credit card or vagrant card.

200
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:28,500
And they can use that to purchase grocery stores.

201
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:39,750
And there's about there just slightly less than 250,000 retailers across the country that will accept debit cards.

202
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:52,980
And that ranges from small convenience stores to very large retailers like Walmart, so that some of the big,

203
00:25:53,970 --> 00:26:07,020
really big retailers benefits can only be used to purchase food and specifically so it can be used to purchase alcohol, tobacco.

204
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:15,750
It cannot be used to purchase pet food. It cannot be used to purchase vitamins and supplements and other personal care products.

205
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:25,530
So there's no restrictions on what they can buy with the exception of this.

206
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:36,060
Now, there's one other exception is that they can't buy hot foods that are prepared in a retail setting,

207
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:45,060
like if you were to buy a rotisserie chicken at a supermarket or if you were to buy something that was prepared by the supermarket.

208
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:52,830
And that has to do with food safety. But they can purchase any other food.

209
00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:10,069
At the grocery store. It used to be that with some research awhile ago that there was concern that there was a lot of foods being

210
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:18,670
purchased at convenience stores and the concerns that for purchasing at small convenience stores is what I thought.

211
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:27,600
Yeah, unhealthy. A lot of convenience stores don't carry fresh produce and fresh produce, or they may carry only a little bit like apples and bananas.

212
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,700
You know, there's not a lot of fresh greens and things like that.

213
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:38,000
But this study came out not that long ago that actually demonstrates, as you can see,

214
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:45,980
that SNAP participants are using their FBT benefits at superstores and large supermarkets.

215
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:55,440
Which the significance of that is that they had more food choices at large retail places.

216
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,140
So that's important. One area that we do need to work on is our farmers markets.

217
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:08,430
Right. The convenience store is light blue.

218
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,950
So it's that. Right one right next to the dark blue.

219
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:15,930
So, I mean, there is a percentage convenience stores is about 6%.

220
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,500
But I was actually pleased to see that.

221
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:30,450
That just hopefully means that they're having greater access to these bigger stores with more food choices and so forth.

222
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:51,270
And this is just showing what I like about this is that if you look at so these are the different types of stores that you can purchase your food at.

223
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:55,920
And over here in this first column, it's the percent of all stores.

224
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:11,430
And so what store has is the highest percentage out of all stores in this column right here on grocery stores and convenience stores.

225
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:18,120
So convenience are actually the largest. So out of all stores, convenience stores have the highest percentage.

226
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:29,280
And yet the percent, 2% percent of redemptions is actually supermarkets and superstores.

227
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:36,389
So now it looks like there's a declining trend of using cards at convenience stores.

228
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:41,880
And that's that's a great trend. So.

229
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:56,140
Okay, so how does it work and how much do SNAP participants receive?

230
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:02,680
So on average, the benefit per person is roughly $121 per month.

231
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:08,170
I'm giving you the the data from last year.

232
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:16,270
I didn't updated, but it will be increased this year and increases every year because of inflation.

233
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:25,840
But I also wanted to highlight that in addition to increasing it for inflation, we had a significant increase last year.

234
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:34,300
It went from 121 to 157 because there was an increase in the Thrifty Food Plan.

235
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,790
The TFP Does anybody know? TFP Is anybody heard of the Thrifty Food Plan?

236
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:55,389
Now that's the basis for how the amount of money is set based on it's basically

237
00:30:55,390 --> 00:31:03,130
mathematical modeling of how much does it cost based on current food prices,

238
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:11,060
based on nutrient requirements, based on current dietary guidelines, the drugs and so forth.

239
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:17,450
How much does it cost to prepare those foods for three healthy meals or three,

240
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:22,570
you know, to meet the nutrient requirements, energy requirements in a given day?

241
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:27,220
That's the thrifty food plan.

242
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,910
What's what was concerning about this specific food thrifty food plan?

243
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:39,430
So again, the amount of SNAP assistance per person per day is based on this TFP.

244
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:51,070
It was established in 1975, this sort of mathematical approach using a 1962 economic food plan,

245
00:31:51,520 --> 00:32:02,530
and all they did at that time was adjusted for inflation. It was never adjusted again for 60 years, which is so problematic.

246
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:17,590
I mean, it was just so finally, finally in the last farm bill, legislators finally got that fixed so that it got updated.

247
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,370
And now it has to be reviewed every five years.

248
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:27,850
The Thrifty Food Plan. So every time they redo the farm bill, that has to be updated.

249
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:37,629
So again, the the food plan is again designed to provide a nutritionally adequate diet consistent with the dietary guidelines,

250
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:48,670
consistent with the drives, assuming that folks can buy food at lower prices.

251
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,370
And the other assumption that's problematic since assuming they're cooking from scratch.

252
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:59,700
So that's one of the negatives downsides of this.

253
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:10,090
TFP and critics and researchers and so forth are concerned because we know today it's difficult for families.

254
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:16,960
Many families, the adult caretakers are both working if there's two or maybe there's only one caretaker.

255
00:33:19,210 --> 00:33:26,800
Many of them are working. And so to assume that one can come from scratch is an assumption that is, I think,

256
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,420
a really serious barrier, and I hope that gets addressed in the next iteration.

257
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:37,420
But again, it's just based on modeling food prices, nutrition, content of food and so forth.

258
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,840
The question for eligibility and equity per person households.

259
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:46,980
If you have mothers with young children.

260
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,760
Are they covered under way in an outright snap or in is there no they can count?

261
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:59,530
So it's dependent on income. Okay. Yeah. So you can have coverage under a wink and then someone also counts as follows.

262
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:07,090
Yeah. Yeah. The with wink and snap.

263
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:10,360
The eligibility criteria differs.

264
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:21,410
So you might have someone who's on weight doesn't qualify for SNAP, but you certainly could have women who qualify for both.

265
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:21,760
Yeah.

266
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:33,460
And the reason for bringing up the thrifty food plan is that this is this is the basis for how they set the cost per person or the money per person.

267
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:47,290
And just to give you an idea of how much. So it increased about 21% going from what was developed 19 in 1975 to the newest iteration.

268
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,990
And so it increased the amount to about $36 per person.

269
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:59,440
So again, we finally had an update.

270
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:04,720
And again, it has to be checked and now we have to review it every five years.

271
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,340
Any changes to the benefits based on location?

272
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:19,540
So there are different benefits differ depending on sort of at the macro level,

273
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:26,440
like whether you live in Alaska or one of the territories where food prices may be higher.

274
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,760
There are adjustments for those. Yeah. Yeah.

275
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,870
There aren't adjustments for like living in the rural area versus urban area.

276
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:42,880
Okay. Yeah. What was the final push to adjust for inflation?

277
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:50,170
Like it hadn't been done for so long. What was the final push from lawmakers to actually make the change?

278
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:59,920
Well, this is something that that nutrition professionals, health professionals have been advocating.

279
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:04,330
They finally got the ears of the legislators to finally do something.

280
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:12,430
Now, I don't know that there probably was an increase for some inflation, but there was just nothing.

281
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,760
We never updated it from the 1960.

282
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:26,380
Other than inflationary adjustments. And we know that there's a big difference between what was consumed in the 1960s versus today.

283
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:34,010
So yeah. Okay.

284
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,790
So to be eligible for SNAP, it's based on income.

285
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:45,770
And so this is a very sort of brief overview of it.

286
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:50,870
And basically they look at your growth and your interest in general.

287
00:36:50,870 --> 00:37:05,870
They look at an individual's gross, gross monthly income and it has to be at or below 130% of the poverty line they take into account deductions.

288
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:13,530
So a person, if you're just looking at their gross income, it may look pretty good to you.

289
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:19,940
Not great. But but then you have to take into account that not all money is going to be spent on food.

290
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,270
So the program takes into account deductions.

291
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:31,280
So deductions for housing, deductions for utilities, deductions for child care, deductions for medical care.

292
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:42,950
So they take into account where money is required in other aspects of their financial situation and then they derive the net income.

293
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:50,390
And so the guidelines, the eligibility is based on gross dependent on deductions and then net income.

294
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,019
So it's it's actually it does require, as you can imagine,

295
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:07,809
a fair amount of paperwork from these from families and households, which is why it can be a bit of a challenge and barrier.

296
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:14,230
And and there's been a lot of work over the last 5 to 8 years improving access

297
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:19,030
to SNAP by reducing the burdens of doing all the paperwork and so forth.

298
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,430
It also requires 20 hours per week work requirements.

299
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:28,900
So able bodied adults. They're called this ABA?

300
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:36,460
Yes. So these are able bodied adults between the ages of 18 and 50 years of age without dependents.

301
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:45,310
They're limited to only three months of benefits per three year period unless they're working at least 20 hours per week.

302
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:51,190
So benefits would be provided for folks that are working 20 hours or more,

303
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:58,600
but just still aren't able to provide enough income to support adequate money for food.

304
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:07,780
There are exemptions for this work requirement, and that's individuals with children, pregnant women and individuals living with disabilities.

305
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:18,950
So there are exceptions to the work requirement. This just gives you an idea of the monthly benefits based on the size of the household.

306
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:21,319
So in the far column here,

307
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:30,650
we have the household size number of individuals living within the household six middle column is the maximum monthly benefit.

308
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:38,120
This was just fiscal year 2022 and then this is the average monthly.

309
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:48,350
So again, the amount of household receives is dependent on their income, the number of deductions, what their net income ends up being and so forth.

310
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:58,390
The fiscal period runs from October 1st through September 30th.

311
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:09,010
So the table, you're saying, ended as of September 30th, 2022, and now there's a new table for October 1st, 2022.

312
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,310
For the next year. I'm showing you last year just so that you can see the inflationary increase.

313
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:27,890
So for a family of four, the maximum amount when it went from.

314
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:43,180
So for a family of four, the maximum amount is $835 there in the middle column for a family or a household of four, it's $835.

315
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:48,460
The next fiscal period coming up, it's now $939.

316
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:55,480
So it went up almost $100 for a family of four or household of four.

317
00:40:55,870 --> 00:41:05,140
And so there is inflationary increases or inflation increases, which is really important with the way food costs have increased.

318
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:20,799
And I also want to just point out, during COVID, family or family, households often receive the maximum amounts irrespective of their I mean,

319
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,190
they were eligible for SNAP, but if you are eligible,

320
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:31,960
many of them receive the maximum amount during COVID during the pandemic and in some cases support beyond that.

321
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:44,370
Okay. Any questions so far? Now we have examples of what that buys.

322
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:52,530
I mean, I have a family of two and like two adults over lunch that buy occasionally and I spend 400 hours in the Persian.

323
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,350
What does that look like? Yeah.

324
00:41:56,410 --> 00:42:05,590
So, you know, there's a there's a number of if you do any kind of qualitative study where you do surveys and focus groups and stuff,

325
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:13,680
folks often run out of their SNAP benefits by, you know, middle of the picture field.

326
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:26,710
Teenagers are going together. So you can see how it's really critical to use this these funds for nutrient dense foods.

327
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:32,620
But you can also understand when they say they can stretch their dollars a little bit more because unfortunately,

328
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:35,709
healthier foods, especially produce, can be more expensive.

329
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:40,960
Sometimes it ends up being more calorie dense foods that are cheaper.

330
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:51,320
So. Yeah. We're going to circle back to that only type of snippet.

331
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:57,950
So I just wanted to highlight a food purchasing pilot program that was started.

332
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,930
It was initiated in the 2014 Farm Bill.

333
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:11,990
They wanted to examine the feasibility of utilizing online food purchasing so you can

334
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:18,290
purchase your food over Amazon or you can order your food through a grocery store.

335
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:28,130
And the purpose of the program was to increase food access to folks that perhaps live where there's

336
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:34,280
food deserts or maybe in a rural area where they can't or they have a lack of transportation.

337
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:42,380
So it was test piloted. And this is just sort of an overview of the the piloting that had occurred.

338
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:49,310
There are now 47 states. In fact, I would be surprised now if not all states are involved.

339
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,959
Michigan retailers are all day Walmart and Amazon.

340
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:58,250
Although I suspect there's more retailers just I looked on.

341
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:09,410
I did a Google search event of the online piloting program and Massachusetts is adding two more supermarkets, well-known supermarkets to the program.

342
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:15,140
And that was just two days ago. So states are still ramping up this program.

343
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:26,300
So it's available to SNAP participants, but it does not cover the cost of delivery nor memberships.

344
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:34,910
And some of these online food delivery programs require memberships and so forth.

345
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:38,530
So I don't know if any of you had a chance to read.

346
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:48,290
There were a couple articles about this online piloting program or this online food district for food purchasing program.

347
00:44:48,950 --> 00:44:58,280
But even if you didn't get a chance to read, what are some of the concerns, equity concerns, barriers with a program like this?

348
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:07,900
I mean, I mentioned it already, right, that SNAP benefits don't cover the cost of delivery or the memberships if there's a membership requirement,

349
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:12,710
but other issues might be problematic. Oh, go ahead, Mark.

350
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:17,510
Yeah, I would say like hours of operation, especially in an apartment building.

351
00:45:18,490 --> 00:45:25,570
I mean, if you don't get home from work until like 9 p.m., you're not to have your food delivered and sit out all day.

352
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:31,120
And so, like the times are, I mean, grocery stores can close at like 830.

353
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:35,240
So that's a big barrier to food delivery.

354
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:39,050
Right. Yeah. Well, I appreciate that.

355
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:43,070
Transportation could be an issue if having to deliver it is fantastic.

356
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:49,520
I feel like if Amazon and Walmart Target were really altruistic about providing this service,

357
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:59,630
they would waive delivery fees and membership costs, which i, i really the government needs to get more money is just hanging on.

358
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,890
Yeah. It's just another facet and it just yeah.

359
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:06,740
That part bothers me as they have access to healthcare foods.

360
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:11,640
Online prices are good because they're buying in mass organizations.

361
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:18,220
Yeah, but there's a problem with some of those articles, right?

362
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:30,770
Yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking of like having the technology or the ability to use it, you know, like for older adults, I'm just thinking,

363
00:46:30,770 --> 00:46:37,520
like my grandma, like my grandparents, like they would be setting up an online account or something.

364
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:41,270
So thinking of like what demographic can use it, you know?

365
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:45,650
Yeah. What else?

366
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,719
Well, certain communities, like, just said you're trying to bring people.

367
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:57,560
I mean, I think less than 40% population, even as I mean, I know like rocket mortgage and stuff are doing things about how much broadband is downtown.

368
00:46:57,560 --> 00:47:03,980
But there's a lot of communities back to the technology use it don't have access to be able to do something online.

369
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:11,210
Yeah. And I think there was a survey that was highlighted in one of the articles that was like 31% don't have reliable Internet.

370
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:16,490
Yeah, but it's also with the individual to actually take a healthy choice.

371
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:22,820
If you're like an online shop and you're instinctual and whatever you like or you're creeping at that moment is probably what you were saying in part.

372
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:28,760
So to kind of actually meal plan and prioritize your health is also really smart and convenient.

373
00:47:29,810 --> 00:47:35,480
Now what's interesting in community and in consumer surveys, sometimes that actually can go either way.

374
00:47:35,690 --> 00:47:38,629
So some folks have said that when they go in the grocery store,

375
00:47:38,630 --> 00:47:47,780
sometimes they end up buying more than they would have because they see or they smell and they end up purchasing things they might not have.

376
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,310
So. That's one advantage to an online and you go in and you just get what you want.

377
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:58,040
But to your point, the problem with online is then there's marketing.

378
00:47:59,070 --> 00:48:05,719
There's apparently targeted marketing of folks that, you know, you know, that love ads for various foods.

379
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,850
And a lot of those foods are ultra processed sugar containing beverages.

380
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:16,170
So it could go either way, but you can see how either way it might be.

381
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:23,240
It just depends on the person. Right. Which which influence would be more pervasive for them?

382
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:29,719
Yeah. I mean, yeah. I would also say, like in terms of food delivery, its safety aspect,

383
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:39,110
you just think of like the single mother in like downtown Chicago trying to go out to her neighborhood or at night just to grab food from someone.

384
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:43,910
Dropping it off is another safety concern. Just the backgrounds of all that.

385
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:54,600
Yeah. One thing they did highlight as an option is that, you know, that especially for some grocery stores where they will,

386
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,710
you know, you can order the food online, but you can come by and pick it up free of charge.

387
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:11,010
Right. And so that's great. But again, just you've got a whole set of population that does not have easy transportation or maybe

388
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:15,319
they have to take groceries on a bus and whether or not that's feasible and so forth.

389
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:20,150
So yeah, those are important points. Also, I think like in the pandemic, this was doubly true.

390
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:25,410
Like if you don't have a grocery store that does delivery in your area, then there is no delivery.

391
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,600
So it's only available to people who probably have access to a grocery store if they could get there.

392
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,579
And you can certainly understand how this would have been helpful during the pandemic if especially during that period where we had the Delta variant,

393
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,350
which was really very concerning.

394
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:47,429
I mean, you know, high mortality rate and folks didn't just didn't want to go to the store.

395
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:56,909
And so they might have used this. But the fact that it's still and still seems to be ramping up and continuing and I as you all are pointing out,

396
00:49:56,910 --> 00:50:09,780
I feel that some of these companies need to step up and maybe the USDA and provide some of these services free of charge to to help folks.

397
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:16,049
Go ahead. I do have a little side note like my undergraduate university.

398
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:20,970
So I was on the student government and during the pandemic because a lot of students

399
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:26,850
didn't have access to cards and our surrounding community was in two nations,

400
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:35,489
but our college was we did like fund ship memberships so that like all students deliver

401
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:40,110
and it's like was so successful that it was able to continue on like past pandemics,

402
00:50:40,110 --> 00:50:48,749
like it still is, and it's a private university, but still like it was, it definitely showed a big difference of like with using it like access.

403
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:55,230
We have a lot of international students and so like that access for them was super important as well.

404
00:50:56,320 --> 00:51:00,600
That's, that's a great example. One of the successful approach, right?

405
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:06,300
Yeah. What might be some unintended consequences of this program in communities?

406
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,760
Just think about retailers.

407
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:32,500
It takes away from local retailers at the same time among the general population at that you don't actually have to get up out of

408
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:43,290
your chair and go to just is comforting unhealthy to come to the house and you aren't going to do it so I want a healthy lifestyle.

409
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:52,050
So that's that's one of the potential unintended consequences.

410
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:55,180
It's just that will impact local businesses.

411
00:51:55,630 --> 00:52:03,670
You know, some of the smaller grocery stores and, you know, other establishments in the community,

412
00:52:03,670 --> 00:52:10,380
if people are well, I'm sure we already have seen that anyway with our big box stores and so forth.

413
00:52:10,430 --> 00:52:18,280
Like I say, farmer's markets in particular as well, just given if I combine my produce online as opposed to walk in.

414
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:23,170
And that's a good point because these tools are already in place.

415
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:30,580
Yeah, yeah. It'll be interesting to see how this evolves.

416
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:37,960
But I wanted to I thought it was just is an interesting program that is associated with SNAP and.

417
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:46,390
Highlighted in terms of this snap work.

418
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,210
Generally speaking, overall research demonstrates that it improves food security.

419
00:52:55,840 --> 00:53:07,220
Generally speaking, in most research, households typically experience that are SNAP participants.

420
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:16,540
They generally see a decrease in food insecurity and so forth.

421
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:22,360
Households that experience snap reduction or cut are an increased risk of food security.

422
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:28,810
So sort of looking at it from the flip side, as opposed to those households that were consistent SNAP users.

423
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:36,070
And there is studies that have shown that if they look at the food security of a household,

424
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:45,910
just as they start snap and then they look at the food security, six months later, food security has improved usually across the board.

425
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:50,620
So, again, it does seem to improve food security.

426
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:56,080
The issue, the concern is that that quality is still a problem.

427
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:04,750
The concern this is a study that came out 2021.

428
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:10,360
And here in this figure on the Y axis, we have the total score.

429
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:14,290
Have you guys learned about the healthy eating index in some of your other classes?

430
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,330
Seeing head nodding yes. No. Okay.

431
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:25,360
I'll go over it really quickly. So those of you have have learned it.

432
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:36,310
Bear with me. So the healthy eating index is a way to assess or evaluate dietary intake in terms of diet quality.

433
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:44,950
So if we want to evaluate dietary intake, we can assess relative to the DRI, right?

434
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:51,140
We can say we want to know the prevalence of inadequacy in terms of nutrient intake and so forth.

435
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:57,130
So that's one way to assess dietary intake. Another way is to assess the quality of food consumed.

436
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:10,990
We have a number of indices indexes. This one healthy eating index is used quite a bit, and it's a way to determine if the diet is of high quality.

437
00:55:11,110 --> 00:55:17,910
And you can see it's based on food groups, not nutrients per say.

438
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:29,920
For the most part, there's a few nutrients, but total fruits includes both whole fruits plus fruit juice, vegetables, whole grains.

439
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,220
Dairy consumption includes cheese, yogurt.

440
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:40,270
That actually also includes soy beverage, total protein foods, seafoods and so forth.

441
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,700
And each food group has a maximum point.

442
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:50,350
And over here, it shows how what the standard is for a maximum score.

443
00:55:51,610 --> 00:56:01,900
So for each of these food groups, the maximum score is going to be consuming X amount of servings of whole fruit vegetables.

444
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:09,360
Dairy. And again, it's all these equivalents or serving equivalents.

445
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:13,320
Over on the right is the standard for.

446
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,580
Minimum score or basically zero.

447
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:25,589
So if you're not consuming whole food fruit,

448
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:30,870
if you're not consuming whole grains and you're consuming more refined grains, you're going to get a lower score.

449
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:36,290
These foods down here are the foods that we want in moderation.

450
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:40,260
So with the maximum score, we want to be consuming less.

451
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:45,060
So if somebody has a low sodium diet, they're going to get the maximum score.

452
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,960
If they have a high sodium diet, they're going to be have a low score of zero.

453
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:54,750
So the upshot is, is the possible total possible points is 100.

454
00:56:55,050 --> 00:56:59,130
The higher the score, the healthier your diet, the higher quality.

455
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:02,960
Okay. So that's using the healthy eating index.

456
00:57:02,970 --> 00:57:07,860
So this study used the healthy eating index. This was using Heinz.

457
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:11,459
So dietary recalls were collected at population level.

458
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,530
And these are three different cycles of needs.

459
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:23,930
And so using those dietary recalls, the foods were coded and based on the healthy eating index scores.

460
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:29,520
And you can see in the blue kind of grayish blue bars on the left, those are snap participants.

461
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:36,810
The gray bar are individuals who are income eligible for SNAP but are not enrolled in SNAP.

462
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:44,340
And then the green bar are individuals who have an income above the eligibility for SNAP.

463
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:48,660
And so you can see that, you know, as.

464
00:57:52,760 --> 00:58:03,320
Higher income households have a higher diet quality score relative to SNAP participants.

465
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:10,130
These are children 2 to 8 years of age, adults, 19 to 59 and older adults.

466
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,510
Even at our best, we are all family. So that's the other take home point.

467
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:22,549
Even if you look at everyone, we're still failing because we're still so well below 100.

468
00:58:22,550 --> 00:58:28,070
And this is this is actually what we typically see is, unfortunately,

469
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:34,850
in the United States, we typically are between 50 or just under 60 terms of the score.

470
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:43,070
So we all have a lot of work. But the concern is just that SNAP participants have some of the lowest.

471
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:53,480
And if you look at overall at their intake, they have the lowest intake of vegetables and fruit and they have a higher consumption of added sugars.

472
00:58:54,350 --> 00:59:02,180
Now, the concern about the fruits and vegetables and this is coming from qualitative studies, is that it's more expensive to purchase.

473
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:10,190
Right? So it's these kind of findings that help inform how can we improve the program?

474
00:59:14,930 --> 00:59:23,930
So it's growing on anything that you read today, how might the SNAP program be improved but strategies might be employed?

475
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:35,149
I would think education should come with it on this budget, like frozen fruits and vegetables are great and so they can be extremely or inexpensive.

476
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:37,580
As long as you have refrigeration, canned vegetables,

477
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:44,390
as long as you rates the sodium off them can be great opportunities or not eating a vegetable at all and are still really cost effective.

478
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:53,540
It feels like it's an education that people know how to best use that money to provide the most for their family.

479
00:59:54,590 --> 00:59:56,749
And in fact, there is a program, it's called SNAP.

480
00:59:56,750 --> 01:00:02,420
And it's not really well, I mean, a lot of students aren't familiar with SNAP and it's not well known.

481
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:05,740
But we do have a snap head program and I'll get to that.

482
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:11,000
So that speaks to that. Nicole. What else might be done with Snap?

483
01:00:11,450 --> 01:00:21,090
Yeah, just doing more. The second areas is like providing some sort of funding and resources for refrigeration and frozen foods.

484
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:28,460
I know that there are some companies and do some others set up as long as you can like and so forth.

485
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:33,560
Electricity, but still somewhere compensating that barrier.

486
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:40,159
Yeah. What else do they look at?

487
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:44,810
What kind of food you buy off of it. When you use your card for.

488
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:50,670
So in this study, the previous study, yeah, they could see because it's a dietary recall.

489
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:54,190
So you're you're just recalling what you ate the day before.

490
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:58,510
So also, can they make it so you can't buy like sugar sweetened beverages with that money?

491
01:00:58,550 --> 01:01:05,900
So we are not. Yeah. So that's actually been something that's been recommended is to convert the SNAP

492
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:11,930
program more like Wick because in Wick there's very specific foods that are provided,

493
01:01:12,890 --> 01:01:24,709
you know, milk, eggs, things like that, more nutrient dense foods, whereas the snap, it's dollars, not specific foods.

494
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:30,590
So there's an article that I did not make mandatory.

495
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:33,620
I think I might make change that next year because I think it actually highlights

496
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:37,550
it's under optional readings and it says something about a snap binge.

497
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:43,219
Let's just say something I have printed here. You need to read that article.

498
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:46,220
It's only two pages long. It's a. It's a.

499
01:01:51,090 --> 01:02:06,239
No snappy solutions yet, but it highlights why we have not gone to a requirement where snap the card is only

500
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:15,810
used for specific foods because it's felt that that's a very paternalistic approach.

501
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:19,860
It's not fair to SNAP participants.

502
01:02:20,280 --> 01:02:26,819
But that being said, Sandi Logan, who is a researcher here, she's now working at Harvard.

503
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:32,510
She actually looked at did a study where they actually surveyed SNAP participants,

504
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:38,580
and they actually want healthier choices and they want help with making healthier choices.

505
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:44,669
So I think there's some opportunity for creative,

506
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:53,370
whether it mean that some of their SNAP benefits or if there's a way to support more fruits and vegetables because we know they are more expensive,

507
01:02:53,370 --> 01:03:02,549
especially if they're fresh or supporting frozen or what have you, so that we could stimulate or stimulate.

508
01:03:02,550 --> 01:03:06,540
What's the word? I support the purchasing ability.

509
01:03:06,810 --> 01:03:14,670
I thought it was interesting that it noted SNAP can be used for seeds and plants that they're thinking of.

510
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:17,369
The people that we talked to, in addition to the urban farming and stuff,

511
01:03:17,370 --> 01:03:24,719
that there could be a way to connect the opportunity to use your snap to buy seeds and plants in places where it might be easy to plant

512
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:30,600
things and then have someone that teaches you actually how to do that and take advantage of that opportunity for more partners in your diet.

513
01:03:32,460 --> 01:03:36,900
Well, when Michael and Sara, we're here to talk about base fruit farms,

514
01:03:37,350 --> 01:03:49,410
they are partnering with Trinity Health Health Care Hospital in an area that's low income, and they're providing CSA boxes for those low income folks.

515
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:54,360
So that's, you know, in smaller communities, that might be an option.

516
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,089
I know in a big city that might be more difficult.

517
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:04,830
But in smaller communities, especially if you have local farmers that can partner with a hospital or a health care,

518
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:13,140
health care setting that can support that. Any other thoughts about how SNAP might be improved?

519
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:19,600
You know, I just have a question related to the general topic.

520
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:29,350
I'm wondering where the program for Meals on Wheels for Seniors falls into, because that is something specific for seniors.

521
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:33,330
And I'm just wondering where that falls into this way.

522
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:42,370
So my unit is Have a Meals on Wheels and Allison Forman from our Ypsi Meals on Wheels will be talking in November.

523
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:53,410
That is not part of finance. It's a separate organization, but it partners with many of the organizations and community nonprofits.

524
01:04:53,710 --> 01:04:58,980
So our Meals on Wheels, I'm sure, are have food gatherers as a partner.

525
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:04,050
They have multiple partners. Yeah, but it is a very important program for our seniors.

526
01:05:04,140 --> 01:05:07,390
Yeah. Okay.

527
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:13,360
Just very quickly, because we're running out of time here. I just wanted to go over Snapchat.

528
01:05:13,370 --> 01:05:24,130
So Snapchat is a requirement as part of the SNAP program to provide education.

529
01:05:24,250 --> 01:05:27,580
The whole idea is that if we're providing this assistance,

530
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:35,170
there should be an education component to promote healthy food choices as well as to help with the budget.

531
01:05:36,130 --> 01:05:39,910
Right. And so that's the goal of Snapchat.

532
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:45,160
So it's a federally funded program and they partner with community organizations.

533
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:49,479
So Ann Arbor doesn't have a snap ad office.

534
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,150
There's no snap ad per say.

535
01:05:52,330 --> 01:06:01,840
It's often it's ministered by the federal government through the state, but then through usually oftentimes it's nonprofit organizations.

536
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:11,620
That doesn't mean it has to be, but sometimes it is. And they provide nutrition and physical activity programs.

537
01:06:11,950 --> 01:06:21,130
And again, the whole point is that for those who are eligible for SNAP to improve healthy choices and budgeting,

538
01:06:22,630 --> 01:06:27,280
it includes nutrition, education as well as policy systems and environmental changes.

539
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:38,050
So by that, I mean that there's funding from the USDA to support development of community gardens, improvement in walking for children.

540
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:46,360
So there's, there's environmental options to improve both health as well as healthy food choices.

541
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:53,680
The two funding agencies in Michigan that receive the federal funds is Michigan State University Extension.

542
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,600
And then there's the Michigan Fitness Foundation.

543
01:06:57,610 --> 01:07:07,000
And so they if you're a community organization that wants to provide SNAP education, you submit a grant to either of these two for funding.

544
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:21,370
Growing Hope is an organization in Ypsi that promotes gardening, helps individual families, households have their own garden and so forth.

545
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,730
They have been involved in SNAP at Me in the past.

546
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:31,420
I'm not sure if they still are. These are some examples in Michigan of SNAP at programs.

547
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:34,930
There's nutrition in action and I can't remember what.

548
01:07:35,050 --> 01:07:41,800
I assume that's school based. And in fact, most of these peanut is physical education,

549
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:48,790
slash nutrition education that has been implemented in a number of schools and probably still is.

550
01:07:49,390 --> 01:07:56,980
And then they learn from watching you a program that targets caregivers as well as kids.

551
01:07:58,750 --> 01:08:01,450
And I don't remember who implemented that program.

552
01:08:03,160 --> 01:08:12,670
The National Kidney Foundation in Michigan has Reggie's rainbow buy with the National Kidney Foundation would be interested in promoting snap at.

553
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:21,250
And this is for children. Can you just.

554
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:27,810
Yeah. Reduce kidney disease, which is one of chronic disease in the United States.

555
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:32,020
And not only that, but, you know, reduce other chronic disease as well.

556
01:08:32,740 --> 01:08:44,720
Yep, that's exactly it. These are some snapshot projects at one in Wisconsin, in Maine gardening program.

557
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:50,590
And I just wanted to highlight the snap and website actually is quite useful.

558
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:53,740
It has a number of community based interventions.

559
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:57,770
It's almost like a clearinghouse of these interventions.

560
01:08:58,190 --> 01:09:05,659
And it's in part because it's sharing with other communities what kind of interventions might be implemented that provide nutrition,

561
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:09,740
education, but also physical activity, education and so forth.

562
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:15,829
So it's useful if you're ever working in a community setting and you need ideas about

563
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:21,530
potential intervention programs that have already been implemented and so forth.

564
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:28,620
It's useful as under the SNAP Toolkit. Okay.

565
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:40,469
Covered a lot. There's a long class, but there's a lot of information, so hopefully you feel a little bit more versed in Snap and Snap.

566
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:48,780
Ed And again, Markelle is going to be a great resource to if you have any questions about any of the food and nutrition services,

567
01:09:48,930 --> 01:09:53,350
especially those that are commodity based. She'll be a great resource as well.

568
01:09:53,370 --> 01:10:01,380
SNAP Any questions that you're ready to nod off?

569
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:11,160
I understand you guys have a great rest of the day and I will see you on Wednesday and again in person with Stephanie.

570
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:21,430
So. All right. And if anybody has questions about their assessment record, I will be clearing happened just outside the door.

571
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:28,890
I can answer anything up there. Must be.

572
01:10:31,010 --> 01:10:31,850
Yeah, I know.
