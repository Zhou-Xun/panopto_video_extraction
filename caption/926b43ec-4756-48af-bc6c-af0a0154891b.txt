1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:12,490
It did not help me at all. I need to buy a new car that can keep my family here.

2
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,660
I wish I had a job. Oh, my God.

3
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:27,720
Dogs don't go to the airlines. You mean Cigarets or something?

4
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:39,610
No, I mean, I no doubt in mind.

5
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:44,520
Glad that things like that, actually. All right, let's get started.

6
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,760
Two reminders. One is that you should have all signed up for project group.

7
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,240
However, when I look on Wolverine Access, there are 64 students.

8
00:00:54,340 --> 00:01:03,840
And when I look at this, there are 62 signed up. So perhaps Wolverine access isn't up to date, but if you happen to be one of those two students,

9
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,050
and likely I'm guessing maybe they're not even here they are.

10
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,890
But if you're listing on Panopto, please sign up for your project.

11
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:16,920
You do need to do the project before for the end of the year, so please sign up.

12
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,410
If we don't see these filled in. We'll go through one by one with a name.

13
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,850
But I'm hoping that you all signed up. Okay.

14
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:30,030
The other announcement is that your second homework was due.

15
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,320
And I think there is a there was also that like practice to grade scope.

16
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:41,550
And I made it seem. It was optional, but then some people freaked out because it was worth a point.

17
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,729
Don't worry, if you didn't do it, it was fine. If you knew how to do it, that's fine.

18
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,170
I'll give you the point. Don't worry about the point, but hopefully you practice.

19
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:53,490
You gave in your second homework. You know how to use grade scope, you'll use it for the rest.

20
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:57,630
And those are no longer optional, right? Homework to three or four or five.

21
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,600
Those are not optional, so please do those. Okay. The next homework is not due until October 4th.

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,139
So you have a little bit of time and it is on more phase two things.

23
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,880
So I would recommend not you would just have a lot of questions if you try looking at it right now.

24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,059
The other thing I wanted to update you on is that next Thursday I will not be here and I was going to have someone give the lecture, but they can't.

25
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,570
So I recorded the lecture. And so next Thursday, the 22nd, you do not need to come to class.

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,889
You're welcome to come here and listen to it, or you can just listen to it on your own time.

27
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,130
So the lecture is already available.

28
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,160
There's a video recording, the transcript slides, PDF version, whatever you need.

29
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,650
And then on the following Tuesday, we'll do all the pull everywhere questions that were a part of that.

30
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,290
So please don't skip it because it will be on your test.

31
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,080
I'll make sure that you watched it and or test your knowledge about those concepts the next week.

32
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,440
Are there any other questions in your first test, by the way?

33
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:07,120
Is October 11th and it's on phase one and phase two.

34
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:17,590
And like I said, the study guide for that is looking at all of the lecture objectives, and it's multiple choice and short answer.

35
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:26,920
Oh, that's the other thing. If you have any accommodations, please make sure that I have those.

36
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:35,580
Okay. Anything else? Any other questions? Feel like we're missing a whole set of students today.

37
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,460
I don't know what's going on. All right.

38
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:48,950
So we were talking about the continual reassessment method this year, which is the Phase one model based design,

39
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:54,090
which is going to allow us to consider all of the data across all of the dose

40
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,580
levels to assign the next dose and to estimate the MTD or maximum tolerated dose.

41
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:07,709
So we're going to be performing this year with within the Bayesian framework or

42
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,000
with a Bayesian approach so that we're going to have some prior distribution,

43
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:19,770
some prior beliefs that we're going to combine with the observed data about who's had a DLT or not and get this posterior distribution,

44
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:23,640
which is going to tell us the probability of deal to use at each dose level.

45
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:34,730
And that's going to allow us to make the next dose assignment so we update our beliefs after we see every patient and whether they had a DLT or not.

46
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:41,600
So we talked a little bit about how we figure out, well, what are the number of doses?

47
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,230
Right. This is really something that's kind of driven by the clinician and the drug.

48
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:50,570
But the optimal number of doses for a urine design or what's recommended is 4 to 8.

49
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,010
So it's ideally you have not just two doses,

50
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:05,420
but you could still run a serum and that and ideally don't have too many doses because then it's just going to become very, very large design.

51
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:14,950
The target toxicity level is also something set generally by a clinician and is based on information in that area,

52
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:21,090
the disease, the other treatments that are available, the drug under consideration, who is being treated?

53
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,880
Are they healthy or are they sick? And it's recommended that for a year.

54
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,400
And this could go anywhere from super low to fight from 5% all the way up to 50%.

55
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:41,170
So then we went through this example, which was a serum design with four dose levels,

56
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:51,879
and we saw kind of briefly how we might have some prior belief of what the probability of toxicity is at these four dose levels.

57
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,290
So we start there and then we update it with the data that we get.

58
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,790
And there is a question about like, so how are we actually figuring out what this alpha was or previously called Beta Theta?

59
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:10,110
How are we actually doing this? Well, we actually had a set of prior distribution around Alpha to begin with.

60
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:16,900
So we have this prior distribution and we have the observed data, whether they're deities or not, and we're combining that information.

61
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:21,130
Now, we can't do that by hand because the prior distribution is generally normal.

62
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,759
And so this is something that we would need to use computer software to help

63
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:29,589
us do to combine that prior plus the observed data to output the posterior.

64
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:33,610
And in fact where it outputs a posterior distribution and we're taking the posterior

65
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:40,120
means of the probability of DLT is the probability of toxicity at each dose level.

66
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:43,870
So this is something that you couldn't have just done by hand, right?

67
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:58,189
You know. With the calculator or whatever. So we see that we have this prior belief and we could draw a curve and then we can see

68
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:02,370
how the curve changes based on the updated observed data of whether there are a deal,

69
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,459
whether there are deltas or not.

70
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:12,320
And generally what we see is that if there are no deal t's right, our curve is likely to come down because it's less toxic.

71
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:17,570
And if there are DL to use than our curve is likely to go up and show that these doses are more toxic.

72
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,680
And so what I wanted to we kind of stopped here with this example.

73
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:33,739
I want to make a few points that so every remember we're dose finding between individuals so we're

74
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,300
not taking one individual and then changing their dose level or dose finding between individuals.

75
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:40,940
And in all of these designs that we talked about thus far,

76
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:47,420
we have to observe that individuals deal you before we can decide the next dose for the next individual.

77
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,410
So multiple individuals are not coming on at the same time.

78
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,050
It's that a patient enrolls and then review their whether they have a deal t or not.

79
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:06,110
And that's either that's that time period is specified within a protocol of like the DLT observation window is one day,

80
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,229
one hour, two weeks, six weeks, etc. Right.

81
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,290
So like that's based on what the clinician thinks.

82
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,040
The definition of the DLT is in mind. We would see it from the patient.

83
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:23,149
And so while it looks like right, these people are coming in like one by one by one lining up at the door and we're giving them this drug.

84
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:26,780
Right. This could be weeks in between each each patient coming in.

85
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:38,510
In this specific example, we don't have anything about the number of patients that need to be on a dose before we or we can escalate or de-escalate.

86
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:42,080
Right. Which we can actually do. And we'll talk about that in a second.

87
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,420
But in this example, you put one patient on a drug.

88
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:50,209
On the dose level, you decide if they have a deal T or not or not.

89
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:56,900
You update the model, you get the new posterior and you can escalate or de-escalate or put them on the same

90
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:02,120
dose depending upon what those posterior means of the probability of toxicity are.

91
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:06,170
Right. So we had somebody on dose one, they didn't have a deal.

92
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:09,739
T We put somebody on those two, they didn't have a DLT.

93
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:13,280
We update the model, they go on dose three, the next one goes on dose four.

94
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:16,670
And now there are no doses, there are no more doses to escalate. Right?

95
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,700
So there is no DLT or we just keep putting them on for.

96
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:25,940
And then once there is a DLT on four, the model likely says, oh, this toxicity, this level is too high.

97
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,970
Right? It could have said this level is still okay.

98
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:34,970
And maybe the next one went on four, but we ended up going to dose three that there was a toxicity of three.

99
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,610
The next person went down. So this is how the model is working and the trial is working.

100
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:45,679
All right. We can't tell, actually.

101
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:51,649
Is this the final? Here it is. Okay. So from the graph, we can't tell what the MTD is, right?

102
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:55,970
Because we don't actually know what the probability of toxicity is on this graph.

103
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:02,000
All we can tell is how many people were treated at each dose level and how many people had to use at each dose level.

104
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:09,920
But if we look down here from the model, right, we can figure out what the MTD is because the after the 20 patients,

105
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:18,770
we had this final estimate of our parameter of 1.996, which if we have here.

106
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:25,850
Right, we can see that. Then the final estimates of the probability of toxicity from our power model are 4%, 10%, 18% and 28%.

107
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:32,690
And if we were targeting 20% toxicity, then dose three is our MTD.

108
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:47,090
Okay. So I want to show you a little bit more more a few more examples of how these herbs change over time with the accumulated data.

109
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,880
So these are really cool simulations that Phil bootstrapped put together from when he was teaching this class in 2008.

110
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,210
And I've just kept them because I think they're really great illustration.

111
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:03,800
So if you talk to a fellow, you can say how great his his our simulations are or whatever.

112
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:13,820
Oh, they're so great. We still want to use them. So the the black solid line is like the true dose toxicity relationship.

113
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,739
So the true relationship where each one of these dots represents a different dose, right?

114
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,980
There's one, two, three, four, five, six dose levels here.

115
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,120
And this is the true relationship between what the doses and the probability of toxicity.

116
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:35,810
So you can see these are very much not toxic. This one maybe has 10%, this one, 23%.

117
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,260
It looks like we're targeting maybe 25% toxicity.

118
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,920
This one's too toxic, 45% or so. And this one's very much too toxic, maybe even 70%.

119
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:56,240
Okay. So this is the truth. This black dashed line is our current estimate, which before we have any patients in our trial.

120
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:03,350
Right. That's based on the investigators prior beliefs of what they think each dose level, the probability of toxicity is.

121
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:11,120
So they're overestimating at first and then they're underestimating the actual true probability of toxicity.

122
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:20,159
Right? At first. That's or prior. I guess it says that the right we can't see the red it's a skeleton is in red.

123
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,610
We can't see that because it's underneath the black. Right.

124
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:28,260
Because at first when we have no patients, our skeleton is the same as our current estimate.

125
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:33,370
But you'll see that these those skeleton is going to stay in the black is going to change.

126
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,480
The black dash one is going to change based on our accumulated data.

127
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:47,790
So I will start to play this. And you'll see these are the number of patients and if they go up high, if they have deltas.

128
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,780
And so you can see from patient 14.

129
00:12:51,270 --> 00:13:02,159
So for example, this is patient 20 and this is how many on the bottom how many patients have actually, this must be six.

130
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,500
Nine. Okay. So this is the number of patients who have not had yields on each dose level.

131
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,250
And on top is the number of patients who have had a DLT on that dose level.

132
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,410
And if we go so I'll just let it keep going. I think it keeps going.

133
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,620
A lot of patients, even though you wouldn't have this, likely have a ton of patients.

134
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:29,740
But you can see, right, the line is moving. And if we watch it, it's doing a pretty good job of getting close to that.

135
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:38,130
And to the actual entity that we want to choose. It's not doing a good job of figuring out what the relationship is at the extremes, right?

136
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,900
The actual true values. So it's starting over now.

137
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:46,070
Right. So at first we're like, what is this relationship?

138
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:52,190
Oh, I'm getting closer to them today. Now I'm basically going between doses, three, four or five.

139
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:58,370
Right. And it's going to do a pretty good job of figuring out that this dose four is the MTD,

140
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:07,970
but it does a terrible job of figuring out just how high the toxicity is at dose six or just not a great job of figure out how low it is at dose one.

141
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:15,050
So remember, that's because we have this usually one parameter model that we're working for, working with, with our serum,

142
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:23,300
and it does a pretty good job of finding and TD, but not a very good job globally of estimating that whole dose toxicity curve.

143
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,560
So let's see a different. There's another one here.

144
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:40,000
Okay. So this one has a bit more of a complicated, true dose toxicity curve.

145
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:50,620
You can see that it's a steep increase and then kind of plateaus and it's actually the last dose level that is the MTD.

146
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:58,750
So here we're targeting a toxicity level of 30% and that would be our sixth dose level.

147
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:11,080
You're going to see that. What happens is that we don't do a very good job even in the long parameter of getting here because our MTD is on the edge.

148
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:17,350
So that one parameter model is pretty good at finding them when entry is in the middle.

149
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:24,729
But when our entity is on edge, especially if there's a nonlinear relationship, our one parameter model's not going to do a great job.

150
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:27,610
So that's the downfall of the one parameter model.

151
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:37,300
And so this is kind of helpful as a statistician to know some feedback to give to a clinician in the number of doses,

152
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,919
especially if they say, okay, here are the doses. And I believe that that last dose is going to be in that MTD you might want to talk to and be like,

153
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:49,030
well, maybe we should consider adding one or two more doses, right?

154
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:53,019
Like if they're too toxic, we won't assign many patients on them.

155
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:58,360
So, you know, it shouldn't it shouldn't be too worrisome that we're going to have one or two more doses.

156
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:04,900
All right. Let's watch. So again, the solid line is the true toxicity dose toxicity relationship.

157
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:12,339
The dash line is our current estimate, which first is off, so overlaying our skeleton.

158
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:20,140
So the initial belief. So in this case, part of the problem is actually that the investigator is just really wrong in the beginning, right?

159
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:25,120
Like they thought that MTD was going to be dose four, they didn't think it was going to be dose five.

160
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:32,410
And this could definitely happen. And the way that we want to try to circumvent this issue we'll talk about is we're going to run a

161
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:39,219
bunch of simulations once we choose all of the parameters of our serum and make sure that our design,

162
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:42,310
our model is relatively robust to different settings.

163
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,050
So we're going to talk a lot more about that today, next and next week.

164
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,220
And in that lecture that I recorded about the extensions.

165
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:08,340
Okay, so let's watch it go. So you can see it's actually not even ever assigning that last dose.

166
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:15,720
It is getting a lot of people on the fifth dose.

167
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:21,990
But because of the prior belief that even this fifth dose was really toxic,

168
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:32,730
it would take a lot of patients to get enough data to overcome that prior belief to start going and assigning that last treat, that last dose level.

169
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:42,750
So here at the end of this trial, we'd be most likely to go forward with dose five instead of dose six, and perhaps that would be okay.

170
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,940
However, it's possible that it's not as effective as it would be.

171
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,380
Hadn't gone with dose six while dose six still could have been safe.

172
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:56,430
And so you can see that there is the possibility that we're going to miss the right dose to move forward with.

173
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,409
Okay. But this is again, this really right. This is actually what's happening in the trial.

174
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,799
As patient comes in, we get their DLT information. We're updating that curve.

175
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:14,629
This is what's you know, what's actually happening is that our estimates of our posterior means I mean,

176
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:22,930
estimates of the probability of toxicity for each dose is changing. That helps us assigned the next dose and at the end helps us to that MTD.

177
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:36,170
Any questions? So a lot of this probably looks familiar, right?

178
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:44,419
We're using these relatively simple general general linear models, the generalized linear models, a logistic model,

179
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:49,640
a power model, maybe don't work so much with the power model before, but you definitely know the logistic model.

180
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,110
We're just modeling the probability of DLT, yes or no, right?

181
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:59,929
That's pretty simple. You've done that before. It may.

182
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,499
If you took Bayesian analysis or you know a little bit about Bayesian,

183
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,690
perhaps even the fusion framework looks familiar to you and how we estimate those model parameters.

184
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:14,930
That probably doesn't actually look all that familiar to many of you that you haven't taken Bayesian or you're currently taking it.

185
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:21,110
But a lot probably so a lot of a lot of it still looks relatively unfamiliar.

186
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:25,639
So we're just going to keep trying to go through it, look at these simulations and get a feel for what's happening.

187
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:31,850
And then next Tuesday, basically, probably the whole class,

188
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:39,229
you're going to get the chance to play with Serum and R so that you actually get some applied knowledge

189
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,870
going through the example and trying to understand and really get a feel for how it's working.

190
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:50,060
So again, remember to bring your laptop, tablet, whatever you have on to use next week.

191
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,719
Okay. So the two common models that we're going to spend most of our time thinking about are the logistic model and the power model.

192
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,520
I also showed you the Probit model last week, but I don't use that one very much.

193
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,310
So it does exist. It can be used, but we're going to focus on these.

194
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:12,629
The two most commonly used models also updated these slides a little bit before today.

195
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,370
So if you had downloaded them previously, you might notice some difference as we move forward.

196
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,460
Very, very few differences. Well, a little bit.

197
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:30,479
So we're going to let the piece of J be the probability of a DLT at dose J and that shows whether a patient experiences a

198
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:41,520
Delta dose level j and we have this set of possible covariate values that actually probably should change this as well.

199
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:57,419
This is actually the covariates groups. The covariant values are really this d sub j and these are the dose labels.

200
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:03,660
So this is what I ended up choosing throughout. I felt like it was not clear differentiating the skeleton from the dose labels.

201
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,909
So hopefully now it's going to be clear.

202
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:12,030
So the skeleton, remember, is the set of the initial set of probability of toxicities that the clinician gives you.

203
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:20,040
The dose labels are these covariates in our model this D sub j that you know, we think of doses as like one, two, three, four.

204
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:26,370
But actually the model we have to be very careful about what we specify the dose as so that we get a

205
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:33,599
good curve or relationship or a accurately showing that so that the skeleton values are set initially.

206
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,920
So we'll make that more clear through pictures. So we have this logistic model.

207
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:44,660
Well, I guess I should have changed these then. Right.

208
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,750
These should be these.

209
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:59,150
So we have the logistic model, we have the power model, our parameter that we're going to be updating estimating each time as this data.

210
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:11,229
Okay. So we just as we saw with the MTI, we could have those kind of wacky results if we didn't constrain that parameter space.

211
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,360
We're going to have to do that again here with the CRM.

212
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,270
So we want to enforce, monitor the city such that as doses increase the probability of toxicity increases.

213
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,590
So we're going to actually do that by constraining the theta space.

214
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:31,210
So that parameter of interest, we're going to constrain in the way that we can do that is actually through our prior distributions on that parameter.

215
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:35,950
So we can have some specific prior distributions that are going to help make sure that we're

216
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:42,700
estimating it within the space that's going to keep us so that our results are monotonic.

217
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:49,690
This numerical value for that decent j the dose is not obvious.

218
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:52,210
So we talked a little bit. It could be one, two, three, four.

219
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,530
It could be 20 milligrams per unit squared, 40 milligrams per meter squared, 100, whatever, right.

220
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:04,270
Whatever the actual values are. But usually neither of those are are the way we actually want it to be.

221
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:11,860
We want to have those labels be some numerical value that makes our skeleton.

222
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,100
Set up the right way for the dose toxicity relationship.

223
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,080
Again, I'll show you in a plot to make that more clear. We.

224
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:30,920
Don't just you know, what you're used to probably with your data is that you have all the data and then you fit the model, right?

225
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,409
You got a data set and now you fit this model.

226
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:38,750
We're actually fitting this model over and over and over again as soon as we get a new individual in the dataset.

227
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:45,860
And so this is something that is repeatedly refit over time, not just like at the end of the study.

228
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:57,670
Okay. So this constrained parameter space, again, we're just trying to make sure that we're going to enforcement in a city so that as dose increases,

229
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:07,419
toxicity increases, and we can do that by making sure that this X or which is going to be our dose label.

230
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:13,899
Right. Has to be positive. And similarly for our oh, sorry.

231
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:18,880
So the theta has to be positive in both the logistic model and the power model.

232
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:28,990
And the way that we can enforce the theta to be positive is generally by enforcing these specific prior distributions on theta.

233
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:35,439
So usually theta either has a gamma distribution, an exponential distribution, a normal or a log normal distribution,

234
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:42,280
and that's going to make sure that the parameter can't be estimated outside of zero.

235
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,230
Right, the negative side of zero.

236
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:56,919
So there are just different ways in which this is and for some people, parameter wise theta as beta they actually do beta equals log of theta.

237
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,550
Some people just talk about theta or beta whatever.

238
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,570
You just want to think about what the scale is and then what's the appropriate prior given that scale to make sure that you have this monotonously.

239
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:17,060
Yeah. Okay. Now we have this these different possible dose toxicity models,

240
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:25,130
and they're describing the relationship between the dose and the probability of toxicity or the probability of a DLT.

241
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,500
We want it monotonically increasing.

242
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:35,719
We know that we generally use either the power model or the logistic model, and the logistic model can have one or two parameters that one parameter,

243
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:45,890
a logistic model is going to be more parsimonious and it's going to do a really a pretty good job generally of estimating near the

244
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:55,160
empty the two parameter logistic model gives us a little bit more flexibility and will better capture more of the dose toxicity curve.

245
00:25:55,910 --> 00:26:02,030
So you can see, right, that we either have a beta or we have like a beta one and beta two and a two parameter model.

246
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:05,360
I know this is hard to read from where you are.

247
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:12,410
I think I just stole this exact table from the Wheeler paper that you were supposed to read or hopefully read soon.

248
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:18,020
And so if you want a better version of it, just open up that PDF. But what it's showing us is the model.

249
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:29,030
So D is our dose label. The beta is the parameter of interest here that we're that we're hoping to estimate every time we re fit the model.

250
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:34,759
This column right here, it tells us the general form of the dose labels.

251
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:41,870
So this is just solving for D in each of these equations right is just did a little algebra solve for

252
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:51,110
D and so that way we could take our skeleton and figure out what the dose label should be from that.

253
00:26:53,750 --> 00:27:02,150
This is the choice of the prior mean or median of the parameter of interest, and most often it's set at zero.

254
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:11,090
So most often we'd say something like Beta is distributed normal mean zero and standard deviation sigma or variance sigma squared.

255
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:16,759
Right? We often set the mean the prior mean at zero.

256
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:23,420
And so if you can, you can just put it in zero here at first when you're solving for the skeleton, it makes it much easier.

257
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:27,310
So if we do that right, if we put in the prior mean,

258
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:34,450
then we can figure out what these docx labels are so that we know that the power model's nice and easy to work with.

259
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:42,400
Because what this what the clinician says are those initial values of the probability toxicity at each dose is the dose label.

260
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:49,570
So it has this nice 1 to 1 relationship, whereas if we use the logistic model, we have to go in and solve for those dose labels.

261
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:52,900
Now when I say we have to go in and solve for those labels,

262
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:00,550
I mean like if you are somehow setting this up by hand when you use R, you don't have to go in and solve these things.

263
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:11,530
Okay. So generally what you do is you just give r this vector of like my doses right at the you essentially give R the vector of your

264
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:19,710
skeleton and it figures out how many doses you have and then it will calculate your dose labels given what model you've specified.

265
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:26,380
So you would, for instance, say something like, you know, R here's my vector of 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%,

266
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:32,320
and it would say, okay, you have four dose levels and you would tell R I want to use a power model.

267
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:36,340
And so now your dose labels are the 20, 30, 40, 50%, right?

268
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:40,840
As you said, Jeremih, here's my skeleton and I want to use the logistic model.

269
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:47,530
R is going to go in and figure out what your dose labels are and use those in the calculations refitting model.

270
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:52,149
You don't actually have to tell r your dose labels, but you should know where they're coming from.

271
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,870
Right? So that's why I'm showing them to you. That's why we're going over them.

272
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,829
Anything that R is doing should not be a black box to you as biostatistician, right?

273
00:28:59,830 --> 00:29:10,090
You should fully try to understand what's happening within that coding, but I'm not going to ask you to calculate these, for example.

274
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:18,820
Okay. You'll notice here in the previous slide, where does this three come from?

275
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,020
Oh, yeah. Okay. I was just going to say that. So you'll see this three here, right?

276
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:31,810
This three here, this three here. You'll remember when I showed you the logistic model, it was a C, so usually C is one or three.

277
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:41,950
And so in this example and I'll I'll I'll talk about that in a second, a little bit more in this table, in this paper, they just generally use three.

278
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:46,270
So that's why three is filled in. I'll talk about. So actually let's talk about it right now.

279
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:53,380
So this one parameter logistic model, there's that C also in the two premier model there C and it's often set to three.

280
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:58,630
This doesn't actually affect the shape of the model, so it's not affecting the shape of the curve,

281
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:07,930
but it does affect the dose labels and the credible intervals of probability of toxicity.

282
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:20,620
So you can see hopefully on Tuesday you'll run some simulations and you can change C from 3 to 1 and see how it affects the outputs.

283
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:30,280
Okay. Well, it's chosen to give prior uncertainties around the dose levels or the skeleton.

284
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:35,079
So it's kind of like how it gives a little bit.

285
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:39,250
It's related to like a weight of how confident you are in the skeleton.

286
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:48,670
It can also tell us a little bit about like, are we are we more uncertain at the high levels or the low levels?

287
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:52,300
It's going to affect the credible intervals around those toxicity levels.

288
00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:03,550
Also, you should know that our choice of the models, power or logistic, whatever, and the skeleton, 20, 30, 40, 50%.

289
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:10,780
Right. Those are those are chosen based on what we believe, but also they're not unique.

290
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:17,979
So like you can decide, I'm running a power model and a clinician gave me this skeleton and somebody else could say, Well,

291
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:23,650
I'm using a logistic model and I'm choosing this constant with the same skeleton, and we might actually end up with the same result, right?

292
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,870
These there's not just like a 1 to 1 correspondence.

293
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:36,129
You can use different models, you can have the same skeleton, you can use different skeletons,

294
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:41,170
have the same model and come up with the same conclusions in terms of each dose assignment and then A.D. at the end.

295
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:46,569
And so there's not one right answer, right?

296
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:53,950
As you hopefully have learned as you're going through your courses, particularly the applied regression courses, there is not one right answer.

297
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,729
Modeling is an art and you're trying to do the best that you can.

298
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:01,990
But lots of people can come up with the same answer using different ways of getting there.

299
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,100
And it's the same thing here. Okay, so here's some.

300
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,000
Figures showing you these different models. So the.

301
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:22,840
Rightmost version is a logistic model with two parameters, and the leftmost figure over here is the power model.

302
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,620
And then you can see different curves on there. The black one is one.

303
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:34,990
The data which we can think of as that parameter of interest, like the theta is set at a prior mean of zero, set at zero.

304
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,590
The red is if that data was negative one and the blue is if the beta is one.

305
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,210
Remember, the beta is the thing that we're updating every time.

306
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:48,430
And so it might start with thinking that, you know, its estimate is zero, the prior mean a zero.

307
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:56,110
However we're going to put in our we have our prior then we have our new data we're going to combine them and get a new estimate of beta.

308
00:32:56,140 --> 00:33:01,870
So it's going to change. And what's happening, just as we saw in those simulations from Phil, right?

309
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:03,990
When beta changes, the curve changes,

310
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,750
it moves up and down depending upon what this new what we believe is a new relationship between the dose and toxicity.

311
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:19,390
And so you can see here the difference between the power model, the logistic model and the to the one parameter and to parameter logistic model.

312
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:23,940
Right. It changes the shape of the relationship between dose and toxicity.

313
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:31,280
The power model when beta equals zero is this like 45 degree line?

314
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:37,580
Right. The logistic model is more of that. What we would expect S-curve from a logistic model.

315
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:41,810
Right. And a two parameter model can actually be even more crude.

316
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:54,170
And so the choice of power versus logistic should be thought of carefully when you're deciding to run a CRM

317
00:33:54,530 --> 00:34:01,220
based on what you believe the relationship is between the dose levels and the probability of toxicity.

318
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,950
Right. The power model is very simple. It's very easy to understand.

319
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:10,580
However, if you want a little bit more flexibility or curve, then you might want to go with the logistic model.

320
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,700
Okay. So if we have the one parameter logistic model,

321
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:30,930
we talked about how this is going to be more parsimonious and when you have less parameters to estimate,

322
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:34,400
right, you can have smaller variance around those estimates.

323
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:42,150
And so the one parameter model will be more efficient but will often be a poorer fit to the dose tox curve.

324
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:48,240
As we saw with those simulations, it will hopefully do well around the MTD as long as the MTD is not on edge,

325
00:34:48,960 --> 00:35:00,290
but it's unlikely to do well with the full curve. There is no closed form expression for the variance of this one parameter logistic model,

326
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:04,580
but we can kind of get an idea of it by using this two by two contingency table.

327
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:08,240
So you can imagine, right, the outcome is no DLT or DLT.

328
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,160
And if we had a binary covariate, which we do not remember.

329
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:16,490
Right. The covariate is the dose label, right?

330
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:22,520
It's not actually a yes or no covariate. So that's why we can't get this a close form of it.

331
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:28,570
But if our culprit was maybe it was just like high or low dose or something, right?

332
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:33,470
We could solve for our beta hat and get a variance around it.

333
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:37,500
And so you can get some idea of how you could do that. But right.

334
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:45,020
Since there's no close farmer, therefore using software and is looking for roots and combining the observed data with the prior.

335
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:58,840
So we're we're using the CRM, we're updating the model with the observed data.

336
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:06,010
We're we know that the more data we get, the better we're going to do at estimating that relationship.

337
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:16,610
Right. And so we we want to have. Enough patients in our Phase one trial such that we think we're doing a good job of finding that MTD.

338
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,370
We already talked about that. Usually this one parameter model is going to do a good estimate,

339
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:30,410
a good to do a good job of estimating the DLT probability at the MTD, but not at the other dose levels.

340
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,220
So how do you decide if you want the one parameter or logistic model or the two parameter logistic model?

341
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:47,349
Well, this is generally something that you're going to think about what's the sample size in general and the number of doses that you have?

342
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:52,210
Right. Like how how much data do you have to estimate another parameter,

343
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:57,970
but also you want to think about if you have a one parameter model, you can actually escalate faster.

344
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,080
And because you're only estimating one parameter, you can be more efficient.

345
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:09,100
However, with the one parameter model, there's the potential to have more deltas because you're escalating faster.

346
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:14,979
You could start going to dose levels that are too toxic and have more deal to use the two parameter model.

347
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:19,420
Right. We're going to do a better job of fitting more of that dose toxicity relationship.

348
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,880
However, it's going to be less efficient. It may take longer to to escalate.

349
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:30,370
And if you don't have enough data, you might not actually be estimating.

350
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:37,900
Well, right. So you really want to consider how many patients you have and what's your goal here?

351
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:43,600
And would it be okay if some patients of a few more patients experience deltas?

352
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,540
Right. That is something that you need to consider. What's the definition of DLT and who the patients are?

353
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:53,260
And you know, if that would be acceptable.

354
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,370
So what's recommended in the Wheeler paper is that we go with the one parameter model.

355
00:38:00,370 --> 00:38:07,149
It's usually sufficient and it's most often used because we usually don't have super big

356
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:11,080
sample sizes and we often feel like it does a good enough job of estimating near them.

357
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:17,650
I have never used a two parameter model actually, and zero ones that I've designed, although I haven't designed that many.

358
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:22,030
But I've most often gone with this one parameter a logistic model.

359
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:29,510
Okay. So here is where some of the vocabulary changes from the slides that I posted the other day.

360
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:36,950
Again, I just want to make it more clear. It was not clear the difference between a skeleton and the dose labels, and I'm hoping that now it is.

361
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:44,090
So the skeleton of that set of expected DLT probabilities at the dose levels of interest.

362
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,010
This is something given by the clinicians.

363
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:54,569
We have the dose levels and then we ask them, you know, given this and your background and what's been done before,

364
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:58,080
what do you think are the probabilities of toxicity at each of these levels?

365
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:05,370
And then we take that skeleton and we take what the clinician gives us the skeleton.

366
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:12,149
We decide on the model, right? Exclusion can't say like I'd like to do a one parameter logistic model like that.

367
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:17,700
They have no idea what you're doing, right? So you decide on I'm running a one parameter, a logistic model or power model,

368
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:22,830
and then you figure out what those dose labels are based on the skeleton in the model chosen.

369
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:27,120
And the dose labels are as we solve here, right?

370
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:35,640
We're solving for these dose labels, given our model and these probabilities of toxicity are the skeleton.

371
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:48,640
Like I said, those dose labels for the perimeter, we're usually filling in our prior mean or median value, which generally is set to zero.

372
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:58,360
So the clinician uses their preclinical knowledge to come up with the anticipate anticipated probability of toxicity or the skeleton.

373
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:07,900
And then we figure out the dose labels by solving for the skeleton, solving for the given the skeleton value solving for those D sub js.

374
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:17,180
And we can see that there is an impact into what we decide these DOS labels are.

375
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:23,450
Right. So if we actually just said the dose labels are like one, two, three, four, five, six, because I have six doses.

376
00:40:23,930 --> 00:40:27,460
Right. And here's my skeleton. The probability of toxicity is as such.

377
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,070
Right. This is what we would say the dose toxicity curve looks like.

378
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:37,309
If we decide to down here to say, oh, well,

379
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:46,250
the dose actually is like it's in milligrams per beta squared and it's 0.5 and one and then two and 3.5 and 5.2.

380
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:51,530
And so that's what I'm going to put. You can see that the relationship between the dose and the probability of toxicity in

381
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:57,590
the skeleton actually changes based on that that way of deciding what our doses are.

382
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:04,610
And if instead we use like a power model, right. And our skeleton is also equal to our dose labels.

383
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:11,479
You can see now here's our relationship between dose label and probability of toxicity.

384
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,900
It looks very different. It looks pretty different than these other two curves.

385
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:20,209
Right. So it's very important how we are modeling these things.

386
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:25,310
Right. What we're deciding our dose labels are and that.

387
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:28,520
Right, obviously we know that they correspond to like dose one, two, three,

388
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:33,290
four that correspond to the dose that's point five milligrams per meter squared, whatever, whatever.

389
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:33,770
Right.

390
00:41:33,770 --> 00:41:46,940
But in our model, it needs to be these special dose labels so that the curve looks right and how we expect the doses and toxicity to be related,

391
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:54,259
you can see right, what's really changing is the space between the doses right here.

392
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:58,010
They're all equal here, they're spread out here.

393
00:41:58,370 --> 00:42:02,959
There are also spread out but like close here and then more is more spread out, right.

394
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:10,100
So you can imagine, right, the space between things on the x axis obviously impacts what that line looks like.

395
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:11,780
It's relationship to the Y axis.

396
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:27,430
So these those labels we saw for them where we had the skeleton, we set it up with our model and we're going to solve for this piece of j.

397
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:32,620
And it's just helping us to figure out what the different, the,

398
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:41,010
the distance should be between the doses and how that impacts the relationship between the dose and the probability of toxicity.

399
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:52,600
We're always assuming, again, this modern tenacity or that that as dose increases, the probability of toxicity increases or at least doesn't decrease.

400
00:42:57,490 --> 00:43:05,110
So I think this actually needs to be taken all of the New Valley, the new version of the slides up after this class.

401
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:17,469
Okay. So here's an example. If we had to do this, if we had to figure out the DOS labels by hand, which again, software will do for us,

402
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:22,420
but we should figure out what it's doing, saying we actually have a two parameter, a logistic model,

403
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:32,979
and the means of the prior means of our two parameters they don't want to be the two are two and one and that we have six dose levels

404
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:43,690
and the dose units and mg four meter squared are as follows and that we have our skeleton set up such that the clinician said,

405
00:43:43,690 --> 00:43:53,230
oh well for dose one we expect 2% the probability of deal t to be 2% and then 6.5%, 10%, 20%, 33% and 65%.

406
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,680
Then we can calculate our dose label.

407
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:05,470
So you'll see that we're calculating the dose label using this function over here, which was this function we just solve for D, right?

408
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,989
We set this equal to zero, we solve for D,

409
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:16,120
we got this stuff over here and now all I'm doing is plugging in my P, which is the probability of toxicity.

410
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,059
And since I don't have anybody who's been on this trial yet.

411
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:26,440
Right, I use the skeleton and then I've plugged in my values of beta one and beta two, which I specified up here is one and two.

412
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:32,230
And so I'm just doing the algebra here and I got these DOS labels down here.

413
00:44:32,950 --> 00:44:42,040
And so the dose labels, right, don't actually correspond at all to the dose units or to the dose level.

414
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:47,680
But this is and they're negative, which is like funny, right? How do you have negative levels of dose?

415
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:54,880
But it's just mathematically going to help us with this relationship between dose and the probability of toxicity.

416
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:08,229
So you can see here this is again directly from the Wheeler paper, where if we had the dose in milligrams per meter squared on the x axis,

417
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:11,890
this would be our relationship between dose and probability of toxicity.

418
00:45:12,220 --> 00:45:18,100
Whereas if we transform and use these dose labels, we get this kind of curve.

419
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:24,049
Which makes more sense, right? This this curve is kind of interesting.

420
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:31,220
And like in this little increase in dose level, there is quite a sharp slope, right?

421
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:40,309
Whereas with these wider these longer increases, there are not as large slopes, which doesn't make that much sense.

422
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:46,549
We would think that as we increase the dose rate and get doses farther and farther apart, we'd get larger slopes.

423
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:50,030
And so that's what happens here. Right.

424
00:45:50,030 --> 00:45:53,960
When we modify those dose labels. So we're just taking something and.

425
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:59,140
From like the clinic and trying to make it mathematically work in our model.

426
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:04,030
And so we just do that with some algebra. All right.

427
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:06,090
So now we're going to we got our model set up.

428
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:14,140
We've gotten this information from the clinician, the number of doses, the dose levels, the probability toxicity at each dose.

429
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,310
And we've decided on our model and figured out those dose labels.

430
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:23,320
And now we want to start figuring out how we use this model.

431
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:30,430
So we're going to use the Bayesian framework. We have this prior probability distribution that's going to be assigned to our model parameters.

432
00:46:30,790 --> 00:46:35,379
Most of the time we just have that one model parameter, one data or one theta, right?

433
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,030
If we use the two parameter logistic,

434
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:46,180
we have two two parameters and that's assigning some prior belief and uncertainty to the probability of deal to use at each dose level.

435
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:52,900
And these prior probability distributions are based on preclinical or clinical opinion previous trials.

436
00:46:53,260 --> 00:46:58,600
They may also be something that like use, but so you specify the prior distribution,

437
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:04,030
but you're trying to capture how much you believe the clinician are like how strong.

438
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:10,360
I mean, you can't really tell it. You need to know about the area, right? How strongly the clinician feel about their prior beliefs.

439
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:21,010
Right. And so your prior is going to help you figure out how much weight you're putting on their expectations versus the accrued data,

440
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,540
the data that comes in about whether the patients have deltas or not.

441
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:33,760
That's going to be combined with the prior it's going to update our estimates of beta, which is going to some update and make update our estimates.

442
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,240
So the probability of Delta is able to make our dose assignments.

443
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:47,139
It gives us that prior distribution of the probability of toxicity and we take the mean of that part of those posterior distributions, right?

444
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:53,650
So we figure out what's the mean probability of toxicity at each dose level and assign the next dose.

445
00:47:56,620 --> 00:48:03,580
Before we actually start the trial, we want to make sure that we've chosen the right model,

446
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:09,399
that we have the right prior distributions on the model, that things that we would make good decisions.

447
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:14,440
And the way that we do that is through simulation and assessing what we call the operating characteristics.

448
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:20,469
So the operating characteristics with these different settings that we've set up.

449
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:26,140
And then if we see that it's not making good choices, we can potentially tweak things in our model.

450
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:33,280
We don't want to tweak things like the number of doses or what the clinician said was the skeleton.

451
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:37,350
It's unlikely that you'd go back to them and they'd say, Oh yeah, you're right, I was wrong, right?

452
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,749
Like, No, they came to you with their best guess. So you want to use that?

453
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:44,590
And then you need to figure out if you tweak things, they're like statistical, right?

454
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:47,850
The standard deviation of the prior, the mean prior,

455
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:53,979
the constant to allow for some additional uncertainty or additional certainty to try

456
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:59,620
to make better estimates of the probability of toxicities and better decisions.

457
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:04,270
But you're not trying. This isn't like a total guessing checking, right?

458
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:11,210
You have to be careful of what you're tweaking because this is deciding what those people are going on and how we're finding that mtd to people.

459
00:49:14,180 --> 00:49:19,669
So we're in the trials, the ones we've done, and we'll talk about all those simulations in a second.

460
00:49:19,670 --> 00:49:26,150
But then once we've decided we got all the right settings, we got the right model, blah, blah, blah, right?

461
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:38,570
Then we have the prior set up. Now a patient comes in, we generally assign them to either the first dose or the second dose of a low, very safe dose.

462
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:42,710
And then we figure out that they've had a deal to or not.

463
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:49,760
The second patient is ready to come in. We fit the model with the first patient's information plus our prior beliefs.

464
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:54,860
We get new these new updated probabilities of toxicity at each dose level.

465
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:03,470
And we look at what the what those new probabilities of toxicities are at each dose level of how those relate to our target toxicity level.

466
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:13,340
And we can either choose the dose, the next dose to be assigned can either be that dose which is closest to the target toxicity level,

467
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,719
or we can have these safety constraints like even though it says go to dose four,

468
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:21,410
we're just going to go with one dose two like dose two are dose three, right?

469
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:25,910
Usually we actually have that safety constraint of we can only escalate one dose.

470
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:30,610
We do this over and over and over again for all of our patients.

471
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:39,850
And at the end, we can look at our model and figure out what are those probabilities of toxicities for each dose level and

472
00:50:39,850 --> 00:50:45,760
then decide the MTD is that which has the probability of toxicity closest to our target toxicity rate.

473
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:55,549
So our model is a full even though we might not do a really good job of estimating at the ends with like a one parameter model,

474
00:50:55,550 --> 00:51:03,830
it's still a model that's using all the information across all the dose levels to understand what the relationship is between dose and toxicity.

475
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,629
And so it's borrowing information across all the dose levels to inform the next treatment assignment,

476
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:14,360
unlike MPI or three plus three, right, where we just use information on each dose level.

477
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:28,310
Our decision rules are often, well, we could choose the dose with the estimated probability of DLT closest to the target toxicity.

478
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:36,080
Or we could have some level around in which we feel comfortable of assigning the next dose.

479
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:47,810
So say for example, our target toxicity level is like 20% and we find that the updated probabilities of toxicity are like 17% and 23%.

480
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:51,709
Right around doses, three or four. Right.

481
00:51:51,710 --> 00:51:56,300
You could maybe go for dose three or you could go for dose four potentially if you said, well,

482
00:51:56,300 --> 00:52:04,580
I'm willing to go 5% over that often we have some excellent that we're willing to go over under and choosing the next dose.

483
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:12,889
And so you could say, oh, I'm willing to go to dose four or you could say I at my target toxicity is 20 and I never want to go above 20.

484
00:52:12,890 --> 00:52:14,600
So you would go with dose three, right?

485
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:21,530
You need to pre-specified these safety constraints or decisions before the trial happens so that you absolutely know,

486
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:25,460
regardless of what those estimates are, which dose you're assigning next.

487
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,960
So we talked a little bit about the sample size. The sample size is really going to be dictated by practical constraints.

488
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:44,140
So in the three plus three, the sample size is set by like those cohorts of three and the decisions in the and you can't know it a priori, right.

489
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:47,530
And the three plus three, you don't know like, oh, we're going to have 12 patients, right?

490
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:53,160
It's just like, what, what happens happens and it's usually less than 18 patients dependent.

491
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,180
Well, actually, it really depends on the number of doses. Right.

492
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:05,860
The the CRM, we actually set a max sample size, our sample size at the beginning of the trial.

493
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:11,620
And this is based on the number of centers involved, the number of doses that we have,

494
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:16,420
how fast we think we can get patients, and how fast that deal period is.

495
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:22,330
And so is really dictated by these practical or logistical constraints.

496
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:28,719
It's often, you know, like somewhere between 20 to 40 participants,

497
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:35,560
but it could be more if there are lots of doses, it could be more if you want to get more information at the MTV.

498
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:43,600
That's what I was trying to think of that word like, I don't know, one a few classes ago,

499
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:47,260
some phase one trials have this what they call expansion cohorts.

500
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:50,530
And so they end up doing like a three plus three and then they're like, oh,

501
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:55,960
we're going to do an expansion cohort and just put all of these additional people on the MTD and it's like, well, is that how is that?

502
00:53:56,080 --> 00:54:03,909
Is that just not like phase two? You just didn't really plan a full phase two trial several and faculty here filled with trauma.

503
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:09,090
Skip Berge I mean, Taylor myself wrote an article about how like, you know,

504
00:54:09,130 --> 00:54:14,410
don't just decide to put so many people on them to actually just keep running a serum, right?

505
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:16,120
Like if you want to get more information,

506
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:22,870
then just keep running a serum with a higher back sample size and likely you're just continuing to put them on MTD,

507
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:28,959
but then you could get more information at that MTD and still make good choices if it if

508
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:36,940
the model decides that it's too toxic or not toxic enough with the sample size chosen,

509
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:44,139
again, the clinicians going to say like, oh, we can get to we were just doing this at Michigan with the eligibility criteria,

510
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:50,170
we can probably get 1 to 2 patients per month. So the sample size, you know, we have three dose levels.

511
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:55,239
The sample size is 20 because we really want to finish this trial within 18 months.

512
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:59,020
Two years, right. You can say, okay, let me go.

513
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:06,189
Given that information, the skeleton, the model, let me go look at the simulations and make sure they're making good decisions.

514
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:10,330
We're finding the MTD under various scenarios and that sample size is adequate.

515
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:14,470
You might, after you run these simulations, be like, Oh, that's too small.

516
00:55:14,590 --> 00:55:19,630
Like we are not finding them too often for not treating most of the patients at the end.

517
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:24,460
Is there any way in which we can engage another center to try to get more patients?

518
00:55:24,670 --> 00:55:28,569
Right. So there is this like back and forth between you and the clinician of like,

519
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:34,480
I understand that that's the realistic goal, but we're going to need to it's not we're not going to get a good result.

520
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:39,010
So we're going to need to figure out if we can get another center or whatever on board here.

521
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:49,020
Another issue with sample size is the cohort size. So three plus three, we have cohorts of three, right?

522
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:56,639
Three patients go on one dose level and we have to see at least three patients on each dose level,

523
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:59,310
sometimes six before we're able to make that decision.

524
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:07,050
On the example serum that I showed you as a cohort of one, one patient one on dose one, and then we could decide to escalate after that one patient.

525
00:56:07,590 --> 00:56:08,010
However,

526
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:18,659
often we actually still enforce cohorts of like two or three even in a serum such that we don't want to be able to just escalate after one person.

527
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:25,230
We want to make sure that at least two people. Right, we're okay on this dose before we move forward and escalate.

528
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:37,520
If you have the cohort size of one, you can escalate really fast, but you might escalate so fast that it's making poor decisions, right.

529
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,030
That you're being you're going to give it too toxic of a dose.

530
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:44,600
Since the sample size in the cohorts are so small.

531
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:52,339
What do you do in the event of like a high dropout rate or like does it just end long, the study or so?

532
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,379
Usually in phase one, the dropout is very,

533
00:56:54,380 --> 00:57:05,290
very small because the follow up time is so short and it's being done often in a very like you're you're in the hospital,

534
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:11,990
you're getting a drug most of the time. Like in other it could be like you have a vaccine trial or something,

535
00:57:11,990 --> 00:57:15,110
you get a vaccine, they go away and you're still monitoring for them for six weeks.

536
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:23,630
You definitely need to be able to replace the person. But the dropout rates are are so, so small that it usually isn't that big of a deal.

537
00:57:24,230 --> 00:57:28,760
I think so. I have one title here that's going on right now.

538
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:37,290
We've never had anyone drop out. I think we have like 12 people, but we have had people after the fact withdraw.

539
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:43,080
So like we randomize or we don't randomize, like we get we assign a dose level, right?

540
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:49,069
And then they. I don't know if they're cancer progressed or they moved or whatever they withdrew.

541
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:53,540
And so then we had to, you know, the next patient would get the dose level and so then they don't really count.

542
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:59,480
So yes, it does elongate the trial, but usually it's not super, super common.

543
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:05,580
So the Wheeler article recommends that these cohorts are maybe one, two or three.

544
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:11,070
Any more than that, it's just going to take far too long to escalate and find that mtd most likely.

545
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:19,980
You don't want. Usually you don't want the cohort size to be larger than the maximum number of doses that you have.

546
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:28,660
Sarah So here in this case, even if you have a cohort size of three, you still wouldn't like do the patients concurrently, would you?

547
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:32,909
Yeah. So if you have a well, that's a good question. So if you have a cohort of three,

548
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:39,569
you might be willing to if there happens to be like two or three individuals who would go on a trial at the same time,

549
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:48,780
you might be willing to put them all on the same dose. It just depends on the disease and the treatment, because you might not you might say,

550
00:58:48,780 --> 00:58:52,019
you know what, at least want to see the first patient go through.

551
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:55,320
And I have a deal to do before I let numbers two or three. Come on.

552
00:58:56,550 --> 00:58:58,620
And so that that's kind of a.

553
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:08,150
A trial specific decision that, again, would have to be decided before the trial starts and then consistent across the trial.

554
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:18,050
Other questions. So what we're talking about here are some of the safety modifications.

555
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:23,120
So the model can say you should you should give this dose or we can go up now.

556
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:28,450
But we're all people and we're treating people. We know that we don't want to just be like the model robot.

557
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,040
We have to actually think ethically throughout this.

558
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:36,379
And so we might put in these safety constraints, these safety market modifications, say, all right,

559
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:40,400
it says you could go to dose four from dose one, but really, let's just escalate one at a time.

560
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:48,410
We also the if you remember, the original Quigley paper says start the trial at the MTV.

561
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:54,500
But if the MTD is thought to be dose four, we might actually we usually actually want to start the trial a dose one or two.

562
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:58,580
We want to start at a low a low dose, not that one to be the MTV.

563
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:06,020
Sometimes we also have these safety constraints that says like is the last patient.

564
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:10,820
Patient three has a DLT, but the model says you can escalate doses.

565
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:19,070
We don't want to we say, you know, we want patient four to go on the same dose as patient three to see how they do before we actually escalate.

566
01:00:19,460 --> 01:00:24,860
So we have this coherent dose escalation such that we could only escalate if we don't see a DLT.

567
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:29,650
The cohort size greater than one is a safety constraint.

568
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:38,270
It's just saying that we have to see to make sure that two or three people don't, you know, to see their deal.

569
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:41,630
Tease yes or no before we decide to escalate or not.

570
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:49,820
This is going to slow down the escalation of doses, but it's again, just safety of those involved in the trial.

571
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:56,780
For most of the for the few serums serums that I've written, I usually have cohorts of size two.

572
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:01,880
So we need to see the data from two individuals before we decide to escalate.

573
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:10,180
And these are again, just saying that like, okay, I have this model, it gives me these probabilities,

574
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:13,629
but I know that we're dealing with people and that we have to be ethical witness.

575
01:01:13,630 --> 01:01:22,110
And so I'm putting in these extra constraints here. We also as safety constraints can work in stopping rules.

576
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:31,170
Right. So we have this model which is going to tell us what the probability of toxicity is and we make decisions to escalate, stay or de-escalate.

577
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:35,400
But we can also make a decision that the model's not going to tell us, Hey, stop.

578
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:41,850
The models is going to give us probabilities. And we can say, you know what? Even the lowest probability of toxicity is far too toxic.

579
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:51,270
We got to stop this trial. Or like actually all of these probabilities of toxicity are so low, we're not close to the target.

580
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:56,370
Maybe all these dose levels are some therapeutic. We should stop, start over, think about our dose levels.

581
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:08,139
We can also say, you know, that the investigator said that they were willing to have a max sample size of of 25,

582
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:13,270
but we're on patient 16 and we've been at dose level three over and over and over again.

583
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:19,420
And I can now estimate the probability that I, you know,

584
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:25,149
that the entity changes and it's very unlikely based on the additional patients that could come in.

585
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:33,850
And so I might actually want to stop early due to the fact that I'm not going to make any additional I'm not going to end up changing what the MTD is.

586
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:41,110
Now, this one actually doesn't happen all that much, that last one, because usually if we think that we're at the MTD,

587
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:47,739
we're happy to continue treating patients at the MTD to get more data of the patients at them to the right.

588
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:54,700
We can better understand the safety, we can better understand the biological, you know, underpinnings, the mechanism.

589
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:58,179
We can look at what we call correlative science.

590
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:03,819
So like usually they're drawing blood or taking some samples of some sort of

591
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:07,330
so we're looking at that to see the relationship of the drug and the person.

592
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:13,540
And so we don't usually stop early because it looks effective at least in the phase one space.

593
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:18,400
We're willing to spend a little bit more resources and feel better about it going into phase two.

594
01:03:19,330 --> 01:03:24,410
But we could do it. And then.

595
01:03:27,830 --> 01:03:35,750
So if we're going to incorporate a stopping rule, we want it to have we want it to be something that we could we know when we make that decision.

596
01:03:35,750 --> 01:03:39,120
It's not just like, you know, all of the trials running up.

597
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:42,350
This looks good, you know that. Ah, this is really bad. No, let's stop.

598
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:46,340
Like we want to predetermine it and we want it to be based on probabilistic rules.

599
01:03:47,270 --> 01:03:55,489
And so it might be something like we say, oh, well, we're going to stop if X number of people are treated at this dose or we're going to

600
01:03:55,490 --> 01:04:00,649
stop if the estimated probability of all the doses having some deal t rate greater than

601
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:06,170
the target toxicity rate or less than the target toxicity rate is really high if we

602
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:12,859
have really narrowed in on a MTD and now the credible interval with is is quite small,

603
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:20,270
we're willing to stop or the probability of the next patient dose with the same treatment is saying,

604
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:27,020
you know, is really high, then, then what's the point? So we're going to we're going to work in stopping rules by specifying these like

605
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:33,169
mathematical rules that could be reproducible and are not subject to question by anyone.

606
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:36,260
Right. There's something that like it can't be subjective.

607
01:04:43,150 --> 01:04:49,150
Okay. So I've been talking about how we're going to do a bunch of simulations to figure out if these are good designs or not.

608
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:54,129
And so I really want you to get a feeling about what we're doing,

609
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:57,910
why we're doing these simulations, and then next Tuesday, how these simulations work.

610
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:05,500
So we're going to talk about the simulation. Then we're going to look through some that I did and talk about them, and then next week you'll do it.

611
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:12,969
So we're trying to, with these simulations, understand the operating characteristics of the trial.

612
01:05:12,970 --> 01:05:15,580
So we'll talk about what those operating characteristics are.

613
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:21,130
But generally there are things like the number of individuals treated at the MTV or at each dose level.

614
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:30,630
The proportion of our simulations that decide each dose level is the MTD, the number of toxicities at each dose level, right?

615
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:34,660
These are characteristics of the trial that define how well we did.

616
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:40,509
Right? Those are our operating characteristics. So we want to look at those operating characteristics under different scenarios,

617
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:44,920
under different settings of the true toxicity rates for the dose levels.

618
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:53,340
So what we're trying to do is demonstrate that our design is relatively robust to these different settings,

619
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:58,680
that we're generally making good decisions, we're assigning the right doses and we're finding the MTD.

620
01:06:00,210 --> 01:06:06,060
We can also do these simulations to compare different, different designs.

621
01:06:06,450 --> 01:06:12,029
So one of the most effective ways to convince an investigator to not run a three plus three is to run

622
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:17,639
simulations of three plus three designs and zero designs and show them the operating characteristics.

623
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:22,530
And you will see that the operating characteristics of the number of individuals treated at the entity and the

624
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:29,460
number of trials that that find the correct entity are far higher in the serum than in a three plus three.

625
01:06:33,630 --> 01:06:36,060
This is also going to help us justify the sample size,

626
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:48,600
clearly identify that we've chosen the best parameter values and often we use these simulation results.

627
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:55,139
We put them in like protocols or grant proposals to show like, look, we know what we're doing.

628
01:06:55,140 --> 01:07:02,310
You've chosen the best design. Here's how it's going to work. Well, it gives other people confidence that we're running a good trial.

629
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:11,430
So the operating characteristics that we're interested in looking at are the probability of selecting each dose as the maximum tolerated dose.

630
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:16,829
And we want to see that that probability is highest at what the true MTD is.

631
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:22,889
In each setting that we look at the number or proportion of patients treated at each dose,

632
01:07:22,890 --> 01:07:30,930
and we want to see that the higher proportion is treated at the MTD and a very low proportion is treated at very toxic dose levels.

633
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:34,889
We look at the number of DL tiers at each dose level. Again,

634
01:07:34,890 --> 01:07:40,350
we want to make sure that this is relatively low generally and it's lower for

635
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:46,050
lower toxic doses and it would be higher for higher toxic doses potentially.

636
01:07:47,970 --> 01:07:53,550
We're looking at the expected sample size and so we specify a max sample size.

637
01:07:53,910 --> 01:08:01,250
But remember that the trial could stop if all of the dose levels are toxic and when or if we work.

638
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:08,790
Other stopping rules in trial could stop early, and so the expected sample size would be the average sample size across all of our simulations, right?

639
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:14,220
So if it's sometimes smaller, the expected sample size could be smaller than that max sample size.

640
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:20,670
And then the expected sample size also determines the expected study duration.

641
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:30,630
Right. That's based on the number of individuals and the number that we could accrue per month given to us by the clinician.

642
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:39,820
Okay. So what what are these different settings that we simulate, but we always simulate?

643
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:45,250
Well, here are some options. So usually what we always do is that the clinician tells us that skeleton.

644
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:48,700
Right. Of what they believe the expected probability of toxicities are.

645
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:53,470
And our first setting is usually okay, what if that's the truth?

646
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:58,660
Right. What if we got it right there? Prior expectation is the real relationship.

647
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:02,500
And what we should see are great operating characteristics, right?

648
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:12,120
If we generate data that matches the way we model data or we have some prior belief and the truth is that same thing we should do really well.

649
01:09:12,430 --> 01:09:15,460
And so we should see good stuff in that setting.

650
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:19,000
Now we say, Well, what if we're wrong? And what if you're wrong?

651
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,890
Such that the clinician actually super underestimated the toxicity.

652
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:27,150
So be really bad, right? That actually the doses are much more toxic.

653
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:32,469
We want to make sure that our model isn't going to be giving toxic doses too often,

654
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:35,260
that it's either going to stop or it's going to go to the lower doses.

655
01:09:35,860 --> 01:09:43,680
We also consider, well, what if our clinician investigator super overestimated the probability of toxicity?

656
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:48,430
What if we could actually go to the top dose? Are we actually going to do that and make good decisions?

657
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:57,610
We usually do. At least those three settings listed here are additional settings such that it says you could do a setting so you have five doses,

658
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:01,839
you could make up different settings where each individual dose is that MTD Right.

659
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,910
So the clinician tells you oh dose three is that.

660
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:09,160
Well you can come up with different settings where dose one is dose two is dose three is dose for a dose five.

661
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:14,980
Right. And so that would be different levels of over underestimating the clinician over underestimating.

662
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:19,630
I usually don't go through all the dose levels being MTD I just go through like

663
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:25,390
underestimate and overestimate the truth and maybe like a super underestimate or something.

664
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,740
But at least those three settings.

665
01:10:32,820 --> 01:10:43,410
You you, you know, you want to make sure that at least one of your settings is where like one of the first two doses is toxic.

666
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:52,229
And you're going to make sure that your trial is going to stop early and not keep going because it's already treating people at two toxic levels.

667
01:10:52,230 --> 01:10:58,920
Right. You usually want to include that as one of your scenarios. Okay.

668
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:02,910
So here are some we're going to I'm just going to explain the best practices

669
01:11:03,150 --> 01:11:08,190
and then we're going to stop there and we're going to go through on Tuesday.

670
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:12,300
We'll start with showing you the simulations and then you'll do your own simulations.

671
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:18,120
Okay. So this is like you want to keep this in your back pocket for when you become a

672
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:22,799
real biostatistician and you happen to have a job where you run phase one study.

673
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:27,810
So some of you can throw this out, but some of you want to hold on to this because you might actually need it later.

674
01:11:28,110 --> 01:11:35,549
But these are your best practices. So you want to create a detailed simulation plan and you want to make sure that you in the simulation plan,

675
01:11:35,550 --> 01:11:39,500
you're saying, okay, here is the model, here are the things that we can I'm changing you.

676
01:11:39,510 --> 01:11:45,930
Here's what I'm running, right? This is just like the documentation of what you're doing as a statistician so you can explain it to somebody or,

677
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:56,340
you know, just provide some reasoning for why you did what you did. You always want to set your seed in any simulation.

678
01:11:56,730 --> 01:12:03,150
Okay? So if you don't set your seed, then any time you go back through and run these simulations, you're going to get different results.

679
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:09,450
If you set your seed and run it one time and then come back and run another time, you're going to get the same results if you can reproduce them.

680
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:13,800
So set your seed. Let us know what that seed is so that we can replicate it.

681
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:19,920
You want to generate that wide range of scenarios, you want to put them down on paper,

682
01:12:20,490 --> 01:12:23,879
then you want to specify the number of simulation replications that you're doing.

683
01:12:23,880 --> 01:12:27,540
So this is usually like a thousand or 2000, maybe it's even higher.

684
01:12:28,290 --> 01:12:31,619
And actually this this plan is not just for phase one.

685
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:35,670
So actually take it all the trashcan and most of you hold on to this information

686
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:39,299
because it's really useful for any time that you ever have to do simulations,

687
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:49,410
which like most of you, I don't know, at least half of you will have to run some simulations in the real the real world, depending upon what you do.

688
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:53,370
And so this is like general simulation guidelines.

689
01:12:54,420 --> 01:12:56,790
Figure out what the number of simulation replications is.

690
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:03,810
It's usually you want it to be so large such that your results aren't differing because of simulation error,

691
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:09,510
because you didn't run enough simulations, and because of the random draws that it was getting right.

692
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:11,940
You want your results to be relatively stable.

693
01:13:15,820 --> 01:13:22,710
And then you want to generally say like, okay, well, I'm running this under these settings and this is the model I'm interested in.

694
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:28,300
But you also usually want some comparative models, and so you may, in the phase one case,

695
01:13:28,630 --> 01:13:36,520
also run the three plus three, or you might run the one parameter and two parameter serum in your you know,

696
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,140
if any of you go on to your PhD,

697
01:13:38,470 --> 01:13:45,610
you're going to have some model or whatever that you've created and you want to show like how yours does compared to what the next best was,

698
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:48,820
what you improved upon. Right. So you always want to like comparator. Yeah.

699
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:52,500
I'm sorry. I just have a quick questions about easy.

700
01:13:53,500 --> 01:13:58,450
Is it important to try different. See, just to see like in like deciding.

701
01:14:00,190 --> 01:14:04,360
Not usually. So you usually don't have to try different scenes.

702
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:11,769
However, if you're going through and then seeing really funky results, you first would increase your number of simulations.

703
01:14:11,770 --> 01:14:15,759
And then if you're still seeing that, you might change your random seed to see if that had some effect.

704
01:14:15,760 --> 01:14:18,850
But it shouldn't if you're running enough simulations.

705
01:14:21,100 --> 01:14:28,090
Okay. So this is this is back to now you're a phase one biostatistician.

706
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:33,940
And this is just specifying again from I think this is from a Wheeler article.

707
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:42,549
It's specifying who gives you what information and in what order you get it in and how you use it to get to the Phase one design.

708
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:50,230
So the clinician is going to tell you these clinician clinical parameters that the title is target toxicity level,

709
01:14:50,230 --> 01:14:58,209
what we've been calling piece of T, the dose levels, the progressive MTD and the max sample size you the biostatistician choose the working

710
01:14:58,210 --> 01:15:06,850
model the your your computing the like dose labels from the skeleton the clinician.

711
01:15:06,850 --> 01:15:11,380
You're going back to the clinician and saying like, all right, you know, just.

712
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,230
Let's make sure that these were the probabilities of toxicity.

713
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:21,870
Your your clinician is helping you with the cohort size,

714
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:26,399
but you also might be thinking about that in terms of the operating characteristics you're deciding,

715
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,670
you know, is this is your model or likelihood based model?

716
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:35,460
You and your clinician are discussing the safety constraints.

717
01:15:35,820 --> 01:15:44,010
You know, how are you making these decisions you're going through and simulating a thousand to maybe 5000 for all these different settings?

718
01:15:44,730 --> 01:15:51,950
You're looking at the operating characteristics and going back to your clinician potentially and saying like, how does this look?

719
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:58,530
Is it a good performance? If you and the clinician agrees that it is, then you can go forward with that trial.

720
01:15:58,530 --> 01:16:03,030
And if not, you kind of go back through this loop, right? Okay. Well, then what needs to change?

721
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:05,669
And it's usually not the clinical things, right?

722
01:16:05,670 --> 01:16:13,590
It's usually those statistical things that perhaps we're changing the certainty that we had of that skeleton,

723
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:17,640
or perhaps we're changing the model because it was not the best relationship

724
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:21,180
between it was not showing the best relationship between dose and toxicity.

725
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:27,600
Okay. And then I give you again a template for if you're writing a Phase one protocol that

726
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:32,850
has a CRM and this is just a nice template for how you would write it in a protocol.

727
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:40,469
So again, put this in your back pocket from when you're working at like Genentech designing serum phase one designs.

728
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:43,799
Right. One day you'll write minimal. I use this template.

729
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:49,500
Thank you. Okay. And then these are the tables that you might have to write.

730
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:53,790
So this is a list of all the software that you can use for the CRM.

731
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:57,239
We're specifically going to look at using the CRM package.

732
01:16:57,240 --> 01:17:01,830
That's the one I'm going to tell you to use in class. But you should know that tons of them exist.

733
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:06,120
And this is taken from the paper that was written years ago. So there's probably even more now.

734
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:15,060
It's important to stay up on what's the best software to use and to understand differences, if there are any between them.

735
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:28,500
So we'll stop here will start on Tuesday with some of these questions and then we'll go through my simulations and talk a little bit about them.

736
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:31,650
And then you bring your computers and you'll go through simulations.

737
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:37,050
All right. Have a great rest of your week. I will see you Tuesday.

738
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:57,370
I know this is like a little late for that.

739
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:09,540
Now is just like the deadline.

740
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:31,110
And they're 12 to 5. I'm not sure that you said it sounds like I feel like it's down right now.

741
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:40,690
Well, I you're not going to start out.

742
01:18:40,780 --> 01:18:52,770
But, you know, I just think about how, you know, they are.

743
01:18:53,090 --> 01:19:19,720
Absolutely they're going to have to say, I mean, I guess maybe I was the only person close to it only gives us a little.

744
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:46,379
So this is before the value that it actually means, especially to travel around and around and the way they go to the actual sales,

745
01:19:46,380 --> 01:19:52,530
which you might see a little bit of how it feels, but this is like even before.

746
01:19:52,830 --> 01:20:06,860
So it's just saying that this constant of that 000000, yes, this one is about the same.

747
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:11,820
So this one is saying, I don't know what they're going to look at all of them, but.

748
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:19,430
Not going to do that across the river. And just like we saw saw allegations of murder that one time.

749
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:35,750
Yeah. Yeah. Because he's not sure what more could you know, but because we only have one parameter generally it's pretty safe is pretty you and.

750
01:20:36,980 --> 01:20:41,050
Okay. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, do you know what mean.

751
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:49,690
Oh, I think that's the override. It is like the estimate for violence.

752
01:20:50,060 --> 01:20:57,410
Yeah, I think it's supposed to be like. I think I'm trying to say that this is the clinician's first guess.

753
01:20:57,470 --> 01:21:00,650
Oh, it's like the. Yeah, yeah, it's.

754
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,600
It's like. It's like that. No, no. Otherwise it's like. Yeah, it's like the skeleton, like the clinician.

755
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:09,200
Best guess at it. So it's not the truth. Yeah, yeah, it's the clinicians.

756
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:15,579
Best guess. Yeah. And that was Aussie operating characteristic.

757
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:18,840
Oh yeah. It's. Oh yeah.

758
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:24,230
And for this problem you said like we need to give the ah the main of this equation.

759
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:29,630
Right. But what if like the police going to and the end.

760
01:21:29,640 --> 01:21:34,560
We got a point there. Yeah they are the same but for empty is always the last.

761
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,750
There is one, right? Well, yes or no.

762
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:45,080
So you would have to specify ahead of time if you are only willing to be less than petty or if you are willing to go above or below.

763
01:21:45,570 --> 01:21:51,000
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I don't even fully specify be a closest to within some epsilon.

764
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:56,430
So often what I do is I say like I'm willing to be 5% above or below.

765
01:21:56,790 --> 01:22:02,050
Oh, so even if it was like 25%, I might still choose that 20.

766
01:22:02,070 --> 01:22:07,649
You know, if it's estimated probability taxes use 25%, I might still choose that dose 24, but okay.

767
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:10,950
So I need you claiming everything before you too. Yeah. Yeah.

768
01:22:11,160 --> 01:22:14,219
And, but. Well, what is happening in the middle?

769
01:22:14,220 --> 01:22:20,750
But like, you still need to usually choose the lower supplement.

770
01:22:20,790 --> 01:22:23,339
It depends. It's, it depends on the setting, right?

771
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:29,879
Like on the disease, a lot of things often people would end up going with a higher dose or another option is that they.

772
01:22:29,880 --> 01:22:34,220
Before to get into phase two. Yes.

773
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:44,749
Yeah. And for as you mention, for a cohort we like people are saying, example, if we detect the person,

774
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:50,030
we have the authority and shall we like immediately de-escalate or we sue?

775
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:59,810
You know, usually what we do is our safety constraint is if somebody has a DLT or OC and on the model still says that does it's safe.

776
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:04,940
You would involve someone at that dose level and sort of like escalating necessarily immediately.

777
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:08,810
Okay. Only if the model said de-escalate. I see.

778
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:17,520
Okay. Great. Thank you so much. You were right.

779
01:23:18,750 --> 01:24:20,830
But funny, you don't follow Oliver. I've been. I think that would be one.

780
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:35,540
All of the law firms will make. So those are the ten.
