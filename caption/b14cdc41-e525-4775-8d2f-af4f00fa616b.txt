1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:10,830
That's what I hear this morning, everybody.

2
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:17,790
So a few words about what we're doing today, which I hope is going to be enjoyable.

3
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,060
Basically, we have an election, as you might have noticed, and I hope you enjoy the drumbeat of please,

4
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:29,220
please vote, please vote coming for the University of California. And I hope as citizens, you acted on it.

5
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:38,450
If you didn't, then ask yourself, why not try to remedy it for 2024, which is also going to be one of the most important elections of your life?

6
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,940
We scheduled this week because, as you know, Americans don't count votes effectively.

7
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:51,040
That's a political strategy in many ways to slow down the count because you slow down count, then you make it easier to challenge the results.

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,650
So it's not an accident in a number of places that we're still counting.

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,950
There's also a good old fashioned level of defunding public services dependent on volunteers who, like, have to go home and sleep and stuff.

10
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:02,659
But nonetheless,

11
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:11,690
we have this absurd situation in the United States in which if I can't schedule my electoral electoral wash of class on Wednesday after the election,

12
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:18,230
as I would be able to at basically any other advanced industrial democracy or for that matter, pretty much any other democracy in the world.

13
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:24,350
Instead, we need to put it a whole week later. This at least also has the advantage that it has some sense of what we're going to be doing.

14
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,990
As you might imagine, some years this class has a certain large component of what you might call group therapy,

15
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:37,730
depending on the results and the composition of the class. And some years, it's a much easier environment in which I speak at the science.

16
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:42,320
So today, this week, I think it's likely to be much more political science.

17
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,540
This is a very interesting election, a very odd election, an incredibly important election.

18
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,080
And, you know, since I'm showing my professional identity,

19
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,240
it's also one that is actually probably very good for both public health and American democracy,

20
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:00,410
even if no matter what your politics are, you can find a reason to be unhappy.

21
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:06,830
And the more interested you are in the policy in politics, the more likely it is that every election will make you happy.

22
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:12,610
It's like the joke about Michigan football fans. They're not happy. They're not happy in the same way.

23
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:18,470
Anybody who cares deeply about a policy area or is deeply interested in politics really isn't that unhappy?

24
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:23,530
Because think about social media. What you see on Instagram, certainly.

25
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:27,940
What makes people watch Fox News? Their identity. What drives Twitter?

26
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,490
Fear. Investing in politics. Basic human emotion.

27
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:41,079
So what I want you to do is. Take a couple of bits and just think of a couple of questions.

28
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:45,180
And I'm going to give a little basic explanation of what happened instead of slides.

29
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,519
I have lots of Washington Post up here because I've discovered that when I do this,

30
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:54,219
I spend more time strolling around shooting maps than I do, showing anything resembling a list of bullet points.

31
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,830
But I'll talk about what was expected, what happened, why it might happen, and what it likely means.

32
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,700
And I'd like you to just take a couple minutes to talk to each other and think of some things you'd like to know, and I will do my absolute best.

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:16,570
It could be an abstract concept. So 5 minutes, no pressure to one side of the hill, preferably Kilpatrick.

34
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:34,900
But that's not true, isn't it?

35
00:03:42,580 --> 00:05:01,060
I want to ask you to smile at the moment because I want you all right?

36
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,500
I want to do what's right.

37
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:18,340
Yes. Okay.

38
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:44,800
I need you to more than anything else.

39
00:05:45,790 --> 00:06:04,840
This is where I wish I was like that right now.

40
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:34,120
And then you will accept me. I don't know anything about my ideas about what's going on.

41
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,090
Right. Okay.

42
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:45,600
So hold on your questions.

43
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:53,769
And I hope that they hang on to them and I'm going to run through a quick sort of seed setting exercise that I hope is useful for you as promised,

44
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:58,059
four points, and then basically try to figure out what happens.

45
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,470
What is the point? One, expectations. What did we expect to happen?

46
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:08,260
Now, there's two kinds of ways you can predict American elections. One is we call the political variables.

47
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,700
And they would have predicted, based on the average, what happened in midterm elections.

48
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,450
This is all against the parties in the White House. Right. Voters responded to the White House.

49
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:27,180
And they would predict that the party, White House, the Democrats would have lost an average of two Senate seats and about 40 House seats.

50
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,780
Well, see, that's not actually what happened. Um. Now there's a number of reasons for this, and it's really, really hard to pass it out.

51
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,940
You have to really enjoy public opinion, intellectual data, but it's kind of interesting to review them.

52
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:43,000
One of them is what we call Thermostatic,

53
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:50,500
which is that voters habitually regard one of the parties in the White House as having gotten by and they hold back against it.

54
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,620
So Obama had a huge backlash in 2010 because a bunch of voters,

55
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:59,069
the Affordable Care Act and the rest of the Obama administration and Obama as a British,

56
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:05,630
you know, Trump had a huge backlash in 2018 because a whole bunch of voters regarded everything he was doing, just going a bit too far.

57
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:12,770
We call that Thermostatic. And it basically assumes that to the extent that the party in the White House actually tries to do anything significant,

58
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:18,770
you're going to see a backlash against it by voters who somehow have a big sense that that's not politics,

59
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,060
regardless of whether you do all the personal opinions or agree with them,

60
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:30,430
that this is a pattern of the excessive party in the White House that results in them to the extent that they actually do it.

61
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,450
Because given the amount of stuff the Biden administration has done, this would have predicted a pretty rough election.

62
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:43,549
That is mobilization and demobilization. I remember telling students in January 2017 that it was going to be a fabulous

63
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:47,150
labor market for them as they worked as a kind of progressive left ecosystem.

64
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:51,949
Because just like clockwork, Trump gets elected in an absolute tidal wave of money,

65
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:57,290
flows into Planned Parenthood or the ACLU and all the organizations that he left out of the political spectrum.

66
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:01,819
So it's apparent that. And likewise, it was really,

67
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:08,030
really good year to be a young conservative in 2021 because there's a whole lot of pent

68
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,230
up anger and money that would follow conservative causes and conservative voters.

69
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,250
There's a small version of that statement, by the way. Hillary I to tell that.

70
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,080
Now, that's a small version, a much bigger dynamic, which is that basically when you're in the White House, you tend to.

71
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,380
Right. Because if you fundamentally have the presidency, it doesn't feel like things are that bad.

72
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:32,010
That's the thing about governors as well. It doesn't feel like it's that bad.

73
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:38,970
So it's like lot of the parties go down the number of phone calls to of people, percentages goes down.

74
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:42,990
The other half, the people who don't like the president more impact is more animated.

75
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:50,610
They put more effort in and it pays off. So you would predict with a Democrat in the White House he would have higher Republican polling.

76
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:56,870
You actually did get this. We actually didn't see a Republican majority for a while.

77
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,250
And that. Those are the two. Those are the two big ones.

78
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,870
Then there were a whole bunch of frankly not very believable theses about, for example,

79
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:12,719
whether culture or political issues matter and whether campaigns are going to matter will come back

80
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,700
because of the level of stuff that they discuss in political journalism pretty clearly does not matter.

81
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,200
So are the political things. Then there's the economic argument.

82
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,720
The economic argument is really, really simple.

83
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:31,920
The single most powerful determinant in American election results is household income growth in the two quarters before the election.

84
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,750
So Q2 and Q3 people do not have the ability to remember their income a year ago.

85
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,700
But they can't tell if things are getting better right now.

86
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,370
So an intelligent politician, there's plenty of evidence that they think this will actually manipulate the economy.

87
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:53,570
So it grows right before they come up for reelection and possible. Next time you read business news about that.

88
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,209
Now, the problem is we don't read our economic statistics.

89
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:02,500
The American economy isn't completely crazy for two years without a job search.

90
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:07,330
On one hand, we have very, very low unemployment.

91
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,530
We have seen skyrocketing wages.

92
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,950
Right then you notice nothing works like Ann Arbor at 9:00.

93
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:17,260
It's a ghost town. I remember when all those businesses were open.

94
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:27,130
Having all this stuff in my morning pocket is a sign saying Sorry, one showed up over ten people there, I think $50 an hour,

95
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:33,370
which would have been a very immediate salary for a basic service sector job, even a fairly miserable one.

96
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,240
In other words, we see really, really high wage increases.

97
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:42,910
We're seeing quite substantial increases in. The quality of people starts.

98
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:48,370
Most of the change that you see in the labor force is actually people voted for the best for the sector jobs, the better service sector job.

99
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:55,930
So if we're going to Starbucks, to them moving to Starbucks someplace, that's the kind of thing to seeing.

100
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:01,239
And of course, for example, it's pretty standard in a lot of low end, low salary jobs.

101
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:08,200
The health care industry, because maybe it's old enough to stand up as a hospital side is an exceptionally

102
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,270
unpleasant job and we don't pay well at this point in people with in that.

103
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:17,210
So. For one lady.

104
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,640
The American economy has been absolutely fantastic running on all cylinders.

105
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:28,420
You know, jump in. We're going for a ride. Now, is that necessarily the narrative that you would think there's something else that this.

106
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:37,469
The. And there's a lot of debate about why exactly we are having inflation, but we are definitely having inflation support.

107
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,820
Inflation is running higher. That basically it probably is headed for your lives.

108
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,240
And what this means, of course, is inflation degrades the value of our.

109
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:52,530
So yes, to behave more about the other. And it is also possible, you know, you got a better job.

110
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:59,879
But you've also got, I guess at gas prices are extraordinarily influential in people's understanding of our economy,

111
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,290
despite the fact that they really shouldn't.

112
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:08,430
So my dream is that we, every hospital be at a price that the couple does the things that they do as part of their business.

113
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,910
So we have this site outside cities where birth costs today.

114
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,990
So inflation and inflation is inevitable for all of us.

115
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,090
Know, basically every American buys gas. Pretty much everywhere I see about 50.

116
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:29,690
But what inflation does is the rates will rise.

117
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:35,260
So the people who are most angry about inflation tend to be the people who have the most wealth.

118
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:41,940
So for example, you like inflation. It's a fixed rate mortgage because it means you're getting more money to pay off the cycle.

119
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:47,140
So you don't like it if you actually own a house. Pretty clear because it diminishes the value of your house.

120
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:58,020
So inflation does reduce everybody's household income growth, but it particularly reduces the household wealth of people who have wealth.

121
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,950
And I hope we see by now that the American political system is extremely responsive to people with.

122
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:15,560
Results. The basic proposition of household income growth determines electoral outcomes broadly, leading to judgments on the party in office.

123
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,340
As White House doesn't work super well because we don't have enough data.

124
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:27,320
Because we have enough data. The other piece is very late and even then we circle back to the 1960s.

125
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:33,080
And so if you could think of a reason that the 1960s might be in some way, shape or form different from the 2020s, right?

126
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,230
So for. So we have a conviction for paper is.

127
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,080
So everybody asking if the police what was going to happen.

128
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:48,610
And I gave my honest professional answer grounded in an honest review of science as well as visual contribution to literature.

129
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:01,150
This was one of the things that was possible. This tells you that household income growth in the eyes of people with the Democratic Party on.

130
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,160
So what? We expected the Democrats to take a pasting.

131
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:15,760
And afterwards you I should have predicted it probably by have been provided will be investigated within an inch of his life.

132
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,179
It doesn't really matter. Find anything wrong? You just expect like an impeachment.

133
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:25,690
There was a solid majority of Republicans in the House of Representatives. Then if you tried the Senate, there would be a majority to the House.

134
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:31,180
But we would just be establishing the tradition that whenever the opposition party controls the House, they impeach the President.

135
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:37,469
Whatever. Good about. That would not be a healthy dynamic, but it was one that was pretty much expected,

136
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:42,840
so I pretty much had to take care of the baby was going to be a huge factor over that.

137
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:51,780
But then it happened. So that's what most of the political class expected to see.

138
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,270
The top line is the Democrats did really well in terms of seats.

139
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,760
So look at these two bars at the top.

140
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:07,829
They already are going to keep the Senate assuming nobody dies because 5050 Senate, the deciding vote is cast by the vice president.

141
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:12,120
Who is Kamala Harris, the Democrat. That's already interesting.

142
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:16,470
What it means is they picked up Pennsylvania, a Republican senator, retired, and.

143
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,970
Was replaced by Democrat John Fetterman.

144
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:25,460
That was an enormously entertaining election, particularly, if you like, watching good social media strategies.

145
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,210
Because Dr. Oz, the.

146
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:39,430
Is it is it hard? Is it to say he's a quack? Anyway, Dr. Oz, a doctor of unorthodox understanding of science,

147
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:43,360
medicine and medical ethics, ran for the Senate despite obviously living in New Jersey.

148
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:49,320
And one of the great comic themes of the entire election was the way that the Fetterman campaign completely ether him,

149
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:52,300
like they did things like get him nominated for the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

150
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,290
And they had airplanes towing banners around over New Jersey sporting events.

151
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:03,380
Welcome back. Dr. Oz is one of New Jersey's great citizens. It was a very, very funny campaign, right.

152
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:11,430
That doesn't necessarily win you a Senate seat, but it was musical. It's to finish the Senate.

153
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,460
We have a runoff in Georgia. Georgia's a super interesting case.

154
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:21,030
First of all, for most of my life, Georgia was not in the business of deciding whether or not Democrats keep a liberal majority.

155
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:32,139
Furthermore, the Georgia campaign is between. Well, the road to the Georgia campaign is between the Reverend Warnock,

156
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:37,690
who is the incumbent who was elected for two years on January eight, on January six, 2021, the date.

157
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:45,730
And so he's up for reelection. And Herschel Walker, and we're going to come back around to Herschel Walker.

158
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,300
But does anybody have a view that we know about Herschel Walker?

159
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,120
He's one of the more interesting characters of the cycle, despite some great characters.

160
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:11,430
He's like a retired football player and he's very much like endorsed by Trump and he's also very much pro-life.

161
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:24,769
But then it was discovered that he had and then his partners have like abortions, and then he tempted to get into an abortion.

162
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:29,320
And she now has a child. And he's the father of.

163
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,860
And he's also very much against all US champions.

164
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:41,610
Also on this ABC election.

165
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:51,920
How does that make sense of the issues between them and how is it about those issues that the

166
00:18:54,450 --> 00:19:07,790
member states he'd like to share and make sure that it's not as much legal status as you know?

167
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,870
My daughter gets the little bill on the fly like this thesis.

168
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:19,049
By this logic, she's like, If you get a little plastic, okay, you're going to get it.

169
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:19,740
Essentially with her.

170
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:29,580
She doesn't do debates because I mean, in all honesty, I think college athlete helmets have probably improved a lot since he was a player.

171
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,170
He lies constantly. He lies in ways that are easily provable.

172
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:40,049
Deny that he graduated from the University of Florida graduate student like football for the SC school.

173
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:44,610
Right. What do you expect and what he does discuss policy.

174
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:48,059
He says things that don't make a great deal of sense.

175
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:56,100
For example, his view on climate change is that China sending a bad air, better air that will send a better air to China and we get better China.

176
00:19:56,550 --> 00:20:02,370
And I'm not entirely sure what his theory is behind that. So Walker is what we call a very flawed candidate.

177
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:11,940
But Trump is in a grudge match with a number of establishment Georgia Republicans who did not work hard enough to find votes for him,

178
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:16,620
shall we say, at the 2020 election. So he endorsed Walker, despite Walker being realistic.

179
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:26,980
What candidate? And now Walker is out there as essentially an avatar of Trump alone running a terrible campaign against an incumbent senator.

180
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:32,030
Well, among other things, was the pastor of the other Besar Baptist Church, which was part of the King George Church.

181
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:40,790
So that's not a consequential point. In fact, let me see if I can find the ads to show you how they're doing politics in Georgia right now.

182
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:57,170
Okay. Let's see. So Facebook. I might show you a Facebook.

183
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,730
We told them as we were coming.

184
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:23,620
And that's exactly what I would say, that if I have something good to say about himself, if she really wants to represent daughter and such,

185
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:29,920
he's trying to scare people by taking things I've said out of context of over 25 years of the past.

186
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,320
But I think your audience will see your hat for what they are, don't you?

187
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:42,800
I love your war, and I think we approve this message. That's pretty brutal, wasn't it?

188
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:49,730
Also just look at so many of the things. Look away more or less the background, the breed of the dog.

189
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,690
Look at the timing. That was a really, really carefully calculated ad to show in Georgia in 2020.

190
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,720
It also tell you this is a very complicated. We show you what's happening to Walker now.

191
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,400
This is why they used solar panels.

192
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:31,029
The reason is not about sunlight or whether or not you're looking at remarks made this weekend

193
00:22:31,030 --> 00:22:38,140
by Republican U.S. Senate here and now that if you look at the most recent developments,

194
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,270
some concern for in this Sunday's Herschel Walker event in Hall County on Facebook,

195
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:53,290
the GOP candidate did not take questions and climate change is off the table.

196
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:01,510
On the same saying he referenced in south Georgia hometown to launch into a folksy take on climate today.

197
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:18,340
So what would you be willing to to all of them saying it would be better for all that?

198
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:28,120
That is what I would ask them to tell you.

199
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:38,650
How do they want me to explain media here on Twitter?

200
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,629
Walker's critics had great fun with how the U.S. Senate candidate said what he said that

201
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:50,800
his backers heard a clear message is addressing the nuanced nature of climate control.

202
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,950
Atmosphere Republican strategist Ed Gillespie says Walker is making a valid point.

203
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:03,390
So. Would you really want to go into one on one run off between these two guys on this Herschel Walker team?

204
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:10,830
That is one very good campaign and that is one very flawed candidate I think that you just watched.

205
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:17,130
So it'll be interesting to watch how much money Republicans put into that race going forward.

206
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:45,460
Since I'm showing you, that's from Georgia. Let me see if I can find the best. Okay.

207
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:50,210
But basically blocker, you know, turkey bulldog, very weird player, by the way.

208
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,780
He was incredibly good or or just like a lot of people.

209
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,069
In fact, I never knew I couldn't be less interested. The Georgia Bulldogs.

210
00:24:58,070 --> 00:25:00,860
But if you study politics, you end up learning a lot of weird things, right?

211
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,889
This one had to learn a lot about, you know, Oprah Winfrey's favorite doctor, the history of the Georgia football team.

212
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:14,180
And so they had a lot of fans, like showing their autographed Herschel Walker helmets and their Herschel Walker jerseys,

213
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:17,980
all the wall of their pictures of Herschel Walker getting trophies, Heisman.

214
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,929
And all they said over and over again was that's where he belongs.

215
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:27,169
He belongs in a photo on my wall receiving a Heisman Trophy.

216
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:31,970
He belongs that, you know, as a year of honor that I paid for.

217
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:37,310
He doesn't belong in the Senate. Alison Poole at. And I leave you to think about that, right?

218
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:44,400
Because the cultural politics of those two clips, I think, are very much worth while thinking about what he had learned was portraying himself.

219
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:52,380
It's like a Southerner, emasculated. And also, when you think about what was going on when Walker was performing for the people of the country.

220
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:59,160
So that's the set. Walker is basically a straightforward proxy for Trump.

221
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:04,159
He's a terrible candidate. We're about to learn what happens when you have a straightforward Trump proxy sitting out there,

222
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,190
isolated in Georgia, and it's not going to decide control of the Senate.

223
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,310
I think we basically don't know. But it might be a good day for Democrats.

224
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:15,340
More results. It's health.

225
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:25,810
This was not what anybody expected. So basically the Republicans picked up nine seats.

226
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,410
The Democrats lost nine seats.

227
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:37,820
It is almost impossible to see a Democratic majority, but you're looking at an extremely thin Republican majority of a couple of votes.

228
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,770
We'll talk about what that means. But a broad headline is that the House is going to be pretty chaotic.

229
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:48,830
Meanwhile in the States. Two things happened.

230
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:56,960
This is the first race since 1934 that the party in control of the White House did not lose a single state legislative chamber.

231
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,850
And which is a fact. And fact. Democrats picked up a number.

232
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:09,680
They picked up Minnesota. They possibly picked up New Hampshire, I believe, by like literally one candidate won by one vote, one candidate won by two.

233
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:17,610
So if you think your vote doesn't matter, think about that. And they also picked up and held a number of states.

234
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:22,790
So Michigan is now a Democratic trifecta. This is the effect of redistricting,

235
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,310
the state of redistricting to become much more competitive after has been extremely gerrymandered for the Republicans.

236
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,060
You can see the difference in that.

237
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,530
Wisconsin is still very heavily gerrymandered and a Democratic voting majority produced a new Republican supermajority.

238
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,940
In Michigan, the increased competitiveness this time happens to have led to Democrats being

239
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,240
in charge of all three branches of the state for the first time since 1983.

240
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,300
Now, if you look, though, the other thing to pay attention to is that let us be very,

241
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:56,640
very clear that Trump thinks the 2020 election was stolen from him,

242
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,920
and he thinks that there were a number of Republican and Democratic officeholders who were instrumental in doing that,

243
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:09,990
principally the governors and secretaries of state of swing states, which are specifically Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan.

244
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:19,540
This led to a large number of people who deny the 2020 election or are quite explicit that they would work as hard as they could to,

245
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,960
for example, in the case of Michigan, throw out postal votes from Detroit on the ground.

246
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:30,130
And guess what? If you throw up postal votes and early votes from Detroit, you know, Democratic candidates chances, right?

247
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:36,580
Detroit's a very large number of Democratic votes. Almost all of these races were won by Democrats.

248
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:45,590
Right. So, for example, secretary of state deliberately runs the elections and in most cases has some role in certifying the elections.

249
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:51,349
A secretary of state who regards Democratic victories as presumptively illegitimate as the Secretary of State would

250
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:57,679
be capable at 2024 of almost single handedly throwing the presidential election into the House of Representatives,

251
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:06,620
where because of the Constitution, it would be decided by a Republican majority, regardless of how of a state or, for that matter, the country voted.

252
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:15,530
So in terms of elections and the likelihood that 2024 is a free and fair election, that leads to something like a majority verdict.

253
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:17,360
This is a very, very good day.

254
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:23,840
I would say that overwhelmingly Republican candidates even quite far breathing once when they happened to lose conceded,

255
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:28,760
which was not necessarily a norm that was going to survive the events of 2020, 2021.

256
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:34,880
Finally, I would point out the Trump endorsed candidates did rather badly.

257
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,110
Now, this is the dirty secret about health care. It's not that popular.

258
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:46,270
Not in the sense that a large number of Democrats truly hate him, but in the sense that he's not a particularly popular politician.

259
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:52,519
He and Hillary Clinton were the two least popular presidential candidates in the history of public opinion,

260
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,200
fought right from the point of view of most Americans. It was a really bad choice that they were offered.

261
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:01,100
And that's part of they'll have to go beyond the politics.

262
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:11,550
But Trump also, he has this particular magnetic force as well as his, you know, adrenaline matched his attribute of eligibility.

263
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,600
But a lot of the candidates don't they didn't want Herschel Walker to go.

264
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,650
Yeah, he's my leader. Did you even know what he was talking about?

265
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,690
That was the good air. And you see a lot of this, right?

266
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,560
You see a lot of these candidates who are Trump endorsed and do quite poorly.

267
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:35,940
So one of the things that you're seeing now in the Republican Party is a lot of fallout,

268
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,720
which is that to the extent that they do what Trump wants, they seem to do worse in the general election.

269
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,910
And that's as you see some of the actions.

270
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:53,200
Also point out, Michigan, we have this process of composition to amend the state constitution or pass laws, and it's much easier to vote.

271
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:56,050
That's is not allowed. The state can be redistricted, get rid of their hand.

272
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:02,560
And of course, Proposition three still versus place in the state constitution, essentially.

273
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:08,140
And the interesting thing about the opposition to Prop three was that it did ask people to vote against abortion.

274
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:13,480
What it did was it said if you saw the signs go outside the local Catholic Church, have a look.

275
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:21,660
It says, too complex, too radical. And if you watched the ads, what they said is that abortion is already constitutional in Michigan brackets.

276
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:26,260
That's not entirely what the 1931 law was stated by the state Supreme Court,

277
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,219
by a state court judge pending a Supreme Court hearing as to whether the Michigan

278
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,110
Constitution before the amendment contained a provision that would make abortion legal.

279
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:40,970
So they said you have constitutional in Michigan. In other words, you don't need it.

280
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:48,800
Abortion is fine and it's radical because they in a whole lot of plans that basically don't make any sense about the impact of trans rights.

281
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:56,209
So it's very noticeable that the anti Prop three campaign did not appeal to its core constituency, which was people an abortion,

282
00:31:56,210 --> 00:32:04,760
and instead it aimed at making claims targeted at people who actually are pro-choice in an effort to diffuse what I would call an honorable campaign.

283
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:11,159
So moving on. Why did this happen? Well, economics.

284
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:17,670
First of all, it turns out that having a red hot labor market at $50 an hour and a better job is actually something people like.

285
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:25,120
Secondly, this. The student loan forgiveness thing was a really, really big deal.

286
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:31,120
One of the striking things about this election is fairly high given the usual dismal level participation

287
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:37,750
of people between 1835 who typically just don't show up with it in any significant numbers.

288
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:46,149
And one of the reasons seems to be that they just gave a $10,000 worth of student loan forgiveness and thereby that negative well, positive.

289
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:50,080
Well, they like that. So Joe Biden is good at politics,

290
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:56,550
speaking as one of the many political scientists who underrepresented under estimated him and or wondering what we got wrong.

291
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,910
Gerrymandering. This works against Democrats, but if you look at that House margin.

292
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,340
I can give you a list of states where gerrymandering.

293
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,760
The differently would have led to a Democratic majority. Right.

294
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:17,920
So, for example, the Supreme Court has been ruling that voting rights protections, including majority rule.

295
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:23,060
So if those decisions hadn't taken place, you would have had a number of black representatives.

296
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:26,500
States like Alabama. And I was supposed looking at the Democrats.

297
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,799
So you can see very clearly the interaction of the Supreme Court,

298
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:37,480
along with gerrymandering and then the gerrymandering taking effect and actually the House majority, which is absolutely the case.

299
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,110
DOBBS I've got to do a lot of arguments with political science about what Dobbs would mean.

300
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:50,550
Their theory was that attitudes on abortion were basically based into partizanship

301
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:55,409
because we know that essentially a pro-choice Republican or an anti-abortion Democrat,

302
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:01,430
I know we're vanishingly rare people. If you have a strong partizan identity that matches almost perfectly with your sample, you.

303
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:09,290
My counter argument is, first of all, that taking rights away from people is far harder than campaigning into rights rights.

304
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:16,100
So it's a much harder ask to say let's expand the range of rights in society than it is to say defend the rights that you already have.

305
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,920
Furthermore, go back to the framing issue, right? Abortion has been framed almost exclusively as a question of sexual.

306
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,919
Which it is like. That's fundamentally one of the most important things we're talking about.

307
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,180
What we discuss abortion is do you have sexual autonomy or don't you?

308
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:41,800
However, that frames it is basically a fairly tightly wound question as to whether women in their twenties should have sexual reproduction.

309
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:52,320
And we debated that for 40 years. But now a whole lot of other fragments have jumped onto the stage.

310
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:59,040
What happens to a ten year old who has been raped? What happens to a ten year old who has been raped by a family member?

311
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:03,110
What happens to a woman within a time pregnancy? Right.

312
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:10,560
These are all questions, all start to arise because fundamentally it's one thing to have an abstract debate in which why abortion would be illegal,

313
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:14,670
it's that person's abortion would be illegal. Well, suddenly abortion is illegal.

314
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:19,170
And you discovered that while that was reassuring to tell yourself, it didn't actually have to do with the law.

315
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:25,170
So that's probably made a lot of changes. And while I don't want to go too heavy on the value of this data.

316
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:33,060
I love to ask people to guess the demographic that appears to have the hardest towards both caring about abortion at all.

317
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,210
Because, as you know, from having been alive that society started, the conversation about abortion rights is a great way to not have any friends.

318
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:40,980
And.

319
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:49,220
Started becoming very, very pro-choice after having incoherent opinions befitting they're not be very interested I guess included society that was.

320
00:35:52,390 --> 00:36:02,170
Fathers. Abortion rights becomes extremely concrete if you are a kid.

321
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,840
It doesn't matter what the gender of the kid is, right?

322
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:10,360
Because if the kid is capable of giving birth, you're simply looking at some very different possible futures.

323
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:17,450
And if the kid is capable of causing someone else to give birth, you're also actually looking at sort of the consequences of it,

324
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,580
where something went wrong that led to consequences that last for a minimum of 18 years.

325
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:24,820
And that's not realistic for kids.

326
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,299
So certainly a lot of fathers decided this actually is an issue that they care about and it's one in which they have a stance.

327
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:34,930
And it's the stance that we predict of somebody who's actually trying to protect their

328
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:38,800
existing child from the hypothetical future consequences of something going wrong at that.

329
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,490
Finally, candidate quality. So back to the water. This is awful.

330
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,400
It's not just that there were some Trump backed candidates who are pretty poor.

331
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:53,150
It's not just that. Peter Thiel, who is the founder of PayPal Friends of.

332
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:00,160
Elon Musk. Finance some Republican candidates to win the primaries.

333
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:04,320
In, for example, Arizona were very, very weak. General election candidate lost.

334
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:09,670
But we hold on to the Arizona Senate seat so the Republicans could take on the Arizona Senate seat.

335
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:17,829
But that was like pastors who was very strange as it cut a two minute long campaign ad where we drove out into this place that really had a very,

336
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:23,620
very strong sort of breaking bad side. It's like this sort of weird, hilly desert outside Tucson.

337
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,700
And it shows like there is a water.

338
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,010
At least that's firing randomly into the wilderness. The whole thing really has this very profoundly strange vibe.

339
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,720
Like I said, Breaking Bad. This is what we call a weak candidate.

340
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:42,930
You've got to cut an ad like that to get against this.

341
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:50,040
2 minutes. So do they deserve to talk lovingly about this German gun algo that.

342
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:57,599
So yeah, that was a good candidate. That's one from. Right. Peter Thiel bankrolled like masters in Arizona.

343
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:03,700
And then Blake Masters went to law school. Donald Trump endorsed Herschel Walker.

344
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,810
And Herschel Walker is not really the candidate that you would choose for a highly competitive seat against an incumbent senator.

345
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,690
But there's also a bigger back problem, which is Donald Trump's endorsements are really powerful.

346
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,980
So, for example, why do you have such an absolutely awful slate of candidates?

347
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:25,230
Michigan. I hope you're paying attention to the Michigan statewide candidates, but.

348
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:30,760
They were not convinced. Well, here's the thing.

349
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:35,170
Running for office takes at least a year, and it takes all of your waking hours to do it.

350
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:40,629
You can't do anything else outside. Spend all your time talking to donors, traveling at the state, meeting voters,

351
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,440
talking to party powerbrokers, talking to the media, running your campaign.

352
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,959
So we're talking about a minimum year if you are confident, as you should be,

353
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:55,730
if you're a Republican, that all of that could be wiped out by the onset of Donald Trump.

354
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:56,300
Are you going to do it?

355
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:06,780
Going to spend a year on the campaign trail like you can do something else if you will follow the Donald Trump to destroy all of us.

356
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:12,890
The personnel. So the broad pattern of dragging out all the candidates.

357
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:22,700
So Michigan Republicans started out with a fairly weak slate of candidates who were all confident that they could get Donald Trump's endorsement,

358
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:28,220
because it's not an intelligent idea to say, look, Michigan, unless you pick Donald Trump's candidacy,

359
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:34,480
this is all about how people view Donald Trump's endorsement of my candidacy.

360
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:42,200
Then it was a moment of comedy in which to the two leading candidates, one of them the former Detroit police chief.

361
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:47,230
Of at the highest quality candidates you've ever seen,

362
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:53,680
but they're able to do it all through the same canvasing company to get the signatures needed to get on the ballot.

363
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:01,510
At the company that forged the signatures and got their patients to the ballot thrown out,

364
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:06,010
leaving the Republicans with a whole bunch of candidates who have heard of which is how to predict,

365
00:40:06,010 --> 00:40:11,860
said who is basically a small time business consultant, somehow found herself as a candidate for governor for the Republican Party.

366
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:19,430
Predictably enough, Republican powerbrokers took one look at her and said that, which is how she went into the election race.

367
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:27,020
That really point six. And I saw those two on two staff at being outspent 26 to 1 by Gretchen Whitmer.

368
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,650
If you're being outspent 26 to 1 in a major party competition,

369
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,230
this tells you that your entire political party has decided you're dead in the water and they're not going to throw good money after bad.

370
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:42,120
That was what happened in Michigan. That's what we mean when we say candidate quality problem.

371
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:50,860
For sheer entertainment value. Over here we have McConnell Faces Senate Leadership Challenge GOP House Control.

372
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:58,660
Rick Scott, the guy who paid one of the largest fines in the history of health insurance when he was CEO

373
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,220
of a health insurance company and parlayed that into becoming a health senator from Florida.

374
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:09,190
So Republican is chair of the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee.

375
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:15,400
Lost a whole bunch of races, you would say, and is now challenging Mitch McConnell to the Senate.

376
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:22,000
Minority leader on the basis that McConnell was a party member, which I think is pretty much the definition of the.

377
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:29,500
So that's probably what it boils down to, right? The economy is working well for a lot of people who might not otherwise turn out well.

378
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:37,170
There are a number of policies that probably on the margin, many people identified as Democratic policies that they might do more forgiveness.

379
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:48,220
The mother. Doss probably mattered quite a lot in terms of changing overall perceptions of the Republican Party.

380
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,060
And candidate quality was, in large part, the Trump effect.

381
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:59,720
Finally, like the effects in Michigan, it's now institutionally much more blue state.

382
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:03,540
It's a much more politically competitive state. Being politically competitive is good.

383
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:10,290
Life expectancy is longer. Development is better in politically competitive states because the politicians actually do things that people.

384
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:15,170
So getting rid of the gerrymander leads to better life expectancy in Michigan to do that.

385
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,010
Biden is going to have a much easier time. The federal courts are going to be like nominees approved by a Democratic Senate.

386
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:28,560
So after January, expect the Democrats to absolutely pull the pedal to the metal until at the federal level,

387
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,799
reports of nominees who are Democrats and the Democratic nominees under Biden are not like the nominees previously.

388
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,300
Lots of coalescing. In terms of 2020 for two effects.

389
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:46,240
One is it's going to get much harder to actually contestable learning of the election, although the Supreme Court might have a say in that.

390
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:52,590
And it's much more likely that Biden is going to have gone to develop, for example, impeachment,

391
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:58,440
because that would require a House majority and instead have gone in with a legacy of achievements.

392
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:04,220
There's also going to be another fiddlesticks, like a lame duck, will probably be able to get lots of funding through crates or not completely

393
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:07,790
standard stuff is not going to be clear under a House majority Republican.

394
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:20,600
Finally this. Tells you that the House is going to be chaotic because the Democrats under Nancy Pelosi

395
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:24,920
were remarkably unified by their own historical standards of I won't comparative standards.

396
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:33,979
This is going to be very, very marginal for the simple reason that if the Republicans have a two or three vote majority that turns a sexually,

397
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:39,560
every single Republican into the center, into the larger party.

398
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:45,450
Already the Freedom Caucus, for example, which is basically the Trump focused caucus,

399
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:48,950
which has got 40 hard core members and a bunch more who essentially orbit them,

400
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:56,010
has presented the prospective Republican leader and Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, with a list of demands that this actually be.

401
00:43:56,010 --> 00:44:00,750
The Speaker of the House had no control over the House, which would have turned off every committee to do its thing,

402
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:05,310
which would mean in many cases they're all going investigate Hunter Biden and they're going to spend

403
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:11,010
two years getting attention to a story that simply has not got any traction with the general public.

404
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:16,540
Finally in the lame duck session session, we're likely to see a bunch of things,

405
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:23,229
including there's a Senate bipartisan effort to address same sex marriage law, even though it doesn't say the Supreme Court can't overrule.

406
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:29,920
So unless we pass it and hope the Supreme Court doesn't rule and as I told you and I think as the election is, reports that.

407
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,180
Okay. I think that's the basics. This is a very interesting election.

408
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:50,320
You've got questions, perhaps, that raise more questions. This is an option.

409
00:44:51,420 --> 00:45:04,530
That is the selection of representative of the changes that a lot of the schools receive before the election, which is Republican funded.

410
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:13,410
If were any major pollsters that were getting good samples, I know like there's the Oregon district for a buck 30,

411
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,630
it's forecast to get a decent chance for the Democratic race.

412
00:45:16,650 --> 00:45:24,500
And she won. And so, like, is it because it's a midterm representative or is this a forecast?

413
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:28,810
So the opportunity and then the politics to talk to us.

414
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:32,550
Great. That was a great question.

415
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,460
I had a landline phone I gave you.

416
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:44,700
You're all nodding your heads in a way that tells me you're saying of course, it says it's going to be looking to house those.

417
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:50,860
So. I will trust. This is an unusual city.

418
00:45:51,540 --> 00:46:05,689
I thought so. The response rate for these polls would probably go to my office a little bit, 70%, which would be amazing if they're accurate.

419
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:10,419
So here's what happened. For a long time. We were trying to go for pull aggregator sites.

420
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,069
So that's the place that really is.

421
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:17,680
That's what Real Clear Politics is to take a whole bunch of polls based on the hierarchy, concerned about how they make them.

422
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:21,640
And like silver is not transparent about it at all.

423
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,820
And then they give you a likelihood,

424
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,650
they give you a polling average of the likelihood that that translates into a victory, which are different types of polls.

425
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:40,320
Here's the role. The Republicans explicitly supporter was one of the biggest participants in this set out to create the narrative of the right way.

426
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:42,179
I genuinely don't know why they did this,

427
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:51,180
like creating a media narrative based on bad polls that doesn't have a reliable effect that is desirable to you on actual acceptance.

428
00:46:51,900 --> 00:47:00,720
So good polls hit it amazingly tightly, like the CNN College poll was at least off by like 7% on average.

429
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,590
And it was in Iran and Russia. It's really, really, really good. Right.

430
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:09,690
Most of the top quality pollsters we know them ever want you back here to help you with Gallup.

431
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:14,100
They hit this election. Exactly. It was a great election for pollsters.

432
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,940
It was a terrible election for poll aggregators because their averages were

433
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,890
getting stuck with poor quality polls commissioned by Republican polling houses.

434
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:28,619
I think this constitutes a gigantic waste of money by Republicans because what do

435
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:32,490
you achieve if you do all of all say the press is going to lose the election?

436
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:40,500
And the question at the risk of the election, would it be published? So it was a great election for real pollsters.

437
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:46,320
It was a terrible election for poll aggregators and all the people who averaged polls.

438
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,479
And it was a serious election in the sense that I don't know who thought it was a good idea

439
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:55,860
to take over a couple of other Republican pollsters to completely pollute the environment.

440
00:47:56,870 --> 00:48:01,770
Like all the things Republicans could spend their money on, which is that get.

441
00:48:07,820 --> 00:48:26,850
August, although. I'll just travel this city and run it secretly on a after walk party.

442
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,720
A meditation group accepted that will bring out a lot of people.

443
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:39,230
Okay, so as a rule of thumb, a party that has an incumbent president renominated the incumbent president.

444
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:45,440
Now, the same way that I said, the economic predictions don't make any sense because the economy doesn't make any sense.

445
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:53,030
This rule of thumb is not necessarily optimized. If you go to the next very old table, four very, very old candidates at the moment,

446
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,830
if we do a 2020 hedge for doing 2020, we've asked people who are very old.

447
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:01,550
And things happen to people in their later years.

448
00:49:02,950 --> 00:49:07,870
And Ronald Reagan clearly had severe Alzheimer's for most of the second term, but that didn't really seem to.

449
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:17,290
Damage has affected us all that much. So assume the renomination of an incumbent president, period.

450
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:20,460
Given the way he's been leading the party,

451
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:26,740
I would assume only the uncontested renomination because of the example of Bernie Sanders looking yet again.

452
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,920
First of all, I would really make the podium more useful.

453
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:38,110
And secondly, Bernie would take an enormous amount of flack because to a large extent, he's really got tons and tons of what you want.

454
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:43,030
His job was to shove the Democratic Party. It's always way toward will.

455
00:49:43,030 --> 00:49:52,210
Bernie wants it and to go back to talking. Right. You get reassuring, feel like doing a lot of stuff that Bernie's first campaign is not the best for.

456
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:55,870
So assume it's Biden, Asterix.

457
00:49:57,080 --> 00:50:01,640
If something happens to him, then I honestly have no idea what to predict.

458
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:10,670
Including the worst case scenario of the Democrats is a very sick tool by who doesn't look good on campaign trail and who is also still campaigning.

459
00:50:12,190 --> 00:50:17,620
Because they're helpless, right? Because if you don't think you're going to win in 2024, you see.

460
00:50:17,790 --> 00:50:22,870
So, for example, let's say Kamala Harris runs against it. She's perceived as backstabber.

461
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:26,500
She probably doesn't win. And she's lost the vice presidency.

462
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:34,090
She has all the time in the world about. I see a bit of the same thing on the Republican side.

463
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:38,890
If I to as long as it gets funded 2024, Ailes is done.

464
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:42,820
He's over politics. He waited for 28.

465
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:48,040
You might have a different offering and different experience.

466
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:56,360
Remember, parties are teams. Backstabbing a team member.

467
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:13,690
It's not you. So is it possible for the Democrats to get to prove they are featuring the speaker by choosing their own crazy Republican?

468
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:19,380
Okay. This is. It is possible.

469
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:27,280
So there it looks like there's 435 people at the house and they are just going to show up every day and do business in the house.

470
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:34,360
There has not been a single day for years. I've actually had a full house, got all sorts of names, right.

471
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:41,750
So, for example, a lot of the time the governors, when somebody dies, they're retired, etc., the governors will replace.

472
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:48,250
So, for example, Alcee Hastings, a Florida Democrats, had a great message.

473
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:54,420
And apparently great ego ran for, elected and then immediately toppled.

474
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:59,370
Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, Republican important figure, said,

475
00:51:59,370 --> 00:52:06,959
as the district is definitely the goal of the Democrats schedule and he had to be sued to

476
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:11,100
force him to schedule an election in a district that was almost certainly did represent.

477
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:15,900
So a lot of that kind of measures. So here's the two problems.

478
00:52:16,470 --> 00:52:23,670
One is that the membership of the House is not stable, is not so stable that a simple majority remains a stable, ongoing thing.

479
00:52:24,590 --> 00:52:27,900
Right. So we could add with multiple shifts before the house.

480
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:36,270
And the second, as you say, is that the House caucus is by no means other possible in flux, as they do to fire up the party.

481
00:52:37,050 --> 00:52:41,730
And there's very specific points on which they basically want a stronger in the party as.

482
00:52:43,170 --> 00:52:51,380
I don't know if the party would be a strong leader in that what he's got to work with but he's not coming off as is probably the right case.

483
00:52:51,390 --> 00:52:58,380
In particular, people are open to the party and it's worked out to the extent that he's likely to be Speaker of the House.

484
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:04,090
But it also means that he's going to be presiding over a very, very fragmented,

485
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:10,270
fragmented and mobilized, energetic and angry office that I have support.

486
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:17,830
So I think I think it would be that you don't see like a political crazy you don't see

487
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:22,000
a leadership Republican getting tossed out because that would be against their party.

488
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,200
Gives us a lot of command of the people a little.

489
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:35,160
But. You. I think you're very likely to see the party get elected and the house to an absolute right.

490
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,970
It's absolutely out of place with a high chance that.

491
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:44,439
One person resigns. One person dies. That there's a couple special elections.

492
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,870
And suddenly Nancy Pelosi. That turns out to.

493
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:54,700
Except Nancy Pelosi with one more story which would be less chaotic to have a party of one low security business insider.

494
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:08,970
To. Kind of.

495
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:24,930
Trump will still be indicted in Chicago. You guys have great questions that everybody has to ask the question.

496
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:34,970
That is not right. Yeah. So what is Trump doing? I don't like trying to gain power from things I do that I shouldn't have as successful as in my past.

497
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:44,920
But. We have essentially no precedent in American history for charges of this gravity

498
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:49,780
and this factual validity being levied against the president or president.

499
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:55,899
It's like this is completely Trump is gambling and he's not entirely wrong.

500
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:02,860
And his own wife would show him evidence for this is that the Department of Justice is now going to file criminal

501
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:08,650
charges against a group I with the January 6th committee discovered when he's actually like the president.

502
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:12,760
So I think that dictator's timing and timing is good question which one is he wants

503
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:19,780
to portray this as a political martyrdom to target and thereby destroy the charges.

504
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:26,950
And he also wants to take house sails of Ron DeSantis, who is running around trumpeting his victory in Florida that.

505
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:33,670
Here's the problem. The Department of Justice was quite openly ordered by tradition and other Democrats.

506
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,520
Trump did not act. The Department of Justice should run autonomously.

507
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:46,420
And that was the subject of a lot of the arguments inside, inside and around the park for justice for the president.

508
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:54,910
Like the rest of the executive branch. So it's going to come down to a calculation in large part by the attorney general, Merrick Garland,

509
00:55:55,810 --> 00:56:03,900
who has a very effective field and is a very slow, classic federal prosecutor with.

510
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:10,820
My hunch is that this is going to actually be like anything that's based on essentially

511
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:17,360
the victim of the federal prosecutors to file charges with us that we have to control.

512
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:24,290
There's also other players, right? The state of Georgia is pursuing the state of New York is pursuing a civil suit.

513
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:30,410
They have no incentive whatsoever to stop. So is Georgia prosecutor President Donald Trump.

514
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:41,990
That's right. Donald Trump would be very happy with the charges you did of the attorney general of New York, just got reelected as prosecutor.

515
00:56:44,010 --> 00:57:04,680
It was. Do you think that the other is also the crisis that is such a great so that that should tell

516
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:15,070
the Republicans that this is an issue in a bunch of different districts over in this country.

517
00:57:15,510 --> 00:57:19,190
That's the change that I think is okay.

518
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,000
This is this is a strategic problem for. So I don't think it's going to change their agenda.

519
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,600
But first of all, I don't personally believe that abortion is murder in an open society and life is like.

520
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,350
The right thing to do is to it. To the bishop of Detroit,

521
00:57:36,350 --> 00:57:46,840
the Catholic bishop of Detroit has called for the past tense because his point of view is something is wrong in Michigan, such as it is right.

522
00:57:47,030 --> 00:57:52,010
I don't think the bishop of Detroit plans to give up full weight. Of your surprise.

523
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:58,620
There's a number calculations here. First of all, you might have personal beliefs.

524
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:05,940
Second of all, there has been a competition to basically show your fidelity to conservatives and the pro-life

525
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:09,870
cause by coming up with more and more intensive ways to restrict access to abortion.

526
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:17,640
And I'm not sure that that dynamic is going to stop because you're primarily concerned about his Republican primary voters in Missouri or something.

527
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:21,330
There's no downside to be more and more intensely anti-abortion.

528
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:29,580
And that's going to be a hard place to stop. The third point is that even if you don't want to talk about the issue as a Republican,

529
00:58:29,670 --> 00:58:36,000
you're playing defense because not as much as states where a large portion of the population has just lost, what they do is right.

530
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:42,459
And remember. And so a segment of the population where Republicans have already been having some trouble,

531
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:47,860
basically college educated women as a whole, and that all is not going away.

532
00:58:48,070 --> 00:58:55,270
And it becomes very, very easy to design a strategy or a Democratic campaign strategy that is constantly forcing

533
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:59,890
Republicans to restate their adherence to something which is structurally very unpopular.

534
00:59:00,190 --> 00:59:07,060
Support for abortion rights at a level of Roe hovers in the seventies and eighties in the United States.

535
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:13,239
So practically everywhere this is unpopular. It's quite easy and politically intelligent to go.

536
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:18,490
Reproductive rights advocates to force Republicans over and over again to take votes to do this.

537
00:59:18,790 --> 00:59:25,900
So there is not one answer. You would get back to the Republican Party of any states by being more sensitive pro-life than the other guy.

538
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:31,390
And if you have a whole lot of reproductive rights advocates, Democrats and the media,

539
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:36,790
we're putting you on the spot and forcing you to defend the stance and have a career.

540
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:39,950
So even if you don't talk about it, a lot of other people outside.

541
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:45,549
They're basically the of the far right from a straight forward electoral mobilization stance with

542
00:59:45,550 --> 00:59:50,620
potential to the lives of the people involved running against people versus making massive.

543
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,470
Because like always, a whole lot of people,

544
00:59:53,470 --> 01:00:02,170
it'll be really tough to have it all versus you get over carried is no fun whatsoever because suddenly you go up against the defense of the people.

545
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:13,970
Before defense, you're really dealing part time. And unlike a lot of issues where it looks a bit like tinfoil hat cereal, this is really concrete.

546
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:21,370
It's very easy to make people who have terrible miscarriages. They generally have very strong views about it.

547
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:38,390
It's some abstract game. Very much so.

548
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:42,680
South Dakota also voted to extend Medicaid.

549
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:46,310
Well, at least now for that state.

550
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:49,850
But what do you think is the next state to extend?

551
01:00:52,330 --> 01:00:55,360
First of all, that appointment notice the importance of referenda.

552
01:00:55,870 --> 01:01:02,199
The reason we have statewide referendum is the progressives at the turn of the 20th century saw completely gerrymandered,

553
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:08,380
undemocratic state legislatures, and they fought to build referenda at the turn of the 21st century.

554
01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:15,430
We have completely undemocratic present state legislatures that in the state would prefer that we use it and undo it,

555
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:24,260
including initiatives to undo the very such upset state. There have been a bunch of red states where it was not radical Medicaid expansion, you know,

556
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:29,650
and it does it leads to slightly better health and much better finances, basically,

557
01:01:30,370 --> 01:01:32,100
because the effect of the American health care system,

558
01:01:32,110 --> 01:01:37,150
the fact that you're getting so much is that everything else in your life is destroyed by natural birth results.

559
01:01:38,650 --> 01:01:40,470
But it's also good for providers.

560
01:01:40,980 --> 01:01:48,210
One of the amazing things is the extent to which the fight over Medicaid expansion of the ACA in general has evolved.

561
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:53,430
Opponents of the ACA generally, Republicans basically selling out their own health care providers.

562
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:58,080
Right. Because health benefit expansion help hospitals the future.

563
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:04,790
Right. That's what I think was in disproportionately high, expensive states, which reduces health care access for everybody.

564
01:02:05,840 --> 01:02:13,129
And so South Dakota is the most recent of the states where the expansion was tragic is Mississippi,

565
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:16,350
which has a very political Supreme Court controlled by one party.

566
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:21,440
Yes, the party. And they were poised to vote pretty clearly for Medicaid expansion in Mississippi,

567
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,070
which would be just about the best social policy put set up that poor state.

568
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:30,660
And the states have been caught on pretty flimsy legal grounds throughout the entire referendum process.

569
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:34,990
So you have to have a referendum process as international.

570
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:40,719
The other takeaway, by the way, is that when you look at expansion to a multiple of success,

571
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:43,390
the Mississippi Supreme Court judges were perfectly intelligent.

572
01:02:43,390 --> 01:02:48,040
They recognized that the policy that they personally opposed with lawsuit was going to become incredibly popular.

573
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:52,180
So they removed the democratic representation of all the democratic.

574
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,600
So smart move is the way that they don't let people vote on it.

575
01:02:59,570 --> 01:03:08,280
Because a lot of people tend to go for it. As seen in people.

576
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,170
Nobody ever wrote about disaster for profit.

577
01:03:18,190 --> 01:03:26,740
What do you think the Democrats should focus their messaging and agenda on in the next couple of years and successful 2024?

578
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,450
Okay. Taxes. I only did that report.

579
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:36,850
If the political scientists were to do every political story today, I think happened and it didn't matter.

580
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:45,900
Or twice to head out. I can't tell you what Democrats should focus on, but I'll give you two answers.

581
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:53,389
So one of them is remember I went back to the predictions with the exception of candidate quality,

582
01:03:53,390 --> 01:03:57,260
which is it's extremely strange to admit that basically Donald Trump,

583
01:03:57,260 --> 01:04:01,370
it doesn't affect the Democrats who are running the rational for a political party.

584
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:06,770
Why would you do that? I actually had a message. It doesn't actually happen.

585
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:13,190
That is the largest, but a lot of the time is just reminding people of something that they already know about.

586
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:17,850
Right. The the ads tell you what to put over that.

587
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,590
So what does matter? Household income.

588
01:04:25,250 --> 01:04:28,620
American soldiers dead in war. Incumbency.

589
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:32,940
Incumbency works for you in the first election, works against you after that.

590
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:37,260
So this might be a great place for.

591
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,180
Just like 2016 was already going to be a tough year for whoever it was.

592
01:04:42,630 --> 01:04:47,250
Hillary Clinton. What is household income growth look like at this point?

593
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:51,889
We're now into a totally different class where I'm telling you what we might expect from the Fed,

594
01:04:51,890 --> 01:05:00,360
raising interest rates and shocks caused by being able to sell gas to Europe, reducing the euro,

595
01:05:00,740 --> 01:05:07,090
or save the dollar of Ukraine for jacking up the price of food, causing crises in various,

596
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,970
you know, American farmers, more money because of major crisis in other parts of the world.

597
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:19,370
Almost all of that going to be through the household in Q2, Q3, the second or third quarter or really.

598
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:25,819
There's a decent chance that inflation is going to prove to be transitory, will have the sustained spike in inflation.

599
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:32,780
It will continue the strength of the market. If you want us to look like an absolute fool at that rate, to go back down the economy.

600
01:05:34,010 --> 01:05:40,130
That's totally possible. So pay very, very, very close attention to the economy.

601
01:05:40,150 --> 01:05:47,440
If you're a Democrat and do everything you can to make sure the household income growth is good in 2024, that's the number one thing.

602
01:05:47,740 --> 01:05:50,469
And they'll start earning more if you do start to worry through.

603
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:57,010
This couple are very close to the election, so everybody's got to be careful not to do that.

604
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:03,660
The other point about messaging, to the extent that address is one of the things that,

605
01:06:04,220 --> 01:06:09,460
you know, the point is elite media talks about Democratic messaging.

606
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:13,530
We also track what actual parties are saying. So, for example,

607
01:06:13,530 --> 01:06:18,450
I can tell you basically the entire Republican campaign in the last couple of weeks

608
01:06:18,450 --> 01:06:22,470
of this campaign was about inflation and the touch of opposition to trans rights.

609
01:06:22,710 --> 01:06:27,500
That was it. And I tried to write something really simple, which is.

610
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:34,370
It's about inflation. The Democrats led on abortion, but they also did democracy.

611
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:37,780
They also did specific policies. Likes to offer this.

612
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:43,189
And well, you it is a little thesis that comes out of organizational studies that has been repeated

613
01:06:43,190 --> 01:06:47,600
and underpins a lot of decisions that smart organizations make in American life.

614
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,420
Which is that if you do it as a model, offering it as a model, that it works out.

615
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,319
Apparently organization made a very similar,

616
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:05,590
very smart people will systematically make worse decisions than an organization made of less intelligent, more diverse people.

617
01:07:06,430 --> 01:07:11,230
Right. In other words, you would predict, for example, the Tesla is going to make bigger mistakes that General Motors.

618
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:20,330
Why is this? It's because being smart is great, but being smart doesn't necessarily give you diversity sufficient to figure out what could go wrong.

619
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:26,930
It doesn't necessarily take your information, right? So being a bunch of identical tech girls, you might be really,

620
01:07:26,930 --> 01:07:31,760
really smart and you just might not notice things that would be totally obvious to somebody else.

621
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:38,040
That's the case for diversification. You might submit the Democrats because they are.

622
01:07:38,100 --> 01:07:43,710
No matter how you slice it, any possible access look like the Democrats are a much more diverse group of people.

623
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:49,169
You might submit that even if you don't like them, they are getting more diverse information,

624
01:07:49,170 --> 01:07:53,310
better understanding the scenarios, better understandings of different segments of the electorate,

625
01:07:53,400 --> 01:08:00,600
what motivates them, the views across the whole party and far more homogeneous party where overwhelmingly the principal source of views is what?

626
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:09,460
Albert Woodfox TV. So you could argue to the extent that Rupert Murdoch is deciding what Republicans interpret as valuable data.

627
01:08:10,210 --> 01:08:15,280
Being an incredibly smart person is going to be defeated by the fact that they're an incredibly smart

628
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:20,950
person operating within a worldview shaped by the thing with the risk of groupthink as a result.

629
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:25,480
That's hypothesis, but it's one that has a lot of grounding in organizational sense.

630
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:34,330
Okay. Okay. You really, really want to come to the next class because it's going to teach you how not to destroy yourself publicly and that school.
