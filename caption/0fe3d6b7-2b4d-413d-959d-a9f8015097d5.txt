1
00:00:05,708 --> 00:00:13,050
As we stressed before, negotiations do not have to be a win-lose situation.

2
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:17,480
There's actually a different way of thinking about negotiations that would

3
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:24,713
avoid the perception that negotiations are competitive as in zero-sum game.

4
00:00:24,713 --> 00:00:30,080
Broadly speaking, we negotiate only when the chance

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,200
of our success is dependent upon the decisions and

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,770
actions of other people whose position on an issue is different from ours.

7
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:48,380
Meaning, there is a conflict between our positions.

8
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:55,380
In other words, negotiation involves interdependency.

9
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,350
It is a process of interactions, the end of which is

10
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,800
to advance our interests by working with our counterpart

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:11,330
to jointly decide on an agreeable plan of action.

12
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:14,350
The fundamental goal of negotiation problem,

13
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:20,680
therefore is to advance our interests.

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,980
The keyword here is interest.

15
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:30,320
It is very important to keep in mind that interests or more specifically,

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,200
underlying interests are the raw material, the focus of negotiation.

17
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:45,120
Moreover, we should know negotiation is a means or tool for advancing interests.

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:47,690
It is not an ending, itself.

19
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:52,770
Negotiating for the sake of negotiating could be counterproductive actually,

20
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,000
likely impeding the goal of advancing of interests.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,260
As a means, negotiation is really a process of joint problem solving.

22
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,330
In fact, the essence of negotiation is this.

23
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:14,150
To advance our real interests, we must assess that yes,

24
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,580
we want from our negotiating counterparts.

25
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:22,580
And understand why they might agree to the yes,

26
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:29,020
rather than walking away from the negotiation, opting for no deal.

27
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:33,870
And to achieve that, we need to inference how they see their

28
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,490
interest in such a way that whatever they choose to decide and

29
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,170
do will serve our interests.

30
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:51,160
In other words, negotiation is the art of letting other people have our way.

31
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:59,310
As I said, the concept, interests is foundational to effective negotiation.

32
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:05,620
Your interests are whatever you care about that is at stake in the negotiation.

33
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,260
You can never be an effective negotiator if you don't know what you want.

34
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,955
So, let's think about an example.

35
00:03:13,955 --> 00:03:17,880
Say, you are negotiating with your new employer.

36
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:23,600
If your real purpose is to broaden your experience, learn new skills,

37
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:31,950
and seek opportunity for self-improvement, then those things should be your focus.

38
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:36,330
You should make sure that the conversation with your new employer and not primarily,

39
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,990
about salary.

40
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:43,200
In this case, given this example, keeping your salary

41
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,180
goal flexible will be important for productive and successful negotiation.

42
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,180
So, know thyself.

43
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,600
Knowing what you want is the core of effective deal making.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:01,580
Equally important is know thy counterparts.

45
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:07,933
A major mistake that people, including me, that we make during negotiation is that,

46
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:13,560
we confuse issues with and positions with interest.

47
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,580
They're quite different.

48
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:21,100
Issues as you see on the slides represented by the iceberg

49
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:26,730
are the items on the negotiation table to be discussed.

50
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:31,270
Positions are what people say they want.

51
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,060
It is the surface statement of where they stand on an issue.

52
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:41,640
It is just like the tip of the iceberg which is visible and apparent.

53
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,900
Interests are why people want it.

54
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,330
They are the underlying reasons and motivations.

55
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:54,200
Explaining why people take a certain position.

56
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,806
Interests represent the major part of the iceberg underneath

57
00:04:58,806 --> 00:05:02,450
the water surface that you don't see.

58
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:07,400
They are hidden and invisible.

59
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,320
Let's use an example to illustrate this concept and their differences.

60
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,110
Let's say, a project manager is negotiating with her boss

61
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:20,280
about the timeline of an important project.

62
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,060
The issue is the project timeline.

63
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,120
Now, regarding that issue,

64
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,820
the project manager wants a one month extension to finish the project.

65
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:37,690
So, her position is one month extension.

66
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:44,997
On the other hand, her boss's position is that the project has to be done on time.

67
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:48,544
No extension.

68
00:05:48,544 --> 00:05:53,180
So there's no conversions between their positions.

69
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,510
But in terms of the interest,

70
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,940
the reason that the project manager wants the extension is because she feels

71
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,870
there maybe unexpected obstacles that may prevent completing the project on time.

72
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:12,557
And also because she wants to show to her team that she fights for their needs,

73
00:06:12,557 --> 00:06:19,814
and she will then push them to work overtime to complete the project.

74
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:23,970
The boss's underlying interest is completely financial.

75
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:28,580
Because if the project's not completed on time, the company

76
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:34,010
may lose money because of a penalty cost in the contract.

77
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,490
So you see, in this example, issues, positions, and

78
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,240
interests are all different.

79
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,110
A lot of time, we take positions and

80
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:52,460
make the mistake that positions are the same as interests.

81
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:58,450
To negotiate successfully, we have to keep in mind that positions and

82
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,350
interest are different.

83
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:05,820
We had to be clear about our interest before we enter a negotiation.

84
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:10,127
At the same time, we have to explore, discuss,

85
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:15,720
and actively listen for the other party's interests.

86
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:21,420
So that we can increase the possibility of finding alignment in our interests,

87
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:28,150
and create values for everyone involved in the negotiation.

88
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:32,860
Now let's go back to the project management example.

89
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:37,530
If the project manager and her boss realized that even though their

90
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:43,870
positions are conflicting, different, there's no convergence.

91
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:48,200
They actually may share similar interests.

92
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,670
So they decide to sit down, discuss and

93
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:54,940
listen to, in order to understand each other's interest.

94
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,370
And based on the conversation,

95
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:01,080
as a result of understanding where each other is coming from.

96
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:07,410
The boss decides to give the project manager discretion to management team,

97
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:13,810
and decides to extend the deadline of a different and less urgent project.

98
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:18,199
That way, they can move other people to work on the project, and

99
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,343
the project manager can have additional help with the important project.

100
00:08:23,343 --> 00:08:28,220
The happy ending after the conversation is that the project is

101
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,139
done on time without any extension.

102
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,581
And that the project manager is able to demonstrate her ability to

103
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:40,520
protect her team, and care for their needs.

104
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,760
Let's consider another case.

105
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:48,730
CHASS and Henry Ford Health System have been partners to provide healthcare for

106
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,580
residents in Detroit for over three decades.

107
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,980
The partnership has been beneficial to both organizations.

108
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,690
CHASS is a federally qualified health center and

109
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,880
serves a large number of uninsured and low income patients.

110
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,440
So, CHASS has been able to help Henry Ford Health System

111
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,990
to fulfill its philanthropic mission and

112
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:22,820
keep its non-profit status by meeting the community benefits requirement.

113
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:25,330
Henry Ford Health System on the other hand,

114
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:31,580
supplies primary care physicians to staff CHASS clinics at cost.

115
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,170
Two factors, stagnation of economic conditions in southeast Michigan,

116
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:41,400
and reduced supply of primary care physicians

117
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:46,100
have increased the cost of physician recruitment and retention.

118
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,350
And therefore forced Henry Ford Health System to

119
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:53,810
renegotiate the physician contract with CHASS.

120
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:55,870
Unknown to each other.

121
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:01,532
Henry Ford Health System did its own estimates that the cost of the new

122
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:06,706
physician contract has to increase by 20% to 40% in order

123
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:13,850
to recoup their loss in physician recruitment and retention.

124
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:18,943
CHASS on the other hand, has its own estimate showing that a cost

125
00:10:18,943 --> 00:10:29,179
increase over 20% is likely to threaten its financial viability.

126
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:35,085
So apparently, based on the example, the issue on the table is renewal

127
00:10:35,085 --> 00:10:42,640
of a physician service contract between Henry Ford Health System and CHASS.

128
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,080
What other positions?

129
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,800
They're also very clear.

130
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,360
CHASS wants the cost increase to be as small as possible.

131
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:58,640
By contrast, Henry Ford Health System wants the increase to be high enough

132
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,920
to offset their costs in physician recruitment and retention.

133
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,720
And simply based on their positions, it is clear that there's no convergence.

134
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,050
And the physician contract may fall through.

135
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:19,358
But on the line, CHASS's position is the concern that too much

136
00:11:19,358 --> 00:11:24,577
increase will threaten the center's financial viability.

137
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:29,558
Also, there is a strong interest on CHASS part to keep

138
00:11:29,558 --> 00:11:34,330
the clinic staffed with primary care physicians.

139
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,994
In terms of Henry Ford Health System's interest, their primary

140
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:44,102
concern is to recoup the loss in physician recruitment and retention.

141
00:11:44,102 --> 00:11:49,041
Also, they need to fulfill their charity care and community benefits

142
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:55,270
responsibilities, and for those things, CHASS could be very helpful.

143
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:01,940
And Henry Ford's primary care physicians are feeling committed to CHASS.

144
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,250
In addition, there could be other interests to consider for

145
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:11,180
both CHASS and Henry Ford Health System.

146
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:16,870
They may include access to specialty care, market share in the city of Detroit,

147
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,240
and publicity, and institutional reputation.

148
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,627
Those interests have different degrees of importance to CHASS and

149
00:12:26,627 --> 00:12:28,428
Henry Ford Health System,

150
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:36,793
that may be satisfied through various strategies or mechanisms.

151
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:39,618
Let's think about an example.

152
00:12:39,618 --> 00:12:44,723
Access to specialty care is critically important for CHASS patients.

153
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:49,370
Other than Henry Ford Health System, the Detroit Medical Center for

154
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,680
example, is also interested in accepting CHASS patients.

155
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:59,620
Because many of the patients can now afford a care as a result of

156
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:04,680
the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid special.

157
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:10,040
The important point is that considering the full set of interests and

158
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,430
how they may be satisfied by the negotiation party or potentially others
