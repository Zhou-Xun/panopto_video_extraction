1
00:00:01,345 --> 00:00:10,195
To set up a weighted grading, go to the assignment section of your course and use the plus group button.

2
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:17,175
You'll name the groups according to the categories you have shown on your syllabus.

3
00:00:17,175 --> 00:00:21,795
Then click on the more menu in the upper right of the assignment's page,

4
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:30,975
click on the assignment group Waite's option and select the checkbox that will tell Canvas to wait final grades based on these assignment groups.

5
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:37,605
This will show you your list of assignment groups and allow you to set the percentage that each should be worth.

6
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:48,415
Check that your total is worth 100 percent and click save. You should now see these percentage rates listed next to each assignment group.

7
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:56,065
As you create your assignments for the semester, add them to the correct group so that their grade will be calculated properly,

8
00:00:56,065 --> 00:01:05,945
you can easily drag and drop assignments into different assignment groups if needed, using the dotted bars on the left.

9
00:01:05,945 --> 00:01:10,625
Once all assignments are created and organized into the proper assignment group,

10
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:16,955
you can look in the grades area to see all your assignments and check their point values.

11
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:28,085
And on the far right, see the weighted categories. Each of these will calculate separately in order to produce the total score.

12
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:37,205
If you'd like to have your grades held instead of automatically posting for students, you can set a course grade posting policy.

13
00:01:37,205 --> 00:01:43,385
This is a new feature of grade book that you can apply to all the assignments in your course,

14
00:01:43,385 --> 00:01:50,165
click the grade book settings icon and navigate to the grade posting policy tab.

15
00:01:50,165 --> 00:01:54,785
The default is that all grades automatically post to students once they're entered.

16
00:01:54,785 --> 00:02:02,225
Switching to manually post grades will hold or mute, as it was called before all assignments.

17
00:02:02,225 --> 00:02:08,285
While you're in the settings, you might also want to look at the late policies and the advanced tab,

18
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:13,295
which now offers an option to instructors to override a final grade.

19
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:24,535
Make your selection and click update. Once you've finished grading each assignment, you'll come back and post the grades,

20
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:33,965
which will allow your students to see their grade for that assignment. You can also post the grades from the speed greater view.

21
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:51,862
Once everything is set, you can navigate to the home page and click on the student view button to see how your students see their grades.
