00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:08,110
Welcome to the first episode of The Air We Breathe. I'm your host, Lyric Kleber.

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:15,010
Thanks for joining us in this inaugural episode. I'm really excited to get into some of the tough subject matter that we plan to talk about.

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,970
First, I thought it'd be helpful to give you a bit of an overview of what we're trying to do here.

4
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:24,730
You can probably tell by the name of the show we're going to talk about climate change.

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,580
By now, you've almost certainly heard of climate change and maybe some of its associated terms like greenhouse gases,

6
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:37,480
global warming, ozone and others. We'll get into the science a little bit because it is definitely important to understand,

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,580
but this show will focus primarily on the causes and particularly the health impacts of climate change.

8
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:48,180
The goal of these episodes would be to provide you with some knowledge about real

9
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:52,620
world impacts that climate change is having right now in communities all around us,

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,630
including the ones we live in.

11
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:00,820
I also want to make sure we take time to talk about some of the actions we can take to minimize the effects of climate change.

12
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:07,370
This can be a really overwhelming topic, but there are steps we can try to take to preserve our health and our earth.

13
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:14,330
Another important topic in this podcast is going to be environmental justice that may be a new phrase for you, and that's OK.

14
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,930
Go over some definitions and a bit here to make sure we're all on the same page,

15
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:23,020
but just wanted to preface the show with a quick description so you know what you're getting into.

16
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:30,310
Now, let's talk more specifically about what climate change is and how it directly impacts us in our day to day lives.

17
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:36,790
Climate change is defined by the United Nations as long term shifts in temperature and weather patterns.

18
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:43,180
These shifts may be natural, or they may be anthropogenic, which means caused by human activity.

19
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:47,470
Burning of fossil fuels is a primary contributor to climate change,

20
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:53,920
the combustion of fossil fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and methane gas, which are considered greenhouse gases.

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,390
These fumes trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere and cause temperatures to rise over time.

22
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:04,850
There are other examples of pollution, too, that can have more immediate health impacts than rising temperature.

23
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,920
Industrial factories can emit pollutants such as particulate matter and hydrogen sulfide.

24
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,620
These molecules can cause respiratory distress,

25
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:19,600
dizziness and can even be tied to heart attacks if you're exposed to them in high concentrations or for long periods of time.

26
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,650
They can also cause odors that severely impact quality of life.

27
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:32,050
Smells of smoke or in the case of hydrogen sulfide, rotten eggs are hard to escape if you live near factories that have high emissions.

28
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:37,180
Another important dynamic to understand is the dangerous feedback loop that exists between the gradual

29
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:42,680
warming of the climate for greenhouse gases and these other air pollutants that harm our health.

30
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:50,400
Increased air pollutants from factories and vehicle traffic contribute to smog, which exacerbates the warming effect of greenhouse gases.

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,970
Warmer weather and longer summers increase pollen production, which is a serious allergen that many people struggle with,

32
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:01,640
asthma attacks are also commonly triggered by this poor air quality.

33
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,260
In essence, the warmer the climate gets, the more pollutants will be trapped in the atmosphere,

34
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:14,790
which in turn continues to contribute to the rising temperatures. Now, what about that term, I mentioned earlier environmental justice.

35
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,340
Well, environmental justice is the idea that all people, regardless of race, gender,

36
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,150
socioeconomic status or national origin should be treated fairly as it relates to

37
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,790
the implementation and enforcement of environmental policies and regulations.

38
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:32,360
Unfortunately, research shows that this is not the case.

39
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,220
The exposure rates to high levels of air pollution are over 20 percent higher for black and Latino

40
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:42,810
Americans compared to their white counterparts and over 30 percent higher for Asian Americans.

41
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:47,550
Racial minority and low income neighborhoods bear the brunt of climate change in the U.S.,

42
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:52,560
even though they usually contribute the least to the emissions that expedite the process.

43
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,790
This is due to a disproportionate number of minority and low income communities that reside near high emitting places like factories,

44
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:08,280
landfills or highways. Hence, the importance of environmental justice, if we are to attempt to collectively address the issue of climate change,

45
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,460
that we have to keep a focus on these vulnerable communities.

46
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:16,590
History has shown that even with advancements in climate, technology or alternative energy,

47
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:20,880
the disparities and health impacts that already exist due to climate change continue to worsen.

48
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,330
If we are not intentional about how we implement our climate change solutions and where we concentrate our efforts.

49
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,090
So now that we've tied some of these ideas together,

50
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:35,460
I think it makes sense to offer a real world example so you can see how these relationships play out.

51
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,280
In our next episode, we'll dove into a case of environmental injustice in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

52
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:50,197
I hope you'll tune in. And please remember to subscribe rate review. We'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions for future episodes.
