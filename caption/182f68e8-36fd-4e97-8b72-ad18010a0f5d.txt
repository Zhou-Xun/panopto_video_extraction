1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:10,080
Principle number three, be the example for your community. Instructors often ask, what is my role in the holiday community?

2
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,060
It's easy. You're a community member. Be the model member.

3
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:19,260
Do what you want your students to do. Create posts and comments.

4
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:28,320
Share interesting articles, take videos of yourself and participate in conversations as an equal member of a shared learning community.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,540
Don't tell your students exactly what to do. Show them how to question.

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,390
How to analyze. How to be open minded.

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:44,570
Your students will look to you for intermittent feedback and you should give plenty of accolades, reactions and encouraging comments.

8
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:50,380
But your students don't want you to insinuate yourself into every aspect of every conversation either.

9
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:52,200
So don't kill the vibe.

10
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:03,000
The best quality instructors attend to their community with a light touch, making their presence known without dominating the conversation.
