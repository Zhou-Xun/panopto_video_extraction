1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,220
Oh, I just. I just found it in college.

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:14,370
Yeah, I thought that was my and clean, but, you know, it's the chocolate, so you want to be.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:24,790
When I get out of here, I would see 10,000 or something like that.

4
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:41,600
I think it's funny. I would love to go out and buy these things like she's just doing it on TikTok.

5
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:54,570
Yeah, we do it and email that we like that wouldn't be like like selling a, b, c.

6
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,160
Wow. I'm just thinking of this. We advocate competitions for public meetings.

7
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:16,740
Oh, you mean, like, exactly where I told you I was working on every single for, like, two on your day.

8
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,490
Like, I really have till tomorrow.

9
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,139
I have got everything.

10
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:35,570
What are you waiting for? 600 and also, like a large office.

11
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:41,870
Yeah, that's what I'm going to try to make voluntarily.

12
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,500
I still need to watch, like, the election night coverage or your speech.

13
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:57,780
Late night money or MySpace or the late night.

14
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:04,290
I don't even. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

15
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,200
You get the sense they were going to do some of what was actually on the agenda one day,

16
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:16,019
except when we were able to come in on Monday mornings working and staying on target.

17
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:24,390
So we're trying to put that up today. And last time we talked about the theory of production is the of adoption function

18
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,059
and we talked about how that sort of tells you terms of what's technically possible,

19
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,510
what influence can you turn into what upper level. And so they were and sort of apply that to health care.

20
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:44,990
So there's no production of what I'm talking about, the production of health care or the production of health.

21
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:52,130
Today we're in talk mostly about the production of health. So instead of health care, it's the same output of the medical industry.

22
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,760
And if you ask questions like our hospitals producing their services efficiently, that's sort of an appropriate context.

23
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:02,450
But today we're talking mostly about the production of health itself,

24
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:08,360
what goes into whether it be an individual's health status or a population level metric of health status.

25
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,020
What are the various inputs that influence health?

26
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:21,320
So if we're trying to say what's the most efficient means of improving our individual health or the health status of an entire population,

27
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:23,210
that's sort of an appropriate framework.

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,610
So introduce the health production function and uses the same theoretical tools that we developed kind of for firms,

29
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:38,090
but now we're applying them to health. And this could be a person's health status or it could be a population.

30
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:41,630
So however you want to think about it either way.

31
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:45,260
So we got some final status measure of health status.

32
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,829
We'll call that sort of an index age. You can keep it really simple.

33
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:54,500
You can think of like a quality adjusted life, your status measure that goes from 0 to 1.

34
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,190
One is you're in perfect health and zero is death.

35
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:02,270
And then a year lived in less than perfect health is somewhere in between.

36
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:07,060
If you have some minor health problem might be a 0.95 or 0.9 age.

37
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:12,920
If you have a significant health limitation, maybe your health status is only 0.54.6.

38
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:17,090
So what are the various things that could influence that?

39
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:26,240
So think about it from the personal levels, diet and exercise or your your health habits, food, what your nutrition.

40
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:34,100
You eat carrots, are you potato chips with lunch? The example you had from the very first day of class, we've got heredity.

41
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:39,350
Some of it is luck, you know, did you pick the right parents environment?

42
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:47,000
So exposures, it could be environmental exposures to like pollutants, it could be environmental exposures to physical risks like violence.

43
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,600
You live in a safe neighborhood or a high crime neighborhood.

44
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:56,660
Your income and your income might allow you to purchase certain things.

45
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,649
I don't know. What can I purchase of high income?

46
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,800
I might influence my health purchase insurance.

47
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,610
Insurance. So access to health care. So maybe medical care.

48
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:16,860
One things I can afford. Maybe a gym membership. Maybe education matters.

49
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,580
So there's a slew of potential inputs. So you figure that at the individual level, or you can say,

50
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:28,760
if we're trying to describe the things that influence the health of a community, we can also figure it out at the community level.

51
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,970
What's the average income in that community? What's the distribution around that average in the community?

52
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,420
What are the you know, what percentage of the population smokes? What percentage of the population drinks excessively?

53
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:46,889
A percentage of the population gets regular exercise. Do people like to work early?

54
00:05:46,890 --> 00:06:00,450
Drive to work? So we have to get more people in this country more competitive in the future.

55
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:04,940
So sort of the overall infrastructure of the country.

56
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:13,920
So if we think about sort of a medical infrastructure and even if I'm a relatively rich person in a relatively low income country,

57
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:20,700
there probably isn't the same medical infrastructure that we have in Europe or the United States.

58
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,300
You know, if I'm not going have the same access to MRI's or same access to advanced chemotherapy for cancer or,

59
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,500
you know, advanced cardiac surgeries, just because that infrastructure isn't there.

60
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:39,930
So if even if I'm a pretty well-off person by the standards of my country, I'm not going to have access to everything that people here have access to.

61
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:45,360
So a low income person in the United States might have more access than a high

62
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,220
income person in a low income country to various advanced medical capabilities.

63
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,760
So that infrastructure is very different.

64
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:04,800
We think about sort of health care infrastructures. Health care tends to be you know, we talked about necessities and luxuries a while ago.

65
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,750
It tends to be a necessity at the personal level. That's one of the things that we talked about demand for health.

66
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,070
At a personal level, if my income goes up by 10%, I might buy one or 2% more medical care.

67
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,590
But at the country level, if my country's income goes up by more than 10%.

68
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:27,810
Our country's investment in health care to our country's income goes up by 10%.

69
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:31,290
Our country's investment health care tends to go up by more than 10%.

70
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:40,440
So we're building a bigger infrastructure. So I think it's that type of environmental factor, thinking about sort of just where I am.

71
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,980
There's a lot of things that are going on in policy of that country.

72
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:57,930
Like if you look back to my country, if you begin to see doesn't matter if it is cardiac or you are having a seizure, I really don't care.

73
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,690
You have your money up front before you get to this treatment. And here you go.

74
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,630
You know, their place on the planet, all the loss of that.

75
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:12,090
So we'll take you and then they will treat you first, then they'll bankrupt you.

76
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,770
So lots of people can look at life just like that.

77
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:22,800
So if you don't have you don't have the cash, then you're not going to get the treatment in the first place.

78
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,080
And so let's see how we can look at the production function for health.

79
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:38,610
And we're going to hold all of our inputs constant except one medical care and say how productive is medical care in the production of health?

80
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,920
And I'm going to use three different scenarios. This is a very pessimistic scenario.

81
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,120
So this is a condition for which there's literally nothing medical care can do to help you.

82
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,860
So let's say you've got some initial health status that's at this access where the dash

83
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:58,049
light is coming out of and then something happens to you called a health shock on the graph.

84
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:05,280
Just think of it as an illness or an injury. So you start out at this level of health status and then suddenly you drop to here.

85
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,410
And now what we look at is suppose I start consuming some medical care.

86
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,609
Does it help me? And in this graph, the answer is no.

87
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,020
I'm kind of stuck.

88
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:24,030
You know, I think I've lost this much health status and regardless how much medical care I consume, that's my health, my new health status.

89
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,360
So what's the marginal productivity of medical care and zero?

90
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:38,010
Because the marginal productivity versus we've got this is like the total product curve for medical care.

91
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,950
Bring it back in the terms we had last time. The slope of the total product curve is marginal product.

92
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:51,240
The slope of a horizontal line is zero. So the marginal product of medical care is also zero.

93
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:56,000
What's the average product of medical care or average productivity of medical care or service?

94
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:58,560
Those two in terms of use interchangeably, also zero.

95
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,290
That's just how much health status improvement do I get divided by how many units of medical care tonight?

96
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:09,179
So this is health status improvement is zero. The numerator is zero.

97
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:17,700
The no matter what the denominator is zero. So this is a very pessimistic scenario where there's literally nothing medical care can do to help you.

98
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,390
Something bad has happened to you and there's no use getting any medical care because there's no effective care available.

99
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:32,760
There's now much more optimistic scenario. You have the same initial drop in health stats.

100
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:38,730
That's a drop along that axis, which says, you know, what would what would happen if I soon consume no medical care?

101
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,299
I start out here, I have this illness or injury occur.

102
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,500
It drops me down to here.

103
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:54,420
But now that I see that the production function actually responds positively, I get more health if I consume more medical care.

104
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:58,800
In fact, there's two really good pieces of news about this illness.

105
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:06,040
I guess what they are. So right here, we had really bad news.

106
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:13,860
There's no medical care that can help you at all. If somebody is going to get back to your previous state of health.

107
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,280
Right. In other words, as long as you consume at least some star units of care, a complete cure is available for you.

108
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,470
This illness or injury can be completely overcome.

109
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:29,800
If I consume star units of medical care, I'm back at the original level I had before this bad thing happened to me.

110
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:33,910
So a complete cure is available. What's the second piece of good news?

111
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,830
After that. I'm sorry. It's.

112
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,579
It's useless. Or there's no harm to go. Right?

113
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:52,230
There's no harm. So if I suppose I overshoot and I consume this much care instead of I'm sorry, I'm wasting resources.

114
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,750
That extra medical care has no marginal productivity because the slope has become zero.

115
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:03,300
But I'm not harming myself. In other words, there aren't risks or side effects to consuming too much.

116
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,780
So there's two pieces of good news here. If I consume star units of care, I'm completely cured.

117
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:19,980
I've restored every bit of my lost health status, and if I mistakenly overconsume, well, I'm wasting resources, but at least I'm not harming myself.

118
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:27,119
So you could imagine a scenario where if I consume too much, the risks begin to exceed the benefits.

119
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,150
And actually, I'd be harming myself. My health starts to begin to decline.

120
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,680
I want to see that next graph. So let's look at all that marginal productivity.

121
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:39,270
That's the slope of this curve. And we see it's positive but declining.

122
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,870
So marginal productivity is positive, but declining.

123
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:50,850
Once we get to star marginal productivity becomes zero significant of think of that marginal relativity line just kind of moving along.

124
00:12:53,350 --> 00:13:00,620
The access after the star average productivity is just sort of how much should my health status improve?

125
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:05,380
Divided by how many units of care that I consume. And that also declines.

126
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:13,120
But it's positive. So if I consume, say this I'm sorry.

127
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,870
Units of care, the average productivity is just the slope of that court says on average,

128
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:25,570
this is how much my health status improved divided by how much care did I consume.

129
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:35,449
And it says the marginal productivity declines, that's going to pull the average down because the next unit has a lower marginal productivity,

130
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,160
a lower marginal improvement health status than all the units that came before.

131
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:43,480
So consuming another unit is going to pull the average down. So the marginal gets pulled out?

132
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:54,580
Yeah, average gets pulled down. Once it reached the end, star will still be celebrated and deemed negative.

133
00:13:54,670 --> 00:14:04,480
Is it even possible that the average point gap will actually always stay positive here because marginal never turns negative?

134
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:10,990
So in other words, if I say What's the slope of that? So that's the average productivity if I consume this much care.

135
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:21,600
So the average productivity will approach zero. Imagine we just keep overconsuming care.

136
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,270
Way, way, way up, way off the graph. But it's always going to be positive.

137
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:28,700
There's always that positive gain divided by the amount of care.

138
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:32,450
It's just as that denominator gets bigger and bigger, the average productivity.

139
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,290
It gets closer and closer to zero, but it'll always be positive. You can always have that same game.

140
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:48,600
Okay, so we went from a really horrible scenario. Go into the doctor and the doctor says, I'm sorry, there's nothing we can do for you.

141
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,710
You have to learn to live with it. So a really great scenario.

142
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,740
Hey, we can completely cure you. And there's never a point where the risks of care exceed the benefits.

143
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:06,380
And now here we've got maybe an in-between case that probably is descriptive of a lot of real care.

144
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,290
And let's think of this as a drug and say AM is the dose of the drug that I'm taking.

145
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:21,499
So how many milligrams of the drug am I taking? So initially, I might be in what you'd clinically call like a sub therapeutic range.

146
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,700
If I just take a little bit of the drug, I'm not really going to get any meaningful effect.

147
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,399
But now I start getting into a therapeutic range where I see as my dose of the drug increases.

148
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:45,120
I'm getting better. I'm getting some response to that drug. I keep getting a response until I get to here.

149
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:54,270
So at this point, it's not quite as good. It's better than graph one because clearly there's medical care available.

150
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:59,100
The drug in my example that can restore at least part of my lost health status.

151
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:07,940
So it's better than scrap one, not as good as graph two, because that peaks out below the original level of health status.

152
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:16,070
So it's not a complete cure. The drug makes me better, but it doesn't completely restore me to that original health status.

153
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,700
I don't never get to the height of the dashed line. So relative to the second graph, that's a piece of bad news.

154
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,430
The drug is effective, but it's not a cure. There's now a second piece of bad news.

155
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:37,760
Now, imagine with most drugs. If you keep taking more and more and more of it, is it likely to be benign like this?

156
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,960
Well, yeah. If I keep taking more and more and more of the drug, it's not helping me. But at least it's not hurting me.

157
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,070
Or for most drugs, do you think it's more likely to be the case that.

158
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:54,350
Well, if I keep taking more and more and more of it, eventually the risks exceed the benefits and is actually on net harmful at the margin.

159
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,100
That's probably a more realistic case.

160
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:07,249
So we've got a second piece of bad news relative to graph two and said we don't want to overshoot and star in graph two if we overshot them,

161
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:12,920
star likes that we'd be wants can resources and that's not good. But at least we're not harming our health in this case.

162
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:16,790
Not only are we wasting resources, but we're spending more on medical care.

163
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:25,670
We're buying more drugs in order to get a worse outcome. So we see the marginal productivity is going to be first increasing.

164
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:32,090
This curve is getting steeper and steeper. Eventually it turns to convex to concave.

165
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:37,520
Marginal productivity is still positive, but it's declining, it's increasing,

166
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:44,090
it peaks out, begins to decline, and eventually it even becomes negative.

167
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:50,550
The on down star, that slope actually turns down, so the risks exceed the benefits.

168
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:56,450
I don't want to go there because see what happens to average saw in the story we told last time.

169
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,510
Marginal productivity is rising. That's going to pull the average up.

170
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,490
The next unit has a higher marginal productivity than all the US that came before.

171
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:09,680
So adding that next unit is going to raise our average. But eventually those things are going to cross.

172
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,970
And the next year, while still as a positive marginal productivity in this range,

173
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:19,570
the marginal productivity is less than the average of all units that came before.

174
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:25,580
So it's going to pull the average down. So do these marginal productivity.

175
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,360
On average, productivity is just a number like this.

176
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:34,310
How much health improves with care? Is it like a derivative?

177
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,990
Right, so that the marginal productivity is the derivative, right.

178
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:45,320
So if you were to do a calculus in terms of you have a calculus, you can kind of go on your phones and do something else for 30 seconds.

179
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:51,649
The marginal productivity is just the slope of the of the total productivity.

180
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:55,940
So this is the total productivity curve. The slope of a function is its first derivative.

181
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:04,970
So the marginal productivity, if you're doing calculus, if you had an equation for this and you took its first derivative, you would get this again.

182
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:15,130
The average is just the Q overall. So in this case at M Star, it'll the marginal productivity will be under the X axis, right?

183
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:22,070
So the marginal productivity around star is zero because that's where the total productivity curve is horizontal peaks.

184
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,450
So that's going to be where the marginal productivity goes from positive to negative.

185
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:36,770
It's right. It's positive until M star and it's negative after star is exactly zero, right out of star because that's where this curve is horizontal.

186
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,630
If we take draw tantra line to it.

187
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:46,610
So if you don't have that, if you have no calculus and think of marginal productivity as I'm just drawing the slope of the tangent line,

188
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,940
so the tangent line is getting steeper and steeper now it's getting flatten, flatter, but still positive.

189
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:57,800
Now the tangent line is zero, the slope is zero. Now the tension line, the slope is negative.

190
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,060
So if you have not calculus, just think about drawing the slope of the tangent line.

191
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:06,320
I'm gonna just continuously changing the tangent line along this curve.

192
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:18,210
The marginal productivity is just a graph of that. And so it's probably the most realistic case where somehow some useful care is available.

193
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:23,489
It may not get you a complete cure, and there are risks to overshooting.

194
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:27,780
There's a point where at the margin, another unit of care is more harmful than beneficial.

195
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,620
There's a couple other productivity concepts in health care that are very important.

196
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:44,700
How does productivity change on two different margins? We call them the intensive margin and the expense of margin.

197
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,410
So let's think about it from a perspective of a particular patient.

198
00:20:49,410 --> 00:20:53,250
We can also think of it in terms of the population, but sort of a patient level,

199
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:58,890
the intensive margin is how many resources do we devote to that individual?

200
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,730
How intensively do we treat them? That's where we're in intensive.

201
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:11,560
You know, I've decided I'm going to treat you. But now the question is how intensively?

202
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:15,640
And let's use screening, screening test, for example, for example.

203
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,890
So we're doing, say, a cancer screening test.

204
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:24,950
So the intensive margins, once they've decided that you are within the part of the population that I want to treat,

205
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:26,469
that I want to do the screening test for,

206
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:35,010
I recommend screening to I screened every ten years to I screened you every five years annually every six months.

207
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:38,230
So I screened you every day. We screened you every 15 minutes.

208
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:44,980
So the intensive marriages, once I've decided I want to treat you at all because the treatment is just the screening test,

209
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,390
how often am I going to do it? How much care am I going to give the person?

210
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:59,020
And we would expect that as I screening more frequently for cancer, probably the marginal productivity of another test is going to go down.

211
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,570
So screened you 15 minutes ago.

212
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:09,580
What's the chance that a new cancer or a new detectable cancer has developed in the last 15 minutes, that it wasn't detectable 15 minutes ago?

213
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:18,020
So imagine if you take it to that extreme, it's sort of obvious the marginal productivity of another screening test at the intensive margin

214
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:24,469
is incredibly low by screening every 15 minutes rather than every 30 minutes or even every month,

215
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:30,170
rather than every two months. But on the other hand, if I screen you every five years rather than every ten years,

216
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:36,530
there probably are a lot of additional cancers that could show up and be detectable in that five year interval.

217
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:44,140
So the number of cancers detected per additional screening declines the more intensively I screen you.

218
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:49,430
So the marginal productivity of screening, how many more treatable cancers?

219
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:56,030
Some detecting protest? Now we can also think about the extensive margin,

220
00:22:56,030 --> 00:23:00,360
and that's a decision which people in this room am I recommending the treatment for in the first place?

221
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,250
And so if we take something like mammography, we have to decide two things.

222
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,690
We have decide, first of all, for the people we recommend mammography for at all.

223
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,270
So we have to decide something like, well, what's the minimum age? What's the maximum age?

224
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:23,710
What about if it's sort of they're a general population risk versus they have a high risk to say a family history.

225
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,840
So we have to first make the decision of, you know, who are we going to screen at all?

226
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,780
So we're not doing mammography or recommending it on 105 year old women.

227
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:41,770
We're not recommending it for five year olds. You know, so we have to say work where know the lower boundaries, the upper bound.

228
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:45,610
And how does that lower upper bound change based on things like family history?

229
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:55,870
So that's the extensive margin decision. How broadly in the population do we extend the treatment or the screening programs example?

230
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,340
And then we have to make once we make that decision, we have to make the intensive margin decision.

231
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:04,630
Is it every ten years, every five years, every two years annually?

232
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:10,389
So we're making decisions on both of those margins and recommending the screening

233
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:15,040
program to say who's going to get screened at all as the extensive margin.

234
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,400
How broadly do we extend screening in the population?

235
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:24,790
And we expect also marginal productivity to decline. You know, why why are we not screening five year olds?

236
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,820
Yeah. Because so we discover a breast cancer at 105 year old.

237
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,470
That person is not even going to be able to make it through the treatment. We're not going to recommend treatment.

238
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,990
Even if we did and they somehow succeeded, we would be gaining a month of life expectancy.

239
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,730
So the marginal impact on health of screening a five year old is very low.

240
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:52,840
So the prevalence of the condition might be fairly high,

241
00:24:53,620 --> 00:25:02,440
but the impact of screening on their ultimate life expectancy is very low, maybe even close to zero, maybe even zero.

242
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,700
The other hand, what if we screen 15 year olds?

243
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:10,690
Prevalence of disease is incredibly low,

244
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:17,800
so we're not detecting much because it's a population that has very little of our population where the prevalence of the condition is incredibly low.

245
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:24,159
So we got a little marginal productivity of extending treatment either into the very old where

246
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:28,540
there is little health gain or in the very young where there's little disease to be detected.

247
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:34,630
And in fact, there are a lot of side effects because if we, you know, we can get false negatives,

248
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:39,520
false positives, false positives, or if there's some abnormality on the test,

249
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,299
and now we've got to do a biopsy and now we've got to do various other things

250
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:48,910
that are invasive and stressful and have some risks associated with them.

251
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,079
And in all likelihood, it's going to turn out to be a false positive,

252
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,160
not a true positive if it's sort of know part of the population where there's very little.

253
00:25:58,570 --> 00:26:08,540
Disease. So let's see some empirical evidence.

254
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:16,379
How valuable is medical care? Oh, in the United States, it's probably a reasonable thing.

255
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:19,650
We consume as a population quite a bit of medical care.

256
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:23,790
We do in most of most higher income countries.

257
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:30,270
Most European countries also use a lot of care. On occasion, countries use a lot of care.

258
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:40,230
Probably if we cut back a little bit, it probably wouldn't have very severe effects on population health metrics.

259
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:48,090
So the marginal contribution of care at the level we're already consuming in the United States is probably pretty low.

260
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,770
What do you want to take from that implication that you know what, we ought to just get rid of the health care system.

261
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:05,080
Not because we are that marginal versus average. No, this graph, we have both the marginal productivity and the average productivity.

262
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:17,530
So maybe we're at a place where. The marginal productivity is very low.

263
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,890
So if we cut back a little bit, we really wouldn't be.

264
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,110
Change your health status, the population very much, but the average productivity is still pretty high.

265
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:42,730
There was a paper done a while ago, but it had sort of an interesting take and it tried to sort of estimate, you know,

266
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:48,730
what, you know, based on what we know about how effective various types of medical care is in changing health status.

267
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:54,310
What if we got rid of it? Got rid of it completely.

268
00:27:55,300 --> 00:28:01,060
How much is medical care contributing to life expectancy as a whole, not just at the margin?

269
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:06,820
So the marginal productivity is low. If we cut back a little bit that says we're not going to change health status very much.

270
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:14,920
It turns out on average, it's pretty big. So obviously there's a lot of assumptions made in this study.

271
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,740
I would not take this number very seriously, but at least as an order of magnitude kind of thing.

272
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:27,310
They said, well, medical care overall in the United States at this at the time of the study, they said added about five years to life expectancy.

273
00:28:28,390 --> 00:28:36,550
That's pretty big. So we're a situation where the marginal productivity is low and the average productivity is high.

274
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:54,460
Somewhere like that close down star. So medical care matters a lot on average, even if it doesn't matter that much at the margin.

275
00:28:58,330 --> 00:29:05,170
Infant mortality rates. So if you look at historically tremendous improvements.

276
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,620
What was medical care, his contribution to those improvements.

277
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:22,330
Probably some, but it probably wasn't a big factor. So when did medical care potentially begin having a big impact?

278
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:29,650
Really, it was sort of the 1960s. Late 1960s is when neonatal intensive care units were essentially developed.

279
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:38,020
And a lot of the techniques to save high risk infants say very low birth weight infants or developed.

280
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:48,219
Prior to that, there wasn't a lot of medical care available. And so data from New York City 1968,

281
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:54,610
so roughly the beginning of use and also sort of shortly after Medicaid was implemented where

282
00:29:54,610 --> 00:30:01,300
Medicaid dramatically increased the access to medical care for mothers with low incomes giving birth.

283
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,509
Now, Medicaid is a source of coverage for, you know,

284
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:11,139
very high percentage of births in the U.S. So we sampled almost simultaneously had a health care financing reform,

285
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:19,540
the dramatically increased access to care for those infants who are most at risk of a bad outcome.

286
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,580
And we had a new medical technology being developed that effectively treated the.

287
00:30:26,170 --> 00:30:29,680
So we were at 21.9 per thousand. The New York City.

288
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:41,720
Okay. Great. By 1984 that had fallen to 12.8, so about a 40% relative reduction.

289
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:49,040
By 2004, it had fallen another 50%. And it's been a lot more stable since then.

290
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:53,030
There hasn't been much change. That's really the main time of change since Medicare.

291
00:30:54,650 --> 00:31:00,799
Okay, so that's pretty great. So overall, it fell by about 70% in that time.

292
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:07,880
So that might be attributable primarily to Medicaid and neonatal intensive care technologies.

293
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,700
But where were we in 1900? Skipped over that first number.

294
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:22,110
So before medical care could have made much of its contribution a even for Medicaid provided financial

295
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:28,980
access and nick use provided the technology to effectively care for low and low birth weight infants.

296
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:35,910
We went from 140 to 21, so we dropped percentagewise.

297
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,270
That's about 80 more than 80% drop.

298
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:44,940
But more importantly, in absolute terms, that's 124,000 drop.

299
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:51,840
In absolute terms, even though we got about a 70% drop from 1968 to 2004.

300
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,290
It was only about a 15 per thousand absolute drop.

301
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:04,050
So there was a bigger relative drop before Medicaid and Nichols and a much, much, much bigger absolute dropped.

302
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:14,530
If you think about this one out of seven. So think of the last seven people in your lives that you've known that have had a baby.

303
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:21,670
If it had been 1900. One of those seven babies statistically would not be expected to have made it to their first birthday.

304
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:29,570
You know now. Think of the last.

305
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,510
It's about one 460 or something like that.

306
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,950
Think of the last hundred 60 people in your lives that have had a baby.

307
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:45,950
You have to think of the last seven people. You probably don't know. 160 people have had a baby.

308
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:53,370
So what happened? Medical care was probably secondary.

309
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:02,220
Rising living standards, nutrition, sanitation, public health and chlorination and pasteurization.

310
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,170
Marinating the water supply. Pasteurized foods, vaccines.

311
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,160
Vaccines. So lots of stuff.

312
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:19,379
The things that would have gotten us from 140 to 21 were primarily not the sort of medical interventions that were primarily.

313
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,370
Public health interventions. Living standards. Sanitation.

314
00:33:26,010 --> 00:33:29,310
Those have much bigger impact on infant mortality historically.

315
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:33,930
So, Niki, this have been great. You've gone from 21 to 6.

316
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:42,720
That's really good. But going from 120 to 140 to 21 was a lot bigger of a deal.

317
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:52,080
And that primarily was not medical care. Heart attack treatment.

318
00:33:55,310 --> 00:34:03,080
So we've developed a bunch of what sorts of high tech cardiac procedures like catheterization and revascularization procedures.

319
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:14,360
There's a clever study that looked at Medicare data and it looked at where patients lived relative to hospitals that offer these services.

320
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:22,550
And they argued that, well, if I live if I happen to live close or if my nearest hospital is one that has these high tech cardiac services,

321
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,540
I'd be more likely to get them. And they verified that was true.

322
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:32,810
So for the convenience, I happen to live close to that hospital right there that has those high tech services.

323
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,590
You find your hospital had been one that didn't offer those services.

324
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:44,059
I'd be less likely to get them. And they found that, yeah, people are were a lot more likely to get them about a third more likely to get

325
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:49,250
these procedures if they happen to live closer to these four high tech hospitals.

326
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:55,400
Despite that, a third more use, there was almost no difference in outcomes.

327
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,280
So doesn't mean that these services weren't valuable on average,

328
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:06,229
but the marginal people who basically got them just because their closest hospital happens

329
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:10,580
to provide them and wouldn't have gotten them had their closest hospital not provided them.

330
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:18,860
She didn't really get much benefit. There are very small improvements in like 30 or 90 day mortality that basically were gone by 1 to 2 years.

331
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:27,890
Tiny, tiny improvements. So this is at the margin, the productivity of extending those services to a third more patients essentially was very low.

332
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,450
Does not imply that the average productivity is low,

333
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:40,550
but at least the patients who got it just because they happened to live close to a place that did it weren't benefiting very much.

334
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:51,530
So what are the benefits of health insurance? So we've talked a lot about insurance as sort of protection from financial risk.

335
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,640
So that's what economists would jump to. First, why do you have insurance?

336
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,020
How many have renters insurance? Why do you have renters insurance?

337
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:05,950
What are you protecting yourself from? Financial risk.

338
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,350
Yeah, financial loss, basically, if something happens.

339
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:16,060
You know, if you're, you know, if there's a water leak in the apartment that damages your stuff, there's a fire, there's a burglary.

340
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,830
If you didn't have the insurance, you'd be out money to replace that stuff.

341
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:27,430
Okay. So that health care we talked about, we have got also the motive of access to care.

342
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:34,780
So most people think, well, the bad benefit of health insurance is that I'm going to better access to care and it's going to improve my health.

343
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,810
So the answer is really sort of both.

344
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:44,230
But if we think about that sort of health pathway, so causal pathways, I get health insurance, what does that do?

345
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:50,080
It pays off by lowering the price of care. Unlike the renters insurance, it doesn't give me a check.

346
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:57,090
It gives me access to cheaper care than if I didn't have insurance. It lowers the price because it lowers the price.

347
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,930
I respond by using more care and then hopefully that extra care improves my health.

348
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:13,330
So that's kind of the causal pathway that we're sort of hoping to see if medical care is going to be effective in improving Miles.

349
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:18,550
I have insurance that lowers the price. I get more of it. My health improves.

350
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:24,810
And so it's really kind of seems obvious.

351
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:29,730
If I have more health care, I may have better health. Sure.

352
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,340
There are a lot of studies that have sort of very conflicting results.

353
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:38,220
And it turns out most of those are confounded by adverse selection to insurance.

354
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:44,580
So there are a lot of studies, for example, that show that people on Medicaid have worse outcomes than people who are uninsured.

355
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:51,600
Okay. So then Medicaid is harmful. Who believes that?

356
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,560
One, Medicaid are different than the uninsured in terms of their health status.

357
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:02,470
There's a reason they bother to enroll in the Medicaid program.

358
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:07,120
Something's going on with their health adverse selection. There is adverse selection.

359
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:11,350
So people in Medicaid are sicker in ways that are unobservable in the data.

360
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:17,590
You can't tell. You don't know all the variables. You can't just put them on the right hand side of your regression equation.

361
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:25,370
So health insurance might be associated with worse outcomes. But that's a correlation, not a causation.

362
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,069
Sicker people are more likely to get health insurance. So it doesn't mean health insurance made them.

363
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,550
Second means being sick, but it caused them to get health insurance.

364
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,980
The causality kind of went in the opposite direction.

365
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,990
So we wouldn't want to have sort of a conclusion that, you know, health insurance actually is dangerous.

366
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,830
Could you also find that there's worse outcomes just because there's more screening, because you have access to health care,

367
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:52,940
so you're screened, you find you discover things that you might not discover if you don't have insurance.

368
00:38:52,970 --> 00:38:56,420
That's a great point. We'll actually see that in a couple of slides.

369
00:38:57,410 --> 00:39:04,430
Perfect point. You know, so and politically, there have been people that have pointed at these studies and said, see,

370
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:09,620
with reason, we shouldn't expand Medicaid as people on Medicaid actually do, where some people are uninsured.

371
00:39:11,090 --> 00:39:16,550
So these sort of confounded studies are actually kind of used in the political sphere.

372
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:23,839
So what we're doing is we're focused on studies that are either experimental or at least have sort of a plausible sort of quasi

373
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:30,290
experimental type design where we might think that we're more likely to identify sort of the true effect of medical care.

374
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:36,500
We'll start with the rand, the health insurance experiment business. Talk about RAND 600.

375
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:49,470
So I spent a minute or two on that because what the grand experiment did is they randomize people into different generosity in health coverage.

376
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:58,320
So more or less generous coverage. There was a cap on out of out-of-pocket maximum cap, which was pretty low.

377
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:02,950
So even if you had the high cost sharing plan, there was still a maximum out of pocket you faced.

378
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,860
So you get health insurance that lowers the price of care. So that first chain in that causal path.

379
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,600
Second chain. Yeah. People face an oil price that carries a lot more care.

380
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:24,580
So people in the 95% cost sharing group used about 35% more than the people in free care, used about 35% more than those who faced 95% cost sharing.

381
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:31,260
And again, that was 95% cost sharing, subject to a relatively low out-of-pocket maximum.

382
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,520
Roughly, if you were hospitalized once, you would have met your out-of-pocket maximum.

383
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:45,760
But now, did that help people in terms of health status? The extra care they consumed really had no significant impact for most patients.

384
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:50,200
There are 30 different measures of health that they looked at.

385
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,490
For most participants, there were no significant differences.

386
00:40:53,940 --> 00:41:02,730
And among the those with a lower income or lowest income in the group or the greatest preexisting conditions,

387
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:14,049
there were improvements on four measures out of 30. So again, not super robust evidence that the extra medical care the people in,

388
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:18,670
say, the free care random random group got had a dramatic impact on health.

389
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:23,080
There were sort of some narrow targeted effects in a subsample of the population.

390
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:33,070
Oregon. So now we're going to get to the Protection Oregon Health Insurance experiment.

391
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:40,540
It's also for low income were given the opportunity to join a lottery to be able to enroll in Medicaid.

392
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,100
So the words Oregon at that time had enough money to expand their Medicaid program,

393
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,820
but not enough money to expand to everybody who would actually be eligible.

394
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:54,130
So they basically said, hey, if you're in this income group and you want Medicaid,

395
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,500
fill it up, fill out an application, and then we'll randomly select as many as we can fund.

396
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:08,870
So that gave them an experiment. Some people randomly selected for the opportunity to enroll in Medicaid and others that should

397
00:42:08,870 --> 00:42:12,980
have been equivalent people because they all filed an application and they were randomly selected.

398
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:19,370
We're not given that opportunity and so do care use increase?

399
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:27,349
Absolutely. So spending went up about by about 25% on a 30% relative increase in hospital use,

400
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:37,580
about 35% relative increase in outpatient visits in the group that got Medicaid versus those that didn't Edu's was similar in both groups.

401
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:43,310
And so we got that first arrow in the causal chain. Insurance lowers price.

402
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,720
People buy more care. So what happened?

403
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:54,739
So financial risk, huge benefits. Okay, any out-of-pocket spending.

404
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:58,069
So this column is basically the values in the comparison group.

405
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:01,520
Those that we're not we're not winners of the lottery.

406
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,040
And this is the change in the treatment groups, those who got Medicaid through the lottery.

407
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,630
So any out-of-pocket spending went down about 15 percentage points.

408
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:17,460
The amount of out-of-pocket spending went down by about 40%.

409
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,549
Likelihood of catastrophic expenditure has plummeted. It went from 5.5% and it fell by 4.5%.

410
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:36,530
So it went from 5.5 to basically 1%. Having any medical debt went down by 13 percentage points, about a quarter in relative terms.

411
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:43,160
And either borrowing money or skipping payments went down from 24% to about 10%.

412
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:50,660
So huge benefits in terms of protection from financial risk of being able to enroll in Medicaid.

413
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:58,920
Now, what about the health impact? So they asked some self-reported questions about physical mental health.

414
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,710
You know, how how healthy are you on a scale of, you know,

415
00:44:02,730 --> 00:44:08,470
very or exactly what scale they used was like a five point scale from like very unhealthy to very healthy.

416
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:18,900
And they found on average for self-reported physical and mental health improved by about to scale it about 0.2 standard deviations of the measures.

417
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:26,250
So not a not a massive increase, but it was statistically significant and meaningful bump.

418
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:31,830
Now here is, to Andrew's point, the higher rates of diagnosed depression.

419
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,180
Okay. So does that mean medicate made you depressed? No.

420
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:40,830
That means that it got you into care and you got diagnosed and you got treated.

421
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:46,649
So if you wanted to look at this in sort of a silly way, you could say, well,

422
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:49,860
there's more depression in the population that got randomized into Medicaid.

423
00:44:49,870 --> 00:44:58,670
So Medicaid costs, you know, people are under screened and under treated poorly, got Medicaid.

424
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:01,920
Now you got the Medicaid, you got them screened, you discovered a hog.

425
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:09,900
It's not like Medicaid created the Depression. Medicaid discovered the Depression that existed and treated you for it.

426
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:19,749
So that's an example, I think exactly of what you were talking about, that you might identify new things.

427
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:22,990
So actually that the prevalence of conditions might actually go up.

428
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:28,200
But as the prevalence of identified conditions, because the real conditions were always there,

429
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,760
they just hadn't been identified because you hadn't gotten care.

430
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:40,170
And they found that on some of the harder measures like diabetes, control, blood pressure, cholesterol.

431
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:46,710
They found no significant improvements. They found there were improvements, but they were too small to be statistically significant.

432
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:53,760
And we kind of looked at the sample sizes. Probably the study was a little bit underpowered statistically to detect those changes.

433
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,440
So there's at least some indication that these things improved.

434
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:01,740
But the study wasn't big enough to say that conclusively.

435
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:05,670
Yeah. How long was the study conducted?

436
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:09,950
I think they tracked people for about three years.

437
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:15,500
I think the initial paper that some of this came from was the first year and this is the longer term like two or three year follow up.

438
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:21,170
You know, so in terms of you had a limited number of people and a limited follow up.

439
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,550
So if you had more people on a longer follow up, there's probably a very good chance,

440
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,550
chance that some of these things would have become significant effects.

441
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:35,590
And this ended up being sort of a big political hot potato because the opponents of Medicaid,

442
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:41,300
this happened just a few years before Medicaid expansion was rolled out under the ACA.

443
00:46:42,350 --> 00:46:47,500
And a lot of the opponents of Medicaid expansion focused a lot on this.

444
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:54,020
They said, well, wait a second, we've got this great experimental evidence from Oregon that Medicaid didn't improve these outcomes.

445
00:46:56,860 --> 00:47:00,130
And it didn't. But the study was probably underpowered to detect it.

446
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:08,440
The direction of the effect was in the right side that Medicaid improved it, but it just wasn't statistically significant.

447
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:18,320
So this ended up being a very controversial study. Then lots of studies of Medicaid expansions under the ACA.

448
00:47:18,330 --> 00:47:25,220
So using the decision to expand versus states that didn't expand and looking at particular pre post comparisons,

449
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:29,990
the trends change in states that expanded relative to trends in states that didn't expand.

450
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,300
So the sources are a quasi experimental variation.

451
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:40,490
So there are a lot of studies that have looked at things like How much care did you use?

452
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:46,520
Not the final shade. And that's that causal pathway of did you get better?

453
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:50,990
Did it improve your health? But yeah, that first chain, that access and utilization went way up.

454
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:56,570
So in all all these bars, the yellow is studies that found a positive effect of Medicaid expansion.

455
00:47:57,050 --> 00:48:00,230
The orange is ones that found no statistically significant effect.

456
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:05,240
And then there's a little bit of this sort of teal type color which actually showed a negative effect.

457
00:48:05,870 --> 00:48:09,070
And you kind of see overall that there's a lot of yellow here.

458
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:12,710
There's some orange and there's not much green across the outcomes.

459
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:17,840
So the by and large, across these outcomes, Medicaid expansion had beneficial effects.

460
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:25,340
Now, most of the studies have been on access and utilization or how much insurance coverage they had.

461
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,929
It's also affordability and financial security.

462
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:37,339
So things like the Oregon data we saw in several states, the ACA expansion, again, primarily 56 studies in that domain,

463
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:47,350
50 found benefits, six found no effect and none found a negative effect on provider capacity.

464
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:55,580
So where there are more providers available, what about after Medicaid expanded some evidence in favor of 16 positive studies?

465
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:59,240
19 found nothing, three found negative effects.

466
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:06,200
So at least a little bit of a change in provider capacity. But now there are much, many fewer studies about health outcomes.

467
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:10,100
That final change we're looking for, didn't did the extra medical care,

468
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:17,810
did all this extra access to utilization improve health outcomes in a lot fewer studies of that self-reported health,

469
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:23,209
kind of like that first set of Oregon measures, there are 24 studies that have looked at that.

470
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,480
15 found positive effects on self-reported health.

471
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,630
Nine found no effect, none found negative effects.

472
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:35,690
It's the state economy in 20 studies found improve the state economy.

473
00:49:35,690 --> 00:49:39,379
So the other health one is sort of more positive health outcomes.

474
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:43,400
These are more sort of explicitly measurable things like the blood pressure control.

475
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:50,360
In the Oregon study, there is a little bit more of a mixed bag, but still overall positive, far fewer studies,

476
00:49:51,410 --> 00:49:59,690
17 studies overall, nine found benefits, six found basically nothing statistically significant and two found negative effects.

477
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,060
So it's like these bars,

478
00:50:02,270 --> 00:50:08,809
these two are the ones that really show the health outcomes of Medicaid expansion and far fewer studies than some of the other outcomes.

479
00:50:08,810 --> 00:50:15,320
But on net positive, you think about your studies just because the studies reporting health outcomes are a lot more expensive to conduct.

480
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,860
And so government says, do you have insurance or not have insurance? Exactly.

481
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:26,060
You have to have the access to the data is more difficult and it's harder to do those studies and oftentimes you don't have.

482
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:31,730
So if I have claims data, for example, I'll know whether I got a blood pressure bed.

483
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:37,790
I've got the claim for the prescription, but the claims data doesn't have my blood pressure values,

484
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:40,999
that it has a diagnosis code for high blood pressure,

485
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,530
and it has a prescription that I filled for blood pressure meds,

486
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:49,220
but it doesn't say how much my blood pressure went down after I took that prescription.

487
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,850
It doesn't even say if I took the prescription as I filled it with that.

488
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,140
So a lot of times you don't have those reviews and claims data for this research.

489
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:03,230
You don't have the lab values and claims, you have some diagnosis codes and you have utilization,

490
00:51:04,190 --> 00:51:09,710
but you don't have the, if you want, see values for tracking diabetes, for example.

491
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:19,790
Okay. So here's the study we talked about. Last time the IRS study.

492
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:25,040
So we already heard a lot about that from our presentation. So I just kind of add sort of one thing.

493
00:51:27,050 --> 00:51:32,840
It's a very simple intervention, sending a letter. And sending a letter saved lives.

494
00:51:33,530 --> 00:51:40,340
Now, this is a case where, unlike the Oregon study, where we had only thousands of patients, we had millions.

495
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:45,530
So you can detect a very small effect. So overall,

496
00:51:45,530 --> 00:51:52,430
the people who got the letters were 1.3 percentage points more likely to get coverage the next year than people who didn't get the letters.

497
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:59,420
And again, the letters were sent to a randomly selected group of people who didn't pay the mandate penalty the year before.

498
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,410
So those who got the letters, those that didn't get the letter should be comparable.

499
00:52:04,550 --> 00:52:10,070
So 1.3 percentage points or about 2.8% relative were likely to get insurance.

500
00:52:10,610 --> 00:52:20,840
And in the 45 to 64 year old group, that resulted in a 0.06 percentage point lower mortality over the subsequent two years.

501
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:25,850
So again, that's not a real big effect, obviously. But remember, what the intervention is, is sending a letter.

502
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:32,959
So to have any impact on mortality from sending a letter, let's scale that one.

503
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:36,740
Avoided death per se. 648 letters sent.

504
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:41,719
What does it cost to send a letter? It sends $0.50.

505
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:46,760
So now let's say the IRS also had to spend some time setting up the program and

506
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:50,660
find and finding all these people in their database and deciding which ones.

507
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:56,540
So let's say they spent $10 per letter on the program, probably spent less than that.

508
00:52:56,610 --> 00:53:05,150
Let's just say it's $10 per letter. So multiply this four by ten that says for $16,480, they saved a life.

509
00:53:06,470 --> 00:53:12,090
That's not a goodbye. I take a lifesaver.

510
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:21,059
$16,000. Some evidence that medical care that didn't matter.

511
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:26,460
They got insurance. We don't know how much medical care they got because the IRS data does not have claims for medical care.

512
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:31,079
So we have to sort of infer those intermediate steps in our causal pathway that getting the

513
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:37,380
insurance caused them to get more care and then it caused them to a slightly lower mortality.

514
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,530
Yeah. I'm wondering if in this study were they people who were in the coverage gap or just

515
00:53:43,530 --> 00:53:50,660
like those who were healthy and just elected not to get medical insurance originally?

516
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:56,010
It's going to be a mix because it was just a random subset of all those who paid the mandate penalties.

517
00:53:56,040 --> 00:54:00,510
Some of those are people who say about 400% didn't get subsidies and just said, forget it.

518
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:07,920
Others might be ones that were, you know, the family glitch or and some other scenarios.

519
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:14,310
Now, they didn't find any significant effect on mortality in the under 40 fives because, you know, mortality rates are very low in that group.

520
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:17,579
And even with a big sample, there wasn't enough power.

521
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:24,270
So it was only it was only in sort of the middle age group that they found a statistically significant effect.

522
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:33,470
For the younger groups, you want to look at different health outcomes. Mortality is not going to be the most salient outcome for 30 year olds, which.

523
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:41,150
But that's what they could do, what they could measure with federal data, say Medicare.

524
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:47,230
So Medicare was introduced in 2005. So.

525
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:49,670
Medicare insured. What?

526
00:54:49,940 --> 00:54:59,969
Obviously substantially reduced out-of-pocket costs for the elderly prior to Medicare, the elderly uninsurance rate was something like 40% to 50%.

527
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:07,780
It was pretty high. Dramatically increased utilization, but there were no discernable effects on mortality.

528
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:12,460
So that was maybe it's data from 1965 proposed introduction of Medicare.

529
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:22,269
Some more recent data found that severely ill patients who were admitted through the E.R. at lower seven day mortality,

530
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:26,230
if they were just over 65 as compared to if they were just under 65.

531
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:32,050
So we looked at similar patients that were admitted to the E.R., say if they're 64 years old,

532
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:40,330
old and most 64 year olds have insurance, but not all were essentially all 65 year old insurance because of Medicare.

533
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:51,760
So you get that bumped from maybe 15% uninsured at that time, 10 to 15%, probably close to 65 to 0% uninsured.

534
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:58,780
And that actually translated into law a seven day mortality for this kind of severely in the subset of patients.

535
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:03,070
So being a year older actually saved has actually saved your life.

536
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:09,370
Not only think of mortality going up when you get older, but one year older.

537
00:56:09,370 --> 00:56:12,970
If that year is accompanied with getting Medicare as opposed to being uninsured,

538
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:22,390
you're actually more likely to live if you're one year older than one year ago. Why do people make good decisions?

539
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,480
It's something we've already talked about a bit.

540
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:33,850
So while we've got this wonderful consumer here who's making decisions about their medical care, they say, I've got this demand curve for care.

541
00:56:33,850 --> 00:56:41,500
I'm ranking all the care from high value to low value. A face, not a pocket price, a piece star.

542
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:47,860
I'm going to say, hey, I want all of these units of care. These are all the ones that I believe are worth more than star to me.

543
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,139
And I'm not going to buy any of these units of care, even though they have positive value.

544
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:58,750
To me, I would take them if they were free or low value relative to the price of each star.

545
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:07,569
So do people behave that way? Do they say, Well, if I face a ticket price, a piece star, I'm definitely getting this stuff.

546
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:14,390
And then I get that stuff. So we know that people cut back on care.

547
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:21,610
So it's clear that when out-of-pocket costs go up, people buy less care out of pocket costs go down, they buy more hair.

548
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:27,130
But overall, it seems like they cut back fairly indiscriminately.

549
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:32,080
Let's talk about these high out-of-pocket costs. I'm not going to get this.

550
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:37,640
You don't care and also not get this unit of care. I'm just going to cut back overall.

551
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,660
I don't laser beam in and say I'm only going to cut back on this.

552
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:45,560
So let's say originally I had no out-of-pocket costs. I buy all of this care.

553
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:48,320
All out-of-pocket costs goes up to star.

554
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:54,200
What we hope people will do is say, I'm going to identify the lowest value care, and that's what I'm not going to get.

555
00:57:55,170 --> 00:58:02,030
I'm still going to get all the good stuff. Instead, they just kind of cut back kind of indiscriminately on everything.

556
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:12,330
So the Rand study, they found sort of high value and low value care kind of both went down in similar percentages

557
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:20,010
for those people who had the higher out-of-pocket costs of some Medicare prescription plans.

558
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:25,020
We see that prescription fills again. You know, what are you not going to fill?

559
00:58:25,050 --> 00:58:27,570
So if you have high out-of-pocket costs for drugs, well,

560
00:58:27,570 --> 00:58:34,530
we hope you would not fill is maybe something that treats a skin condition that's mildly annoying but not dangerous.

561
00:58:35,070 --> 00:58:40,860
But you're going to take your blood pressure meds and your cholesterol meds if you're at high risk of a heart attack.

562
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:49,770
And it turned out, nope, they cut back their statements that are antihypertensives even even people who were at risk of heart attack or stroke.

563
00:58:55,390 --> 00:59:00,130
It's a study of a firm. KAGAN Just on the theme of sort of random variation.

564
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:04,660
Economists often look for situations where there's sort of a natural experiment created.

565
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:11,800
So here is a firm that said, well, next year we're simply switching all of our employees into a high deductible plan.

566
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:17,740
So they looked at what happened. Okay. Well, I first piece of the causal path happened.

567
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:23,110
They did cut back quite a bit on spending about 12 to 14% reduction in spending.

568
00:59:23,930 --> 00:59:26,110
That's a pretty big decrease in medical spending.

569
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:32,530
They found, first of all, that that spending was driven really entirely by reductions in the quantity of care.

570
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:39,459
In other words, there was no evidence of shopping around. They didn't cut spending by saying, I'm still going to get that MRI,

571
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:43,510
but now I'm going to get the MRI at the cheap place instead of the expensive place.

572
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:48,760
So the reduction in spending was entirely based on quantity cuts, not price cuts.

573
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:52,240
They got less care. They didn't shop around for cheaper care.

574
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:59,470
And they found similarly to around, when they looked at what care people cut back on,

575
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:05,020
it seemed to be sort of indiscriminate between high value care and cut back on all kinds of stuff.

576
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:17,950
Now, another similar study was a little bit more. Optimistic the people were able to sort of laser in on more value care.

577
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:25,540
So in other firms, switching to a high deductible plan found very similar reduction in low value services,

578
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:29,720
about 14%, but that was significantly more than high value services.

579
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:36,430
So in that group, people, for whatever reason, were able to laser in a little bit more on.

580
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:47,290
They cut more of this stuff than this stuff, basically. Whereas in the first term they kind of cut these things equally to these things.

581
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:58,250
Savings were mostly from lower quantity of care, but they did find at least some evidence of price shopping.

582
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:03,320
So for whatever reason, that firm's employees were a little bit more savvy.

583
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:09,770
Shoppers shopped a little bit on price, and they cut down low value services more than high value services,

584
01:01:10,430 --> 01:01:14,510
whereas this firm's employees just kind of said that's come back.

585
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:18,920
It's just quantity. And it was equal for low, high value here.

586
01:01:19,820 --> 01:01:24,530
So it goes back to Dr. Fender talk on value based insurance design,

587
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:29,600
the argument that sort of the standard way cost sharing has been implemented in most insurance plans.

588
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:37,220
It's a blunt instrument. So if I've got a 25 versus $25 out of pocket costs, $25 co-pay on drugs.

589
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:41,299
Well, if it's if I need a drug, I pay $25 out of pocket for it.

590
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,390
If it's a life saving drug, over $25 out of pocket for it.

591
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:53,600
And value based insurance design says, wait a second. Why do we make that zero?

592
01:01:57,310 --> 01:02:07,920
And make that 50. So we have evidence that people sort of cut back sort of fairly indiscriminately.

593
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:15,840
So if we charge them $25 for any prescription, they're going to be cutting back on these things and they're going to be cutting back on these things.

594
01:02:16,170 --> 01:02:21,440
We'd rather have them cut back on these and not cut back on these.

595
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:25,050
So we manipulate the co-pays based on the value of the service.

596
01:02:25,650 --> 01:02:31,379
The idea of value based insurance design. The doctors often talked about another trying to do that,

597
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:37,230
but isn't that exactly the opposite of what an insurance company might or a drug company is not going to?

598
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:41,640
I mean, I don't know how you do that because, like life saving drugs are the ones that cost more money.

599
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:50,350
Well, not necessarily because there are statins are now most of our generics, I guess antihypertensives.

600
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:54,160
So a lot of the a lot of the life saving drugs are pretty cheap.

601
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,630
I guess I was thinking more for the rare disease type stuff.

602
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:01,840
So like the biologics and things like that that are, you know, tens of thousands of dollars.

603
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:14,980
All right. I think I'm going to kind of skip over this because you can kind of look at these on your own.

604
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,950
It's nothing to complicate. I just kind of mentioned this one quickly.

605
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:25,370
Have you seen the kind of McAllen, Texas, versus El Paso, Texas, study that will go on?

606
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:33,590
They did. So for those who haven't seen it to very similar communities in Texas, similar sized towns,

607
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:39,140
both border towns, very similar per capita income, very similar demographics.

608
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:45,120
And Medicare spending in McAllen, Texas, was double that in El Paso.

609
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:49,729
Not big differences in these populations in terms of their health status,

610
01:03:49,730 --> 01:03:53,900
their demographics, their income, any other measurable aspect of their populations.

611
01:03:54,350 --> 01:04:05,090
These are similar towns, and yet Medicare spending was double the health care system of McAllen, driven by a lot of, say, specialty owned hospitals.

612
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:12,320
So utilization was very high. The indication for a cardiac procedure is basically that you had a heart.

613
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,870
El Paso didn't have those specially driven hospitals.

614
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,750
That wasn't the only thing going on, but that was one of the big differences between those two communities.

615
01:04:22,080 --> 01:04:25,710
Their health care systems treated people at similar people very differently.

616
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,730
And just an interesting point of comparison.

617
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:39,030
Same year of data, if you look at Rochester, Minnesota, the home of the Mayo Clinic with much higher income than McAllen and El Paso,

618
01:04:39,030 --> 01:04:42,530
and they actually had lower Medicare spending per enrollee.

619
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:50,860
So it's not it's hard to argue that, well, McAllen, Texas, has much higher quality of care.

620
01:04:56,820 --> 01:05:02,070
So that's a very well-known study by Julia London. So that's we will.

621
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:08,579
That you want to spend at least a few minutes starting on sort of costs.

622
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:11,649
So the rest is mostly fairly self-explanatory.

623
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:15,810
Some kind of look through the notes. W What?

624
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:29,420
Penalty. We pay for awesome guest speakers. You get a little bit behind.

625
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:42,010
All right. So when we talk about production functions, one of the things we emphasized is there were no dollar signs.

626
01:05:43,010 --> 01:05:45,130
We're just talking about technical relationships.

627
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:50,590
If I have this many units of capital on this, many units of labor, how many units of output can I produce?

628
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:58,180
We're talking today about the health production function. If I use this much medical care and I have this set of good health habits and I've got

629
01:05:58,180 --> 01:06:02,890
this set of bad health habits and I've got this environment around me and these exposures,

630
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:07,720
what's my health status? And we didn't put dollar signs on anything.

631
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:17,200
So today, when I begin to put dollar signs on things where I said, you know, so what do we mean by cost?

632
01:06:17,770 --> 01:06:20,860
And then we're going to move to what input bundles should a firm choose.

633
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:25,830
So if you remember last time we drew Isopods and they kind of looked like indifference curves,

634
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:33,190
we had sort of our standard shapes and we said, Well, you don't have to.

635
01:06:34,570 --> 01:06:40,620
And I want that looks like that. Diminishing marginal rate of technical substitution.

636
01:06:40,620 --> 01:06:45,120
Going back to the jargon from that's the slope that I supply is going from steep to flat.

637
01:06:45,930 --> 01:06:53,350
So this is how substitutable are those inputs? If I have a very capital intensive bundle, I could drop capital a lot higher.

638
01:06:53,370 --> 01:07:00,240
Only a few more workers and keep producing the same quantity that people start.

639
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:11,040
We had inputs that were perfect substitutes. You have linear isopods, so I could trade them at a constant rate.

640
01:07:11,040 --> 01:07:16,679
If I reduce capital by this amount, I'd have to hire this many more workers, like you said, by that amount again,

641
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:23,580
or have to hire that same additional amount of workers to keep producing like ten units of output.

642
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:31,070
Okay. And then, not surprisingly, you're taking back to indifference curves or other extreme case.

643
01:07:31,550 --> 01:07:37,340
So here's some substitute ability. And how much substitute really depends on what bundle we're starting from.

644
01:07:38,500 --> 01:07:44,080
Here's perfect substitute ability, where my ability to substitute doesn't depend on what bundle I'm starting from.

645
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:54,530
It's always at the same rate. And we also. Have those isopods in other words, production functions,

646
01:07:54,980 --> 01:08:00,469
I suppose necessarily as drive for production functions that reflect perfect complementarity of inputs.

647
01:08:00,470 --> 01:08:05,090
We call that fixed proportions production. So the example in that clip, that lecture,

648
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:15,200
was if it takes one machine and one worker to produce ten units of output and a second machine without a worker

649
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:21,649
is useless because it requires a worker's full attention and a second worker without a machine is useless.

650
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:26,360
Because if we don't give that second worker a machine, it doesn't make the first machine work any better.

651
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,629
We would say that we would use them in fixed proportions.

652
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:34,400
We would always have one worker, one machine, just like we'd always have one left shoe, have one right shoe.

653
01:08:34,970 --> 01:08:39,470
So those are kind of our technical possibilities of what Isopods might look like.

654
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:44,350
So in this class we're going to start finished this next week where start talking about, well,

655
01:08:44,360 --> 01:08:49,370
which of these bundles is most economically efficient, what's the cheapest way of producing ten cars?

656
01:08:50,090 --> 01:08:55,920
So let's just tells us what are what's possible. How can we turn inputs and outputs?

657
01:08:55,930 --> 01:08:59,860
It doesn't tell us what labor costs, what capital costs or what the cheapest funding will be.

658
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:07,420
So what we're going to do now is develop ideas of how we can say, well, what would be the cheapest way of producing ten units of output?

659
01:09:09,010 --> 01:09:13,540
So what input bundles should the firm choose? So that we're going to have to then put prices on things,

660
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:17,290
we're actually going to lift the price of labor or price of capital, for example, in order to input.

661
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:29,260
So there are three kind of concepts of costs. The first two are going to be very closely related.

662
01:09:29,310 --> 01:09:32,690
I would argue they're only different based on sort of whose perspective was being taken.

663
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:42,050
So we already saw, I think back in the first day of classes, opportunity cost, the opportunity cost of a resources, its value of its next best use.

664
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:52,440
So deciding whether to study econ tonight. And if you asked yourself, if I weren't studying econ for an hour tonight, what would I do with my time?

665
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:56,520
And if your answer is, I would watch two episodes of my favorite show.

666
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:03,380
And you say the opportunity cost of studying econ is you're giving up two TV episodes.

667
01:10:08,190 --> 01:10:15,690
It is a concept called economic cost that is very similar, but opportunity cost takes the perspective of the owner of the input.

668
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,010
You're the owner of your time.

669
01:10:17,550 --> 01:10:24,900
So you're saying, so if I'm going to study for an hour or if I'm going to take a job and work for an hour, what am I giving up?

670
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:31,170
What would I what would I have liked to have done with that hour had I not gone to work for that hour and I not studied for that?

671
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:38,100
Our economic class takes the perspective of the person that's trying to hire the input to hire the resource.

672
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:45,950
The economic cost of a resource is defined as the amount that you have to pay it to keep it in its present use.

673
01:10:46,530 --> 01:10:51,270
So you currently work for me, you have a job, I pay you $10 an hour.

674
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:57,870
The salary. What do you think?

675
01:10:57,890 --> 01:11:02,950
You get an alternative job. 15.

676
01:11:06,160 --> 01:11:12,820
More 20, say 20. Okay. So if you're working for me and I'm paying you $10 an hour.

677
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:19,240
How long are you going to keep that job? How?

678
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:23,190
Until I find a new one. Yeah, as soon as you can get out the door.

679
01:11:23,190 --> 01:11:28,830
You're getting out the door. Right. So in other words, if I expect to keep you employed in my job.

680
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,010
I better pay you $20 an hour.

681
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:40,680
If I don't pay you $20 an hour and somebody else will pay you $20 an hour for a job that is otherwise equally desirable or undesirable.

682
01:11:42,590 --> 01:11:46,230
You're not going to stay. So look at it from your perspective.

683
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:51,350
Your opportunity cost of working for me is you're giving up a $20 an hour job somewhere else.

684
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:55,820
So you would say, well, my opportunity cost of working for Hearst is too high.

685
01:11:55,850 --> 01:12:01,760
I quit. So I'm looking at it from my perspective as I'm trying to hire you and keep you employed.

686
01:12:02,180 --> 01:12:12,360
If I'm only paying you $10 an hour. I'm not covering the economic cost of employing you because if I don't pay you $20 an hour, you're going to leave.

687
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:18,720
So in most most cases where you put dollars on it, the opportunity cost and economic cost is going to be the same.

688
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:24,000
Your opportunity cost of working for me is you're giving up a $20 an hour job somewhere else.

689
01:12:24,870 --> 01:12:28,079
The economic cost to me is if I want to keep you working for me,

690
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:32,790
I'd better pay you that $20 so you don't leave for a better opportunity that's available to you.

691
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:41,020
So the economic cost and the opportunity cost, the resource are both $20.

692
01:12:41,050 --> 01:12:44,050
The only difference is the perspective. Opportunity cost the same.

693
01:12:44,410 --> 01:12:47,600
You know, what is it? What are you giving up to work for me?

694
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:52,510
And the economic cost is what do I have to give you to keep you from leaving?

695
01:12:54,130 --> 01:12:58,490
And the answer in both cases is $20. Now.

696
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:07,100
There are some exceptions to that. Let's say you've got a good union job that pays $40 an hour and that's above the market wage.

697
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:11,780
So in other words, if you quit that union job, you could only find a $20 an hour job.

698
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:17,899
And said, well, even though you're getting paid 40, the opportunity cost is a $20 job.

699
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:24,770
So for sure you're staying. If I could somehow as that union employer pay you 30 instead of 20, you would still stay.

700
01:13:25,100 --> 01:13:29,390
These are alternatives, a $20 job, but the contract precludes me from doing that.

701
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:36,440
So sometimes the amount that I pay pay is not a good reflection of the opportunity cost or the economic cost.

702
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:48,900
But most of the time it is. If I were to set accounting courses just so I can have stock, you know, it's an out of pocket measure.

703
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:56,550
It's what did you pay? So the cost of a good or service from an accounting perspective is what was paid out of pocket.

704
01:13:57,330 --> 01:14:00,930
When it's a durable good, there are rules to sort of prorate that over time.

705
01:14:02,070 --> 01:14:10,740
So if I bought a piece of machinery five years ago, what does it cost me this year in my accounting books?

706
01:14:10,740 --> 01:14:15,209
Well, there's a depreciation formula. This is what I bought it four or five years ago.

707
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:18,840
This is the number of years I'm depreciated, depreciating it over.

708
01:14:19,470 --> 01:14:25,980
And if I'm doing that straight line that I'm just taking, let's say it was $1,000 five years ago and I'm depreciating it over ten years.

709
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:35,730
My accountant says that machine costs me $100 a year for ten years, at which point it's fully depreciated and costs me nothing beyond ten years.

710
01:14:37,610 --> 01:14:42,830
So that's sort of a modified out of pocket basis use of historical out of pocket purchase price,

711
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:46,690
but it just recognizes that machine is valuable for more than one year.

712
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:56,240
So we're going to sort of cost it out over a period of time rather than entirely your purchase for things that are not durable.

713
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:01,559
All materials. It's just clustered literally in and out of pocket during the year.

714
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:07,940
I bought it. So which concepts are better?

715
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:12,790
So the world's most boring fight economists versus accounts.

716
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:18,940
The first round goes to economists, so let's use that machine example.

717
01:15:19,540 --> 01:15:25,350
So let's say I bought ten years ago for $1,000 and I'm depreciating in a straight line over ten years.

718
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:30,700
So the column says that machine cost me $100 a year for ten years and nothing thereafter.

719
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:39,340
An economist would say, Well, but that historical purchase price was ten years ago really isn't relevant to my decisions today.

720
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:48,280
So we call a sunk cost. That money is gone and doesn't bear any necessary relationship to the value of that today.

721
01:15:49,770 --> 01:15:52,950
What's the opportunity cost of having that machine now in your five?

722
01:15:54,040 --> 01:16:00,630
What if I. If I have it, that means I'm using it myself. I could sell it or I could rent it out to somebody else.

723
01:16:02,400 --> 01:16:07,530
Let's say similar machines cost $5,000 now, and maybe I could rent it out for $500.

724
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:13,860
So the opportunity cost of using that machine myself is I'm giving up $500 of rental income.

725
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:18,540
So my accountant says that machine costs me $100 this year.

726
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:26,640
An economist say no. Using a machine costs you $500 if you gave up $500 of rental income that you could have had.

727
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:31,890
Conversely, what if the machine is broken and irreparable?

728
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:37,670
Other than whatever salvage value it might have for its metal.

729
01:16:39,500 --> 01:16:45,350
Its opportunity cost is essentially nothing. Nobody would rent it for me because it doesn't work and it can't be fixed.

730
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:54,310
I can't use it myself because it doesn't work and it can't be fixed. So again, that what I paid four or five years ago is really not relevant to that.

731
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:08,010
Second round. If I own a firm, what right does that give me this me the right to keep whatever accounting profits I generate.

732
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:17,200
And so the counting profits don't. Track the opportunity cost of the owner's time.

733
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:24,430
Suppose I decide to quit my job here and instead I'm going to be an independent consultant.

734
01:17:24,490 --> 01:17:33,610
So I start my own consulting business and this year I invest, say, $50,000 in my business.

735
01:17:34,910 --> 01:17:41,120
You know, computers, marketing materials, hiring some staff, whatever.

736
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:47,660
And I earned $60,000. Does my accountant say I'm profitable this year?

737
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:54,799
Yeah. I made $10,000 of accounting profit. Wouldn't.

738
01:17:54,800 --> 01:18:00,650
Economists say I was profitable this year. I guarantee you I paid more than $10,000 a year.

739
01:18:03,110 --> 01:18:12,470
So I sacrificed a job that would have earned me a lot more than $10,000 a year in order to invest in a business that earned me $10,000 a year.

740
01:18:13,250 --> 01:18:16,910
From an economic perspective, that was a big money losing business.

741
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:24,460
An economist would say that was an unprofitable business. An account which measures things out of pocket.

742
01:18:24,490 --> 01:18:27,770
Says that's a profitable business. Out of pocket.

743
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,830
I only spent $50,000. I made $60,000.

744
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:43,620
So what if I have assets of $100,000 in my company and I'm only making $1,000 a year using those assets and I'm making accounting profits?

745
01:18:43,630 --> 01:18:54,430
That's a profitable business. I made $1,000 in profit, but I easily could have liquidated that money and earned a lot more than 1% on it.

746
01:18:55,750 --> 01:19:00,120
So an economist would again say that I'm not profitable. Okay.

747
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:03,520
So are accounting costs irrelevant? Absolutely not.

748
01:19:06,420 --> 01:19:10,170
What if I went to the IRS and I filed my taxes with my consulting business?

749
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:15,420
I didn't realize I've already over $0.51.

750
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:22,110
And I said, you know what? Actually, I lost money because I quit my university job.

751
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:24,480
So actually, I have this much losses this year.

752
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:30,839
Not only do I not own or any taxes, but I can write those losses off against any other income I have from,

753
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:36,090
say, my stock portfolio and carry forward losses to future years.

754
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:46,810
What's the IRS going to say? We have a nice jail cell with your name on the IRS is going to say no,

755
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:53,380
you earned $10,000 in profits and you get a report that I don't get to write off the opportunity cost of my time.

756
01:19:58,420 --> 01:19:58,780
So.
