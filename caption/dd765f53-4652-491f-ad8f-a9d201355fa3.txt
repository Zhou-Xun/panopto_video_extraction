00:00:05,827 --> 00:00:10,726
Our bodies have several different ways in
which they work to maintain stability in

2
00:00:10,726 --> 00:00:12,560
our homeostasis.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:17,500
This can be done through either
physiologic change or behavioral changes.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:22,680
This process of achieving stability
through changes in the face of a stressor

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,290
is call allostasis.

6
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,670
Generally, allostasis is a good thing.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:31,130
We want our body to be able
to respond appropriately

8
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:35,460
when challenged with a stressor, so
that we can maintain normal functioning.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:38,500
This is the whole point of homeostasis.

10
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,600
However when our body is
faced with chronic or

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,410
multiple stressors that require our
body to respond over and over and

12
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:50,380
over, this places a lot of wear and
tear on our systems.

13
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,830
And this is known as allostatic load.

14
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:57,830
Let's think of an example that we might
be familiar with and of how this wear and

15
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,710
tear can be detrimental to our body.

16
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:05,670
Let's think about the thermostat and
furnace system in our house that works to

17
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:10,260
maintain the temperature or
the homeostasis of our home.

18
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,159
Imagine that you set the temperature
of that thermostat to 70 degrees and

19
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,502
then you quickly turn it up to 72.

20
00:01:17,502 --> 00:01:18,478
What will happen?

21
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:20,220
Well, the furnace will kick in.

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:23,810
The furnace will kick in to blow
in more warm air into the home and

23
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:28,410
raise the temperature from
70 degrees to 72 degrees.

24
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:33,523
What if then when the temperature
gets to 72, you turn it up to 74?

25
00:01:33,523 --> 00:01:37,470
The furnace will kick in again to be
able to get to the set point that you

26
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,360
initiated.

27
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,150
Then if you get to 74 degrees in
your home and you turn it up to 76,

28
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:47,300
the furnace is going to kick in again.

29
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,800
This process of you raising
the temperature over and over and

30
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,400
over again is an external stimuli to
your furnace to consistently kick in and

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,450
begin blowing in more air and
working harder and

32
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:04,410
harder and harder to respond to
those stimuli that you initiate.

33
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,480
So the working furnace works harder and
harder without a chance to rest

34
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,440
because of the chronic and persistent
stimuli of you raising the temperature.

35
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,060
And this will result in wear and
tear on your furnace.

36
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,320
If you keep working
your furnace harder and

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,300
harder, it's not going to
have an ability to rest.

38
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,850
And it's going to put out more energy

39
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,800
that will cause the furnace
to break down sooner.

40
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,200
The same experience happens in our body
when we experience multiple stressors

41
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,510
without the chance to rest in between.

42
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,430
If we chronically experience
stressors over and

43
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,760
over and over again, without the ability
of our body to respond to them and

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,760
resolve the situation, our body
will also experience wear and tear.

45
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,000
And this is allostatic load.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
Research has demonstrated that high
allostatic load is related to increased

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,330
risk for many health problems and
diseases including cardiovascular disease,

48
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:05,950
diabetes, arthritis and cancer,
as well as all cause mortality.

49
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,540
On this slide, from a review in 2009,
on the stress response,

50
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,770
we see many of the signaling pathways that
are involved in homeostatic regulation.

51
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:19,160
And these pathways may be
subject to allostatic load and

52
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:23,640
become disordered in the face
of multiple chronic stressors.

53
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,780
We see that these pathways
ultimately end in disease outcomes

54
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:32,820
due to the overworking of the system and
result in poor health.

55
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,900
Note the important factors at the start of
the system such as genetics, nutrition,

56
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,190
and age.

57
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,000
These are important inputs
into the equation and

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,880
understanding overall
paradigm of our static road.

59
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,750
As it suggests,
the individuals may be more or

60
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:52,730
less susceptible to the stressors for
varied reasons.

61
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,189
This is critically important to us
as public health practitioners as we

62
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,872
understand why some individuals might
be able to manage stress better than

63
00:04:01,872 --> 00:04:06,855
others or why other individuals might
be more susceptible to disease-related

64
00:04:06,855 --> 00:04:13,439
outcomes due to stressors of interest.

65
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,639
Learning more about the multiple
ways individuals experience and

66
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,589
respond to stress and how this is related
to health outcomes is critical to both

67
00:04:22,589 --> 00:04:27,839
developing effective coping strategies at
the individual level and in developing

68
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:33,090
innovative, multidimensional disease
prevention programs as our role of public

69
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:38,245
health practitioners in understanding
the impact of health and stress.
