00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:11,380
Welcome to Apted 634 as module and linking transmission models, epidemiological metrics, part two prevalence in part to this model.

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:22,250
We'll first focus on prevalence. So let's look at his simple condition where the forced infection is constant, therefore X is equal to s not.

3
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:28,350
Times eat the minus I. T, as we saw on the previous recording. The disease is chronic.

4
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:33,180
Therefore, there is no recovery. Here we see that the prevalence,

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:42,930
the number of cases that are present at time t divided by the total population equals one minus E to the minus high T,

6
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,220
where the total number of cases is the initial number is acceptable,

7
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:57,210
minus the number of sepals that time T and the number of of the time T is equal to E to the minus 18.

8
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:04,800
So let's relax this assumption that there is no recovery. We can do this by using our S.A.S. model.

9
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:14,100
Here we see steady state. We get the following relationship by setting Beda times eye to little eye equaling

10
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:22,230
the force of infection and then setting the disease duration D to one over Delta.

11
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:29,920
We can see we can then use this relationship that I her state variables equal to the force infection,

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:43,350
Nataline Times disease duration D times the number of susceptible zests and input this into our equation for prevalence which equals to I over s.

13
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:47,170
Plus I have prevalence is small.

14
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:55,650
We get our epidemiological relationship between prevalence and incidents as we've seen as we see here and seen before.

15
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:06,240
Again, this approximation holds if the populations that studies date that is the population is stationary, the recovery times are constant.

16
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,860
That is the disease duration and three.

17
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:15,000
The incidence is constant over the time period of interest.

18
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,500
Now, let's look at the attack rate, which is defined as the proportion of infected over a period of time.

19
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:31,380
So the attack rate, which is really a proportion, is a measure of the intensity of an outbreak.

20
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:38,440
For a disease with constant force of infection. Eventually, everyone gets the disease.

21
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,470
Here, the attack rate is described as a proportion where the numerators,

22
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:49,000
the number is susceptible that were infected between zero and time T and the numerator.

23
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,720
And the denominator is the total number of receptacles at time zero.

24
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,130
Also, under this assumption, there is no recovery. The attack rate is the same as the prevalence.

25
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,600
And as we derived earlier. For small force of infection.

26
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:17,400
And when the force in vacuum is a constant, the attack rate approximates the force of infection.

27
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,160
Now, let's look at the relationship between the attack rate and the reproductive number are not.

28
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,680
We will look at the derivation of this relationship. The next slide.

29
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:39,240
But for now, here is the plot, the function showing that as our not increases, so does the resulting attack rate for our not less than one.

30
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:47,080
The attack rate is zero. And as our not increases to five, the curve asymptote to one.

31
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:55,500
One insight we can get from this graph is that the impact of transmission reduction depends on the baseline values of our NOT.

32
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:06,030
If our night is five and an intervention decreases the transmission by 20 percent, there is only a one point three percent decrease in attack rate.

33
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:15,720
If our night is three and the intervention decreases the transmission by 20 percent, there is a six point two percent decrease in attack rate.

34
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:24,180
And if Arnott is one point five and the intervention decreases transmission by 20 percent, there's a 27 percent decrease in the tax rate.

35
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:36,120
So the effort to get our not to to provide much less health benefits than the efforts to reduce our not from two to one.

36
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,280
Here is the derivation for the relationship between are not an attack rate that we saw on the prior slide.

37
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,600
We start with our essay, our model, by dividing our DSD t equation, by our DTT equation.

38
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,780
We get the following relation ship between S and R,

39
00:04:53,780 --> 00:05:03,770
where DSD R is a first order or name differential equation and its solution is a decreasing exponential function, as we've seen before.

40
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:14,110
Next, we take her equation for attack rate and solve for her safety and set equal to infinity.

41
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:21,280
Third, we combine the equations from one and two and said X equals some affinity using our relationship.

42
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:29,700
We found from two. Then we bring in ah, the state ah.

43
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:37,050
At that time, infinity, which is equal to has the initial value of S minus the number of sepals.

44
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,730
At the time infinity.

45
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:51,580
And finally, we combine three and four to derive our relationship between attack rate and or not, that is present in the prior slide.

46
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:56,890
There's a lot of algebra represented here, and you can look at it in more detail at your leisure.

47
00:05:56,890 --> 00:06:02,080
But the main message from this relationship is twofold.

48
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,070
One is derived from an essay or model, and two,

49
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:17,210
its properties have provided valuable insight for public health decision making as as I demonstrated in the prior slide.

50
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:24,640
So now let's shift to another important measure. The average age to infection.

51
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,230
We have seen that in viral infections that have a long term immunity.

52
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:36,590
The proportion of Sarah positive portion of Sarah positive rises with age.

53
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:44,600
These age stratified serologic data allow us to derive the average age to infection.

54
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:52,400
This is a sketch of the year of the derivation showing that the average age of infection is equal to one over the forceful infection.

55
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:03,500
For those interested, they can read the article by deeds listed in the syllabus and on the campus site that provides a more detailed derivation.

56
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,250
The next concept or measure that I'm covering here is herd immunity,

57
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:16,480
defined as the condition when a sufficient number of the population are immune, preventing spread of disease.

58
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,840
If an infection is introduced, remember from our essay, our model to prevent an infection.

59
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:27,880
We need to ensure that has never receptacles less than Delta overpaid.

60
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,790
Where our not is equal to veto over Delta.

61
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:45,080
Therefore, we get the following relationship where HA represents the number of the moon and S and S is equal to one minus half.

62
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:52,070
We can use this equation to predict the fraction immune required to eliminate disease.

63
00:07:52,070 --> 00:08:02,150
For example, if adon equals five, for example, is smallpox, at least 80 percent of the population must be immune.

64
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:13,920
Alternatively, if Aadhar is fifteen, which is more like measles, at least 93 percent of the population must be immune.

65
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,270
The last measure I want to talk about here is the reproductive number.

66
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:25,500
This is a measure that we've already talked about and we will devote a whole week's whole week to this measure.

67
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:32,940
So here I just want to define are not the basic reproductive number as the average number of secondary infections

68
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:43,280
produced when one infectious infected individual is introduced into a completely susceptible host population.

69
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:50,540
This is an idealized number that is a measure of the epidemic, potential of an infectious disease.

70
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:57,590
We will learn later that the effective reproductive number as opposed to the basic reproductive number that's presented here,

71
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:05,580
is a value that varies over time. Every five is a measure of the epidemic potential during current conditions.

72
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:12,550
The other point I would like to make here is that our not is not only a function of transmissibility and disease duration.

73
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,860
Our model parameters that we use to derive are not.

74
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:25,960
It is also a function of population density and immune status. Therefore, for a given infectious disease are not can vary from context, context.

75
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:31,985
And from one geographic location to another.
