1
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:05,350
I can tell you this exact thing.

2
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,100
I think you have to sign up for him, but you can do whatever you want.

3
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,820
That's the same thing I would do.

4
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,610
So, are you all right?

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:28,530
So I just don't think it's all good.

6
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:35,910
Yeah, that's all right. So we're going to finish up our conversation about measurement.

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:43,140
We're going to come back to this several times over the course. So fundamental to everything that we're doing in this class.

8
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:53,850
The fourth, again, I guess I want to ask if there are questions about the check point or anything related to that.

9
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:10,070
All right. Well, I'm excited to see what you come up with. You have lots of great ideas.

10
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:16,520
You know, I appreciate the feedback in a public forum so you can kind of see other, you know, just other types of things.

11
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,820
Right. So it's it's helpful.

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,210
And there's lots of things that you may be interested in, but you don't necessarily want to do your project on that topic.

13
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:30,650
Okay. What if there's something that's talked about that makes people.

14
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:38,600
So just a reminder, last week we talked about the DSM and mostly it's sort of what mental disorders are and sort of what the

15
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:45,410
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual are trying to do versus what we sometimes think that they're trying to do.

16
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,710
Okay. You also watched a couple of recorded lectures.

17
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:54,440
Hopefully, I'm going to review them in a second. On general methods for field research.

18
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,700
This is going to be really apparent today because you're actually going to do an exercise where

19
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,240
you going to interview each other and make posters that we actually use in the communities.

20
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:06,590
And doing this research is doing a reflective exercise on that.

21
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:12,380
Today we're going to talk mostly around measuring treatment need as a as distinct from measuring symptoms.

22
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:18,680
And then we'll do this interview activity on Wednesday. We're going to have week three, our presentation of the readings.

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,630
So these are folks are going to be presenting on the week three topic, which is on stress and mental health.

24
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:30,709
Victoria Kolesnikova, who's just finished her Ph.D. with me, is going to be presenting on some of her dissertation work,

25
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:37,370
which was really focused on this question of how do we measure stress and what does it mean to say your stress induced?

26
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:44,809
What is your body doing when you say you're stressed? And how are those things expected to be congruent or not congruent and etc., etc.?

27
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,549
It's a really fascinating topic.

28
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:53,390
So she's going to she's going to talk to you about that, including presenting some data that I've collected on the Stress and Sugar Study,

29
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:56,090
which is used for those of you who've already done the readings for this week,

30
00:02:56,450 --> 00:03:00,950
the true social stress test as a means of actually eliciting an acute stress response.

31
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:08,419
And to what degree that maps onto what we what we say and what we say.

32
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:13,060
I feel stressed, so that'll be great. Okay.

33
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:20,060
So let me just summarize the recorded lectures from week to three, which are on the survey research methods.

34
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:29,290
So the first thing to remember, and I mean, I presume all of you are experts that like BuzzFeed quizzes of some type, right?

35
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:35,810
Like you will pick which of those right colors is most meaningful, which of these pictures.

36
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:42,380
Right. So what that of course all of that is [INAUDIBLE]. Right. But the point is, is that if you ask, you will get an answer.

37
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,990
That is not there's no question that you will get an answer from a response.

38
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,350
The only question is, should you believe what they say?

39
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:57,170
And so the what that means is how you ask, matters as much as what you ask.

40
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:03,530
And some of the things that I talk about those videos or how factors like the mode of interview,

41
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:13,300
whether this is in-person versus online versus over this ancient device that your parents may know about called a telephone versus paper and pencil,

42
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:13,700
right?

43
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:22,820
So like all of those have different sources of error and what potentially give you different amounts of noise around your the thing you care about.

44
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,980
This is going to come up a lot when we start asking people about, do you use cocaine?

45
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,900
Okay, do you use heroin? Have you ever taken a pill that wasn't prescribed to you?

46
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:39,500
All right. Depending on how you do, in what mode you ask that question, you will get very, very different types of responses.

47
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:44,000
People are willing to tell you about their drug use, but only under certain conditions.

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,670
Okay. The second thing is not just the mode of interview, but the structure of the interview.

49
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:58,370
What's around the questions that you're asking about? What are the things that are really sensitive for people to talk about?

50
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:12,669
Yeah. Like sexual health, right? Yeah. So you probably wouldn't ask your first question about sex, right?

51
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,700
Yeah. What else? What else is hard for people to talk about you?

52
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:26,490
Traumatic experiences don't lead with trauma. Yeah. Could I say this?

53
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,800
Because not everybody. This is not self-evident to all people.

54
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,760
You also don't lead with how much money do you make? How often do you go to church?

55
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:40,270
Do you believe in God? Right. Like I'm. What was your relationship with your parents like?

56
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:44,460
Okay. Like you don't lead with those things. You needed to establish a rapport with the respondent.

57
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:55,190
But the other thing that's important is that if you ask about traumatic experiences, for example, and then ask about stress or or depressive symptoms,

58
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,179
I guarantee you you're going to get more you're going to elicit higher levels of depression versus if you had asked about

59
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,450
those in reverse order and you actually do experiments with this where you randomize the order of questions that people get,

60
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,000
everybody gets the same questions, but they get them in different orders.

61
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,530
So again and then the last thing is who is in your study has a major influence on the

62
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:16,340
estimates of prevalence and potentially risk factors and definitely on prevalence.

63
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,670
But if you go and ask students at the University of Michigan some of the scales that we're going to do today,

64
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,909
you will get a different answer than if you went into a primary care clinic at Michigan Medicine.

65
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:36,709
You will get a different answer than if you ask those exact same questions to a incarcerated population and you will get those, you know.

66
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:47,000
So how the literally the sample itself is going to happen, it's possible that those prevalence differences are real,

67
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,990
but it's also possible that they're just a factor of different parts of selection bias.

68
00:06:51,410 --> 00:07:00,950
Okay. So the best practices are you're trying to minimize the correlations between the data you're collecting and who is in your study,

69
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:05,029
which is minimizing sampling or selection bias, and how you conduct the study,

70
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:09,710
which is minimizing measurement bias because of course, if you ask, you will get an answer.

71
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,280
That was the first the first video you summarized.

72
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,320
The second video was on schedules versus scale. This is going to be very apparent.

73
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,340
You're going to use a bunch of scales today. You're not going to have any schedules today.

74
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,840
They're much too complex, which if you watched the video on schedules versus scales, you can appreciate this.

75
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:37,420
Most of the data I'm going to show you. So in class from the big studies is coming from schedules that is that are that are

76
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:40,780
much more comprehensive than the kind of symptoms scales that we're going to do today.

77
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:47,490
The purpose of a schedule is to operationalize those DSM criteria into distinct forms of mental disorders.

78
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,330
That is, we are trying to distinguish between whether you are a case or a non case.

79
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,360
That status is determined by an algorithm.

80
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:05,130
That is if three of these of this type and two weeks and this much impairment and not due to a medical condition, then depression, for example.

81
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:10,290
And so the metaphor here to think about it is that the way or the other thing that's important is that

82
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:16,440
the way that you measure something in and of itself is a reflection of what you think that thing is.

83
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:21,240
So when did you use a schedule to measure mental disorder?

84
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:29,880
You a way to think about it? You work that you are by definition because this is the purpose of these tools.

85
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:35,580
You are imagining mental disorders as discrete things that people have.

86
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:42,270
Okay, so the metaphor here would be the mental disorder is like a car accident and it happens or it doesn't happen.

87
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:49,410
It is a discrete event. It's impairing. And those and there's variation in intensity that impact functioning.

88
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:55,800
All right. So that's the idea that all car accidents are serious. Right. But like all car accidents are different than not having a car accident.

89
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,770
Okay. You can compare that to a scale.

90
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,550
A scale is a mean of quantifying various dimensions.

91
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:10,330
And those dimensions are usually and you can but we can reflect on this today during our exercise are usually only symptoms,

92
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,370
but usually don't ask people about how much functioning they're having,

93
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,969
usually are functional impairment they're having or how long it's been going on or when did it start.

94
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,420
And those are all things that you learn about in a schedule. Okay.

95
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:29,830
So that the notion here is that I'm trying to measure where a person is on some continuum or gradient,

96
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,940
that everyone has some level of mental distress.

97
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,150
And I want to know, are you at the higher level of that or the lower level of that?

98
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,020
Your position on that gradient, not case status.

99
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,120
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

100
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:49,510
Trying to figure out where are you on this gradient is determined by summing up all your responses and all items are treated interchangeably.

101
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,939
So it doesn't matter which title of the 20 items you say yes to.

102
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,149
As long as you say yes to ten, you're here. You're in the 75th percentile.

103
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:02,610
But it could be ten totally different ones than somebody else. Okay, that's not what happens in the schedule.

104
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:09,960
A schedule means that you have a much more homogeneous set of people that you've identified as a case versus here.

105
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:12,180
There's lots of ways that you can sort of be an 11.

106
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:18,060
For example, an example and you're going to use this today is the Center for Epidemiologic Studies, Depression, scale.

107
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:25,620
And the metaphor here again, because the tool that you're using is reflective of what you think this thing is that you're trying to measure,

108
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,770
is that mental disorders are like the diagnosis of hypertension.

109
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:34,500
At some point we have to like set some threshold by which like that's a blood pressure that's a little too hot.

110
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,980
I want to do something about that. And by that I mean I want to give you an ACE inhibitor. Okay?

111
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:45,300
But fundamentally, the construct that we're talking about is like in this case, blood pressure is continuous and everyone has it.

112
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,750
A blood sugar and that would be another example or BMI or be another example.

113
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,320
Okay.

114
00:10:52,010 --> 00:11:00,440
So and the reason I'm saying this is because even though the purpose of scales is not to find cases, it is to find where you are on this gradient.

115
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:08,450
These are routinely used to to establish a threshold and then say anybody above a ten is a case,

116
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:14,960
even though that was not their intent and it's not what they're supposed to be used for because they're routinely used for that.

117
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:24,470
And so you have to understand it like that key status is identified in the same way that 140 over 90 is hypertension.

118
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:29,570
139 over 89 is not hypertension. Okay.

119
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,200
And I don't really think those are two different numbers personally.

120
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,720
But that's very different than what a schedule will do. You're not here and have a much greater separation and an escape.

121
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:45,140
All right. Questions about those two sons on a Simpsons, Patrick.

122
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,770
So what are the types of questions that they ask for schedules?

123
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:57,500
Because I guess, like in my head, they will be asking questions about whether or not people have symptoms.

124
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:01,120
So you do ask those questions at the beginning for sure.

125
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:07,550
So but then once you sort of know that this person has sufficient symptoms, the next thing you're going to ask.

126
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,150
All right. So, first of all, so it's what did the symptoms happen?

127
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,400
But the second is what caused that symptom to happen.

128
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,909
So the example in the video is panic. Right.

129
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:22,760
So have you ever had a period where you felt very frightened or afraid in situations where most people would not

130
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,410
be frightened or afraid when you were not in danger or the center of attention or doing anything like that?

131
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,940
You say yes to that. And I want to know, what did you tell a doctor about that?

132
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:37,640
You try to you literally go through that flow chart for every single symptom to figure out what was happening.

133
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,840
Is this a panic attack? Right. Because there's lots of reasons. Yeah.

134
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:45,949
At the time I was like detoxing from methamphetamine.

135
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:49,790
Right. That could also create that situation. But that's not what I'm talking about necessarily.

136
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:55,830
And then once you sort of know that the symptoms are legitimately related,

137
00:12:55,880 --> 00:13:00,650
related to some sort of psychopathology, you want to know how intense are they?

138
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:04,760
How much functioning have they? Do they impair? How long have they been lasting?

139
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:10,970
So all of those other elements you're going to get. So it's literally operationalizing all of the DSM criteria.

140
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:13,850
It's also doing it for every disorder.

141
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:22,730
So the skills that we're going to use today are like general anxiety, general depressive symptoms, like, you know, general alcohol problems.

142
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,290
But the DSM, if you were to use a schedule and operationalize that, you would it would be just much more comprehensive.

143
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,610
And you wouldn't just say so. You would know things like when did it start?

144
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,030
How long is it going? How much can you?

145
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,290
You would still have the symptoms for that. It's symptoms plus. And then the other important element is this algorithm, this diagnostic algorithm.

146
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:50,330
So it's not just you have seven symptoms of panic disorder, it's that you had a discrete period of panic.

147
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:55,040
It was accompanied by these physiologic symptoms and you are worried about it re-occurring.

148
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,690
So panic disorder is not just having a panic attack, which is like one third of Americans have had a panic attack.

149
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,419
Panic disorder is only about 5% of Americans. Why?

150
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:08,780
Because while panic attacks are common, worrying about having a panic attack and having recurrent panic attacks is much more rare.

151
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,249
So the only reason,

152
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:16,940
the only reason you can get that level of like this is a group of people that I really want to focus on for treatment and intervention is by

153
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:24,770
adding these additional questions around impairment that are simply like not assessed indicates because they're just focus on the symptoms.

154
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:36,400
Other questions. All right.

155
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:40,810
So I'm going to switch gears a little bit, although maybe this is related to this last question,

156
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:46,160
and we're going to talk about how we quantify symptoms, because you're going to do that in an exercise in a few minutes.

157
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:52,510
But I'm going to tell you about the idea that, like, just because someone is a case meets diagnostic criteria,

158
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,010
however we're going to talk about that does not mean that they need treatment.

159
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:03,790
Why? And that's we're going to answer today. So and you going to do this role play activity where you're going to interview

160
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,719
each other and be interviewed by each other that are used to quantify symptoms.

161
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,340
But again, just because somebody meets diagnostic criteria or like has high levels of symptoms or whatever,

162
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:18,670
why does it not mean that they would warrant intervention? Well, one, because diagnosis is not synonymous with disability.

163
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:23,200
Those are not the same word. And then second, last time we talked about diagnosis is not the same,

164
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,610
is not equal as or any stands for, does not equal disorder, does not equal disease.

165
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:33,040
Okay. So all of those there's there is a there's this is not a concentric circles here.

166
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,760
This is a Venn diagram situation. Why do I say that?

167
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:48,370
So this is on the the three groups here are did you experience this type of impairment as a result of so

168
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:55,750
everything that everyone represented on this graph meets diagnostic criteria for something in the DSM?

169
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,890
Everyone every single one.

170
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:07,770
But you can see that there are four people who have mild impairment that, you know, very few of them have ever been hospitalized for it.

171
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:08,020
Right.

172
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:15,210
So even though every single one of these people needs diagnostic criteria, it is not the case that every single one of them has been hospitalized,

173
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:20,340
has experienced disability or impairment in functioning at work, or has attempted suicide.

174
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:26,729
So that's the first thing. The second thing, and I'll show you this in a second, is that most of those cases,

175
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:31,770
most of the people who meet diagnostic criteria are one of these three bars.

176
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:38,190
They are their mild or moderate cases. So they're not the severe cases.

177
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:42,270
And so, again, I'm not saying that people wouldn't benefit from some sort of intervention here,

178
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:48,290
but it is it is not the case that there's not heterogeneity within cases.

179
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,230
And so here this is showing you how common this is, just to illustrate what I just said.

180
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:58,379
So. Okay. Well, given that everything and everyone in this graph also needs diagnostic criteria,

181
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:05,610
and what I'm afraid those people on is how much impairment they've experienced as a result of that.

182
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:09,180
Whatever thing is going on with that, this is all all things in the DSM.

183
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,740
And again, the majority of people are moderate or mild.

184
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:21,180
So, again, it's. But the things that you would offer here to somebody are not the same as what you would offer here.

185
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,050
Somebody who's not able to work or is, you know, is not able to take care of themselves or live independently.

186
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:36,110
Right. I mean, there is great there's massive rotation within a month or among people who meet diagnostic criteria.

187
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,610
So you might say, well, why should we even have mild cases?

188
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,350
Right. Should we move the threshold? So like now depression is just like these most severe cases.

189
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:55,159
And the the reason that we don't want to do that is that like they're one that

190
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:58,170
like it's possible that you're mild now and two years from now you're severe.

191
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,190
Right. So it's not like this is a static, this is a snapshot in time.

192
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:09,889
But, you know, second, it's it's important to understand that these mild are just these milder cases, milder, again,

193
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:16,880
in terms only in terms of functional impairment, because they have a huge impact on treatment utilization because they are so, so common.

194
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:27,020
The other thing that's interesting when we think about when we sort of step away from the idea that I

195
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,309
don't just because you mean diagnostic criteria does not equal that you need treatment and whatever.

196
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,440
I mean by treatment, which we're going to talk about in a second,

197
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:43,550
is that I don't I don't actually necessarily even need to know if you meet case definite criteria that maybe it doesn't even matter.

198
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:49,849
Maybe all I need to know is how impaired are you? And like your case status is irrelevant, you know, I mean,

199
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,750
it's not irrelevant as far as your insurance company is concerned, which is why we have it still.

200
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:05,750
But if really all I'm trying to focus on is getting people care, then it really doesn't matter what the DSM like, what criteria, if any, they meet.

201
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:18,590
Right. So and that is what's interesting here is that this is very akin to the second generation of psychiatric epidemiology,

202
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:24,200
which was really there were no there was no focus on like is this depression or anxiety or substance use problems,

203
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:29,630
rather, just like mental health risk in general. And so that that was in the Midtown Manhattan study.

204
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:34,879
That was the study that, remember, reported that like 50% of New Yorkers had some high level of mental mental distress,

205
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,580
which, again, when you add everything up, that number is pretty darn close.

206
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:47,050
So the the point is, is that it's again, it is important to understand that meeting criteria is not in enough.

207
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:55,060
It does not by itself tell us that someone who needs treatment or would even benefit from treatment.

208
00:19:55,070 --> 00:20:05,240
I guess that's another way to think about it. And again, except illustrating this, the need to separate diagnosis from impairment and assess both.

209
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:15,590
So. Now. Okay so now identified source talked about how cases are not the same as treatment need.

210
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:21,080
But what am I actually saying when I say somebody needs treatment?

211
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,110
Very same when somebody needs treatment for anything.

212
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:40,420
You might think about it as if your impairment from her case causes serious problems in their life.

213
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:45,120
Like we can't really do like day to day functions. So they're having they're experiencing impairments.

214
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:49,570
And so there's there's something they're not able to access because of their condition.

215
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,520
And no treatment would actually help them get better and function.

216
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,590
So treatment would be beneficial. Right.

217
00:20:56,590 --> 00:21:04,210
So there's a there's a status quo is harmful that would be beneficial for savers and those beneficial and the harms don't outweigh that benefit.

218
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:11,770
Right. Right. So, so remember, there is no free lunch when it comes to medical intervention.

219
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,310
Even aspirin has side effects, right?

220
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:21,910
Cause a stomach bleeding, if you take it often. Even things that you can just buy at Walgreens have side effects.

221
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,440
There is no free lunch. Every intervention has a risk of.

222
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:33,820
But we have to consider the risk benefit ratio. So the challenge for our field is that for many mental disorders,

223
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,110
the treatment or intervention strategies are much more varied for medical disorders, right?

224
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,080
So if you if you have hypertension back to this example from earlier,

225
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:46,690
there are there's almost no disagreement as to like what the first line treatment for hypertension should.

226
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:52,380
Those medications are pretty effective for most people. That's not true.

227
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:58,830
For what? The things we're gonna talk about in this way. Antidepressants have an efficacy of about 50 to 60% for rate.

228
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:05,160
First time you treat. Okay. Efficacy goes down to about 30% when you get to a second line.

229
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:09,630
All right. So like, it is a diminishing returns if the first thing out of the gate doesn't work.

230
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:17,520
There's also non-medical interventions, right? There's and there's probably thousands of types of therapy.

231
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,349
Right. And there's probably hundreds of types of antidepressants and other types of meds.

232
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:27,810
Right. And that's just for one condition of depression. Let's talk about, like all the other things that could be going on.

233
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:33,000
Okay. So when we say somebody needs treatment and again, for example, of depression,

234
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,840
that that statement actually means nothing unless we can be very specific about the content of the treatment,

235
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:45,600
the intensity of the treatment, the duration of the treatment, the setting of the treatment.

236
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,020
And as we're going to talk about later in this class, the cost of the treatment.

237
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,980
Okay. When all of those elements come into play, when I say somebody needs treatment again,

238
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:00,810
what to say someone needs treatment means that those benefits are going to outweigh the risks of treatment plus the harms of not treating.

239
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,150
That is that is the equation I'm trying to solve and.

240
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:10,440
So, you know, we also need to think about prevention.

241
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:16,200
Right. So most of the interventions that we're going to talk about in this class that

242
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,660
relate to prevention have nothing to do with specific forms of psychopathology.

243
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,530
So we're going to talk about the good behavior game when we talk about substance abuse,

244
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:28,710
which is an intervention that's delivered to first and second graders.

245
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:33,090
It is an intervention to teach that helps teachers manage the classroom.

246
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,000
That is the intervention we're going to play in this class.

247
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,040
And that intervention we have shown through multiple clinical trials, randomized controlled trials,

248
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:48,090
where teachers were randomized to the intervention, where students were randomized to the classroom experience, drug use.

249
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:52,410
15 to 20 years later, you're like, How could that be?

250
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:57,630
Like, That's what science tells me, that there's a remote controlled trial. There's also been some interesting work on it.

251
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,890
And the point is, like when we think about prevention, we have to think about essentially again,

252
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,780
we throw out cases because I'm not actually trying to prevent a case.

253
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,860
I'm trying to move somebody from a risky trajectory to a less risky trajectory.

254
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:18,900
And that risk is is fine because it's not like the lines in the sand between depression and anxiety or depression and not

255
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:27,630
depression are true in the sense of I know this is why I started off talking about this issue validity and reliability.

256
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:35,940
But the line in the sand there is not true in the sense of I know that everyone who doesn't have depression has good mental health.

257
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,330
Right. That's not what I'm saying. I'm just saying they don't have depression. Okay.

258
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,720
So when I think about prevention, I'm not trying to prevent depression.

259
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,350
I'm trying to lower mental health risk. Right. That's the way to think about it.

260
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:52,740
So again, telling us that we should not be focused on case definitions when we think about prevention or potentially even a treatment.

261
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:57,809
So how do people even measure treatment? So there's two main ways.

262
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:01,290
So we either ask people during the past year or in this case,

263
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,819
was there ever a time when you needed mental health treatment or counseling for yourself but you couldn't get it?

264
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,160
And if you say yes to this question, so you had unmet need.

265
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:16,260
But there's also the notion, of course, this answer, this first question requires people to sort of like be able to like self reflect and say,

266
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,090
like, I, you know, I guess in my mind I would have benefited more than I would have lost by doing that treatment.

267
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:32,700
There's also inferred unmet need, which is I look at people who tell me that their condition has affected their life a lot, but for whom they.

268
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:41,060
Yes, I've used. Yes, we've used that. They've they've had a lot of impairments and we assume.

269
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:45,020
Are we making we infer that they therefore have unmet treatment that they would have benefited?

270
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:56,420
And either way, no matter which way we use, ask it, we can get you to buy the cases in this case of depression, into four types of people.

271
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:02,190
Okay. So there are people who the group that we hope everybody ends up with.

272
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,620
Yes. These are people who got treatment for their depression and they had no unmet treatment needs.

273
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,070
So that's 40% of people with depression in the United States.

274
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:20,240
They got treatment and they have no unmet need. We have this group that made a lot with that's walking around this way.

275
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:23,570
But then there's also this other group. So these are people who got treatment.

276
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:28,800
And they still are experiencing severe impairment or significant impairment, I should say.

277
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:35,940
So this is 22%. Yeah, I was going to ask that has something to do with the accuracy of the dose itself.

278
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:42,480
So it's the efficacy of the drugs. And it's also sort of like the system that you're living in where you can you can see a doctor,

279
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,210
but only for six times and then your insurance won't pay for it anymore. And actually you can't get a doctor with all these other things for sure.

280
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,169
So we don't actually know if this is like guideline conformity care, for example.

281
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:57,120
We just know like they saw somebody and they're still having impairment. So whatever, there's some gap between that.

282
00:26:57,780 --> 00:27:00,570
So that's that's one in five people with depression. Okay.

283
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,300
Now, there are people who did not get treatment and they don't they don't appear to need it.

284
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:10,380
They don't get benefit. Does not appear to be either. I'm sorry.

285
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:16,500
No treatment. And this is people who did not get treatment and they have unmet need.

286
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:23,400
So one in ten people with depression. Okay. So these are people who have not been able to get in the door of a mental health provider.

287
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,240
And then there's this group which has no treatment and no unmet need.

288
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:33,540
These are people who are not experiencing impairment for them or they're trying to handle on their own or whatever.

289
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:35,400
I'm going to show you some data on this.

290
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:41,760
But again, it illustrates that a case meeting, case criteria, everyone in this pie, in each case criteria for major depression.

291
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,370
Everyone in this fight. In this case criteria. But not everyone is experiencing unmet treatment need.

292
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,230
You might say like, why didn't people get treatment? Like, why did they?

293
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:57,990
You know, and the answer is they thought they could handle their problem without actually the first answer cost.

294
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:04,380
And talk about later in this class like most of this is not covered by insurance

295
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,980
or most of that many things that people want are not covered by insurance.

296
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,790
They thought they could handle the problem without help or they thought treatment wouldn't help.

297
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,800
So these are these are people who are not interested in talking to a mental health provider.

298
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:23,040
That's important to know. But that the majority of people it's around cost.

299
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,650
They don't have an insurance. They don't know where to go or.

300
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:30,209
We talked about this last week, the idea that others would find out they're afraid of being committed.

301
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:34,680
They're concerned about confidentiality. Okay. That's for depression.

302
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:44,010
This is for substance use. So, again, first first factor here is cost, which is especially when this data and this is 2015 data,

303
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:47,640
I mean, this is still true but not ready to stop using.

304
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:52,590
Right. So like the idea that like just because you meet criteria for substance use disorder does not ended up like that.

305
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:59,220
Like let's get you into a self-help group automatically. Like, again, that's not going to do any good if this person is not ready to stop using.

306
00:28:59,430 --> 00:29:04,310
Okay. I always like this one, which did not have the time to get treatment.

307
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,630
That's always my word. Okay. It's an interesting, interesting idea.

308
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:18,000
It's also important to understand that in all I've just shown you is these, like, giant bar graphs and pie charts that are,

309
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:24,690
you know, ignoring the other type of heterogeneity underneath the hood, which is around race and gender and socio economic status.

310
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:30,599
And there's a lot of work and some of you are interested in projects on this in terms of how those factors relate to unmet need.

311
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,040
I'm not really able to go over it today,

312
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:37,140
but I just want to again like encourage you to would just flag this for you that this is something that's important.

313
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:45,620
And the last thing I want to emphasize is that everything I've just told you so far is like especially this, right?

314
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:54,840
This, this person was not ready to stop using or this person didn't know where to go or this person was afraid or what have you.

315
00:29:55,140 --> 00:30:03,660
But the fact of the matter is unmet need is not simply about individuals trying to navigate the mental health care system.

316
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,190
But it is about the system, quote unquote, that they are trying to navigate.

317
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:15,660
And I'm going to walk you through a study that is of people with private health care insurance

318
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:20,520
and what it is like to try to get mental health care when you have private health care,

319
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:24,540
in this case, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which that's what I have this problem with many of you have or somebody your family has.

320
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,800
So if you're looking to get this, you have private insurance, which most of you probably do.

321
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,090
Let's talk through what that actually looks like in terms of and how it relates to unmet need.

322
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,310
So this is the name of the study. This was also both hyperlinked out in the slides today.

323
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:47,360
So this is a study where they the researchers became a simulated clients.

324
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:56,090
That is, they pretended that they were looking for mental health care and they called it what they downloaded, the Blue Cross Blue Shield website.

325
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,969
You can go there and it tells you like these are your providers that are approved that

326
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:03,300
take your insurance and this is who you should call if you have a mental health problem.

327
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:07,850
That's what they did. They pretended like they were a patient and they're like, okay, and they're going to call directly.

328
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:14,520
They did three big cities. They selected the first 220 psychiatrist that were listed in each of those cities.

329
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:22,320
And then they just randomly they said they decided they were going to either call and say, I'm trying to pay by myself, I'm going to self-pay.

330
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:27,329
I'm going to call and use Metro's Blue Shield I Blue Cross Blue Shield Insurance,

331
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,650
which BlueCross BlueShield tells me that you should take or I'm going to pretend I'm on Medicare.

332
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,700
Okay. But none of this is true, right? This is. They're simulating this.

333
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,600
Okay. Why do you think they're doing that? Why do you think they would say they're on Medicare?

334
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:45,510
Why would that be a reasonable. They're trying to get up there.

335
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:52,990
Yeah. So trying to see if there's a disparity in treatment with the cost of insurance versus.

336
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,910
Yes. So Medicare is famously as famously low reimbursement rates.

337
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,510
Medicaid does, too. But Medicaid is also needs based.

338
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,530
Right. So Medicare is everybody over age 65 gets it. So you're not going to get conflict.

339
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,850
Your clients call and say, I have Medicare. That doesn't mean automatically that I have low income.

340
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:15,730
But if you call and say I have Medicaid, it does. Okay. So but you're right, the reimbursement rate is going to be super low.

341
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:20,710
Okay. So this simulated client has depressive symptoms and they make calls during normal business hours.

342
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,790
So the data that they're collecting is they want to know, was the call answered?

343
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,380
Were they able to get to the point? How soon were they able to get in for that appointment?

344
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,550
If they couldn't get an appointment, why were they why were they denied that appointment?

345
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:39,670
And if the call was returned and then they re made those calls two weeks later if a voicemail was not returned.

346
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:44,170
Okay. So they are so you can imagine this is a pretty reasonable thing that somebody would do if they were trying to get here.

347
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:49,150
What happened? Okay. So the y axis here is the number of calls that they're making.

348
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:52,690
And this is after two rounds of calling. So they have 360 psychiatrists.

349
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:58,000
They're trying to get a hold. They can talk to a psychiatrist in one third of those times.

350
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:08,930
Like so 33% of the time they got to talk to a psychiatrist.

351
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:18,879
What else would happen the other two thirds of the time? Well, you know, about 20% of the time it was a wrong number in the paper.

352
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:24,880
They detail how sometimes there was one case where this was a second time, where this I mean,

353
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,390
like literally like usually it's like disconnected, but it's not necessarily disconnected.

354
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:32,950
It's like a pizza place, which is if you're again, if you are somebody trying to get care for your depression,

355
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:43,180
if you imagine because the person's not accepting new patients that's here, they need more information.

356
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:50,800
Where is it? Oh does not accept payment type. This is hilarious because every single one of these people should be accessing BlueCross BlueShield.

357
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,310
Right. So so that.

358
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,950
So you're saying like, well, where does that unmet need come from?

359
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:02,710
Well, part of it is because two thirds of the time you can't get a call even if you have private insurance.

360
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,580
Okay. Oh, yeah. This is just showing you.

361
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:11,240
Oh, sorry, people that they wouldn't care. Sorry, but they did accept. We probably should.

362
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:15,700
I remember this wrong. They did accept BlueCross BlueShield, but they didn't accept Medicare.

363
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:22,730
Okay. So here you've got again that when people this is also the challenge where people say Medicare for all.

364
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:27,050
Okay. Well, if Medicare for All means this, that this is not so good when it comes to mental health.

365
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:32,810
You can see every single one of them was willing to accept your check, but nobody said so.

366
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:40,670
Which again is like, well, who gets into treatment? People can afford to pay $250 an hour for it to see a psychiatrist or psychologist.

367
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,759
Okay. So they were. So that was just the call. Were they actually able to make an appointment?

368
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:50,240
So only 93 people, were they actually able to schedule an appointment?

369
00:34:50,990 --> 00:34:51,390
So I sure do.

370
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:57,890
They got on the phone with the psychiatrist office one third of the time, but only 93 times were they actually able to get an appointment.

371
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:07,370
So here, as I told you this already a college freshman. So so again, that's a so you might say like, well,

372
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:13,370
that's a a study of people who are pretending they're trying to get access to specialty mental health care.

373
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,120
But that's not how most people get access to especially mental health care in the United States.

374
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:21,950
How do people get access to it? If you need to see a psychiatrist, how would you get it?

375
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:29,390
Your doctor would send you a referral. Okay, well, maybe it's easier for your doctors to get an appointment with a psychiatrist for you.

376
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,500
Well, fortunately, somebody looked into this computer program.

377
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:40,930
So now this is a survey of primary care providers, people who are in practice.

378
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:44,480
The response rate is low. So we should keep everything. I'm going to show you with a grain of salt.

379
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:50,230
But the the core question is, during the past 12 months, were you unable to obtain any of the following services?

380
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,160
So it's not just a study of mental health care, it's about any referral care and we're medically necessary.

381
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:04,400
So the doctor has decided it is medically necessary for you to see a primary or a mental health specialist and what is the outcome?

382
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:14,930
So for if you are unable to get into high quality mental health services, 25% of.

383
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:23,390
I'm sorry. Yes, we're able. So 75% of the time, we're not able to get a patient, even though the provider is making a referral,

384
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:30,880
we're not able to get somebody into high quality mental health, outpatient mental health, which is where most of that is going to be occurring.

385
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:34,580
So this is not an inpatient setting, right. This is talking to a psychiatrist or psychologist.

386
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,690
You can compare that to something like, you know, getting you an MRI, which is still shocking that this is 2%.

387
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:47,749
Okay. Right. But the fact is, it's not that these are just like lousy doctors who can't get anybody to do anything for their patients.

388
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:51,500
But rather, you can see that it's really the mental health services that are the problem.

389
00:36:54,380 --> 00:37:02,540
Be the reason that they said they were not able to get that they felt that they were not able to get these needed services for their patients.

390
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:07,420
Is lack of coverage, lack of insurance coverage specifically.

391
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:15,380
And this is all around outpatient mental health care. So again, when you think about why, what are the drivers of unmet need,

392
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:21,440
some of that unmet need is being driven by individual preferences or like not being able, not knowing where to go, etc.

393
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:27,470
But a lot of this is being driven by the system that people are trying to navigate and even their doctors are trying to navigate.

394
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:35,690
All right. So just to summarize, again, there's a I should say there's a lack of consensus.

395
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:40,580
There's multiple reasons why mental health services are underutilized. There's some I'm sorry.

396
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,400
I should also say pause. You're like underutilized, right?

397
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:50,660
Well, yes, in the sense that most people with mental health disorder don't get timely treatment for their depression.

398
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:56,850
But no, on the sense of. Psychiatrists are booked out six months from now.

399
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:05,760
Right. There is a massive shortage of the behavioral health workforce. So if people actually if we actually close the treatment gap,

400
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,160
the treatment means that we would need a workforce that's like ten times larger than what we have now,

401
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,740
not like double, which is the kind of stuff that like Biden is talking about.

402
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,740
He's like, we need to like double the number now. We need like an order of magnitude more for that.

403
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:24,150
Right. So again, some of this is individual characteristics.

404
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:28,170
We talk a lot about self stigma already. There is I get this question.

405
00:38:28,170 --> 00:38:29,459
Our personal coverage has been a lot of it,

406
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:34,620
which I would me when I say when I give you comments like what does it mean to take a public health perspective?

407
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,760
Part of what it means to take a public health perspective is understanding people within a context.

408
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,350
In this case, the health systems context, where we have inadequate health care coverage,

409
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:47,430
we have a fragmented services model, and there is massive underfunding of community services.

410
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:57,690
So another take home I want you to take from today is that the diagnosis or the thresholds or whatever the symptom counts

411
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:03,510
that you're going to get from an epidemiological surveys in and of themselves are not sufficient measures of treatment need.

412
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:11,370
But the reality of it is, is that usually because this is the only thing that's included in, for example,

413
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:15,929
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey or the National Health Interview and examination.

414
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:21,089
Like oftentimes those are the only data that we have. We're going to use data called a National Survey on Drug Use and health,

415
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:25,680
which does have a lot of the measures that we're going to talk about in this class where to use that for an exercise.

416
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,000
But the point is, is that oftentimes policymakers only have symptom counts, like this is how many people had depressive symptoms.

417
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:43,260
But that that in and of itself is not informative as to what treatments, what services should be offered, when to and how people want to access them.

418
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:52,379
So again, we use impairment and severity as a way to understand the heterogeneity within the case definition.

419
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:59,340
That is who, what, when, when is intervention justified and what type of intervention should that be?

420
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,060
What should be the content of it? How intense should it be? Where? How long should it last?

421
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:09,310
Where should that intervention happen? And I should also say,

422
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:15,670
even when all of these other elements are taken into account and even when we're looking within like a functioning health care system,

423
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:21,309
for example, I can look within Kaiser Permanente or you look within the Veterans Health Administration,

424
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:27,670
which you don't have issues of, you know, all the medical records, you know, the EMR is don't,

425
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:32,790
you know, don't communicate with each other or, you know, you don't take my insurance that you want.

426
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,250
All of that is taken into account. You still have unmet need.

427
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:43,960
So I'm going to pause here for questions and then we're going to break into your activity the rest of the time.

428
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,820
All right. I don't have a good slide for you today. So we use these are my questions.

429
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:11,410
Okay. So today I need you to get with a buddy or two.

430
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:18,340
You can get with a few people, but you are going to do on your canvass site trading places, activity.

431
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:30,640
If you don't need more than one computer for this. So hopefully you should get with somebody if you don't have to.

432
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:40,720
So this activity is down. I'm on. If you look here, I'm on. We know that you've been able to see my slides.

433
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,190
Just always make sure.

434
00:41:49,350 --> 00:42:15,330
Here. Uh huh.

435
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,070
Somebody that knows what he's looking for, going all the way over.

436
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:25,680
I'll lose it. Okay, so I'm down. I'm in week two or three, and I'm down here.

437
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:31,210
What's your activity? It's trading places. Okay, so in your.

438
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,590
So this has got the instructions for this, and there's something here to turn in after class based on this.

439
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:40,439
Okay, so it's important that you spend time in class working on this, you and your partner.

440
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:45,300
I need you to pick one of these three things you want to interview and interview each other.

441
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,160
So one time you'll be the interviewer,

442
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,770
and you'll choose one of these measures that you're going to use to interview the other person and the other time you will be the respondent.

443
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:58,620
So now I'll use to shorter depressive syndrome and anxiety the.

444
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,240
I mean, so I was in stage four in high school.

445
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:09,649
So I don't know what it's like to be in front of the stage, but I encourage but I certainly can see I'm a bit of an extrovert, so I encourage you.

446
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:13,760
I'm not asking you to report on your personal experiences with any of these symptoms.

447
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:18,769
You should feel free to affect some other, you know, like something called a role play.

448
00:43:18,770 --> 00:43:22,999
So whatever whoever you want to be for this, right, that's who you should be.

449
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,690
And just kind of answer, yeah, you're not.

450
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:34,580
Nobody's recording your answers. The thing you're going to be reporting on afterwards is your reflections on what it was like.

451
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:40,760
I'm trying to get this over here, what it was like to, you know,

452
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:46,099
the strengths and limitations of the different instruments that you used because

453
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,620
you're to use two different instruments to measure the exact same thing,

454
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:55,429
and then you're going to reflect on which one you would choose to if you had to design a study.

455
00:43:55,430 --> 00:44:04,969
And why would you choose that? Like what about it seemed easy to understand for you, etc. We are going to be closed.

456
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:09,690
We're going to come back and I will ask you. I don't know what I did.

457
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:15,540
This is now. I will be spending your time figuring out how to fix the scale or the screen.

458
00:44:15,930 --> 00:44:24,960
So it's a common empathy map. And so what we're going to do is we're going to talk through this from the perspective of the interviewer.

459
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:29,220
So what as when you were the interviewer, what did you think and feel?

460
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:34,560
What did you hear? What did you say and do? What did you see? What were areas that were really difficult for you?

461
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:39,330
What were areas that were not positive for you? And then you're going to do the same thing when you're the respondent.

462
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:49,770
So just kind of take notes when you're the when you are the both the respondent and the interviewer from this perspective.

463
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:56,909
Now we're going to report out as a group and then you'll be here. So we will regroup at 1240.

464
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:04,260
So we have 20 minutes to do this. Question I'm sorry here.

465
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:08,280
So I'm trying to fix it. Sounds like something I did with the partner.

466
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,350
So, yeah, we have an.
