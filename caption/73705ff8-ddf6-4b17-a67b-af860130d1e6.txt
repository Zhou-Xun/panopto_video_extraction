1
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:28,170
Is it cold here? Because I see so many of you have colder on.

2
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,060
My wife and I, we always fight over the thermostat.

3
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:41,730
I want a few degrees lower shelves, one to keep it up.

4
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:52,780
So I figure, you know, there are some real individual differences in terms of tolerance of the temperature.

5
00:00:53,590 --> 00:01:03,620
Should we begin? Today we're going to do the first of our journal class.

6
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:09,290
Okay. And are you ready to talk about all three articles today?

7
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,010
Great. I hope you find this article interesting so we can do that.

8
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:21,110
Okay. And on the Web page, I have.

9
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:32,780
List. I have listed the instructions for the Journal Club and I presume all of you have a chance to take a look at it.

10
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:50,210
Basically. Okay. All of you have to sign up for given articles for which you are comfortable with discussing it in depth.

11
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,890
Then. Okay. So what I will do is I'm going to have.

12
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,030
You show your hands with regard to each one of these articles.

13
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:14,690
Now I can divide you into smaller groups. Then we will travel over approximately 20 minutes for you to talk about these articles.

14
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:20,330
And I do have some suggested questions.

15
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:28,520
Okay. Which is also in the list on the website, at website.

16
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,020
So these are just suggested questions.

17
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:40,580
And you should also feel free to, you know, if you have some burning questions you want to talk about.

18
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:53,630
And so then we have that flexible. And after you have a chance to caucus on these articles, then we will come back.

19
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,830
And we have allocated roughly approximately 15 minutes per article.

20
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:09,260
Let's talk about something for 15 minutes. We can probably hit maybe two or three questions.

21
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:17,720
Okay. So that's how the Journal Club will be conducted.

22
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:21,470
Any questions? No.

23
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:37,180
All right. I mean, for those of you who have selected the article written by Ikeda Saito consult.

24
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:46,430
Please show your hands. One, two, three, four, five.

25
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,330
Okay, five of you will be one. Okay.

26
00:03:51,080 --> 00:04:03,610
All right. How many? For those of you to select the article by Fisher to Boehner, Coronavirus Deepens Inequality.

27
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:13,520
You show your hands and Instagram. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, seven.

28
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:20,600
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, four.

29
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:24,790
One, three, three, four, three, one. Okay.

30
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,960
The remaining three would be enough.

31
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:38,180
I wanted to keep the group to about four or five because if I have too many people, you won't have a chance to talk.

32
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:49,040
The last article on mental health conditions and subsidies and the substance use.

33
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,000
I think it's an international comparison.

34
00:04:53,030 --> 00:05:01,430
How many of you have sort of like disorders? One, two, three, four, five, six.

35
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:08,270
Only six, right? Okay. Say a people. One, two, three of be one group.

36
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,780
The remaining three will be another group. Okay.

37
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,470
All right, that's a start. Do you remember?

38
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:33,860
And. Yes. Christie is thinking for a second.

39
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:38,120
Thanks for joining us. Okay. You get a check? Yeah.

40
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:48,290
Just joining us, I'm hearing that it's a 20.

41
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,329
And you had a chance to check out the website. I know.

42
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:56,690
I did my damage control. Okay.

43
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:01,810
Just doing anything. And then we give you a copy of you guys songs.

44
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:19,570
Things. Things. Not sure. Sure. I think that.

45
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,490
I'm sure you're doing it.

46
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:40,149
We're not sure you understand.

47
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:46,310
This is why people are so.

48
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:58,570
We are what we are.

49
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:04,830
What are they saying here?

50
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:37,750
That's just what the indicators are on the suggested the standards have been worked out and those are your thoughts on this things on demand.

51
00:07:41,700 --> 00:08:03,870
I was just I was gonna start running down I sat down and I'm telling you, I was one of those people who was talking about.

52
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:42,820
It's the. This is not how the children described this whole ordeal.

53
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:49,470
They are. But looking at the indicators.

54
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:05,440
Because most of the indicators are identical.

55
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:22,310
So I would just say the highlight of my scrolling is 1.0.

56
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:29,929
So I did this and I just thought, oh, no, it doesn't.

57
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:37,730
It just it just retreats. And as one tries to just remember that, yeah, I mean,

58
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:58,970
what we what about to say and I'm just kind of reintroduced just because it seemed like a suicide rate is one high death rate, those kinds of things.

59
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:17,120
And I think those are what you consider leaders when you say something so much, you know.

60
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:48,290
For the last ten years, just in the last year, 2002 shootings.

61
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,190
And I think it's the statistics that we're looking at across countries that

62
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:06,460
are considers some kind of a massacre highlighted in a lot of their school,

63
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:10,340
which is how many of them from diagnosis.

64
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,000
There were also U.S. troops in Iraq.

65
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:34,790
So the first woman to see how it's going to diagnose, you know, the middle class families,

66
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:47,330
the first group that was actually which a group is the Japanese group or which group is talking about the Japanese.

67
00:11:48,320 --> 00:12:07,970
Okay. And you can, you know, one quarter U.S. adults report a diagnosis over the past year or so.

68
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:26,810
That was interesting in Sweden so that they are like the best in the world in integrating into primary care should now be great.

69
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:37,150
I mean, I think I mean, I would say that I think for the organization right now.

70
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:42,200
Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? Sure.

71
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,850
So every day. Every day we meet with one invitation to return?

72
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,560
That's correct. Okay. 100% for the special session.

73
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:57,140
So to achieve. That's right. All right.

74
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:04,250
And then there was a sample of what the intention of the United States it was like.

75
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:07,850
Occupied territories is basically just a paragraph out of that story.

76
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,530
So that's going to be the performance of the current plans for term somewhere else.

77
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:24,020
So just all of that type of stuff and then turn my back.

78
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:38,530
Well, I don't know what you're talking about.

79
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:42,700
Right. So it's your turn.

80
00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:02,360
Yes, I was. Okay. I work for.

81
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:22,550
I think that's I think there's a quality are that there is.

82
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:46,910
Was. That person hold up there and say, yeah, I was there something and it wasn't as if I had a warning shot.

83
00:14:47,640 --> 00:15:08,180
I mean, she. Now you are snapping photos or.

84
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:38,910
Yeah. And I was just like, you know where you were?

85
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:53,260
I. Your first report is in the filing, and I think so.

86
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:04,370
So then self-reported distress, emotional distress or no financial crisis?

87
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:11,590
No. It was an important issue, as I.

88
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:26,080
So you say. That's.

89
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,940
We're going to do that.

90
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:51,060
Yeah. The third one is pretty much the one where you are.

91
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:55,270
So dogs were among the most likely to see the problem.

92
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:59,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

93
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:19,030
Part of this question also is almost like a discussion, essentially like 2007.

94
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:28,470
It is, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Part of the problem is we need to mention a couple other countries.

95
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,100
I just want Canada, Sweden, all this saying.

96
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:39,030
Oh, yes. They want to know where we're at internationally.

97
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:50,870
Say as long as you can see where they are.

98
00:17:51,360 --> 00:18:03,690
So we are just we are trying to do that for the there.

99
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:28,230
He said that is the first step to one of the world's greatest.

100
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:35,650
Yes, I think so.

101
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:45,740
I think we should start off because that is probably the most significant.

102
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:52,970
Third one is the one after the other.

103
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:58,190
So it was this crazy idea to appoint a minister of suicide and a minister of loneliness.

104
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:05,480
I know it. So I am sure when I saw that, I was like, What do you want to do?

105
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:18,920
Find out how.

106
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:35,780
Know. Grand.

107
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:51,070
So the question that I. You just.

108
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,230
California. I.

109
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:13,210
And so we're. So.

110
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:25,530
Or I don't want to do the next one, which is so sorry.

111
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:51,100
Yeah. I'm worried about how it's going to pass this time around for you.

112
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:57,309
I think I'll start with France. Yeah, I just got to Switzerland.

113
00:20:57,310 --> 00:21:13,570
Where? Like, the way up I 1980. I got it from my country because that's where was the U.S. being nice in 2016.

114
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:23,090
And that's explained. Ladies and gentlemen, the way our offices are described in the U.S. is really well.

115
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:34,630
This is more of a recent phenomenon here. Yeah, we're not that far.

116
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:10,770
And it's hour and a half ago.

117
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:31,690
My. You have 3 minutes to go.

118
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:36,910
Do you need more time? Yes. Yes. Okay, let's give you an extra 5 minutes.

119
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:45,250
Yeah, I guess so.

120
00:22:46,510 --> 00:23:06,220
I'll start answering all of your Social Security requirements.

121
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:34,160
I. I don't know why.

122
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:57,230
So. Yes.

123
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:02,600
The footer is at the top of. I just decided to be.

124
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:33,810
I was 100 yards away.

125
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:12,750
Sorry. I career is over.

126
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:36,970
No. Others are exposed to the fact that.

127
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:55,760
Yeah. That's right.

128
00:25:56,610 --> 00:26:03,420
Yeah. So yeah.

129
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:23,210
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

130
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:29,560
Yeah. That's right.

131
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:38,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

132
00:26:53,590 --> 00:27:19,930
I think we know that we are.

133
00:27:29,330 --> 00:28:11,830
What? And that they said, Oh, yeah, that's cool.

134
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:34,190
Next. Yeah.

135
00:28:40,440 --> 00:29:00,400
Everyone was. So.

136
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:26,580
Sorry. But.

137
00:29:47,620 --> 00:30:04,330
Yeah. But.

138
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:18,130
Thank you. All right, that's good.

139
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:23,090
Together we can talk about this article. These are essays.

140
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:31,240
And let's start with the first one. Well, I don't know when disappear.

141
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:53,470
All right. Let's start with the Japanese army.

142
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:58,510
Okay. And this is the Golden Princess, right? Okay.

143
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:08,540
How would you like this article? For me, it was interesting.

144
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:13,780
I would just see these guys more.

145
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,370
I mean, they were just that. Yes.

146
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,510
But you had found those. Yes.

147
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:30,350
And reading is I think it's very useful when you to go and look at the hash tag.

148
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,710
And also, we have a nice little box.

149
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:49,170
What I see in response to that and those blogs that is is that is that this is a good way to go over research on academics.

150
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,730
You know, even this in all this.

151
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:04,760
So there's a recent article about sports at 12 minutes or so.

152
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:23,450
Okay. Why why do you think the Japanese population now, since you have come out with this and then there's such a competition now?

153
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:39,200
So the very strong focus on education and discussion at the board,

154
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:55,160
motivated by his ideas and priorities and scale and so across the water and all and part of the general audience.

155
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:04,760
I just want to make sure because the acoustic is not so good piece and then also terms of how

156
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:26,330
they are we but more than 180 years of work for the next seven years for universal health care.

157
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:46,570
So much of that action illustrates so many concepts we have no right to point out and say, okay, so this is an interesting notion.

158
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:52,040
It was a logical transition. Yes.

159
00:33:52,150 --> 00:34:04,150
As they imagined that the first lockdown, especially going forward to address the policy feedback and everything's going to be more complicated.

160
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:20,620
So we actually were able to calculate and also do what we want to do is show exactly how to make more sense out of substantially less.

161
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:37,390
So remarkable is that after World War Two, their life expectancy, you can see life expectancy was 55 decades more than in older children,

162
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:42,140
not only in the United States, but all the other Western countries.

163
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:54,580
They were able to accomplish high expectancy at birth as well as healthy life expectancy.

164
00:34:55,330 --> 00:35:02,170
You know, they don't just live longer. They actually learn much.

165
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:09,070
They are able to be healthy for the longest time.

166
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:15,940
Right. So that's why you see that celebrities are recognizable.

167
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:36,890
And, you know, I guess how do you take them to the possible exactly like that?

168
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,470
But I think a lot of countries take a lot of experience.

169
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:56,120
Well, there's a lot of factors. Well, one reason I feel concerned is we have this difference from the United States.

170
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,300
And those are different from all the other Western countries.

171
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:11,870
You know, what we studied over the course of the study tells us to refocus on the U.S. or other Western countries.

172
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:24,770
We don't really get it. And this is such an interesting case, is that we came from everybody is very, very good on the region.

173
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:31,100
That is so if is a non-Western society.

174
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,510
Okay. But you would be wrong. You know what?

175
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,930
Yes. First of all, we start with this point, and this is a very interesting concept,

176
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:55,370
which is that we need to invest in social programs so that we do like education in their education for girls and women.

177
00:36:56,300 --> 00:37:03,200
And we have, you know, all these young men and women who have access to the wonderful education.

178
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:11,980
Then we have universal health coverage. So also good institutions of social development.

179
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:18,530
And they also continue to work on the right in terms of the control.

180
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:28,160
They also control what has the potential to become hypertension and stroke.

181
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:36,980
Hypertension. This. There is a major risk factor for heart disease.

182
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:46,160
And so we were able to do and it's also very interesting we need also try to control smoking.

183
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:57,070
I said, you know, I am Japanese and you're smoking much more than Americans are.

184
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:16,700
Yes. Because that is the outcome of the 7%, 3% to 5% now is when he's talking about much lower, somewhere around 10%.

185
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:32,240
So the young adults will be more educated, can actually get around the Japanese, even though they smoke so much more than Americans.

186
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:38,870
They have no resources and families of lung cancer and heart disease.

187
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:46,120
Okay. So they get into that one, three of you.

188
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:53,600
So what about obesity and overweight in Japan?

189
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,870
I believe it was my lifestyle.

190
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:09,540
Part of the reason you started your festival is the sedentary lifestyle.

191
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:16,350
Why? I think one of the very interesting parts is the lifestyle.

192
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:22,200
How do you feel at ease about now?

193
00:39:22,890 --> 00:39:34,230
Oh, okay. I mean, do you get a sense in mid 1975.

194
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:43,470
Let me help you. I look around. I don't see any people who are overweight or obese.

195
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:49,140
I don't see anything. Okay.

196
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:55,079
So that kind of abuse on the scale had an interest in this argument the that we talked

197
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:05,280
about around certain kind of principles and crimes that we have to join position.

198
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:14,970
Okay. So do you notice in Japanese it's really not just the kind of food.

199
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:21,760
But one portion proportion is so much smaller.

200
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:28,460
It probably is general store which sells Japanese stock.

201
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:35,170
This is bringing to light for almost any other reason.

202
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:46,240
Basically, the importance of one can only be used to some degree.

203
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:53,620
All right. So these are just a couple of years of progress on that.

204
00:40:54,700 --> 00:41:07,250
Okay. And also. You know, the very few people who are one of the few remaining opportunities for patients.

205
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:13,640
So it's not unusual for people to have to walk a more than 10,000 steps every day.

206
00:41:16,890 --> 00:41:23,780
And then and every time in Tokyo, I actually I had a son.

207
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,670
That's what it was like.

208
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,620
So this is kind of give you some sense about the lifestyle.

209
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:37,560
And clearly. And but this show is.

210
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,330
Was a huge problem and continue to be an issue.

211
00:41:42,790 --> 00:41:45,940
Some party is partially because of the diet.

212
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:53,890
Japanese diet tend to have high salt content, but they are doing much, much better.

213
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:59,410
Because when the country was poor, refrigeration was uncommon.

214
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:09,180
So preserving salt to preserve food is a very common practice that people can develop a kind of special taste.

215
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:21,280
So in Tokyo, I oftentimes will see shops which are specialists and all kind of preserved pickled vegetables,

216
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:26,230
radish, you know, and fermented soybean sauce.

217
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:30,600
Of course. Okay. So, yes.

218
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:36,370
So considering that high sodium was such an important part of their cultural food landscape,

219
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:41,170
how did they what kind of public health messaging did they use to get people to cut back on sodium?

220
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:43,420
Wow.

221
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:58,840
The Japanese actually are feeding the they invest quite a bit in public health in terms of, for example, vaccination mass, you know, health screening.

222
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:06,370
And they also do, you know, they do a pretty good job on health education.

223
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,890
One example, Japanese are very used to. Wearing a face mask.

224
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:17,130
And long before the cold. Okay.

225
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:31,890
And so, you know, once you are used to wearing face masks, you reduce the risk for flu and also help your seasonal allergies.

226
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:37,170
And the Japanese are very used to every time they return home,

227
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:45,530
the first thing they do is wash their hands and they take their shoes off when they get into the house.

228
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:54,030
So these are kind of tiny little things. I don't know how we can duplicate freely.

229
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:02,370
Also read the article. Emphasize the collective ness of the Japanese society.

230
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:12,120
Okay. And that smell will be developed in the U.S., an individual less individualistic.

231
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:25,049
But in Eastern society, where you are correct in the sense that we really focus not just on individuals,

232
00:44:25,050 --> 00:44:32,460
the focus on families, our kids and so forth, and the Nordic countries.

233
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,640
These are what we call social democracies.

234
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:48,990
Social democracy actually has a very significant component of social solidarity, which we don't have in the United States.

235
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:55,810
That's the reason people are willing to pay 40 or 50% of marginal income tax.

236
00:44:57,950 --> 00:45:01,180
In return, you get what you get.

237
00:45:01,190 --> 00:45:06,380
Free health care, free college education, pension, everything.

238
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,190
Okay. So these are choices we have to make.

239
00:45:14,410 --> 00:45:19,690
So. What have they made you?

240
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:29,480
What are the major challenges confronting which confronts Japanese society?

241
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,490
One thing one must do is, okay, suicide.

242
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:47,820
Suicide is actually suicide. You know, the article saying why the suicide rate was higher.

243
00:45:48,750 --> 00:45:58,320
So like the economic depression, stresses like young men.

244
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:05,700
But that's actually pretty common across all industrialized nations.

245
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:12,900
Right? That is about the same as these additional Japanese.

246
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:25,110
Thank you. Hi, I'm Susan. The culture of suicide often is not only because of poor mental health, open source.

247
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:36,090
Oftentimes it is a person is a sign of trying to preserve their personal ambitions or social compulsions.

248
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:41,670
Suicides is oftentimes it's not like in the United States.

249
00:46:42,150 --> 00:46:49,170
So in some regions and so some cultural is there.

250
00:46:49,920 --> 00:47:02,230
But in other cities, if you just look at not only can suicide in other institutions and it's social services.

251
00:47:03,850 --> 00:47:09,160
Okay. And China. Okay. I'll see you in Brooklyn.

252
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:13,600
Hi, Suzanne. Okay.

253
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,410
So all of this is really interesting.

254
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:21,639
And there's some guys in Surfside.

255
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:26,770
Clearly, it could be because of this or it's not.

256
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:31,630
Well, okay. So that's what was said.

257
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:42,670
And to this day, I still have someone who is, in fact, mental health care, which is just which for us.

258
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:51,690
Any any other challenges. Okay.

259
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:05,420
Like for those of us who had one operation in.

260
00:48:09,230 --> 00:48:12,850
Japan is the host nation.

261
00:48:15,130 --> 00:48:18,150
In the world. So therefore, population growth.

262
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:30,490
I don't know whether I have made the point. The most important risk factor for all crime is What are you saying?

263
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:37,120
What is the most important risk factor of chronic diseases?

264
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:45,260
Any idea? Basically. Obesity is important, but not the most important.

265
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:50,269
That's funny. Genetic. Say that again.

266
00:48:50,270 --> 00:49:07,550
Genetics, genetics, genetics that, you know, accounts for some and all of these health behaviors like stop aging.

267
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:21,500
Christina So you just say I probably the best of ages.

268
00:49:21,870 --> 00:49:32,370
The most important risk factor of chronic disease, not only heart disease, diabetes, cancer.

269
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:35,940
Just about all chronic disease you can think of.

270
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:44,140
The risk of older adults having such diseases are substantially increased.

271
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:50,700
So Japan now is, you know, close to 30% of its total population.

272
00:49:51,240 --> 00:50:04,380
The 65 year old is from mainland China and Japan has done quite a bit with her speech to give you some comparative national long term care insurance.

273
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:08,610
Since the start of 2000.

274
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:17,280
Okay. And also that the whole point of the best customer mission for Audra McDonald, she's also cinematographer.

275
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:27,910
Okay. So the Japanese model, some of you want us to actually have the Japanese experience extend to other countries.

276
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:31,150
Some can, some not. Okay.

277
00:50:31,350 --> 00:50:41,280
Lot of investment. So she determines care of the house practicing and culture of some of the culture that it would be much more common.

278
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:46,110
All right. Second question. Fisher.

279
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:54,230
Why has to do this to me? Okay.

280
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:01,899
Corona virus and inequality, which the two groups are doing.

281
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:05,620
This one, this network is true.

282
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:17,670
All right. True. In one place, corona virus would be and would even be called.

283
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:29,410
How often do you hold off on income inequality?

284
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:40,210
Okay. Because families were having to decide whether to spend money on corporate transactions or whether to send their kids to school.

285
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:55,820
And it wasn't just an overall lack of talking houses in general in terms of force to whether they had the funds to support a winning team.

286
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:06,670
So yeah, kind of reminds you of the whole framework of social determinants of health,

287
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:15,560
like basically lower income people over the end of and more longer.

288
00:52:16,990 --> 00:52:26,160
Any kind of have source. In the U.S. and you have probably not just for the past three months.

289
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:39,070
I read something and they said they have less resources to access this kind of assistance of medical care working in order to,

290
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,630
you know, to respond to.

291
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:47,610
Corona of the coronavirus quarantine.

292
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:54,780
So in that regard and you go to our.

293
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,920
Resist anything else. Hold on to your job.

294
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,050
What do you mean? Is a very significant step.

295
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:13,670
Your ground. So clearly, you should have clawbacks of these.

296
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,050
And so, therefore,

297
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:31,450
I think you all people know this is and there's still going to be more not only this could use this kind of damage and also people to the.

298
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:39,270
Yes. Okay. So what are the stand in that case?

299
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:55,610
But the relationship goes both ways. And so we had, first of all, didn't have that was an exacerbated inequality.

300
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:59,840
To what extent inequality. What?

301
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:08,560
And for the latest on the impact of the pandemic.

302
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:31,230
Can you see this? Yes, we talked about the fact that, in fact, yes, it is their jobs.

303
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:44,150
I know I can't say this. Every single penny either or large salaries.

304
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:59,380
So I live in a crowded housing environment to sit and watch them solve this one.

305
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:08,260
You know, this article was written to focus on, you know, increases in the quality of the economy.

306
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:15,470
And then that is actually, you know, really just the core of the solution.

307
00:55:17,890 --> 00:55:26,170
So therefore, we have and this is my motivation in your paper and things like that.

308
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:37,720
So you want to expand. So I think at least one or two of you actually asked the question, what can we do to break the cycle?

309
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:49,360
That is what we all see is that this right here it is.

310
00:55:51,070 --> 00:55:53,980
And so I think somebody could talk about this.

311
00:55:56,790 --> 00:56:09,930
But one of the things that we talked about was how we could pass things like mandatory service for everyone who didn't need support anywhere,

312
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:17,230
you know. So that would be helpful as well.

313
00:56:17,530 --> 00:56:30,780
Well, I think some policies or risk factors would be aware of that now for a while.

314
00:56:30,810 --> 00:56:42,600
All these are supposed. Yeah. One thing that I think is important and again, I would encourage you to think in terms of social determinants of health.

315
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,070
Last we really stuck by civil rights.

316
00:56:49,700 --> 00:57:00,590
Through impact operation. You don't really have to do house by house to house.

317
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:11,300
In fact, you need to consider house as an element for all of us.

318
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:17,310
So there is this term called health, warmth of the crisis.

319
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:29,300
That is part of this term. That is our economic policy, or at least our educational house.

320
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:41,560
We have to very much consider population house as you know how it would impact participation in family.

321
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:46,340
My sense is in some regard,

322
00:57:46,730 --> 00:58:01,640
education think a lot of primary and secondary education perhaps will do more in improving population health than in the US.

323
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:09,650
Spend billions and billions of dollars on medical care as well as fancy MRI or robotic surgery.

324
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:19,450
That is the type of car or a house that is just some kind of what I would

325
00:58:19,810 --> 00:58:30,280
describe as government should not based place 2030 years ago not in the House.

326
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:43,250
So this is something because nowadays every time we make some investments, I can give this back to you and say that environmental impact we know from.

327
00:58:44,290 --> 00:58:47,730
Doing the same for. Okay.

328
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,310
So that is some secrets. And we got to see these articles.

329
00:58:52,330 --> 00:58:57,520
Basically, you have all of these major concepts underlying such articles.

330
00:58:58,150 --> 00:59:08,500
All right. The third article is related to mental health, which we didn't say anything and we should we which I have not,

331
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,500
which I didn't see anything in my lecture at all.

332
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:24,310
But I thought mental health is actually a major class of chronic diseases, so we are to spend some time thinking about mental health.

333
00:59:24,730 --> 00:59:34,870
Okay. All right. And also, this is a so we have this group and this group.

334
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:42,680
Okay. We talk about mental health. Okay. What is the burden or indicators of burden?

335
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:48,750
The health and mental health. Based upon all these charts you have seen.

336
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:56,160
We answered this question. Plus, summarizing charts.

337
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:04,590
We have not sure if that's what it was asking for the indicators like the self reported or having them or.

338
01:00:04,650 --> 01:00:08,100
Uh huh. Emotional distress. Uh huh. Uh huh.

339
01:00:08,910 --> 01:00:12,650
Substance abuse? Yes. Or does that right?

340
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:18,360
Yeah. Yeah. These are indicators, of course. I mean, mental disorder, you know?

341
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:29,580
I mean, the American Psychiatric Association published what they call the DSM diagnostic, whatever guide DSM.

342
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:34,200
And it's an it's a huge book. Okay.

343
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:43,080
Of course, that is. So this particular article, focus on suicide, focus on substance abuse.

344
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:47,450
What else? Mental distress. Right.

345
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:52,770
So these are kind of very important narrative indicators.

346
01:00:53,370 --> 01:01:00,180
Okay. So how does the US do among these 11 higher income countries?

347
01:01:02,430 --> 01:01:06,180
Why it may be that this could respond to this.

348
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:21,000
Yeah, I think the security was basically right before secretary who created the site of the phone people wanted to see.

349
01:01:22,260 --> 01:01:36,110
The decision to hire someone comes from legal, has the burden of legal stress and access as an operative.

350
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:52,260
And at the same time, like the United States and the entire U.S. seems to, it seems more difficult to access mental health care.

351
01:01:53,100 --> 01:02:07,920
And also the mental health services, the resources on those services can be very seems to be less right than those of other countries.

352
01:02:09,030 --> 01:02:16,940
So that kind of give you some sense of, you know, because mental health is truly is a very important issue.

353
01:02:17,380 --> 01:02:26,220
And I guess, you know, this COVID 19 pandemic actually, you know that people realize, you know,

354
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:35,220
people are not only just dealing with this physical the risk of physical diseases, but also a lot of mental health issues.

355
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:38,400
So we need to think about. All right.

356
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:54,580
What are the major challenges? For the United States in improving or in providing mental health care.

357
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:11,489
The article centers on the workers within the contract that they were part of.

358
01:03:11,490 --> 01:03:25,240
And so, yeah, that's very important to me, not just the number of psychologists, psychologists, social workers, nurses we got.

359
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:30,000
That is very important in how mental health screening is involved.

360
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:34,970
Or you have to come through some mental health care to see what's better.

361
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,130
Only group into primary care.

362
01:03:39,210 --> 01:03:51,140
Okay. Yes. You know, in the United States, we are not we don't see that because you it's so this is very important.

363
01:03:51,150 --> 01:03:57,480
So not only have to think of quality health care resources and how it's all of

364
01:03:57,530 --> 01:04:07,410
this is important for these hours and and and also speaking of in your house,

365
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:17,480
we also need to I mean here and it's interesting it's you know, these to provide a little glimpse of the international comparisons.

366
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:28,010
But it is a actually on one mental health it's like in the developing countries or non-Western communities that would be better government.

367
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:36,820
Just for example, in Japan, mental health care seems to be much more institutional in the sense that there these,

368
01:04:36,870 --> 01:04:46,400
you know, reliable institutional care to deal with serious mental disorder.

369
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:57,090
That is the fact that the they do not even begin to use these psychotropic drugs.

370
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:09,220
Okay. And as far as the strikes to deal with these depression anxiety, so nearly as much as the United States in another context,

371
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:21,090
all the stuff that we can do for you know, and we will have a roundtable discussion on health care and so on.

372
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:30,180
But. Well, okay, we still have a few minutes left.

373
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:41,250
You know, in addition to the questions here, I'm actually wondering whether you have any questions you would like to talk about.

374
01:05:45,290 --> 01:05:57,910
I think they mentioned that for the government the mantle of how the US had really poor rankings when it comes to the burden.

375
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:06,590
But it was surprising to see that the US was more likely to seek professional help than these other countries that had the resources.

376
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:16,430
So yeah. Wow. I mean, it's I don't have answers with all I can say.

377
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:19,790
Well, this is again, an interesting observation. Okay.

378
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:27,140
But actually you may I would encourage you to look to see which of the countries.

379
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:38,270
I mean, they seem to be doing a particularly good job in in delivering mental health care.

380
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,330
Okay. My sense would it be more with countries like Spain?

381
01:06:45,330 --> 01:06:55,500
Like Sweden. Okay. And also with two other countries in Switzerland and the German and German, Sylvia is kind of very interesting.

382
01:06:55,920 --> 01:07:08,850
So I guess we can start thinking about and also the financing and the organization of mental health care is quite distinct or quite distinct from.

383
01:07:09,990 --> 01:07:14,340
You know, health care for medical care for physical diseases.

384
01:07:14,910 --> 01:07:21,240
Okay. And as I indicated to you previously in health care.

385
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:34,620
Okay. Health care. You know, it took me a long time to realize health care is a lot more than clinical medicine on earth.

386
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:45,480
And Lisa, one half of health care costs, management policy.

387
01:07:46,770 --> 01:07:50,070
You don't have good management. You don't have good policy.

388
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,740
You never have a very well performing health care system.

389
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:03,720
And we all know you name it, spent spend more money.

390
01:08:05,360 --> 01:08:16,810
On health care than any other country and actually spent more than twice two and a half times as much than the average for U.S. countries was spent.

391
01:08:17,690 --> 01:08:27,650
Then you look at all the population health outcomes. Americans and the United States do not very well.

392
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:34,940
And to take this pandemic as another example of the United States, you know,

393
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:43,330
actually is one of the first country in which even then the vaccines sold in less and less.

394
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:49,550
Well, I will give you 97, 88 plus in terms of technology.

395
01:08:51,530 --> 01:08:57,080
But how do you improve? How do you get your population vaccinated?

396
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:08,270
United States doing very poor. You know, you have you know, I look at the rate of vaccination.

397
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:17,390
Singapore, Taiwan, even China actually is a higher than that of the United States in general.

398
01:09:19,450 --> 01:09:27,730
Okay. So, yes, you have all these offensive vaccines that you're unable to deliver.

399
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:36,120
To the population which in. And you know, never mind about this one.

400
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,290
1.1, 1.2 million lives lost.

401
01:09:41,630 --> 01:09:45,170
Okay. So that is something.

402
01:09:45,170 --> 01:09:56,570
And we'll talk more about this in terms of how well, you know, and nowadays and with the pandemic is still, you know, not.

403
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:04,900
It's still not gone away. People simply decided to.

404
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:12,500
Ignore it. So this is kind very interesting.

405
01:10:16,030 --> 01:10:23,050
And the big stories nowadays about the COVID 19 pandemic is what's going down in China.

406
01:10:23,500 --> 01:10:28,240
It's the whole world. We'll talk about that in our streets and people discussion.

407
01:10:29,490 --> 01:10:44,840
Okay. Any other course. Are you able to keep up with the reading?

408
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:58,070
Okay. I just want to make sure the amount of the reporting requirement is appropriate.

409
01:10:58,790 --> 01:11:03,290
You're not you know, it's not too much or not to.

410
01:11:04,250 --> 01:11:14,469
If you think it's too little, I can't help. And for those of you who like to read them,

411
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:22,240
why I always have this optional reading list so you can take some of these readings are truly very interesting.

412
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:31,060
But I have to I have learned I should try to really be very careful about how much I required my students to.

413
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:38,650
Okay. I understand you all have been out of four or five classes so that.

414
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:52,610
I did have a chance to go over the handle pages you have submitted and I'm actually quite pleased.

415
01:11:53,720 --> 01:12:01,400
I thought the quality was quite good and people, you know, go over and ask the questions.

416
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:10,010
So I'm trying I'm going to, you know, what I what I have been doing is I will try to, you know,

417
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:18,530
provide you some very cryptic, short comments because I can now possibly spend too much time.

418
01:12:18,980 --> 01:12:28,370
You know, I have to deal with 25, 27 of you and to sort of feel comfortable with you are concerned about that, too.

419
01:12:28,370 --> 01:12:35,720
Related to annotations every week I have to agree 50 annotations every.

420
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:47,129
And. And a question. When will we get the feedback?

421
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:58,110
By the weekend. So we can start on Thursday. I well I have agreed and I, I think in the and the last time I checked out of the 25,

422
01:12:58,110 --> 01:13:03,570
26 standards about, you know, I have already agreed half of them.

423
01:13:04,170 --> 01:13:07,860
Have you seen to view these. Yeah.

424
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:14,440
Any of you have seen your grade? Okay.

425
01:13:14,940 --> 01:13:21,180
Okay, good. Yeah. Because I tried to do five or six every time I have a few minutes.

426
01:13:21,990 --> 01:13:32,460
So. So, you know, they require you to do all this work, that pretty small work for myself as well, so.

427
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:40,560
Well, we're in this together. I hope this is a reasonable way.

428
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:45,659
Okay. And you think it's a good you know, then we're just doing it.

429
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:52,650
And once you get used to it, I think hopefully we're taking much less time for you to do this.

430
01:13:53,640 --> 01:14:03,920
Okay. Well, it's 543 and yes, you'll have the question, the general consensus of people about things.

431
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:08,750
But I was thinking maybe not this one.

432
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:13,280
So maybe candidate is for whatever reason.

433
01:14:14,090 --> 01:14:21,260
Okay. Another three days to go.

434
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:27,050
Okay. Okay. Well, let's talk about it, I think.

435
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:43,210
Okay. I try to do. Two are free reading and seven and typically have some reminder of where and how of happens after days.

436
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:50,530
On that note, some want to see.

437
01:14:51,150 --> 01:15:01,740
Sure. I think I do read, you know what I would recommend for you in this community?

438
01:15:02,790 --> 01:15:14,940
You can probably try to leave your personal information, and I think that is true.

439
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:23,680
What I would recommend is like what I suggest Langston Hughes, one person may be vulnerable.

440
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:29,620
That's how you see instead of really standing.

441
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:41,970
Okay. In the. Save the American coal and we've had increases in cervical cancers.

442
01:15:43,290 --> 01:16:00,920
I would start with that as a starting message that this country is more than the first or second pass.

443
01:16:00,930 --> 01:16:17,230
I would just over grant that we're different section and there are tables, figures, economic tables and figures to confirm what do we want?

444
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:25,620
Okay. I just. I certainly not agree with every word in our.

445
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:35,570
Okay. So that's I would do. And so for these shorter articles, it's no problem.

446
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:45,560
Right. If you had a three piece by piece. So, yes, the need for a shorter course is 5 to 3 months.

447
01:16:46,190 --> 01:16:53,030
We need to also price because it's difficult for the plan in order.

448
01:16:54,230 --> 01:17:05,760
And if you have 300 jobs to do for every two or three weeks, I would always say during the time of the day we will sell one hour or more.

449
01:17:06,320 --> 01:17:12,410
No reason for you to take all of that weekend classes.

450
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:17,510
She's probably not important enough. That's not good enough.

451
01:17:19,490 --> 01:17:21,050
That's what you say.

452
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:35,750
I mean, that's what I'm not even asking for the national standard to do the things that you would like them to put the assignments.

453
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:44,780
I was able to one assignment for me to innovation and then the same question.

454
01:17:45,310 --> 01:17:49,080
Okay. So I would agree with that.

455
01:17:49,860 --> 01:18:01,240
That's my the reason why I was hoping you would not use Google and discuss with

456
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:11,270
me is going to end up and going to write a one increase of one similar to that.

457
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:23,020
So while really clearly do that and one of the things in common is three questions, but very, very likely because of that.

458
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:29,540
So you just take note of that. And what I would do is.

459
01:18:29,540 --> 01:18:37,870
Yes. But I think what we would have trouble is that's too much.

460
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:53,180
I was scared because I was asking for this moment yesterday and I'm going to get someone who more manageable this or that.

461
01:18:55,430 --> 01:19:07,460
Okay. And I have seen and I usually I would welcome suggestions or try to simplify the assignment.

462
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:15,859
But I certainly think it's to get a patience and reduce the customer know which I am

463
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:20,750
staying the course because that's where you find sessions that people come with.

464
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:31,400
So the whole purpose is to motivate people in the summer because more and more people are growing

465
01:19:31,430 --> 01:19:40,450
and it's harder for some people and you may not be able to spend your time numerous than,

466
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:46,340
but that is an important increase.

467
01:19:47,420 --> 01:19:51,290
I can assure you this will being on a couple weeks.

468
01:19:52,100 --> 01:19:56,670
There is.
