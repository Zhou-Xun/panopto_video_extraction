1
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:05,980
Okay. It's going to record.

2
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:15,280
All right. We have two important, very relevant topics to discuss today.

3
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:22,270
But before that, I want to give you a quick report from the exam which supports you.

4
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,710
I'm curious. What's what's the outcome?

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,240
And, of course, I'd like to know, how do you feel?

6
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:36,400
It's hard for you to feel how how do you feel about the exam?

7
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:44,829
Reasonable. Good. Yeah, I guess I can tell from your answer.

8
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,700
I could tell. Overall, it's.

9
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:55,300
And most of the courses are the results or most.

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:58,510
I have gone through all the questions.

11
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:06,490
I want to give you some general ideas. My point, typically, I take a one question at a time.

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,860
I will go to a course or the student, because that could be an idea.

13
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:19,329
You know, if overall have well understood the question,

14
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:25,989
answers the question or it's a question that is the by most of the students if it's

15
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:35,559
not so for those questions of the class the answer sure I'm no more distribution,

16
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,240
which means most student got most of the answers right.

17
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:49,750
There is always the variation so that I feel with the grades that of course based on what you know,

18
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:57,980
how this question how important was the sense of the proportions of the answer?

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,100
Me So that would be like the concrete grade.

20
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:18,930
But if it's a question that most of the students didn't answer the way I have expected or the way it should have been,

21
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,950
I can say that's my failure to explain sense theory.

22
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:31,240
So in that case, I would use a different way. I of, you know, think about the future.

23
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:39,850
We can do this again and the focus that of course for now that the fourth small proportion of the student of the student who

24
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:51,819
really did well despite the overall not well and they conceded to give additional points in stuff reduce over what is a question.

25
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:59,640
So that's my general principle for grading hopefully you think is fair because I think for most students to well,

26
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:08,350
for one person that's not so student poets means we need to spend more time to learn some important concept.

27
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:12,840
So what's the overall result?

28
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:17,110
I think it's a four minute question.

29
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:26,200
Five, right? I think a one, two, three, five or showed a normal distribution.

30
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:37,749
You have some perfect or close to perfect, a very thoughtful answer, some probably at the end.

31
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,870
But overall, it's a question you could tell.

32
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:52,030
Well, and this will at some point number four, I need to go back to review one more time.

33
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:01,330
My first round of impression was not to answer that answer well and all the other questions.

34
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:13,970
Definitely the and I don't know if it's really it the, you know, the understanding or it's more an expression of just,

35
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:26,680
you know, sometimes some concept of within a short time it might not be and it may not be enough time to see which all is so.

36
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:38,740
But I do plan to go back to look through everyone's answer one more time before I finalize the quick form.

37
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:48,040
So and then in each of the exam, you were I were sent your feedback, not just how many points you get in the grade report.

38
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,510
You were also see for particular questions where you lose points.

39
00:04:52,510 --> 00:05:02,500
And I also had some comments and you know, what could have been better and it's a great but what's it about so that's what.

40
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,340
You can expect, hopefully after this. We can get some of that back to you.

41
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:22,930
And I had to work on the proposal with people who are public health practice here in the U.S. and also contacts in Zimbabwe over the years.

42
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,970
And I haven't finalized that.

43
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,900
I want to give you a quick and of course, sheets that that sense of.

44
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:39,590
Right. Any questions? Overall, I think it's good.

45
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:50,300
I think overall it's good. You know, as I say, if any question like for that's not the ideal to the diagnosis students,

46
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:55,720
I definitely would take that responsibility yourself not to get it.

47
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,920
All right. Any other questions? No.

48
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:16,910
I'm so glad to see so many of you here today. I know a couple of students have some special needs, so not here, but another quick could know.

49
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,700
It's about next week's lecture we have from the two guest lectures.

50
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:35,210
One. Originally the plan was I was told to keep updated TB vaccine developments and

51
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:46,200
then back to on from what that now we're doing a lecture and modern vaccine

52
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:54,000
technology his dissertation and developing new tools for vaccine people now creates

53
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:59,930
an extremely important role in whatever it was on his dissertation committee.

54
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:07,300
And I got to know him through maybe two courses by the vaccine.

55
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,680
Many years ago and another set of TB similar cuts.

56
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:21,920
So anyway, he was going to talk over the issue,

57
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:33,530
but we were still in meetings in the country because I have another guest speaker I managed to invite whose name was Len P,

58
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:45,060
who is a former student in the School of Public Health and now working in the central hospitals.

59
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:57,620
And he's going to give a talk and an application application for the methodology that we're sharing with you.

60
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:09,860
And then he will show you how that was used to identify new TB antigens for, you know, future vaccine development.

61
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,050
So I was so glad I could get both of them come at the same session.

62
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:25,640
So that you were saying how all this new technology can be used to develop some

63
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:33,530
is important for the future of vaccine against a very challenging public health.

64
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:49,140
And between these two, because it may not come exactly at 230 as a circumstance that I will try to make some over view introduction of TB vaccine.

65
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:54,200
So we'll have a lot of questions to do next week, but the plan will come in person,

66
00:08:55,160 --> 00:09:11,930
so hopefully and that's next week because the speakers spend time to prepare and lecture and also make efforts to speak as it's always nice to see.

67
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:22,790
We have a good attendance and I think you have been amazing so far for either of them ever to come and appreciate it.

68
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,710
So any questions if you.

69
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:39,060
If not I, we're starting in two days next year, then maybe later or find some time to review some of the important question covered in the exam.

70
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:46,890
And because I really like it's important and know how to use that.

71
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:54,989
Okay. So today we're going to talk about vaccination and the disease eradication because

72
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:02,160
we some day when we talk about vaccination is one of the most cost effective,

73
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:12,540
you know, public health interventions to control disease contributes to the global population growth.

74
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:26,550
So then I think also smallpox is eradicate that we learned some important lessons which you have implications for future disease eradication.

75
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:35,100
So for that and also I think supporting eradication, polio eradication,

76
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:44,919
what's our goal that's a set to learn them and according to the initial goal it will have been eradicated.

77
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:50,579
Cancer as you know from the recent report, this is not the case.

78
00:10:50,580 --> 00:11:00,600
So at the end of this session I work had full approval from everyone discuss what lessons so.

79
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:10,029
To explore the lessons we have learned from this to disease.

80
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:21,100
I think first, I think we were all together review, let's say eradicate pregnancy and we talk about the vaccines most effective.

81
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:27,220
But can we really expect to eradicate every disease by vaccination?

82
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:34,780
So after today, probably this would be clear to you, if not yet.

83
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,540
I'm sure many of you have been exposed to this discussion before.

84
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:51,880
And then please. The Chairman when we discuss, okay, then we will have the smallpox vaccination and the eradication history review.

85
00:11:52,360 --> 00:12:04,269
And where you were is by doing that, we hope we can, you know, highlight this the successes, why it's successful,

86
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:15,360
what has it has taken to succeed the smallpox, Iraq and polio vaccination and podium eradication?

87
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:24,670
The kind of challenges I you know, the first half we talk about the overall general approach concept of framework.

88
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:39,250
The second half are really to select a subset of disease hich represents some important focus or is the only useful concept.

89
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:46,990
And these two, we really want to look what what it takes to eradicate the disease,

90
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:56,260
biologically society and the program where you can think about the different aspects involved.

91
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,590
And so these to review them,

92
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:09,620
Global Poverty Eradication Initiative is something that I hope to put your your resource is if you are you should see proof of health.

93
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:14,170
You are interesting, you know, disease, immunization, disease.

94
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,910
So what takes a lot to define Iraq?

95
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:28,810
I've been simply speaking, you can conceive this is three points basically.

96
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:40,240
But essentially it's to pull out the roots of all potential transmission traits or for cancer transmission source.

97
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:50,200
Of course, in order to achieve this, the primary goal for out there I understand all of this does work.

98
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:55,990
Okay. Even before it's difficult work. Okay, good, good.

99
00:13:56,470 --> 00:14:04,180
And so first you want to identify all response so you can start to think,

100
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:14,170
do we know all the risk for every infectious disease that we are studying, we are trying to come true today.

101
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:23,950
If the answer is no, then you may think if and how likely this disease can be Iraq.

102
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:35,590
So identify all risk and identify a strategy that can eliminate infection from all risk for under all conditions.

103
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:49,780
This is some concept, I hope, that when we discussed, or at least I expose you to multiple times, we say all can be replicated.

104
00:14:50,320 --> 00:15:02,830
And here we are discussing in details why some disease and that Iraq you can only achieve elimination in some regional countries.

105
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:08,499
That's the conflict with Iraq because of the second example.

106
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:19,960
It's not just identify borders. You have to identify a strategy that can eliminate infection from or risk from the or conditions.

107
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,340
Here you can think about some really good disease.

108
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:34,020
Even we know the risk like mycobacterium tuberculosis and can infect the humans can infect have

109
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:44,780
Michigan for years the people project and Michigan State University is in the deer population and

110
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:56,950
so and if we have some versus one for a pathogen lung human then the second the point when that

111
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:08,110
is a requirement is you have a strategy of course to is one health animal and human infections.

112
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:12,540
We veteran scientists also try to develop for veterans.

113
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:25,030
We are in the vaccine. But you know why it's not always easier to try and to mobilize the entire world.

114
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,720
Eradication is completely remove this path of transmission.

115
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:42,250
Of course, if only one frees Iraqis, which is the globalization today, and as we know, we will have even some.

116
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:54,750
Polio cases in the US recently. So you have to make every country ever reaching where you'd be able to.

117
00:16:54,930 --> 00:17:01,740
So yeah, here I have a little bit more information and identify all of.

118
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:07,350
What are the risks for those of you who have studied epidemiology of infectious diseases,

119
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:19,910
you should understand the a sawyer risk for near impossible elimination, pseudomonas strains and tetanus.

120
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:25,850
It's also the soil, so you can't really easily do that.

121
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,370
Right? And then you're not risk. Well.

122
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:32,690
It's also difficult elimination.

123
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:42,520
So if you are facing a set up for disease trying to determine can we eradicated it?

124
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:47,590
It's not possible if they are involved.

125
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:53,500
So human risk from 1871 may have keystroke.

126
00:17:53,610 --> 00:18:10,020
That's human. This is talking about some Cheryl Hanson choose between human and animal population groups sustained transmission.

127
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:19,680
So this is why we need to mobilize empowered because you have subpopulations that can

128
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:29,340
sustain transmission of the the proposal and and what you need to try to accomplish.

129
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:41,730
And all of you can be trusted. We are going to work with population because this is an immigrant population.

130
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:50,580
They are not even you mean. And they have the treaty from last year, Ireland, which is a Pacific island.

131
00:18:51,330 --> 00:19:01,950
They have foot incidence, this population of some 150,000 people in north west corner.

132
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:14,070
They have almost 100 times the state's overall incidence rate and compared to many African countries.

133
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:20,010
So that's the population groups sustained transmission.

134
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:28,770
If you design a vaccine program for disease eradication or you you have to think about who

135
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:38,550
is are there such groups or who at this time in long term excrete those type of risk?

136
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:51,070
If people fight for, you know, long term persistence of the disease, even they are not so symptomatic, it can still be a source.

137
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:58,200
So these are all have to be taken into consideration as symptomatic infection as a risk.

138
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:09,660
This notice of a special interest and I am all to keep you transmission also particular mentioned asymptomatic infection and risk.

139
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:16,740
So this is like disease eradication, immunization or these.

140
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:28,770
It's important if you want to consider all the potential of human risk, not necessarily just as symptomatic the disease.

141
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:40,320
So that's the eradicate villages then you and any questions this you know all these three is to achieve

142
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:48,930
this a major goal but to achieve in order to achieve this goal we have to be able to do all these.

143
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:57,700
And I hope this can also guide your future practice if you work in public health practice agents.

144
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:03,580
You want to think about all these. Then we've come through human rights war.

145
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:09,360
You want to send people and not just activities visas.

146
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:17,380
Another important thing is the pathogenesis of the disease.

147
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:24,520
Knowledge. Our knowledge of cancer. Genesis of disease also changes for a long time.

148
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:32,290
People send good TB, including the infection to distinct stage one score latent TB infection.

149
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:35,910
Another is activity disease.

150
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:40,780
But the later. The study from non-human primates.

151
00:21:43,130 --> 00:22:00,230
I suggest the so-called API license that you can actually involve a very complicated tilings of the pencil genesis from a more confined mark.

152
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:13,130
Well, you know, my son actually has some courses, some pencil, and it's just not be able to be detected by current viscoelastic tools.

153
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,560
So that means that you want to think about everything.

154
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:21,830
And so reality comes. That's absolutely.

155
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,330
So that's what you write. Any questions or comments about the.

156
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:43,070
So for future though you may want to be very careful when you use the term eradicates the disease versus eliminate.

157
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:52,260
And then the goal for vaccination not necessarily is to eradicate this disease.

158
00:22:52,350 --> 00:23:02,490
The best outcome for a successful immunization program is to eradicate the disease.

159
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:06,370
Is this correct or not in this regard?

160
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,840
I think that you will start to think about that more.

161
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:24,730
So some of this information is small, but I thought it was interesting to have some general background I have for the students of WAMU for this photo.

162
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:29,050
I hope you will find some sense of it anyway.

163
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,550
It's not just an artifact, smallpox.

164
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:41,350
It's a huge contagious and sometimes fatal disease caused by the virus.

165
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,280
Of course, now you have you.

166
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:55,750
I think for your generation, you don't even necessarily have any survival for smallpox or headbutting one, so you probably have nothing.

167
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:59,910
Yeah, in my generation I don't really helpful.

168
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:14,460
Yeah, I don't know any of my people who have the disease, but I did see some of the people who were survivors of the, uh,

169
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:25,770
smallpox outbreak had occurred from cancer and for thousands of years eradicated after a successful world wide vaccination program.

170
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:31,920
Sometimes you. I remember I heard my client say very senior colleagues.

171
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:46,240
We do a lot of vaccines talking about how lucky the medical public health community is with the smallpox cuts.

172
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:49,659
It just happened to me, too.

173
00:24:49,660 --> 00:25:04,480
All of the requirements for eradication diseases, last case in the U.S. in 1949 and the last naturally occurring case in the word it's in Somalia.

174
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:15,490
In 1977, after the eradication of smallpox in Somalia, the WTO certified a complete success.

175
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:37,270
Um, of course, after all, the vaccination stopped Iraq, there was an incident in 2001 911 following 911 by a curve where terrorists attacked the,

176
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:46,630
you know, the words of three towers in New York were were destroyed.

177
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:56,920
Following that, there was some incident, which is that course, the potential use of these and the bio terrorism.

178
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,760
So this virus once again infects only a human nature.

179
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:14,590
Um, may need to remain viable for years as temperatures rapidly enlarging that by you wait months.

180
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:30,309
Chemical disinfectants the major and it's that's helped the vaccination success it's these biological characteristics

181
00:26:30,310 --> 00:26:40,210
of this virus that infects human nature and killing symptoms that there are some more severe some less severe.

182
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:48,880
And the very major it's acid severe and most actually the most common form of smallpox.

183
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:56,030
That's why it could cause a lot more pain during the time when it was the prevalence.

184
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:04,200
Um, this is some symptoms. And then for the minor it's much less common.

185
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:15,310
And the severe form of the smallpox, um, historic is less than 1%.

186
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:23,440
Important issue notes the to pay attention to the epidemiology risk.

187
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,070
What we talk about we need to identify all this.

188
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:49,750
So human is the only reservoir for smallpox but once and you want to know is that can we say some animal has what you can also be pathogenic to human.

189
00:27:50,620 --> 00:28:03,399
Uh that's why you want to also if these pathogen was the first of the animal and you also want to look

190
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:11,500
into the potential of human as for humans that the risk and it's a direct to human to human transmission.

191
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:24,280
So what we discussed human you know direct of protection versus indirect protection which is an area that's in direct to.

192
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:30,790
Protection is the most significant.

193
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:40,540
This case also means that. So because this transmission model also make the vaccination of smallpox.

194
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:48,850
Produce both direct and indirect. Yeah.

195
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,159
The other thing is more clinics and they're doing it to boost smallpox.

196
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:00,220
Vaccine is a penny or two like vaccine made of whole tons of Russian vaccines.

197
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,980
You need some very potent system.

198
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:21,370
We use the term potent means to generate the protection to anticipate that it's not how potent you really have to be confirmed in clinical trials.

199
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:31,960
Early admission double the skin high beta uses use this staple freeze dried vaccine that was easier to reconstitute.

200
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:36,339
Clinical efficacy is low. Your household income tax.

201
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:51,610
That is because of household contacts if you have very close contact and that makes the trust mission easier and to be cost effective,

202
00:29:52,120 --> 00:30:06,370
you want to ideally you can come back to the vaccine trial in a high risk population because that will allow you short time and to ensure exposure,

203
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:10,360
ensure disease occurs, then you need a less time,

204
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:26,110
less sample to assess the protective effects so that when it's a lot of studies related to the smallpox, the efficacy is in the hospital.

205
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,860
Any questions? You have some questions are.

206
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:52,590
Why do you worry about? Yeah.

207
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,640
I said, you mean by faxes?

208
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,980
Yeah. Yes. This is something you want to avoid.

209
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:07,670
Is this a good. Because it's a, you know, use this spike on the screen.

210
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:21,330
This is why when you got this fax and you may also give some list to that person during the, um, after posting the eradication.

211
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,689
Compared to many, some of the medical professionals still got the vaccine,

212
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:40,700
just especially during the time when the bioterrorism risk appeared to be high and they were required to be isolated,

213
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:53,240
not to be exposed to any household contact who is immunocompromised, because they could have it locally if they come in contact with just.

214
00:31:54,830 --> 00:32:03,600
Is that what you considering? Yeah. Yeah. Life up to know the vaccine does have the potential, especially for smallpox.

215
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:12,830
It's a surface that could use properties of skin type so the vaccine could be on the skin.

216
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:22,490
I heard people talking about a head of household that, uh, people got some.

217
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,860
Some, in fact, and another hand at the same time.

218
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:37,360
If you don't close the disease, if you don't have one immunocompromised, there could also be a chance you to inoculate.

219
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:43,780
Your close contacts if they have really direct contact?

220
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:49,090
That's a good question. Yeah. Good. Good. So to come see.

221
00:32:52,680 --> 00:33:03,090
Vaccination one successful dose react vaccine 3 to 10 years depends on their risk of exposure to smallpox or related to birth.

222
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:17,250
And then as you we talked about. Even back to that time there some there were studies to understand the immunity induced by smallpox vaccination.

223
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:32,550
And they studied the neutralizing antibody development, how soon after vaccination can be developed and how soon after vaccination.

224
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:46,860
So once you can see what do you after when you introduce the vaccine, you definitely want to follow the immunity and to see how that is done.

225
00:33:46,950 --> 00:34:00,270
Of course, in the post, the license state only if you were involved in some try some some studies like when we got all got several dose of COVID 19.

226
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:13,740
He agreed it has to go. But hopefully those involved in the studies, we're generating information and the timing, the winning of the immunity.

227
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:26,880
Then for future vaccination, there will be some fabulous kicks developed to to monitor if the vaccine population are indeed protected.

228
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:37,620
Yeah. Another interesting thing is that over 95% primary, they develop detectable neutralizing antibodies.

229
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:48,570
So this is a good it happened to induce neutralizing antibody and right now with HIV vaccinated people.

230
00:34:48,660 --> 00:35:01,500
One of the challenges is to develop widely neutralizing antibody because HIV is so many variations and the smallpox at that time,

231
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,180
apparently one vaccine works against the oldest strains.

232
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:14,100
But today it's much more complex situation. High level of protection for up to five years following vaccination.

233
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:22,260
These are all the studies that before today we emphasize immunogenicity trial.

234
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:32,220
You remember when we talk about the new approach, besides the traditional efficacy, you also want to run immunogenicity.

235
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:43,200
Sure. But if you look at the data here, even back then, this kind of sensor may not be studied as immunogenicity trial,

236
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:49,470
but because it was such an important disease for your application.

237
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,410
So data had been accumulated and collected and then.

238
00:35:57,690 --> 00:36:01,120
Pretty sure part of one immunity for more than ten years.

239
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:11,510
You, no matter what and how good the vaccine is, you want to be able to monitor.

240
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:19,780
And one of the sense related polio vaccine is, you know, so in some of the high risk population,

241
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:35,860
the winning immunity may not have been so close and once and relate to the winning immunity is to think about lots of other factors foods that affect.

242
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:46,070
The you know, when you you what kind of a population you could expect to win immunity.

243
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:51,710
Uh, occurs more commonly.

244
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:59,930
And the immunity has to be based on good health based.

245
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:08,900
Otherwise your body would not be able to generate all the immune cells, antibodies, all of these.

246
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:16,310
So then instead that just remember looking at winning immunity is important.

247
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:22,820
You want to understand what affects winning immunity.

248
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:31,520
Reduced reduction in disease of it not previously vaccinated.

249
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:38,940
So even you were not completely. You could also have less disease.

250
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,030
This is what we talk about. So what would measure a protection?

251
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:49,340
Why? It's infection disease. Another is the severity of the disease.

252
00:37:51,250 --> 00:38:05,500
So if you could reduce the severity of the disease, how this could impact of the overall vaccine benefit.

253
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:24,120
Protection. If a person that does not complete the protects against the infection or does not necessarily generate a certain immunity,

254
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:29,560
but is still reduce the disease. Reduce of the disease in the population.

255
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:34,720
Could be how that would impact the overall disease control.

256
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:45,110
You know, probably which is better for the person because then you're also spending less money.

257
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:53,880
But then it's also better for the health care system. Both are being taken up by people that could have been vaccinated.

258
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:57,460
They were. Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

259
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:10,320
That's to reduce the pressure on the health system and to help it to use the resource for other more important pieces.

260
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:21,480
Um, that's required hospital like even in college 19 so many other medical conditions have been management that have been postponed,

261
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,970
including some surgery cancer patients.

262
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,920
Um, but that's a great thanks for that comment.

263
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:45,060
What else would it helpful, uh, would it have any impact on the reduction of the disease in the population?

264
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:51,820
Besides the Nancy, I think it might reduce transmission.

265
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:57,400
Especially depending on how. Mm hmm.

266
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:05,740
Um, I guess if you had something. But. If you have less severe symptoms.

267
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:11,540
You have less opportunities for someone to spread their. Very good.

268
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:19,670
Thank you. Yeah. Uh, to have covered the two aspects of that benefit.

269
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:29,780
So for that's for this reason, we still even could develop a vaccine that reduces severe disease.

270
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:38,260
That's for the beneficial for controlled epidemics in the open, besides the,

271
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:46,650
you know, saving medical resource for other important health issue after another.

272
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:58,220
So I think, Nancy, one issue which has increased very support is how much impact that may have depends on how it is transmitted.

273
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:04,100
Right. And the it's, again, vaccine impact is.

274
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:11,420
You see the the best, the impact's most, in fact,

275
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:24,650
one that is for disease that's directly addressed means if you have a less severe disease, you have people carry less pathogen.

276
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:32,190
If it's a severe human to human, that would be really useful for controlling the infection risk.

277
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:39,070
But if it's something that's not human to, you know, you can control tetanus.

278
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:45,590
So but that doesn't really necessarily impact the risk for other people being exposed.

279
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:49,320
I think that was sought for common sense.

280
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:57,750
Um, okay. Yeah, there's some other type called the modified smallpox.

281
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:08,250
This typically occurs in previous the vaccinated person basically had a less severe symptoms and as you can see

282
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:19,499
and while they protect themselves um not going to have they're also you know you reduce the infectious source,

283
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:31,649
you reduce the infectious source in the community by completely protect but it not getting a poor or you make somebody to experience a less disease.

284
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:38,240
Let's put back to cough with a lot of the fact you're shooting of viruses you do.

285
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:42,480
That's good. Um smallpox.

286
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,900
The fatality rates by time. Um.

287
00:42:47,070 --> 00:42:54,680
Here is. Fatality rate and this years since vaccination.

288
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,440
What's this? A picture. This is the figure I.

289
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:22,330
What does this a finger tell us? Yeah.

290
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,740
Yeah. Were you there? Never.

291
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:35,079
There were two facts. You definitely had the worst experience of the fraternity house.

292
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:41,559
But then if you had vaccinations, the fatality was significantly reduced.

293
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:45,690
But you can see there is a kind of relationship, right?

294
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:57,730
The near term, the shorter of vaccination, the protection from the time increase, you can see the protection is reduced.

295
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:03,409
It's good. Thanks. Smallpox eradication.

296
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:08,899
What to have for smallpox eradication.

297
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:11,960
One is mass vaccination. That's a.

298
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:26,810
But that was not the. Achieve the eradication during that time, basically giving to larger numbers of people who have not been exposed to smallpox.

299
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:32,220
Help to protect people from smallpox, but not have to come from it.

300
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:42,590
Get rid of the disease. So what really helped at the end to what we call the end game is a written vaccination.

301
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:48,240
That was conducted in 1967.

302
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:56,730
So this was a giving to those people who had been or could have been exposed to an infected person.

303
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:01,770
This is more like today's public health and disease.

304
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,240
Infectious disease control is this one approach.

305
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:21,750
You find the case and the closest contact would be first priority to implement for implementation of any control strategy or interventions.

306
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:27,570
And then when you go out further, you get additional and.

307
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:33,940
It's both your risk that you go that way.

308
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:38,140
You two are more focused in stuff for anything less.

309
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:49,480
And this basically it's kind of a mop up campaign that's helped to completely eradicate the disease.

310
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:59,410
This is a certificate that you can see the Minister for Health from different countries in different language assigned to this certificate.

311
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:13,420
And then vaccine early on you know it's a routine function after the eradication and then

312
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:22,030
discontinue in some population but in some high risk populations who may still deal with

313
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:36,069
some laboratory strain and keep that then you could still recommend and to 2001 because

314
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:45,500
that's the experience of terrorist activities in smallpox response teams and where do.

315
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:52,560
Give to the vaccine. How and why small pox was Iraq people?

316
00:46:54,210 --> 00:47:01,230
To summarize, once in nature, an infection was caused by human to human transmission.

317
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:04,680
We are human beings only in nature. Yes.

318
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:16,650
And the mass smallpox vaccination in Africa and food, despite the heavy items, more vaccine than there were people.

319
00:47:18,410 --> 00:47:33,570
But to run vaccination this is doctor for this was the from CDC informed by extensive epidemiological data was successful.

320
00:47:33,630 --> 00:47:39,780
So you need to do contact in this case once you have cases this case it's the call

321
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:46,050
for this in this case then you go to identify contacts and contacts of contacts.

322
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:57,000
So that's the then that's how to, you know, vaccinate all his worst population that could have sustained the transmission.

323
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,700
Then also another important thing is it?

324
00:48:03,990 --> 00:48:09,500
The. Vaccine strength was very potent.

325
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:15,340
So it was an effective and the easier to use vaccine.

326
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:28,040
It doesn't require injecting. It's divisive from bark on the skin then it's vaccinated so that to make you feel good vaccination and.

327
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:35,850
Feasible? Easy. Any questions about smallpox vaccine?

328
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:52,110
I think the smallpox vaccine discussion, the most important from this is the eradicated been what takes to eradicate the disease.

329
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,770
And that's a very important.

330
00:48:56,310 --> 00:48:59,970
This is what takes to eradicate the disease.

331
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:03,750
And then you have to need to sever Poitiers.

332
00:49:04,230 --> 00:49:20,190
And the smallpox had to meet one of the courses, as you know, VAX, we always say VAX VAX is allergies that interesting in this field?

333
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:26,880
As you can see here, it would definitely involve people with very different backgrounds.

334
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:31,380
When you do epidemiology, you need the public health commissioner.

335
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,800
You need to do the diagnosis. You need to do to basically the scientists to develop a vaccine.

336
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:44,230
So that's it's a successful story and for us to remember.

337
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:51,030
You another quick question. It's a little I've tried, but what?

338
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:54,660
Because I know we still get vaccinated against chicken pox and I know.

339
00:49:55,970 --> 00:50:00,560
Small part of what makes it so that the virus is.

340
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,960
You mean why we couldn't get rid of the chickenpox?

341
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:16,120
Word to you? Of course.

342
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:20,350
We had a very potent system for smallpox.

343
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:27,910
And the human is the only risk for the chickenpox.

344
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:36,090
You may look into the first one and also at another.

345
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:53,240
We save the pool, identify or risk, and there's potentially some overlap with the reservoir and then the vaccination.

346
00:50:53,300 --> 00:51:00,980
Apparently, smallpox was very chickenpox was not on the eradication of polio.

347
00:51:01,160 --> 00:51:05,220
It's the second. You know.

348
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:12,370
Yeah. Of course. You're always looking to when you want to ask a question.

349
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:18,250
You're always looking to these three requirements, at least the first.

350
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:26,520
If you are able to pull out the transmission from all the rest.

351
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:37,520
Yeah. You want to see? Polio virus.

352
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:46,670
It's and we all familiar it's enterovirus three serotypes.

353
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:50,900
This is a little bit more complicated. One, two, three.

354
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,880
Minimal. Patra typical immunity among serotypes.

355
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:02,040
This means you need a specific neutralizing antibody for each type.

356
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:08,600
And if you only have one vaccine, which is smallpox, this was not.

357
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:14,179
We supported three serotypes, not two, but we were somewhere.

358
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:19,550
Talk about pneumococcal vaccine.

359
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:30,290
Given the fact you have over 200 serotypes here, we'll talk, obviously, and the fact that they don't overlap.

360
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:36,920
That means that when you develop a vaccine, you need to have very specific.

361
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:42,500
One of the course is the basis for immunization.

362
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,770
Definitely it's memory immunity.

363
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:52,520
But when it comes to memory, of course, you can think this memory is very specific.

364
00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:00,350
But the essential first point is memory. My memory is it's remembers the specific context.

365
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:06,350
Okay. So memory is the primary basis for.

366
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:15,950
Vaccines and a rapidly inactivated by heat formula from ultraviolet light.

367
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:30,020
So these are the some conditions also make the possibility of making inactivated polio vaccine possible.

368
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:35,750
Epidemiology you can see risk one only risk for human.

369
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:52,340
So these make. It's possible to identify since this is identified as human and only one then pull out of the transmission.

370
00:53:52,910 --> 00:54:01,850
You know, the passage in from all of us will become more easier and the community capability is highly infectious.

371
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:11,210
We are highly infectious. You could actually expect to have more for the vaccine impact.

372
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:23,090
However, if it's not a highly infectious to person, to person or indirectly you mean to mass and direct or direct indirect protection.

373
00:54:23,090 --> 00:54:30,860
We're all relatively less the more transmissible from human to human.

374
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:41,720
The likelihood that you can develop, you can expect to have some impact if you have good vaccine, of course.

375
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:49,610
And then 7 to 10 days before onset this most the community people what does

376
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:57,889
that mean to you when it comes to infectious disease epidemiology is this very

377
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:03,900
challenge when you know because you don't really see them right and you don't

378
00:55:04,070 --> 00:55:12,200
prepare and a lot of the time you start to mask when you have a positive test,

379
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:22,220
you have the symptoms. But before and since this is why it's so highly infectious,

380
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:33,320
because the you are not just to get infection from the active case, you also get infection from the asymptomatic people.

381
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:37,100
This is a way for any infectious diseases research.

382
00:55:37,610 --> 00:55:42,050
You want to assess the asymptomatic people.

383
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:49,430
Plays a role in transmission. This is also where impact your vaccine design.

384
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,390
How do you do that? Do you kind of think about that?

385
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:06,960
We talk about, you know, study and vaccine efficacy and how you measure infection and disease and you

386
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:14,270
measure the number of incidents reduced by vaccine or by indirect protection,

387
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:23,540
but maybe for a disease that has pre assets and high communicative entity.

388
00:56:23,990 --> 00:56:31,480
You may also want to put your outcome measurement and not just as symptomatic of disease.

389
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:42,170
You may also want to see how, for example, polio vaccine has reduced to the number of asymptomatic cases.

390
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:48,920
Then you should have. Not only your outcome for measure efficacy would be slightly different.

391
00:56:49,700 --> 00:57:00,980
This would be something you could improve of use tempered pessimistic in summer compared to commit those season of person in short.

392
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:06,410
Yeah I always you all pretty much in most of you.

393
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:14,720
If not I talked about how epidemiology or inference of vaccine development.

394
00:57:15,110 --> 00:57:16,820
Here you can see, for example,

395
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:30,470
what we learned to is epidemiology where allow us to make rational development will allow us to think about what to measure,

396
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:34,160
what to screen for in our clinical trials.

397
00:57:34,610 --> 00:57:39,070
So this is an example, obviously, you see.

398
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:45,250
Yeah. It's entering two months. Why this matters?

399
00:57:46,090 --> 00:57:54,790
Does this the characteristics has any implication for vaccine development where you enter?

400
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:08,140
Just to education, I guess. I mean, like the the attenuated the vaccine is an oral vaccine.

401
00:58:09,510 --> 00:58:13,110
Which means they always have that power. Exactly.

402
00:58:13,350 --> 00:58:16,770
Yeah. Thank you. Yes, there is.

403
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:26,940
One belief is if you can win the back, back, if you your vaccination, you can mimic the natural infection.

404
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:33,210
It may have the best impact because of this.

405
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:39,680
You know, you were benefits from local you actually polio vaccine is exactly like that.

406
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:45,390
When you have the life vaccine, it's already taken.

407
00:58:45,810 --> 00:58:51,510
So it can develop to some intestinal mucosal immunity.

408
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:58,200
That's where it protects against the nature of the infection.

409
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:05,920
With the polio come into mouth, going to your replicate, you found your GI tract and that's the normal path.

410
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:09,300
That's why oral polio vaccine,

411
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:22,410
which is so widely used still as one of the major of use that you know well that why would the transmission still exist and injected one

412
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:35,850
has advantages not causing for vaccine associates of a paradoxical disease that it doesn't quite eat as much local as oral vaccine.

413
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:46,350
That's why it depends on where you are how high the risk for being exposed to nature of infection you were have different.

414
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:53,630
The for the vaccine clinic.

415
00:59:53,640 --> 01:00:01,410
The incubation time was very long then subclinical without symptoms, but infectious.

416
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:05,110
This is why it's a highly communicable disease here.

417
01:00:05,130 --> 01:00:10,950
Mostly it's the clinical information you can I probably we're not first of all, it's too much.

418
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:17,400
But as you can see, one of the very is for long.

419
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:27,850
So in the portfolio history is people when the paramount is in their chest muscle beneath the iron,

420
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:37,740
that creates a difference of pressure so that their phrase can be intense.

421
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:41,880
This is our, for example, here.

422
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:48,220
So Ireland wards up to somewhere in California back in 1953.

423
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:58,770
And the history of polio in industrial countries, one of the most feared disease in the early 20th century.

424
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:09,359
A lot of people get paralyzed and it's out of control in fifties and sixties in developing

425
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:16,920
countries not being recognized as a major public health problem here the 1970s.

426
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:20,500
So much so this tells you our our.

427
01:01:21,270 --> 01:01:29,700
No, not all the older population have been exposed to of getting cancer at the same time.

428
01:01:30,270 --> 01:01:42,960
So they may then the epidemic of this disease may not have been picked up in every population at the same time.

429
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:51,420
This means that a different state, if depends on which is stage, who this population is for.

430
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:58,940
In fact, for a given disease, May needs the defensive strategies for these two.

431
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:07,380
Routine immunization was introduced worldwide as part of national immunization programs in the 1970s.

432
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:10,920
So it's much, much less than in the countries.

433
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:15,340
And, of course, the polio vaccine.

434
01:02:15,870 --> 01:02:27,749
And so development and you can talk about the polio vaccine without thinking about the whole thing,

435
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:35,130
about helping who made a significant contribution to the vaccine development.

436
01:02:35,190 --> 01:02:40,260
Why secured essentially a whole killed vaccine shock vaccine?

437
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:48,990
And later, a seven vaccine was live attenuated or a polio vaccine that made the vaccination.

438
01:02:49,380 --> 01:03:02,640
Of course, the administration the problem is it may cause polio in some recipient and also can evolve into transmissible variants of the virus.

439
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:13,350
This is another important point to to note is when we see a pioneer, it's a relatively concept.

440
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:21,780
It's a depends on the recipient. It also may depends on the condition you how you keep your vaccine.

441
01:03:22,710 --> 01:03:37,800
And to repeat you the animal. The passage of vaccine sometimes could also reply to opinions backs, and it could also go either way.

442
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:52,250
So the experimental conditions which make a vaccine attenuated strain change to more viral type like or sometimes it could also be less potent.

443
01:03:52,740 --> 01:04:00,350
Depends what condition. So this has some of the activates.

444
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:09,790
The polio vaccine was used widely and the first successful vaccine was a lance that I

445
01:04:09,790 --> 01:04:18,990
think you I come here on the stage by Dr. comes Francis from chair of our department.

446
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:25,240
So that was very successful story.

447
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:32,310
Then another version enhanced the IPV introduced in 1987.

448
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:38,670
The can is more potent and it's grew in human cell culture.

449
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:51,000
This was an advancement in food from, you know, monkey is cell culture and then it has also greater antigenic content than the original vaccine.

450
01:04:51,270 --> 01:05:00,870
So you can see the same type of vaccine that has concerns of defensive different culture matures,

451
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,520
which you definitely have impact on the potency of the vaccine.

452
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:12,950
But then all three of polio vaccine was developed later by Dr. Roberts itself.

453
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:27,030
This basically is has the virus in monkey continues if you see the cells and the that's the reduce the violence of polio vaccine.

454
01:05:29,830 --> 01:05:34,690
Several different types have been developed and into the reason.

455
01:05:35,110 --> 01:05:39,190
Later on you can see the pass.

456
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:47,670
First they had four packets and two packs of those three, but they are made some more.

457
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:52,030
What exactly is means? You have to have two different boxes.

458
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:55,780
Each box only contains one, Sarah.

459
01:05:56,530 --> 01:06:00,850
Then later they added another one.

460
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:12,700
Based on epidemiology studies and with the advancement of technology, you could make all three in one vaccine.

461
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:19,150
It's a tricky balance. Then why later become vibrant again?

462
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:30,070
This is based on your gender and it's based on the epidemiology findings.

463
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:35,320
So you can see how epidemiology impacts the vaccine design.

464
01:06:36,070 --> 01:06:41,770
This also means you have to constantly searching for that, right?

465
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,680
So immunogenicity and of vaccine efficacy.

466
01:06:48,310 --> 01:06:53,110
Um, this is basically the measure of immunity.

467
01:06:53,560 --> 01:07:00,460
This would have been caught in today's terminology or b immunogenicity trial,

468
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,710
which means you don't necessarily measure how many disease cases rebound.

469
01:07:06,370 --> 01:07:18,910
You measure your immunity neutralizing antibody production if you don't know what's the active immunity.

470
01:07:19,090 --> 01:07:28,480
Are you able to just based baseline immunity, generosity of results to determine if the vaccine were protective or not?

471
01:07:31,490 --> 01:07:37,990
That's the precondition for using immunogenicity as a.

472
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:44,610
Proxy or surrogate marker for advocacy.

473
01:07:50,210 --> 01:08:00,700
Think about it, we talk over immunogenicity. It's not or immune response generated by vaccine is necessarily protective immunity.

474
01:08:00,730 --> 01:08:12,800
Right. So if you know for this passage, this particular antibody represents the protective immunity, then it's possible to use that.

475
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:18,590
Otherwise, you need to learn more. You need to collect a lot of the different data.

476
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:27,050
Then finally, you do associate these studies you find which is related to protection.

477
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:36,080
Then you can go to some measure of that to predict if the vaccine where we're protected, that doesn't make sense.

478
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:47,120
So it's not the or immunity. You can you make sure we're telling you if the vaccine would be effective.

479
01:08:47,750 --> 01:08:57,140
You have to know the protection. This is just to just compare the two, you know, with OPV.

480
01:08:57,170 --> 01:09:00,190
That's why you have to want to sort this.

481
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:09,830
This is in a lot of lessons. So one dose may not be enough because it's only 50% developed for that immunity.

482
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:17,690
I want to look forward. And then after three dose, it's gets some.

483
01:09:18,260 --> 01:09:31,790
So what disappears when you want to make your vaccine protective immunity or you have to come to really understand how many doses meet.

484
01:09:36,260 --> 01:09:39,470
This is what is figured.

485
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:52,490
Health. What does this signal?

486
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:58,910
Tells you this is a case lumber per 100,000 population.

487
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:04,490
This is a time when you can see some public health intervention.

488
01:10:06,050 --> 01:10:28,810
Let's see what this thing could cost you. So which one works the better in terms of reduction of the disease?

489
01:10:32,740 --> 01:10:37,790
We still have the still had it.

490
01:10:38,350 --> 01:10:42,370
And you can see before the introduction of vaccine.

491
01:10:44,910 --> 01:10:48,660
The trend is high, right? The trend is high.

492
01:10:49,080 --> 01:10:58,500
No significant change. But immediately after the introduction of the IPB, it has a big, big reduction,

493
01:10:58,860 --> 01:11:08,910
but it's constantly coming down and the slope is probably not so sharp, as you can see here.

494
01:11:09,630 --> 01:11:16,260
After all, we have vaccine introduced. You really have Wall Street go into.

495
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,590
So it's more if effective.

496
01:11:20,850 --> 01:11:27,390
An oral polio vaccine when you have more wild type transmission.

497
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:39,030
But the, you know, polio vaccine also oral is very effective.

498
01:11:39,480 --> 01:11:48,600
But the IPV has been increased since 1996 because of the reduction of disease.

499
01:11:48,720 --> 01:12:00,190
You don't we always talk about risk benefit assessments which you out which you make the decision so

500
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:07,890
important to reduce the risk of vaccine associated with continuing risk to contacts of OPV recipient.

501
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:14,040
If you even contact you could potentially. Used.

502
01:12:14,370 --> 01:12:17,760
And then eventually it's completely.

503
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,600
You know, removed from the vaccination program.

504
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:29,270
However, OPV should be used only in special circumstance.

505
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:34,340
When you try to fight endemic countries.

506
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:41,890
Where have that achieving certification of global polio eradication was?

507
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:55,250
This goal was made two decades ago, finalized in 1907, but currently is not to eradicate.

508
01:12:55,940 --> 01:13:08,720
So what you need to is eradication have to meet all these quick here's certification of polio races coming back to the regional basis.

509
01:13:09,410 --> 01:13:18,530
If you come to the you know to fall to each region can concede the certification only when

510
01:13:18,530 --> 01:13:26,320
all countries in that region demonstrate the absence of wild the polio vaccine transmission.

511
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:37,010
Here we see transmission. If it's only one sporadic case, no transmission, then you're aware that the society concedes.

512
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:43,670
This will also have to have, for consistency, three consecutive years.

513
01:13:44,060 --> 01:13:48,590
This is quite clear that the needs to be kind of.

514
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:56,120
Then the next few slides. Is this the Global Polio Eradication Initiative?

515
01:13:56,690 --> 01:14:03,600
You could go to look at this website and to see the latest.

516
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:12,720
The. Activities involves tens of thousands of volunteers in this program.

517
01:14:14,460 --> 01:14:21,740
Yeah. But what's the quality important to know?

518
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:29,780
Is this a full planned youth strategy? So vaccination, immunization for disease eradication.

519
01:14:30,050 --> 01:14:37,780
It's not just the one where they have so many different arms.

520
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:43,280
Under this global polio eradication initiative.

521
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:49,010
Basically it's you have for infant immunization.

522
01:14:49,730 --> 01:15:00,620
And you also have a national immunization days, like going everywhere, like those where this is a handful of, you know, some active surveillance.

523
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:04,940
This is the most important surveillance without the surveillance.

524
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:15,350
You come to develop too important a strategy, like if you want to mop up, want to do the run run vaccination.

525
01:15:16,370 --> 01:15:27,230
Taking the lesson from smallpox, if you don't have a surveillance, you don't know where the wild polio is present,

526
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:38,630
then you were a B you know, not be possible to identify the last the cases.

527
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:43,860
That's why this even more for campaign is also very important.

528
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:55,939
Basically once a tool by tool and the time to find the cases the purpose that you could look I wear a script that associates

529
01:15:55,940 --> 01:16:07,550
paramount disease this is you all know right now there's research ongoing research on vaccine derived polio virus.

530
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,220
This is a very important.

531
01:16:09,860 --> 01:16:22,970
And then today, you know when the disease is almost eradicate, any paranoid disease caused by vaccine would not be acceptable.

532
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:31,100
So a lot of the research on this area that's now that's awful.

533
01:16:31,370 --> 01:16:36,200
We don't have time to discuss no further. This person here.

534
01:16:38,770 --> 01:16:45,940
I can make one slides and put that on to send you into your answer as a homework.

535
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:50,600
We were just doing this. What are the lessons we can also break?

536
01:16:50,750 --> 01:16:55,550
Come back to start with, this has the next set for less.

537
01:16:56,550 --> 01:17:04,170
Some people think the 2 minutes of break and come back to answer this question.

538
01:17:06,170 --> 01:17:24,570
You started discussing. I need to remember to turn on my phone.

539
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:34,990
I also is. So show me.

540
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:53,070
Hello. Sorry.

541
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:54,510
Just give me 1/2.
