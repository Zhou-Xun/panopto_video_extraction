1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:08,300
had a better record yes

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:13,400
and redoing it. I don't

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,060
know if you should I select wrong one.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,260
if you change it for PDF it. what is the beauty okay.

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:31,740
alright so weird to return us into

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:37,740
else you go to Maryland.

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,980
you know

8
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:49,360
with a matter of fact we kind of hot

9
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,660
or not. I think in doing another part of him maybe and then later the other file

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,085
gotta check it out right. keeping that this

11
00:01:01,085 --> 00:01:08,385
is the recording I know I already started thinking in terms

12
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:13,985
history. there's the one you really look for my ten last

13
00:01:13,985 --> 00:01:20,425
week. yes jobs or anything else.

14
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:25,825
we're so early. okay. sorry. out um

15
00:01:25,825 --> 00:01:31,365
like right here such as heck he was down the street who would bring back you in the month.

16
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:37,965
so we need to have a much time and

17
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:43,585
stuff people now my my search

18
00:01:43,585 --> 00:01:48,925
and yeah there are people so I know

19
00:01:48,925 --> 00:01:56,245
right. perfect will be here and they're gonna go and

20
00:01:56,245 --> 00:02:03,769
he will talk about your mother that she's going to pack an hour

21
00:02:03,769 --> 00:02:09,649
I think one of

22
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:20,769
the things the

23
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:26,009
service and my string around and stuff

24
00:02:26,009 --> 00:02:31,289
they put him in show like whatever the best time picture love I love the ring. yeah

25
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:36,829
that's really cool yeah it's quite Friday. bye.

26
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:43,989
Arial gonna be. okay

27
00:02:43,989 --> 00:02:49,149
so um ideally you would stop at

28
00:02:49,149 --> 00:02:54,809
the same time like for Nextel. my question is

29
00:02:54,809 --> 00:03:00,049
do I mean the size of US. yeah and I said I do people and it is

30
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:05,357
great if people have questions. talk about name my comes up. yes

31
00:03:05,357 --> 00:03:10,457
I was home and uh and um yes

32
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:15,637
and then again we'll do the flower water area. so a lot of

33
00:03:15,637 --> 00:03:20,877
throughout the end

34
00:03:20,877 --> 00:03:30,917
we but do kind of have to end up on the claim because there

35
00:03:30,917 --> 00:03:39,977
so. I lean holder sleep with the second.

36
00:03:39,977 --> 00:03:46,537
there's a lot of new things.

37
00:03:46,537 --> 00:03:51,817
you if need to come up. my number I haven't

38
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:56,817
seen terrible think say we can break even if any major equipment at

39
00:03:56,817 --> 00:04:11,480
all of the family. okay.

40
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:18,540
files yeah

41
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:32,260
yeah and

42
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,340
the reason I didn't say anything about nothing. no I didn't do

43
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:49,320
I think um genre you

44
00:04:49,320 --> 00:05:05,137
know

45
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:39,517
I don't

46
00:05:39,517 --> 00:05:47,557
here I mean

47
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:52,797
they're better.

48
00:05:52,797 --> 00:06:00,197
if I'm not sure if I not afraid to

49
00:06:00,197 --> 00:06:07,595
go to always you could join them

50
00:06:07,595 --> 00:06:12,855
whom are I mean we're gonna go ahead and start it even though we seem

51
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:18,075
to still be straddling Michigan time but we're gonna get started almost

52
00:06:18,075 --> 00:06:23,215
on time today so it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers today Doctor Evans

53
00:06:23,215 --> 00:06:28,535
cannot he joins us from Ohio State university

54
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:33,715
where it apparently did not snow as much as it did here at

55
00:06:33,715 --> 00:06:38,907
Doctor doctor can did his training at Harvard and then a postdoc

56
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:44,187
at the University of Washington 's from there he went to the university

57
00:06:44,187 --> 00:06:49,427
of Florida where if his appointment wasn't bio statistics and

58
00:06:49,427 --> 00:06:54,967
I like this name. the emerging top Christian institute very cool name

59
00:06:54,967 --> 00:07:00,167
and so even though the doctor can I did his PhD in epidemiology has really

60
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:05,547
transitioned to have a heavy focus and by us to test text and fact in his appointment

61
00:07:05,547 --> 00:07:11,307
at um the Ohio State univ in Doha.

62
00:07:11,307 --> 00:07:16,647
I worked done saying that a lot. is really largely and

63
00:07:16,647 --> 00:07:22,347
ad by the statistics his work is largely focused around the collar

64
00:07:22,347 --> 00:07:27,767
Ebola and obviously studying infectious disease

65
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:32,927
epidemiology and applying thoughtfully applying via statistics tools

66
00:07:32,927 --> 00:07:38,142
to those questions um another fun fact which I really like

67
00:07:38,142 --> 00:07:43,242
and I hope so can if I share is that he speaks Bengali. having

68
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:48,362
spent kind of collectively five years in Bangladesh. he met his wife there at

69
00:07:48,362 --> 00:07:54,562
the time we neither he he did not speak Bengali and she's English.

70
00:07:54,562 --> 00:07:59,922
said they have worked that out if I see

71
00:07:59,922 --> 00:08:05,442
today. he'll talk about and by the statistics and the epidemiologic methods

72
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:14,142
for infectious disease transmission sage I mean a lot.

73
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:19,582
okay. so yeah I mean I'm gonna talk about um finding infectious

74
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:24,622
disease transmission and the basic problem is is

75
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:29,722
that the transmission causes dependent happening. so you know if we forgot about

76
00:08:29,722 --> 00:08:34,742
heart attacks or cancer it's reasonable that my heart attack cancer doesn't affect your heart attack

77
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:40,332
time together or even if we live in down with the or news condition the way it depends conditional

78
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:45,452
on being in some room the outcomes are independent fire and infectious diseases

79
00:08:45,452 --> 00:08:50,572
that the dependence is just there you can't condition it away. you you

80
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:55,852
you just have to to plow through. so and I don't complain

81
00:08:55,852 --> 00:09:01,192
I'm I'm going to you know in three ways and it's you know the problem

82
00:09:01,192 --> 00:09:06,352
is been approach but I I'm gonna start my thing ever you don't really miss you know distinguished tradition and infectious

83
00:09:06,352 --> 00:09:11,372
disease epidemiology so you you guys don't make these mistakes but

84
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:16,612
it's interesting to talk about then because it it doesn't seem why they don't work

85
00:09:16,612 --> 00:09:22,912
because they're they're kind of you know given that it's a really difficult problem I need either not completely

86
00:09:22,912 --> 00:09:28,032
unreasonable so grandma about analyzing susceptibility only. so we we only know

87
00:09:28,032 --> 00:09:33,492
we look at like that the time until you get infected. um you know we we treat infectious

88
00:09:33,492 --> 00:09:38,586
diseases like we were treating any other movies um

89
00:09:38,586 --> 00:09:44,026
do you get slightly more things to go down the suburbs then when you're the spread of these the branching process over in a branching

90
00:09:44,026 --> 00:09:49,346
process you have you know it's it's a model for the growth of population so you have an animal and then

91
00:09:49,346 --> 00:09:54,666
spring and there's a certain distribution to the number of spring and then those offspring of offspring

92
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:59,706
and so you can talk about things like that the population become infinite or not so you know we

93
00:09:59,706 --> 00:10:04,706
in the ranching process we have an infectious people giving rise to infect

94
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:09,966
people and so on and so. so and then then we have a generation your roles

95
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:15,286
which which are made ages which faces person just for two

96
00:10:15,286 --> 00:10:20,326
people. yeah. under infection in the household contacts and then the index

97
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:25,606
case and this this really is this is a solution to the problem but that

98
00:10:25,606 --> 00:10:30,746
we often snatch defeat from the driver victory and the methods that are used

99
00:10:30,746 --> 00:10:36,146
to analyze these studies. so each feeling initially way. so handle extensibility

100
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:41,748
I basically ignoring the fact that it's transmitted and just hoping for the best. um

101
00:10:41,748 --> 00:10:46,868
so first of all of that. if you can't look at effect on infections and so I need a vaccine might

102
00:10:46,868 --> 00:10:51,888
actually care what the effects on infections that might be an important part of its impact on

103
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:57,068
public health. um. if the treatment is assisted with exposure to infection. estimated

104
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:02,108
effect on susceptibility can be biased and and it's actually worse than that there's a nice paper by a more

105
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:07,248
than of had come and force Crawford where they show even if you randomize treatment and

106
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:12,468
affect on the infections and other people can cause a bias in the end

107
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:18,188
risk ratio or hydration that used estimate and effect on susceptibility so. so there's there's

108
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:24,068
there's a problem out. I was getting by it even in your estimate of susceptibility is is a serious one.

109
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:29,068
so now I I'm gonna if we choose not to

110
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:34,208
completely ignore the spread of infection. we can we talk about branching process approximation

111
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:39,348
and so they're choosing better news here. one is. generation involved. this is like the time the

112
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:44,348
person I guess infected the time of person Jake it's affected the time between the inside and

113
00:11:44,348 --> 00:11:50,362
I expect yeah and then there's like a servant coiled in that sense

114
00:11:50,362 --> 00:11:55,562
um past a generation of people. if I look at the same time on that they have an exhumation. the time between

115
00:11:55,562 --> 00:12:00,602
the and on sizes and the cereal. so if I don't think about these is that they often

116
00:12:00,602 --> 00:12:07,162
will build them in different generation and like well if you know so let's.

117
00:12:07,162 --> 00:12:12,342
which is okay. if they do you mission. has no concept been

118
00:12:12,342 --> 00:12:18,162
deemed you the same thing and all is well. but there's there's

119
00:12:18,162 --> 00:12:23,202
an interesting problem with the folks. this is a branching process. so yeah this

120
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:28,382
is infected person the system. you know the very other people and this guy affects one person

121
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:33,422
in this guy next to people and so on there are those susceptible

122
00:12:33,422 --> 00:12:38,502
people. there's no time that anybody's been asked to risk of infection and not to

123
00:12:38,502 --> 00:12:43,522
you. I mean you you copies of it when you are and

124
00:12:43,522 --> 00:12:48,564
that's that's not how epidemics actually for I most of there I there could be

125
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:54,164
some epidemic that's like vertically transmitted where they should be okay but in movies

126
00:12:54,164 --> 00:12:59,244
that were interested in the infection spreads through the population that already exists

127
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:04,244
and the fact that some people are exposed to infection but not affected the fact that some people take

128
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:11,172
a long time to be infected versus the short time to be infected. that's carried information about transmission

129
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:16,612
so the other thing is if said I said there was a probably weak condition on the fact that I faxed

130
00:13:16,612 --> 00:13:22,792
Jay and actually part of the big think it's somewhat subtle problem

131
00:13:22,792 --> 00:13:28,452
which is that that time. can't stay the same like if he's been transmitted

132
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:33,492
the person who can affect you. the first person who makes infectious contact.

133
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:38,632
so if I'm exposed to more than one infectious person like you know you can run an experiment real I

134
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:43,892
mean like you all been in Texas versus so I I'm and I'm walking in the room with the susceptible

135
00:13:43,892 --> 00:13:49,572
printer and see how long it takes me to inspect them. now if we make two copies of me

136
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:55,452
is time that infection gonna go up or down. what do you think

137
00:13:55,452 --> 00:14:00,452
you have to he said it wanna be I might find him twice

138
00:14:00,452 --> 00:14:05,452
and then fax it. so that that time goes down in the prettier so I

139
00:14:05,452 --> 00:14:11,179
racing the other copy me to infect you and the person who wins is the person who'd be in fact

140
00:14:11,179 --> 00:14:16,659
so if you try to actually track a serious closer generation people of and

141
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:22,199
and an epidemic you'll do they drop something go back over here you know and sometimes they just crash.

142
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:27,299
this is this is our two three or the contraption can

143
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:32,559
be quite significant. so that the serial intervals here less than half

144
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:37,719
like they are at the beginning. so I

145
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:42,979
mean how do think the one. really look only infected susceptibility

146
00:14:42,979 --> 00:14:48,319
and and then another one I can't look at you know it can look at effectiveness because it never measured it and

147
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:53,499
the other method can look at sort of look at in effectiveness they can look at susceptibility

148
00:14:53,499 --> 00:14:58,719
can susceptible people don't exist um and then I just wanna say like with the multi

149
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:04,059
time range or even imagine in a brand-new process approximation could handle infection by having like a multi

150
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:09,079
type process and you know some people have more offspring than other people but then you

151
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:15,743
have this problem of denominator so all having more offspring of a particular type you know might mean

152
00:15:15,743 --> 00:15:21,043
every year we look at susceptibility and a bridging presence model having worked for the particular type that could

153
00:15:21,043 --> 00:15:26,443
represent greater susceptibility of that type or can represent the fact that there are more of that type of person

154
00:15:26,443 --> 00:15:31,983
exposed to infections because you don't have nominated you can't identify which of those two possibilities

155
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:37,063
happens. so I also say the transmission attempt to capture exposure to

156
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:42,403
infection infection and susceptibility and they can successfully

157
00:15:42,403 --> 00:15:47,603
do this but we often do studies

158
00:15:47,603 --> 00:15:52,783
are often analyzed by and that you a way that contribute to all. infections among

159
00:15:52,783 --> 00:15:58,063
susceptible than the household to the original index case. so this

160
00:15:58,063 --> 00:16:03,563
I knew make this assumption because if we cannot use the standard regression model again I think we're we're not back

161
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:08,883
you know we we we limited ourselves to a hospital but now we can use our cocks aggression religious

162
00:16:08,883 --> 00:16:14,335
aggression analyze that all comes in susceptible individuals in the household

163
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:19,335
and we can look at susceptibility in fact using the cougars the susceptible individuals and we can

164
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:25,155
look at infections was affected in the coefficients of the various index cases.

165
00:16:25,155 --> 00:16:30,155
but I want I just wanna say sometimes especially since I'm here is used to

166
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:36,915
screen time chain binomial models to analyze these you know avoid all the problems and I'm about to complain about

167
00:16:36,915 --> 00:16:43,055
sex and I think I didn't carefully conditions on exposure to infection.

168
00:16:43,055 --> 00:16:48,555
so that the intuition behind ignoring multiple generations

169
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:53,755
of transmission in the household is that if if the probably the transmission is Pete. then the probability

170
00:16:53,755 --> 00:16:59,255
of a chain of length two 's P squared the probably the change you know given chain of like three speech

171
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:04,335
you. so you know. usually like five percent. like you know that a lot of us is

172
00:17:04,335 --> 00:17:09,435
they get do in them like five percent seven percent so five been squared five percent cube is really

173
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:14,831
small I see think it'd probably be the big change they they drop off really quickly so it's safe

174
00:17:14,831 --> 00:17:19,971
to only look at one generation of transmission. however in

175
00:17:19,971 --> 00:17:24,971
the house especially larger household. the number of chains a given length is

176
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:30,071
going really fast so so actually the probably multiple generations of infection is decaying

177
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:35,191
much more slowly and you would think based on Peter the case and you can

178
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:40,311
look at even look at the so this is this is the secondary attack free which I

179
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:45,351
I that's the transition probability given that I'm in fact infected household member with

180
00:17:45,351 --> 00:17:50,731
the probabilities that I make if I I mean you Honda maybe I don't affect

181
00:17:50,731 --> 00:17:55,731
you they're maybe affected already by the time I do but the problem that I mean contact is

182
00:17:55,731 --> 00:18:01,671
the secondary impact the final and top rated one of the household of the never runs to completion.

183
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:06,771
what's the proportion in effect. so there's there's a line you can't really

184
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:12,193
there's a lot of quality thing. you can see yeah this is this is for free person household

185
00:18:12,193 --> 00:18:18,613
this is for over the who's for my proposal so that's the fact there's a lot of

186
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:24,233
really does impact probably affected in the houses and it's not

187
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:30,473
okay. well only to assume that there's only one generation of transmission.

188
00:18:30,473 --> 00:18:35,553
your year you'll overestimate the second tax rate

189
00:18:35,553 --> 00:18:41,373
and your confidence interval coverage probably will have extremely low coverage problems.

190
00:18:41,373 --> 00:18:47,813
your confidence intervals will have extremely little coverage problem. so

191
00:18:47,813 --> 00:18:53,033
see the solution that that I was I'm advocating for

192
00:18:53,033 --> 00:18:58,873
infections in transmission is he is a contact with it borrows elements of each of these other three

193
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:04,113
approaches. so your generation and your most trying to use sort of a failure time distribution to

194
00:19:04,113 --> 00:19:09,133
to summarize the transmission. but they ran the problem with the men's moving condition on transmission

195
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:14,189
of infection so what if we don't do that. so we don't do that we get something that I

196
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:19,309
call the contact interval. so the comment for mileage and time for me. I'm for the effectiveness and I

197
00:19:19,309 --> 00:19:25,109
have until infectious contact with Jay. infectious contact here mean

198
00:19:25,109 --> 00:19:30,709
James will be infected by I at that time. if they still susceptible

199
00:19:30,709 --> 00:19:37,349
game I I've already been infected in which case they're not infected at that time.

200
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:42,869
so I don't know for kind fun to be sufficient to affect James changes. so

201
00:19:42,869 --> 00:19:49,403
you know we were looking at. I'm kind of infection has two infectious contact

202
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:54,743
no this is a lot of of nine properties so one thing my care about is the transmission problem

203
00:19:54,743 --> 00:20:00,643
your second or a tax rate so that's that's out that can be calculated using the

204
00:20:00,643 --> 00:20:06,903
survivor fashion of the content of the infection. of the infectious individual.

205
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:11,983
so if I do remember the household that's the household secondary attack rate we can also defined secondary tax rates

206
00:20:11,983 --> 00:20:17,623
and in other situations where we have the fine population at risk actually

207
00:20:17,623 --> 00:20:23,323
more interesting and finally more style application is looking at instantaneous infection. so

208
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:28,863
you know little we'll talk about it in the profile infection that's curved so in in in Pollard

209
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:34,003
believe it early instructions this is very high and then it drops off your other movies I haven't

210
00:20:34,003 --> 00:20:39,183
an infection it builds up and then drops off a lot of affection. miles of constant infections

211
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:44,483
and so it's like somebody switches on a line then and switches it off. um. so then turned

212
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:50,124
out that had function I the contact under the submission is the instantaneous

213
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:55,344
infection and then. so next people sometime scales

214
00:20:55,344 --> 00:21:00,644
in Texas gonna in fact of the current infectious profile and fishing then sometimes people skills have a gerbil one

215
00:21:00,644 --> 00:21:05,664
sometimes have in your goals are not but in the case of the house functions of the value

216
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:13,284
of that function. actually has meaning in terms of instantaneous infections.

217
00:21:13,284 --> 00:21:18,364
so and a lot of way for this idea of a contact and it will actually kind of hide in plain sight like

218
00:21:18,364 --> 00:21:23,684
a lot of epidemic models are actually specified in terms of contact people tend of think

219
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:29,824
of that in the generation interval. but if you've actually go to figure out what the generation of distribution is

220
00:21:29,824 --> 00:21:35,544
at the beginning because the changes but if you figure what it is in the beginning. it's it's not

221
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:41,884
it's not what they think it's and uh I mean then a network based model

222
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:46,904
like in a permit bartender model on the network you have a constant hazard of infectious contact

223
00:21:46,904 --> 00:21:52,280
across these edges which corresponds an exponential beta contacted

224
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:57,300
distribution and then you can see you know are not then determined by the size waited

225
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:02,520
a for degree and the survival function of the contact and distribution

226
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:07,800
and they say even more interesting in mass action was in the original permanent hundred models of mass action

227
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:12,920
and so the way you you you get from a network model to mass action models you have

228
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:19,040
more more connections and those smaller and smaller as an transmission across each edge. so

229
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:24,060
we are having the sort of inversely proportional to to somehow

230
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:29,200
and then this is what is it large. the number effects contents

231
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,060
are going to make it be a lot of one hundred age of an integral to have so the number

232
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,780
of infectious context that I'm going to make any mass action models that the chemo deposit function

233
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:46,060
of the contact and double distribution and and this is this actually related to something that

234
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,702
sort of in basic survival analysis but it is often not top which is that

235
00:22:51,702 --> 00:22:57,102
the things you mother pass function as an aging interpretation in terms of the number

236
00:22:57,102 --> 00:23:02,302
of events that you experience. so if if if if you're looking at sort

237
00:23:02,302 --> 00:23:07,682
of a hazard of death overtime you imagine each time I die brought immediately

238
00:23:07,682 --> 00:23:12,682
back to life and I have the same hazard of death that I would have had had I not died

239
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:17,682
and then you keep repeating that that you know you met doing that over and over again and looking at the average

240
00:23:17,682 --> 00:23:22,842
number of deaths think I you know that it has function. so they'll find a way like

241
00:23:22,842 --> 00:23:27,982
to think about it and the mass action model on the network and I have a fixed name. so if

242
00:23:27,982 --> 00:23:33,022
I make multiple affectionate contact with them it doesn't matter and they'll still be affected at the latest. the first

243
00:23:33,022 --> 00:23:38,102
time I make infectious contact but if I'm in mass a action models like I have the edge and the first of the end

244
00:23:38,102 --> 00:23:43,862
always changing each time I make an infectious contact there's a new infection.

245
00:23:43,862 --> 00:23:49,044
so that's why it's the survival function of governing everything on the network but that

246
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:54,244
she will lives have other function is governing the transmission of disease and the mass action and

247
00:23:54,244 --> 00:23:59,504
there's actually extend the abuse the next generation matrices and stuff and all of these things can be defined in terms of cumulative

248
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:04,624
hazard of the underlying contacted distribution. so

249
00:24:04,624 --> 00:24:09,664
this is an example if we look in the classic remember country follow we have minus beta

250
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:14,824
this turned out to be equivalent to contact that's been exponential beta.

251
00:24:14,824 --> 00:24:20,004
so my hasn't been child. my are not the expected value

252
00:24:20,004 --> 00:24:25,524
of the cable faxes.

253
00:24:25,524 --> 00:24:30,764
beta expectation effect. which is bad gap

254
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:36,064
did actually slightly different way than you normally seem to derive are not in the classic

255
00:24:36,064 --> 00:24:42,624
from. okay. so

256
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:48,148
I I hope you know kinda people tell us a lot of useful things about the transmission of disease

257
00:24:48,148 --> 00:24:53,268
they're they're much more useful than generation intervals because we don't condition on on

258
00:24:53,268 --> 00:24:58,788
the transmission of infection but there's a price and the prices censoring

259
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:04,648
so you know here how do I becomes infectious and then I've covered an observation and

260
00:25:04,648 --> 00:25:09,648
so if Jake it's affected in the middle of this interval. if I know the side effects Jay then I

261
00:25:09,648 --> 00:25:14,668
know that I have an uncensored possible. if I know there's somebody else affected Jay that I don't

262
00:25:14,668 --> 00:25:19,928
have a censored. so this can be censored if I recovered from infections

263
00:25:19,928 --> 00:25:25,288
and I have a fence or if I just awful to your observation

264
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:30,648
I think is another reason things convenience so that that's how the sensor contact and

265
00:25:30,648 --> 00:25:35,648
then you can prove it if infection. in the end of observation independently

266
00:25:35,648 --> 00:25:41,188
censor the contract and if I see would make it home. everything becomes

267
00:25:41,188 --> 00:25:46,288
normal survival and everything we do regular survival because it doesn't

268
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:54,598
affect the transmission as long as the format as failure times and error.

269
00:25:54,598 --> 00:26:00,258
so but like you know I I think that the generation people have this very weird thing

270
00:26:00,258 --> 00:26:06,318
to doesn't them you can't Jesus see this is a weird thing. infectious.

271
00:26:06,318 --> 00:26:11,318
and then they censoring the contact. so that's that's why everybody

272
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:16,918
has this you know some some infectious profile and then at the end of infection is just sliced off.

273
00:26:16,918 --> 00:26:22,038
it's very. this is the worst thing about you know just a full

274
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:27,062
disclosure this is the worst thing about the but in practice often than not recommended

275
00:26:27,062 --> 00:26:33,022
in practice. we usually assuming face infections. in which case

276
00:26:33,022 --> 00:26:38,082
it is not really machine. the other defense I have

277
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:43,262
two real classes assumptions you have to move to a you very survival which is possible

278
00:26:43,262 --> 00:26:48,522
but it's much more complex. this is about my life to solve some days but

279
00:26:48,522 --> 00:26:53,822
I know well before I can run and practice this is not as bad

280
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:58,922
thing as it as it is theoretically I would rewrite all the livelihood they

281
00:26:58,922 --> 00:27:04,142
for transmission data using you to contact people so we're gonna look at as a

282
00:27:04,142 --> 00:27:09,642
household with three people. we have cleverly alphabetically

283
00:27:09,642 --> 00:27:14,962
labels and the border of their infection itself. you a infected from

284
00:27:14,962 --> 00:27:20,162
you know the sport from ours or something like that and then you know if you get affected

285
00:27:20,162 --> 00:27:30,027
by hey don't see like think it's affecting both eighty so there's two possible

286
00:27:30,027 --> 00:27:35,087
okay so if I know the transmission trees in the regular survival

287
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:40,287
and also. so I they should be that means the hazard inspection contact from

288
00:27:40,287 --> 00:27:45,427
me should be the time of the. perfect so for

289
00:27:45,427 --> 00:27:50,867
this. it affects both people have I a house or you know they be having a dizzy so I

290
00:27:50,867 --> 00:27:55,887
has hasn't come for me. age is the type that they do that's just the PDA 's probability

291
00:27:55,887 --> 00:28:01,927
density function of the contact distribution. I the AJC that they see

292
00:28:01,927 --> 00:28:08,547
and then I have never seen you could see was exposed to be but not affected by

293
00:28:08,547 --> 00:28:14,347
over here. I have a busy busy busy

294
00:28:14,347 --> 00:28:19,387
and that I've headed because he was exposed today but not in fact.

295
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:24,927
if I don't see one because who I can just add them up. I don't have the money you do that

296
00:28:24,927 --> 00:28:30,249
and then that has determined for each to show the survival term

297
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:35,769
always say the same which is really helpful. um

298
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:41,109
and then for each person not in fact being that effective the only possible source of page we just have any be

299
00:28:41,109 --> 00:28:46,469
here. she's not infected and there were two possible sources so then it just turns into this um. so

300
00:28:46,469 --> 00:28:52,789
you've always end up with a song but the house infection from all of the possible

301
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:57,889
and this could be some over an a holy number of

302
00:28:57,889 --> 00:29:06,929
trees but because it's always factor this way and it's actually really easy to calculate.

303
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:12,749
okay. so now I'm regression models.

304
00:29:12,749 --> 00:29:18,089
so I'm the thing that I said you a lot of questions you want to ask in effect

305
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:23,709
in epidemiology are about the effects of covariance on transmission and my care about

306
00:29:23,709 --> 00:29:31,687
effect on infection my care about the effects on susceptibility so

307
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:36,947
so sorry to feel your time models are models for the range parameter

308
00:29:36,947 --> 00:29:41,987
and have a filter time distribution. is a lot of your model for. 's for the

309
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:47,287
rates and paralyze et cetera your time model look very much like a regular

310
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:52,647
exhilarating failure to model big range parameter

311
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:57,967
for the comment for my DJ there's some baseline rate parameter and then I have

312
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:03,087
a relative freeze. this is this would be like who's been transpose in X

313
00:30:03,087 --> 00:30:08,407
I do that's like a modern range. if

314
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:14,867
the family has exponential that's that's incidence rate.

315
00:30:14,867 --> 00:30:21,627
but there's other years we have a wise on a lot of different mileage and something slightly different

316
00:30:21,627 --> 00:30:27,437
but but in talking to that already. so my beta is

317
00:30:27,437 --> 00:30:32,557
that's unknown an goldfish effective in exile jaded the extra of covariance for the pair

318
00:30:32,557 --> 00:30:37,717
objects and I do not have the big minor friend. so

319
00:30:37,717 --> 00:30:42,757
that's I think it's really uses I finally breaks down into three types of cover.

320
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:47,937
so there is covariance for. I think that effect on those are going for the perfect

321
00:30:47,937 --> 00:30:53,117
infection I didn't check his number one from a change in

322
00:30:53,117 --> 00:30:58,317
the covariance for James bond driver the susceptibility and then I might

323
00:30:58,317 --> 00:31:03,457
have coverage that don't break down and go over for our coverage for with membership in the same

324
00:31:03,457 --> 00:31:08,477
house. you know are they the same news or where the different because that the break down

325
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:14,497
susceptibility those can be included in the corporate sector X IJ

326
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:19,797
and that's the competition and that they are all. 's. Susie internal

327
00:31:19,797 --> 00:31:24,857
transmission. so if I'm looking at the hospital. so you know

328
00:31:24,857 --> 00:31:30,149
I now really you know if I suppose four them are example

329
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:35,409
how are you used to and

330
00:31:35,409 --> 00:31:40,669
then um you see how you need the only possible source of infection a entry fee.

331
00:31:40,669 --> 00:31:45,909
the only possible for the fax eight feet course there there could be people from your

332
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:51,149
fifties outside infection the house could be the pharmacy is not as environmental sources of infection

333
00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:56,309
there there could be people outside the whole page. so it's it's really

334
00:31:56,309 --> 00:32:02,029
important to also include an external transmission model.

335
00:32:02,029 --> 00:32:07,389
so here we have. so I I I do zero truck for the outside

336
00:32:07,389 --> 00:32:12,689
so that is zero okay. so gonna have I paid for the external

337
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:18,149
transmission and uh that might be different you know we might have different severity after transmission

338
00:32:18,149 --> 00:32:23,289
model in terms of transmission and then we have a face fire Ray friends anybody

339
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:29,877
even have different failure type distributions in the internal texture

340
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:35,697
um. so I didn't they we have a coefficient vector we were compared after

341
00:32:35,697 --> 00:32:41,557
um. now that's the very vector if it can't it doesn't really have.

342
00:32:41,557 --> 00:32:46,777
I I can imagine situations and couldn't talk about the facts coverage for really about susceptibility covariance

343
00:32:46,777 --> 00:32:51,917
for Jay and then the question is how

344
00:32:51,917 --> 00:32:57,397
the system both been in Texas that's fine. no I didn't so

345
00:32:57,397 --> 00:33:02,599
the way we moved away we've been both of these together it's weird yeah I mean there's a paranoia

346
00:33:02,599 --> 00:33:08,059
needed from inside the household together with friends you see we have three additional drills

347
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:13,319
those are the time it was a concept that arose for these internal

348
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:19,339
model. so did I don't the know relative times time zero ongoing infection

349
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:24,479
infections number. the extra rows of rid of the absolute

350
00:33:24,479 --> 00:33:29,499
times where we do find the other some beginning of being at risk of infection

351
00:33:29,499 --> 00:33:35,339
I mean the time we identified the house. that's that's the time of year and the infection

352
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:40,859
and external. but if you're not we national have movies together.

353
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:45,959
operate on the comments and other times you know and then I have a very effective

354
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:51,019
the Phillies up union the covariance for invalid answer the them and covariance

355
00:33:51,019 --> 00:33:56,139
it's unique to one model is just a year. so suppose we

356
00:33:56,139 --> 00:34:01,155
can master all together everything well I

357
00:34:01,155 --> 00:34:06,234
mean you need have like what the. I have a different effect of susceptibility

358
00:34:06,234 --> 00:34:11,695
for in the household and external and you can you can include

359
00:34:11,695 --> 00:34:16,854
a interaction term with an indicator of them told me whether this is in general

360
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:23,734
and answer that's a lot of different. so very direct in terms. so

361
00:34:23,734 --> 00:34:28,854
a lot of the besides traction moving to this power point of view a lot of it in terms of just

362
00:34:28,854 --> 00:34:34,155
figuring out how to set them all up and then once you send them out a lot. you can just

363
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:40,175
treat the model the way we treat any other address. it's kinda fun

364
00:34:40,175 --> 00:34:45,314
to verify one of those experiments he spent a really really long time building the apparatus and experiments

365
00:34:45,314 --> 00:34:50,395
over in just a second. so when you got everything set up.

366
00:34:50,395 --> 00:34:55,415
you know I guess if it's really quickly and and you can interpret things largely the way you would

367
00:34:55,415 --> 00:35:01,722
interpret them in a regular regression models so to test this model.

368
00:35:01,722 --> 00:35:07,882
we did ten thousand network based simulation for each of these five

369
00:35:07,882 --> 00:35:13,002
concepts of distribution and either the baseline distribution so there's doesn't been modified by

370
00:35:13,002 --> 00:35:18,422
the effect you know they're they're sort of stretched out from by the effects of the covariance

371
00:35:18,422 --> 00:35:23,542
and I had an external infection how the constant hazard of

372
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:28,642
infection from outside the house and infections. 's fixed a one time

373
00:35:28,642 --> 00:35:33,902
you know. so any simulation we have it under

374
00:35:33,902 --> 00:35:39,502
him to network that was three three hundred. I'm connected household size six

375
00:35:39,502 --> 00:35:44,742
and then once uh once a infection occurred in the household. other members

376
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:50,522
of the house over at risk of book infection from within the household and from outside the house

377
00:35:50,522 --> 00:35:55,522
and each individual was assigned signed binary code. zero one which is all

378
00:35:55,522 --> 00:36:01,428
independent. probably one half of the one and then I have

379
00:36:01,428 --> 00:36:06,489
near a parameter which just of a different section of times.

380
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:11,489
it might be a different dependability the married and Jay and

381
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:16,928
then this is the um. this is so I'm not able to do that. that's

382
00:36:16,928 --> 00:36:22,108
just in general I so have a long internal base

383
00:36:22,108 --> 00:36:28,769
rate and then I can hear that's the services next but extra.

384
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:34,049
so true value so the true values these are independent random samples from a uniform distribution

385
00:36:34,049 --> 00:36:39,148
of minus one two one. so we got fifty thousand emulation and then we're going

386
00:36:39,148 --> 00:36:45,249
to you on the simulation in differently.

387
00:36:45,249 --> 00:36:50,568
so because one of the things I I know I there is an epidemiologic

388
00:36:50,568 --> 00:36:55,668
study design and the title of the stuff I'm sorry a lot of regression models but you

389
00:36:55,668 --> 00:37:01,271
know the Russian model is only as good as the data that you put into it and

390
00:37:01,271 --> 00:37:06,331
so we look at two sort of salad epidemiologic studies one of the complete court so

391
00:37:06,331 --> 00:37:11,891
I just I watched everybody from time here. this is a service commission

392
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:16,891
here we followed all a few hundred individuals the time year old you know everything that happens.

393
00:37:16,891 --> 00:37:21,891
if I can wanted to contact her if you would so this is identified household in the time

394
00:37:21,891 --> 00:37:27,211
that they have in that case. and then I start looking at the other members of the household when I identified

395
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:32,211
it and I left from she's the first time you

396
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:37,331
know if if I can't you know I I left from me the first time

397
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:42,411
with the other individual in the house so I don't pretend. I was watching. time here. I I

398
00:37:42,411 --> 00:37:47,591
actually honestly only ones and sometimes identified an escape

399
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:52,731
through these you know there are two valid or invalid study

400
00:37:52,731 --> 00:37:58,111
designs. our contact tracing without the late entries identify household and then I pretended

401
00:37:58,111 --> 00:38:04,484
I was watching them from time zero because I know they didn't get a check the whole time which is actually the problem. but

402
00:38:04,484 --> 00:38:09,705
um so have we content driven without the way to train and then we have ignoring a certain infection so ignoring external

403
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:15,024
infections. I pretend that you are only exposed to infections

404
00:38:15,024 --> 00:38:22,284
in your house and I did that next cases are just a missed.

405
00:38:22,284 --> 00:38:27,504
okay so we'll also course size that their rental as women without who infected. so we we expect everything

406
00:38:27,504 --> 00:38:32,564
should work what receive in fact at home is a standard survival analysis so if it doesn't work. this

407
00:38:32,564 --> 00:38:37,584
is like a major you know it's going to work. and how else infected home this is

408
00:38:37,584 --> 00:38:43,024
where were we relying on. I'm taking a stop in these weird sounds over all the possible

409
00:38:43,024 --> 00:38:48,205
transmission trees. so we're gonna end up with four hundred thousand

410
00:38:48,205 --> 00:38:53,705
analyses. okay send them blacked off. this is the truth

411
00:38:53,705 --> 00:38:58,744
and this is an estimate. it's not a one to one scale. you can see

412
00:38:58,744 --> 00:39:03,764
for the blast off are where we see who inspected whom the gray which dogs are actually probably

413
00:39:03,764 --> 00:39:09,027
difficult to see our our when we don't see

414
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:14,327
you can see when when we did were affected. I I I was really surprised how easy

415
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:19,367
it is to either the ballots but that they've been involved in design the invalid study

416
00:39:19,367 --> 00:39:24,727
designs are working surprisingly well. when you see who infected. I was really

417
00:39:24,727 --> 00:39:29,947
really shocked by that. um when you don't feel back home. 's he

418
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:35,027
yeah this is obviously close out this seemed to be doing okay but it turned out if you've if you look

419
00:39:35,027 --> 00:39:40,296
into a little more. you got a lot of fire and then we do have some weird things going on

420
00:39:40,296 --> 00:39:45,536
for very low values of infectious in even

421
00:39:45,536 --> 00:39:51,016
in the valid study designs and then this is status. I mean

422
00:39:51,016 --> 00:39:56,656
a general theme here estimating infectious that's the fax is a lot harder than a semantic susceptibility

423
00:39:56,656 --> 00:40:01,656
is seven and you can see that here I I and again it's amazing how I

424
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:07,456
was really wanting. I really wanted to fail but I I

425
00:40:07,456 --> 00:40:12,476
it filled in using the degree that I wanted him and and you can also

426
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:17,476
see one one we don't even know who we can cover a lot of information but you do get slightly larger

427
00:40:17,476 --> 00:40:22,556
very. okay. so now we get it to send this is

428
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:27,996
a baseline. so I don't have a waiting

429
00:40:27,996 --> 00:40:33,016
room. you got don't um. so this is one of the people in Memphis and

430
00:40:33,016 --> 00:40:38,359
this is when we don't seem and neither are valid studies design over here as easy

431
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:43,679
as valid and if you do the glimmer of hope here that bill sale.

432
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:48,699
so when we need to home. again it's amazing like I'm trying to

433
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:53,699
say that the epidemiologic study design out of it doesn't seem to him

434
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:59,119
so shouldn't work and then but then I mean or sound infection we mean

435
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,119
we don't get the baseline red reprints too hot because the people inside

436
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:09,339
the household are getting credit for infections cost from outside. so that actually makes sense would that be

437
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:14,839
overestimated and then when I was a late entry and Mesa. it would be too low.

438
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:19,959
records were adding a bunch of prison time or guaranteed to not have an effect. so

439
00:41:19,959 --> 00:41:25,820
that said the race is gonna be too low and then this is the um

440
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:30,879
external baseline rate and then when I mean wondering for ten

441
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:35,946
to better than it there's only three studies because one of them pretends that that doesn't exist so the works were

442
00:41:35,946 --> 00:41:41,226
finding those are valid studies his arms without the the street. we get him

443
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:46,706
to high a pay baseline rate and I have an explanation

444
00:41:46,706 --> 00:41:51,806
for that but I'm blanking on it right now but it does it does make sense that that happen and I would

445
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:57,026
look and confidence interval coverage problems so this is pretty effective parameter this is a susceptibility

446
00:41:57,026 --> 00:42:02,506
private based on internal based on external and this is a shame from smoker. again

447
00:42:02,506 --> 00:42:07,606
why she's so in either wall

448
00:42:07,606 --> 00:42:12,786
the confidence. so we're we're doing really well. where if you wanna fax home. when we don't

449
00:42:12,786 --> 00:42:17,846
be affected home like that. that's if they shouldn't

450
00:42:17,846 --> 00:42:23,026
work but they they work and then both we we have really bad coverage and covered

451
00:42:23,026 --> 00:42:28,746
probabilities here and then if I'm not free but I think it is amazing how

452
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:33,818
how much you can get away with when you see what affected. him when you don't even would affect at home they look

453
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:39,117
much more. so those those are really that ones particularly loved him

454
00:42:39,117 --> 00:42:44,117
and then when we completely ignore external infection things go badly you know

455
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:49,157
you can get away without delay to entry to a surprising degree even when you don't see who

456
00:42:49,157 --> 00:42:54,298
infected you know we don't know likely what ratio copy so you guys might mind of it.

457
00:42:54,298 --> 00:42:59,698
you can each type of hypothesis has corresponds to buy

458
00:42:59,698 --> 00:43:05,038
confidence interval. and those are walls that the likely ration comfortable work slightly

459
00:43:05,038 --> 00:43:10,098
better than the than the wall confidence interval and we still we have

460
00:43:10,098 --> 00:43:15,198
the same time when you don't see with make this home. the study design starts

461
00:43:15,198 --> 00:43:20,358
to to mass sales the model produces valid point

462
00:43:20,358 --> 00:43:25,478
interval estimates whether or not we see who infected from um ballot nobody logic study

463
00:43:25,478 --> 00:43:31,498
design is critical to parameter estimation but estimation of rate ratios surprisingly

464
00:43:31,498 --> 00:43:36,753
robust when you see who infected home so what whole trip and one

465
00:43:36,753 --> 00:43:41,833
of the things we saw like you know the ball in is in design were there some strange things going on. I had some

466
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:47,013
combinations of parameters what how the whole transmission is rap and we don't really get an updated

467
00:43:47,013 --> 00:43:52,273
estimate the house of external infectious contact. so I think it might be worthwhile

468
00:43:52,273 --> 00:43:58,273
and some study designed to actually roll control the household. just help us estimate

469
00:43:58,273 --> 00:44:03,433
external forces infection because that's important estimating the rate ratios

470
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:08,733
inside the household that we really care about a notice we don't

471
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:13,813
we don't know enough about the transmission of a lot of to his to be able to choose a parametric distribution so be

472
00:44:13,813 --> 00:44:18,913
good to have a semi parametric version of this and we're running

473
00:44:18,913 --> 00:44:23,993
out of time but I've I've applied this model to defend them to to date examples I was

474
00:44:23,993 --> 00:44:29,013
was I gonna go through one is um Los Angeles County Department of Public health influenza

475
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:34,021
data from two thousand nine so they they follow people in the household and they had some

476
00:44:34,021 --> 00:44:39,021
people who had um profile access and some people who didn't.

477
00:44:39,021 --> 00:44:44,122
so I'll cook so we used we had um sex and that's

478
00:44:44,122 --> 00:44:49,342
older children and the fire measure of veg out for flux for each individual

479
00:44:49,342 --> 00:44:54,461
and their own effect some of of the pairwise analysis our. if America had a value for the infectious

480
00:44:54,461 --> 00:44:59,562
individual so they'll underscore until work process underscores in about for

481
00:44:59,562 --> 00:45:04,741
the susceptible individual. so I'm enjoying the ninety nine and then

482
00:45:04,741 --> 00:45:09,981
there wasn't a very large sample size so I I wasn't expecting much from this analysis and

483
00:45:09,981 --> 00:45:15,201
and then I I don't know what distribution to choose so I I just send a bunch

484
00:45:15,201 --> 00:45:20,241
of models with the same for the covariance and look at the area icy see values and we

485
00:45:20,241 --> 00:45:25,582
ended up using the month which is six months exponential external

486
00:45:25,582 --> 00:45:32,127
contact but the common hazard infection from outside the household and then fly logistic

487
00:45:32,127 --> 00:45:37,287
did you read and if something was I would just think it's fun because every Tuesday

488
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:42,448
and you know with with a lot of the distribution. anyhow have any rate ratio corresponds

489
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:47,787
to an odds ratio doesn't change no matter what time and you choose.

490
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:53,307
so I'm always happy when I see the lot logistic distribution

491
00:45:53,307 --> 00:45:58,387
works. I also like the exponential has a constant hazard while all have had it has to go up

492
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:03,427
or down for four or stay constant and then those but the luggage and can have hazards that go up

493
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:08,627
and down. so for infectious diseases I I think it's an it's a nice distribution to you so here

494
00:46:08,627 --> 00:46:17,283
cultivation estimates and um those are probably my likelihood ratio

495
00:46:17,283 --> 00:46:22,663
so and this is I tried this analysis accounting for external infection in accounting firms

496
00:46:22,663 --> 00:46:29,083
because I wanna see if that's an important thing to do so and the

497
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:34,104
you know we seen by the rain ratios. there's some evidence of of greater

498
00:46:34,104 --> 00:46:39,124
infection in the lower susceptibility but we don't have um you know

499
00:46:39,124 --> 00:46:44,163
we don't have this not statistically significant for it looks like prose losses

500
00:46:44,163 --> 00:46:50,344
actually does decrease susceptibility to infection and then

501
00:46:50,344 --> 00:46:56,104
I thought that if you you know here they just are these

502
00:46:56,104 --> 00:47:01,943
funds form. this is the shape parameter. when you translated

503
00:47:01,943 --> 00:47:07,203
the rate ratios two other issues need shape I'm

504
00:47:07,203 --> 00:47:12,323
in but when we ignore external inspections. we Jeff and that's what much less power it and estimate

505
00:47:12,323 --> 00:47:17,364
this effective susceptibility so it turns out it is important. I I'm surprisingly it is important

506
00:47:17,364 --> 00:47:22,737
in town for external infection even the in analysis with a relatively small sample

507
00:47:22,737 --> 00:47:27,737
size and I don't I don't have a case you know changing point oh five peas always but this does

508
00:47:27,737 --> 00:47:32,737
show the difference in power. so that's

509
00:47:32,737 --> 00:47:37,997
one pairwise analysis and then I should like I took the fit the of model and

510
00:47:37,997 --> 00:47:43,657
I turn it into the transition probabilities because I I had assumed infectious. and so we can see

511
00:47:43,657 --> 00:47:49,077
transmission from a child or adult to an untreated child or child for classes

512
00:47:49,077 --> 00:47:54,277
and you can see the reduction in susceptibility with prophylactic and all

513
00:47:54,277 --> 00:47:59,397
for combination and then

514
00:47:59,397 --> 00:48:04,417
you can put confidence your in balls on it and do other confidence intervals like are the

515
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:09,697
ratio because these depend on a combination of parameters everybody's wall

516
00:48:09,697 --> 00:48:14,977
and you can do the hard effectiveness and smaller dogs reflected in the

517
00:48:14,977 --> 00:48:20,311
household that they are but even more than that you see

518
00:48:20,311 --> 00:48:25,611
so that's that's the type of those things can be done with a lot of household

519
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:30,671
studies and is is quite useful. so the fraud life

520
00:48:30,671 --> 00:48:36,231
is reduce the federal infection there's conclusive evidence of hard patches and floor susceptibility among adults.

521
00:48:36,231 --> 00:48:41,291
I we only had a binary classification of age if we had actually ages. we might have

522
00:48:41,291 --> 00:48:46,611
more ability to look at at an effect age. think do there was there's

523
00:48:46,611 --> 00:48:52,091
been missing data so we see in times of said of infection as we don't see times infection.

524
00:48:52,091 --> 00:48:57,571
so we need to you know I I I sort of crush that under the rug in this analysis

525
00:48:57,571 --> 00:49:02,671
but it really has to be handled the with date augmentation and CMC and

526
00:49:02,671 --> 00:49:07,711
it's none of this required information about who infected and we didn't have any information about that but

527
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:13,151
partial information about who infected who would have given us more precision in my protected us from

528
00:49:13,151 --> 00:49:18,165
from buyers. that's what we saw in the simulations. so this is the final one so

529
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:23,505
I just had a trade mission expanded from pigs to ferret so they had this experimentally

530
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:28,665
infected pigs and there were three vaccine groups and they did have six pigs and then there were three

531
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:34,345
certain changes. Jason to the paper and then there were three certain cages

532
00:49:34,345 --> 00:49:39,465
in situations it takes and they they've actually a fax of three different things so they

533
00:49:39,465 --> 00:49:44,685
were there were naïve fair and then there repairs that have been

534
00:49:44,685 --> 00:49:50,765
vaccinated with kill the vaccine and then for sending back food the modified life fax.

535
00:49:50,765 --> 00:49:55,885
so I sent the follow up as a as a pairwise survival and then use

536
00:49:55,885 --> 00:50:01,405
a lot of logistic Excel feel to your time on. I I didn't say a icy thing just

537
00:50:01,405 --> 00:50:08,625
because I don't I don't have any bait other bases to choose a distribution

538
00:50:08,625 --> 00:50:13,625
or not there's not a simple one. I I knew work on methods of looking at the business.

539
00:50:13,625 --> 00:50:19,035
that's something needs to be done so animated so he's committed rape issues or easy children.

540
00:50:19,035 --> 00:50:24,375
so now he was the reference groups or children's names get a reverse your point if it's not statistically

541
00:50:24,375 --> 00:50:29,395
significant life versus my is and I was not with the small people I but

542
00:50:29,395 --> 00:50:34,395
was really nice I was really surprised to see you got

543
00:50:34,395 --> 00:50:39,395
such a strong signal life vaccines direct for the vendor. you have

544
00:50:39,395 --> 00:50:44,495
a point of if it suggested that indirect garden in direct contact of a longer time for inspection

545
00:50:44,495 --> 00:50:49,875
but it's not. so now

546
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:54,935
I rushed. I told you that we need push a parameter to translate these into odds ratios and

547
00:50:54,935 --> 00:51:00,175
and you can see what a dramatic difference this makes the rate ratio is all pretty

548
00:51:00,175 --> 00:51:05,315
tame. um but then he as said I was ratio.

549
00:51:05,315 --> 00:51:10,515
so we have an rate ratio of point six six that turns into. dress I your point

550
00:51:10,515 --> 00:51:15,613
one nine. such a parameter is really important I'm

551
00:51:15,613 --> 00:51:21,232
so weird to me that hobbies in this in the season other issues it should be for a fair

552
00:51:21,232 --> 00:51:27,133
giving chill vaccine versus the a naïve. and any time

553
00:51:27,133 --> 00:51:32,452
on getting an ostrich this would be the same ups ratio for

554
00:51:32,452 --> 00:51:37,593
of live vaccine versus a life and you could leave me a estimated and

555
00:51:37,593 --> 00:51:42,932
five reach. and I I've had this time of it

556
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:47,952
on the rotors. I don't know particularly in choosing is a fine.

557
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:53,893
if you have. ray vision. the only thing they share that they all agree on the snow

558
00:51:53,893 --> 00:51:59,752
with it is the fact they're all older but you're I'm using other issues because there's a lot of existing dispensers

559
00:51:59,752 --> 00:52:04,853
there's there's no margin to do that. it's just one

560
00:52:04,853 --> 00:52:09,873
option. so I don't mind I do know that one minus the operation

561
00:52:09,873 --> 00:52:14,992
so we get a vaccine efficacy estimate of thirty nine percent for the kill vaccine and eighty

562
00:52:14,992 --> 00:52:20,527
one percent for the lot of faxing that the ninety bucks a pop in general doesn't cover

563
00:52:20,527 --> 00:52:25,527
one so this is actually statistically significant which I was very surprised about that that

564
00:52:25,527 --> 00:52:30,767
was a fun analysis I I think there some changes that they could make to the design of the animal transmission

565
00:52:30,767 --> 00:52:36,687
experiments the ferret got infected perfect place basically

566
00:52:36,687 --> 00:52:41,847
when the bears were exposed to the pigs all of them weren't affected by the second time

567
00:52:41,847 --> 00:52:46,867
they went back to measure. so I I think they could probably tone down the level

568
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:51,967
of exposure. I think the peg and still get good good accident in these

569
00:52:51,967 --> 00:52:57,091
times but like it all of the ferrets have been infected the first time they went back to measure would been

570
00:52:57,091 --> 00:53:02,191
a disaster is able to see any difference in the. fact so also I think that you

571
00:53:02,191 --> 00:53:07,311
know they keep they keep the animals individually in cages. I think in some sense it might be

572
00:53:07,311 --> 00:53:13,431
helpful to to have the animals interacting like a small house and then analyzes

573
00:53:13,431 --> 00:53:18,531
like household study. so I I I

574
00:53:18,531 --> 00:53:24,411
was I mean very go diverse progression where I don't have to choose a distribution.

575
00:53:24,411 --> 00:53:29,491
so that's that's one thing I want to work on future directions we need to improve putting it in

576
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:34,771
France we need to handle missing us data we need to go small and also interval sensor because you know how often

577
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:40,071
you like the big desert they're going back to measure them every two days and I pretend that they were measuring

578
00:53:40,071 --> 00:53:45,211
continuously overtime that's that's not really good. so we need to work on double censoring. we

579
00:53:45,211 --> 00:53:50,391
didn't include partial information on wood picked home from pathogen genetic sequences and then we also

580
00:53:50,391 --> 00:53:55,391
need to work on developing novel have any the logic study designed that there's an analogy in the pairwise you we can

581
00:53:55,391 --> 00:54:00,450
use the paralyzed perspective to drive case control control sports but it is

582
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:05,770
either the same way that regular kids get drunk excuse court settings the on drive in the normal

583
00:54:05,770 --> 00:54:10,890
survival analysis framework all these weapons depend on improving data collection and infectious

584
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:15,890
disease epidemiology especially designed to capture data infections on and

585
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:20,930
it is where exposed infection but not infected. that's something that's frequently knocked on

586
00:54:20,930 --> 00:54:26,150
and infections and everything. so I have all these regression model um.

587
00:54:26,150 --> 00:54:32,230
just hope that we're on not household paralyzed et cetera billions miles on the future for car

588
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:37,530
and the fig impaired was done with and Bowman and Josh Laura Buck. have I

589
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:42,890
all these people. I'm working on future directions with and then these are

590
00:54:42,890 --> 00:55:02,552
the funding sources but the content is my responsibility. thank you

591
00:55:02,552 --> 00:55:11,772
is demographically. 's. thank

592
00:55:11,772 --> 00:55:19,472
you. streams and that more recent

593
00:55:19,472 --> 00:55:24,772
changes. so I use a wide

594
00:55:24,772 --> 00:55:29,772
range because I I wanted the model to have a hard time. like you know member works with

595
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:35,232
a lot of wide range I would expect it to continue to work for an error range that only one reason to pick a wide range.

596
00:55:35,232 --> 00:55:41,092
yeah the reason is that I think for a lot of these you have no idea what the range of these things

597
00:55:41,092 --> 00:55:46,172
you just like we have no idea in many cases what the and I was stunned it is we have

598
00:55:46,172 --> 00:55:51,472
an idea what the infectious profile but is a lot of ways because of the way that the data is collected and analyzed

599
00:55:51,472 --> 00:55:56,500
we we don't actually know what. so I I would say I don't feel like

600
00:55:56,500 --> 00:56:25,620
I do have a lot of basis to choose parameters based on the

601
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:30,840
page. um I'm affected by the fourth of July was supposed

602
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:35,952
to you you working
