1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:17,410
Rosters. Well, yeah. So everybody have like six or seven more bodies and we're not going to get there because all my children playing, she will go.

2
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,470
And I don't know.

3
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:35,490
I mean, I completely new to her so yeah I just I do that every time you need to check but she has her 20 that so when I'm working with her.

4
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,190
Yes. Yeah. We were factories for four years.

5
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:51,360
And you. Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. So we clarify that I guess I like I also your only a lot of tiger because I mean everything everything for the loss.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,910
So that's why he helped me in that game.

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,550
Good. Here. Let's hear a little player, I think, for luxury, like.

8
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,090
Oh, hey. So, wow, that was very well.

9
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:12,420
Explain. Was it? You know, like you said, it was an incredible assault weapons like killing people.

10
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:17,010
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Not very informative.

11
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,510
Yeah. Like, why would you know why?

12
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,080
News when you're trying to teach Cody? Yeah, I'm just saying that.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what she said.

14
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,260
I think I. So, yeah.

15
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:43,680
So then when she how do you just never been anywhere.

16
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:45,630
So for more than a week at a time.

17
00:01:46,150 --> 00:02:01,590
Well, maybe since I've never done anything like I'm also that use it in U.S. dollars anyway and she's like different.

18
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,830
So it's just like with in the States, you have these options.

19
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:20,900
Yeah. Yeah. It's like living in your life where you can find anywhere.

20
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,020
Yeah. Which is frustrating. Why?

21
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:44,210
Yeah. So you just finish the topic and then I want you to drive a truck and go anywhere.

22
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:49,140
It has. It's not only that.

23
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,010
Exactly what happened. Important.

24
00:02:54,675 --> 00:03:00,065
Sometimes we get a call to get somewhere like we're in the wrong building through,

25
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:07,395
like have all our gear just running up the road and it's not time to go back to the ambulance, whatever it is.

26
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:13,705
So it's a hectic one, but it is. But no, I never did that.

27
00:03:13,725 --> 00:03:20,985
I've never taken that distinction anything. I know friends of friends who like it back to back shows because they just wanted more.

28
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:25,255
That's it. It is good, but it's a little pushing it in my perspective.

29
00:03:25,355 --> 00:03:29,084
Oh yeah. There's a lot of to show to it. Like it's an 8 to 10 hour shift.

30
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:34,725
You've got to show up ready. Like it might be fine the first 4 hours and then second, you know, shift.

31
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:38,235
Yeah, the next 4 hours and have fun. Yeah, I can imagine.

32
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:42,665
So I just dressed up. And when did you do it? Last summer. This summer?

33
00:03:42,675 --> 00:03:48,675
Yeah. The summer. Yeah. Just trying to quote unquote tan. That tan can get that.

34
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:54,485
I am. Yeah. Wait, so you guys are like cultural heritage sites to one side or.

35
00:03:55,095 --> 00:04:04,095
And I've been there before, so I mean, I'm just I would walk to like the Western Wall, which is like a 20 minute, 30 minute walk from where I lived.

36
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:11,445
And the shop, which is like the market, like 30 minutes, you know, everything was all this walkable.

37
00:04:11,685 --> 00:04:17,805
See, that's the sort of almost what's the most common ambulance code, the most common road toll.

38
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:23,115
Uh, I think probably like stroke or something.

39
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:27,735
Like, I mean, all people, probably people have a lot of old people in the old city.

40
00:04:27,915 --> 00:04:33,615
Yeah, that is. Or just I'm an old person and I feel bad that we have.

41
00:04:33,755 --> 00:04:39,185
Oh. Is usually people do like. Yeah. So what's different about today?

42
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:42,105
Well, today I feel worse. I feel like said,

43
00:04:42,225 --> 00:04:50,865
you know this is how they bad day like just the baseline is bad the day is horrible and that means like they know so much about their health,

44
00:04:50,965 --> 00:04:56,715
like, I mean, in the hospital. Yeah. Or sometimes they don't want to go to the hospital, which is the fun part.

45
00:04:56,985 --> 00:05:00,285
Very logical. Yeah. Like, can't you give me something now?

46
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:04,905
It's like. No, we're not. We're not a clinic. We can't just give you drugs.

47
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:13,725
That sounds like emotionally taxing. And it is frustrating, especially at night shifts when you have a patient who's at a clinic and it's like one,

48
00:05:13,725 --> 00:05:25,695
2 a.m. on a Thursday night and there's an old woman and she doesn't want to go to the hospital, but the clinic can't have her overnight.

49
00:05:25,905 --> 00:05:31,715
Yeah, but you think, oh, I'll just drive home. You know, they can't, but hey, you don't have a car.

50
00:05:31,755 --> 00:05:35,144
Really. You're going to call somebody. They're not going to go to your home.

51
00:05:35,145 --> 00:05:38,235
Can't call a taxi. You're going to hospital or nowhere.

52
00:05:38,335 --> 00:05:41,745
Yeah. She's like back in the house often.

53
00:05:42,345 --> 00:05:46,515
Back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And we just leave because we can't do it.

54
00:05:46,515 --> 00:05:50,205
And we're like, You figure it out now, lady, we're sorry for that.

55
00:05:50,595 --> 00:05:54,725
We have to go. Yeah, I do this for people to actually take calls from.

56
00:05:55,025 --> 00:06:00,615
Yeah, there are cases where it gets annoying and people going to the hospital.

57
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:04,145
Oh, yeah. People are always the difficult part of. Oh, yeah, yeah.

58
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:10,125
That's a challenge. Sometimes it's the fun part and I've, I've had patients and good like attitudes about it,

59
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:16,995
especially on the spectrum people who aren't actually heard are and like it's not they they.
