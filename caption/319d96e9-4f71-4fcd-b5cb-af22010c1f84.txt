1
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:12,020
Thank you. I suspect that we will be going over nutrition and health today.

2
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:20,030
But before we start off with the lecture, it would be great if everybody can go around and just talk about what context

3
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,219
and disease they chose for their assignments and maybe like a sentence or two

4
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:35,780
on why they chose that disease to start off Because they are a nurse and because

5
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:40,550
I'm interested in infectious diseases and I'm interested in what they're.

6
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,770
Yeah. I checked malaria cases and Angola.

7
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:52,370
The reason why is because there's a vaccine that recently came out about malaria,

8
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,800
and it's not in Angola that they're testing it out for other countries in Africa like Malawi.

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,920
And so just interested in seeing how it looks now versus in a couple of years a way to look a little better because of the vaccine.

10
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:12,590
Yeah, I did tuberculosis in the Philippines because the Philippines has one of the highest burden countries for tuberculosis.

11
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:15,890
That also has pretty good data on it as well.

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:23,180
And just because I'm generally interested in it, I also there hasn't been the infections, but I did.

13
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,709
I did in Indonesia. I'm particularly interested in looking at how climate change impacts the transmission of vector

14
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:35,990
borne diseases and as an island nation and diseases unequally impacted by climate change.

15
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,170
But I'm also interested in Southeast Asia sometimes all three.

16
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:52,430
I did notice that children under the age of five in Haiti, I chose that because I like thinking about doing work in that region for time.

17
00:01:52,970 --> 00:02:03,620
And I just think interesting because it's like something different. The way I use what we produce right now is I'm looking at intestinal parasitic

18
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:08,960
infections within people and Saudi Arabia is really have problems with there

19
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,150
and I've very it's a pretty popular country that's on a lot of people migrating

20
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:18,500
sounds a bit like trying to make a bunch of population endemic or parasites.

21
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,060
So I think that also like many of them are getting infections they're that.

22
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,820
I am generally excited at the impact of climate change on the planet geography, waterborne diseases.

23
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:42,349
I decided to start the Switch project to work on that topic and I chose to look at vector

24
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:51,440
borne diseases as unresponsive climate on that specific fever in a city in Colombia,

25
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:58,009
which is a border town which is currently under the sway of a climate narrative there,

26
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:02,250
but there's also a migratory narrative there in the sense that you have a lot of countries where the

27
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:15,320
migrant economic turmoil that you are exporting and influencing the incidence and prevalence of things.

28
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:26,750
I think one of the things to do in Brazil because I want to grow up there, so I'm familiar about the situation there,

29
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:34,970
but I also want to see how impactful the government plays a role in the present innovative operation and how the kids can help.

30
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,280
You know, their family members are all good.

31
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,710
I'm not sure, Jonathan, if you picked the disease yet, that's fine.

32
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:47,330
Do you have any ideas of what kind of disease to look at or a context that interests you?

33
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,360
That's why I know you not.

34
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:05,530
It's not time the population growing.

35
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:30,590
It has to be about what you think about the Philippines and the Philippines generally, because that is so interesting.

36
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:44,920
Specifically, I'm interested in opposition of because I want to look at a time point of late 1970 or probably 1979, 80 and 1980 into the problem.

37
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:52,750
That was a time when there was an awful political dictator in place,

38
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:02,750
which he was kind of notorious for appropriating resources away from the people and more towards police.

39
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,730
So that was kind of like a blip in the history of the country.

40
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:14,470
So I thought that that would be good thing to look into kind of the mortality of the people of the Philippines.

41
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:20,800
So I thought that specifically would be an interesting way to look at that.

42
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:28,480
I chose problems of food insecurity. One, because my family's from Kenya.

43
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,730
So I'd like to know more about the subject growing up in the States and food insecurity in particular,

44
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:41,890
because I now have a very big like agricultural system, but a lot of people are either malnourished or have overnutrition.

45
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:46,870
And so I wanted to understand how that kind of creating a chronic disease.

46
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:51,280
Because I'm also really interested in not just to click on that one.

47
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:58,420
I'm studying data collection soon in the refugee camp, Kenya and Eastleigh, but of refugees in Kenya.

48
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:02,530
If you want to sneak in a couple of questions for your capstone or thesis, let me know.

49
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:14,410
I chose in Mexico. I chose that because I've heard a lot about poverty in the context of like Texas having had it so easy.

50
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:21,280
And I did stuff like that in the U.S., but I wanted to learn more about it actually in Mexico life.

51
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:27,370
And then I was going to focus on pregnant women in Mexico to try to see things

52
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:32,209
that could be communicated for the pregnant woman to the fetus during gestation.

53
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:40,700
So I thought that was an interesting aspect as. I chose individuals that are going to.

54
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:50,580
America. They're going to put it up to four times.

55
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:56,460
Versus the virus. Interesting question.

56
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:08,430
Sometimes I look for ghosts before I have a special interest from the family.

57
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:14,170
Because my stepmother is from Romania and she never has TV, but she will test positive for TV.

58
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,800
And so I was exposed to it when I was younger as a topic,

59
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:26,050
but I decided to focus on Pakistan because it has one of the highest burdens of

60
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:31,989
virtual space and also because I wanted to see how recent with the flooding.

61
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:39,720
And it was like that later like. How people are regiments and regiments and their access to.

62
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:51,550
I did cases of malaria and that and I chose it as I did research there and I am going to be doing that there.

63
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:59,889
So it's nice to be learning a lot more about it. And then malaria has been very prevalent for a long time.

64
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:05,390
And. I like that. When are you going back to Uganda?

65
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,640
February. I'll just. You know, the university is stopping travel because of Ebola.

66
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,020
So just try to make sure that you have backup plans if that's the case.

67
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:20,329
But one of my colleagues works on maternal and child health in Uganda.

68
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:23,850
So if you want a chat to her about stuff, let me know. I'm not.

69
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:32,390
So do you have any kind of idea, like going toward something or still trying to figure it out so we can the.

70
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:46,280
So originally I chose my contacts a year away, but I decided I wanted to join because I never really specified infectious diseases.

71
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,430
I want to look at the area of infectious diseases.

72
00:08:50,940 --> 00:09:01,679
So now I'm thinking looking more towards or leaning more towards doing my context in Russia, because that's my country, that investigating HIV,

73
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:13,110
because HIV is quite prevalent still in Russia and it's still affecting a lot of more out of like rural areas and impoverished towns.

74
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:24,600
So Iceland, which is an island in the South Pacific for my population of mammals and also I was interested in the

75
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:36,960
health of potential cancer patients because most of the discussions around health is focused on eating.

76
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,500
So I wanted to look at health issues and some old super interesting topics.

77
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,740
And a big reason why I wanted to go around is feel free to work together.

78
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,990
Obviously don't come on the same assignment, but kind of work for each other, share data sets, that kind of thing.

79
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,820
That's completely encouraged. I do know a lot of you chose.

80
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:04,800
Vector borne diseases like malaria and are just a bit off topic from nutrition.

81
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:16,930
I just want to share a video on a really interesting way of data collection to collect data on the amount of mosquitoes in a environment.

82
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:20,399
It's called a human landing cat study and video.

83
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:26,490
Talk about it a bit more, but essentially you have somebody sit outside and you count how many mosquitoes land in them and bite them.

84
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,230
And if you're looking for information on how many mosquitoes there are in the environment,

85
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:35,820
if you can find studies like this, that's really the best way to get that information.

86
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:49,230
Hello. My name is retired program officer malaria at the World Health Organization Foundation.

87
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:57,290
This video will explain how to conduct a human like and also to take the sample taking and not killing mosquitoes.

88
00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:02,250
This method is extremely effective and an accurate way to estimate the human life.

89
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:09,710
This method is labor intensive and results vary depending on the collective skill and appeal to a student.

90
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,930
While HLC does potentially expose the collective to infectious mosquito bites,

91
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:21,829
the risk of becoming infected with malaria can be mitigated by using antimalarial of an okay,

92
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:27,750
so it should not be done during times of known virus transmission latency or both.

93
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:32,810
Actually speaking female mosquitoes that land acting as the victim.

94
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:41,269
This method monitors adult composition, species occurrence and abundance as well as the respective behaviors of humans.

95
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:47,950
Biting, biting time by patient. These behaviors control risk assessments and controls.

96
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,400
They can be performed in a variety of locations, including in houses, animal shelters,

97
00:11:54,820 --> 00:12:00,250
vegetated areas on verandas, or in the very domestic space close to houses.

98
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,379
Before starting any human landing collection.

99
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:09,910
Applications with sampling will take place, must be agreed upon which the head of the household will separate.

100
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:15,889
One catcher will be stationed inside the house or the other will be up to ten meters outside the house.

101
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:23,900
In the prairie, domestic era matches are usually performed at a ground level, outside the house where mosquitoes are most active.

102
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,299
After the usually performed hourly proposal that would open up a good way to manage

103
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:35,610
the program is now connected to work in teams up to 6 hours with one click the

104
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:41,049
something from 6 p.m. to midnight and the other from midnight to 6 p.m. the time

105
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:45,270
of collection and location where individual collected work should be located.

106
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,530
This minimizes bias due to attractiveness or skill of collectors.

107
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:55,680
Note that the hours of collection may vary based on knowledge of the biting behaviors of the locals.

108
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:02,420
As a guide, collectors should stop before the time of their lives and end up the host seeking to stop.

109
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:08,930
Now we will show you materials and how best to. You will need respirators.

110
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,280
Protection and selection cover story.

111
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,520
We cover the cost of permitting and used rubber bands to secure.

112
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:23,820
Some part of the wood is used to block a small package to make sure your cups appear labeled.

113
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,680
When working at night, you will need torches, manufacturers as well.

114
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:38,239
Processing this energy will be more controlled so as to take a portable forceps and label micro centrifuge to before the start of the collection,

115
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:45,030
set up sufficient paper cups for holding it up to the scale. You mean one cup out of the entire collection?

116
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:51,330
That one for each hour of collection cups should be labeled with date location of our collection.

117
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:55,129
One cup will be labeled 6 to 7 p.m. Another seven.

118
00:13:55,130 --> 00:14:02,990
Take them and so on. We like a lot of plastic containers to keep the collection cup safe and the

119
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:06,680
collectors sit on a spoon with their legs exposed and away from mosquitoes.

120
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,660
Trouser leg should be rolled up to expose their skin from the start.

121
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:18,380
Sit down and wait patiently. Regularly. Check your legs and feet for mosquitoes.

122
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:22,040
With the bull's eye approach as useful as your hands remain free.

123
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,940
When you see a mosquito, catch it by using a close by or sucking into the other.

124
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:36,690
The mosquito will be put into the spray. That will not get too much because of the mesh with whenever possible that

125
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,270
the mosquito should be caught with aspirin before they can spread a mosquito.

126
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:48,520
So spread it to the level collection cup by carefully moving aside the cotton wool and growing the mosquitoes and

127
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:54,470
the collected cups carefully and keep the safe in the containers until the processing and long term storage.

128
00:14:55,280 --> 00:15:03,859
Thanks for watching and best wishes. The skin of. Any questions on that?

129
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:08,959
Anything we just talked about before I moved to lecture the first time I heard about it.

130
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,960
So I was like, There's no way you're serious. Like, I told the person, I was joking.

131
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:29,460
Another video actually on nutrition now. This is an Ethiopia.

132
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:36,570
This is a thing. She's one year old. No income in the south.

133
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:45,350
It's been a while since the doors of the translation center at the hospital are doing some sort of.

134
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,800
But that's not supposed to be of the energy to give an individual.

135
00:15:54,490 --> 00:16:03,160
I is a nutritionist working with the project zero zero stands for Community Based Prevention of Acute Malnutrition.

136
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:10,090
Simon Project aims to reduce mortality and morbidity of children caused by severe acute malnutrition.

137
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,810
He's now discussing his daughter's case with the nurses.

138
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:28,300
She was admitted to the hospital due to lack of nutrition. That's why I put it up, because I know what it is.

139
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:31,780
I know what it's like to take it.

140
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:41,560
And I repeat, the humanitarian aid echoed by the CMO program despite severe malnutrition, unavailability that I have.

141
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:51,140
This is not what its training is to use the provision of health professionals on identification and management of malnutrition in children that

142
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:59,620
provides the technical support and training goes on my monitors to help them build the capacity of health professionals on all levels of the facility.

143
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:12,700
The UNICEF equal annual pick up work in several issues around the world.

144
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:17,480
For all we have to think about,

145
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:31,570
it seems like in my old in way the social settings and then this immediate and that is one of another immutable covenant.

146
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:40,180
That's one of the vegetables I think of it and work with you and you don't like it.

147
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:52,770
But it gets a lot of. It would be going to get a little bit like.

148
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:58,490
Yes, I would like you to listen.

149
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:05,970
If they want to visit. But they don't always look good.

150
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:13,280
That was one of the more difficult.

151
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,790
It was difficult for them to get.

152
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,550
I saw the other day as I was writing Samantha.

153
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:33,190
Stabilization centers are established to keep a close attention to lower secrets,

154
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:40,420
whereas outpatient therapeutic programs are launched to help outposts to provide support to the community.

155
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:51,520
The program also provides the mother stabilization centers the floor in oil so that they can prepare their own food at the facility.

156
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:58,670
But overall, I think there's some sense that this was a little bit off of it.

157
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:08,280
I didn't know what to do with it.

158
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,310
We love each other.

159
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:30,660
But I have to that I was able to eliminate the inability of this core to come at all, that word of the outbreak or simply because of Ebola.

160
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:46,099
Yeah. So if you give us a little bit of it and we don't try to analyze the full capacity and as I said I to and it was

161
00:19:46,100 --> 00:20:01,870
a very natural way of putting it because someone was actually already putting it in the decision that it wasn't.

162
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:09,770
So I'm not going to get into.

163
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:23,430
Yes. It's not me, because I people think I know I know they know that you're really against the rest of the

164
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:33,469
group and never that there would be no light up the night to do it without the confinement.

165
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:39,020
Nearly two months since chemo was integrated with the routine offices and program.

166
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:43,850
It's an effective and accessible means of managing malnutrition with the EU.

167
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,060
Humanitarian aid equals strong financial support.

168
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,910
The progress is pretty good and we let them talk about what they're doing over here throughout the lecture.

169
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:59,660
But it really includes a lot of key interventions and ways of measuring malnutrition, which you'll find quite often.

170
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:10,910
So firstly we talk about malnutrition. It's important to understand how we measure and define malnutrition as dietary intake.

171
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:20,520
What is the person taking in if that child under about 18 months, two years breastfeeding is a major source of nutrition.

172
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:27,120
The two types of breastfeeding exclusive which is by the child only breastfeeding and also complementary.

173
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:30,480
That's a mix between breastfeeding and food.

174
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,990
The way you measure breast feeding is, at least to me, not great.

175
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:40,040
It's really often just based on recall.

176
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:46,530
You go to households and you ask the mother, hopefully the mother sometimes you'll ask the father, which is just not reliable at all.

177
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:52,650
But hopefully ask the mother. When's the last time you breast fed and how often do you breastfeed?

178
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:57,330
And questions like that. There's a lot of biases in this.

179
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:03,000
First is recall bias, which is they might just forget. They might not remember what happened yesterday.

180
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:10,070
Mothers are busy people. Obviously, they might succumb to social desirability bias.

181
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,140
They might know they are breastfeeding enough or they are feeding enough.

182
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:21,150
But because they don't want to look like a bad parent to the data collector or the doctor or the nurse or whoever, they might like them.

183
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:30,990
And if you're working on cohort studies or in a surveillance site where people are enumerated very, very often you might have the hawthorn effect,

184
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:36,060
which is people adapting their behaviors because they're constantly being watched,

185
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:41,370
which for that population isn't a bad thing if they're close to being surveyed and they help behaviors improve also.

186
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:45,150
But that's not going to be representative of the entire population.

187
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:53,070
Similarly, you want to question or they might question households on dietary diversity.

188
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,489
So they give them a survey and say in the past 7 to 14 days, how much rice did you buy?

189
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:02,910
How much meat did you buy? Eggs, pulses, fish, whatever it may be.

190
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,630
And you have the same issue here. People might forget. People might like.

191
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:13,270
And same thing for macro and micro nutrient input. There are ways around this.

192
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:18,610
The two I've seen are you watch parents over the course of day, see what happens.

193
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:24,580
You go in the house and you just kind of look at what food they have. But obviously, that also might not be representative.

194
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,969
You can then also look at nutritional status, which is weight.

195
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,210
So overall underweight, but that's primarily used for adults.

196
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:41,160
Body fat index, which is the amount of body fat, the percent of the body that is made of fat,

197
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,350
mostly in the fuel, uses the calipers to pinch the skin, see how much fat is.

198
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:52,890
The stunting, which is your which is low height for age.

199
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,800
But obviously that varies so much in children. It's really falling out of favor.

200
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:03,410
There's wasting, which is, I think, better than stunting an indicator which is low weight for height.

201
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,880
So it doesn't really matter how the child is. It's very tailored to the child.

202
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:17,400
And also biomarkers for nutrients. So collecting stool or blood and seeing what's in there.

203
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:22,570
And it's also always important to consider the systems that exist.

204
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:26,920
Does the household have access to food? And if they don't, why is that?

205
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Economic is not available. Are there other issues?

206
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,390
And also what food is available in the community?

207
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:40,780
I'm sure most of you heard about in the US food deserts, where in impoverished communities you can't buy vegetables, healthy foods, anything.

208
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,550
And that happens globally as well. I just want to point out what this is.

209
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:50,020
This is a mid upper arm circumference tape.

210
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:57,060
It's going to move tape. And it's really just a tape like this about, well, 30 centimeters a foot long.

211
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:01,530
And all you do is you wrap it around the child's arm.

212
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:09,180
And based on the thumb circumference of the arm, you get like a rough estimate of how malnourished a child a child is at a severe or moderate.

213
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,410
That's a really good tool to use in the field where you don't have many resources.

214
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:19,360
So why should we care about nutrition as a public health outcome?

215
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:31,320
Nutritional issues contribute to quite a few of the biggest contributors to disability adjusted life years.

216
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,100
Have you gone to the dailies in your other classes yet?

217
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:40,500
Does anybody know what the Dallas. That's fine.

218
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,500
So what exactly is. Is.

219
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:52,810
I'll give you an example. Let's say someone is going to live for 60 years or so.

220
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:57,340
Someone's going to live for 20 years longer. So I have, for example, 20 years left in my life.

221
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:03,959
If I was to get diabetes right now is my 20 years of healthy life.

222
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,800
It's equivalent to 20 years with diabetes or is equivalent to, for example, say, 16 years of diabetes or whatever.

223
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:17,310
And that is what a disability adjusted life year is. It's suggesting a year of life against having some kind of disease.

224
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:29,420
So dieting and risks and high blood pressure and child maternal malnutrition are some of the biggest contributors to decreased values globally,

225
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:36,950
as is high BMI, high blood glucose intensity diabetes and also high cholesterol.

226
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:43,040
So by impacting nutrition or improving nutrition, you can have a pretty big impact on health globally.

227
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:52,260
In the reading, you talked about all you read about the double burden of malnutrition.

228
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:59,400
The doubling the malnutrition is that malnutrition isn't just being underweight, it's also being overweight.

229
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,080
But you're seeing more and more in high income countries and countries with improving economies.

230
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:08,480
But what's being discussed now is a triple burn to malnutrition.

231
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,090
So overweight, underweight and also having micronutrient deficiencies.

232
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:23,000
A great, great proxy to look at micronutrient deficiencies is anemia, because if you're iron deficient of vitamin A,

233
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,610
deficiency of folate deficient or vitamin B12 deficient, you're probably going to have anemia.

234
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:34,460
And you can see the break down this globally in the higher income countries, Australia,

235
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,220
the US, Canada, and then in South America and some middle income countries.

236
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:51,920
The prevalence of malnutrition is from being overweight in South Southeast Asia because

237
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,130
of issues and infection struck when the second it's normally being underweight.

238
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,130
But quite interestingly, in Africa and some of the kind of higher income African countries,

239
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:06,620
it's being overweight and underweight and having micronutrient deficiencies.

240
00:28:07,870 --> 00:28:11,250
It's really you know, there's no clear cut reason for this.

241
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:18,000
But, you know, what I would call a hypothesis for this is because of inequity takes Africa,

242
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:23,070
for example, you probably have three population groups that when it comes to malnutrition,

243
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:30,570
you have one group which is so poor that they can't really afford food to all the undernourished one group,

244
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:37,140
which is kind of like, you know, not quite middle class, but getting there so they can only afford really unhealthy fatty foods,

245
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:43,830
the ones who are getting overweight and then kind of sprinkled in that group, especially that overweight group, people who.

246
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:51,940
Can afford some food, but not the most nutritious food. So they're the ones getting anemia and micronutrient deficiencies.

247
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:00,780
This is the prevalence of underweight, overweight and obesity for children, adolescents.

248
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:07,380
And I don't want to spend too much time on this because it varies so much by country and by region.

249
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:15,810
But just keep in mind, it's always important to look at different indicators by different demographics, but especially gender.

250
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:22,530
Globally, more males are living in children underweight than females.

251
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,049
Same for overweight and same for obesity. The reason for this?

252
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,620
Unclear. How about a global level and it really does matter in the context.

253
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:40,900
In some countries it's flipped. But just do be cognizant of that as you're examining these indicators if you're doing malnutrition in your contexts.

254
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:47,620
For adults.

255
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,410
Again, reasons aren't clear, but it's the opposite.

256
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:57,370
You have more females who are underweight, more females who are overweight, and more females who are obese.

257
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,300
But again, that varies so much between countries and even different populations and geographies inside countries.

258
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:12,960
And looking at the. Health effects of malnutrition.

259
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:21,270
Again, males globally have higher rates of nutrition and nutrition associated morbidities.

260
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:32,450
But again, it varies so much by country. So nutrition transitioned and we saw bit in that map a little while back.

261
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,549
Diets in different countries are converging to what's called Western diets.

262
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:42,470
So lots of fast food notes, many vegetables, lots of you got me.

263
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:49,430
And, you know, there's so many reasons for that, but it's really grounded in colonialism and,

264
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,770
you know, Western economies and companies taking over these countries.

265
00:30:55,100 --> 00:31:03,020
It's actually really interesting. Some places you go, people really kind of almost glorify like McDonald's and KFC, like in Myanmar.

266
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:07,490
One of my colleagues, he you know, he's upper middle class, fairly well-off.

267
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:11,720
He was going to KFC for his birthday because, you know, that was like the pinnacle of that.

268
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:19,339
And it's you know, there's so many different factors that go into this.

269
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:22,790
But the really big problem worldwide.

270
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:31,250
You also see an increase in in and also a decrease in the quality of food.

271
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:37,149
So, you know, originally what would happen is people would you know, it's almost like a farmer's market.

272
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,570
If you're in Bangladesh going to a grocery store, you're buying a food from the farmer.

273
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,280
But now, if grocery stores come in and more commerce like food industries, you know,

274
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,050
they're using high fructose corn sirup or animal meal to fortify the food.

275
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:54,550
And it isn't, as, you know, high quality food as it was in the past.

276
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:04,420
People often think of nutrition as an issue which solely impacts children.

277
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:11,470
And it is it's a big issue for children, but they are the sole population that's impacted by nutrition issues.

278
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,590
But, you know, it's about saying that a lot of the issues that impact children will stay with them for the rest of lives.

279
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:27,720
So children are malnourished. All that they are. They are for whatever other reason of low rate.

280
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:31,680
They'll be stunted cognitively as well as physically.

281
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:36,120
Those are issues they won't recover from in their life, and they'll mean when they're adults,

282
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:45,269
they won't be able to work in some jobs or achieve as high levels of education and ultimately won't be able to generate as

283
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:54,570
much income of maternal women who are pregnant as have growth health outcomes when it comes to when they're malnourished.

284
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,730
There is a program in the U.S. which is absolutely fantastical because anybody in America is.

285
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,120
Somebody willing to give a little. Explanation of it.

286
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:18,070
Yep. Like in the context of like providing for the. I don't know much about it or like providing nutrition with the mother, but they did have formula.

287
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:29,889
Yeah. Yeah. So there's both. So it's a little formula for babies and that kind of thing, but it's also milk and food and juice and mothers as well.

288
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:35,080
And then in some states, it starts before the child is born with mother.

289
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:43,180
So pregnant is absolutely fantastic for supporting mothers who are pregnant so that they are healthy but a child's born healthy.

290
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:50,170
And then after making sure they're in enough to promote, to produce good quality of breast milk is really important.

291
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:57,830
Of course, nutrition or nutritional issues can cause chronic disease like diabetes, hypertension.

292
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:05,990
Quite a few of the stuff. And what impacts everybody is when people get diseases, they go to the hospital.

293
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:11,139
You have to pay for that treatment. You need to you know, they all contribute to society.

294
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,820
There's a lot of issues then that cause the financial burden for everybody in the economy.

295
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,660
So we're just going to walk through this conceptual framework on the economic impacts of malnutrition.

296
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:30,200
So at the worst level of malnutrition causes mortality for the individual.

297
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:34,520
That is high cost of treatment. Your loved one dies, funerals, all that stuff.

298
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:41,370
Societally. The population level goes down, which is great.

299
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:47,970
You know, spending down in the community, there can be a big impact on social fabric.

300
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:53,350
Nationwide. Again, there's loss of human capital left people to work in the economy.

301
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:04,179
Of course, then you have the mobility. So different diseases from being malnourished, which partially causes, you know,

302
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:08,860
costs of treatment and costs associated with lost income and contributes to the

303
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:14,230
burden of disease and nationwide issues of paying for care in the economy.

304
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:23,290
We discussed physical stunting, which again people won't be able to work as well, less people working the economy and decreased economic output.

305
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,670
And finally, cognitive stunting, which has the same things people won't be able to get as educated.

306
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:38,290
The economy won't be as productive. And you really struggle with achieving development goals.

307
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:45,080
And just going back to this as well, it's really important.

308
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:52,069
For better or for worse, when you're working on public programing to discuss the economic impacts where you're

309
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:56,360
doing because the people who are funding you like governments or the World Bank,

310
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,840
whoever they care about, the economics don't really care so much about the human impacts.

311
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:05,120
So make sure even if you don't agree with this and think this is a good thing,

312
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,150
they can still at least articulate it and understand these kind of models.

313
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:20,730
What's really interesting is that malnutrition doesn't directly often kill children.

314
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:31,650
Over here, it isn't even a. A little like for malnutrition, but malnutrition impacts different diseases so much.

315
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:38,390
Neonates. If the mother is malnourished like we just talked about, there's going to be bad outcomes.

316
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:45,790
All of these infectious diseases all around are also very heavily impacted by nutrition.

317
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:55,890
And it's a whole cycle and there's so much you have to think about. And we can start, I suppose, over here if you are.

318
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:04,190
Undernourished. You're going to have less immunity. Your body doesn't have the energy to fight infections, which brings up the risk of disease.

319
00:37:05,010 --> 00:37:10,730
So you're probably going to get a disease. When you get disease again, you need calories to fight the infection.

320
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:15,830
But also you're going to have less appetite and you're not going to absorb nutrients as well.

321
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:21,290
One of the most common infectious diseases I see is diarrhea.

322
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:32,360
And when someone has diarrhea, especially chronic diarrhea, diarrhea, quite often what happens is the lining of the intestine starts degrading.

323
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:38,180
So instead of like being nice and kind of bumpy and stuff, it becomes smooth, it's cold and properly.

324
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,990
And when you have interrupted, you can't absorb nutrients.

325
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:52,520
So you'll be in scenarios of Bang. This is a great example, but you'll just always have diarrhea or some kind of enteric infection.

326
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,420
And because of that, they actually just can't absorb nutrients from food no matter how much they eat.

327
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,680
And then because there's so much nourished, the immunity goes down again.

328
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:10,220
It's just a really, really vicious cycle. And you can see here, this is the contribution of childhood mobility after infection amelioration.

329
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:17,090
And because of that cycle, it's far greater than the sum of its parts when they interact with each other.

330
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:38,040
But it's also important to consider because of this, it's not just severe malnutrition, which which causes death, but even moderate malnutrition,

331
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:48,180
chemicals that you can see the mortality rate is still existing over here for children who are only 80% below the rate for age ratio,

332
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:52,290
also 20% below 80% of the rate for age ratio.

333
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:03,770
And over here you can see all of the different morbidities that malnutrition contributes to.

334
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:12,500
So and you see that most infectious disease. So pneumonia, diarrhea, measles, malaria, other infections and neonatal infections.

335
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:21,020
And it's really important for anybody studying infectious disease, for projects to consider malnutrition as part of this.

336
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:29,520
But going back to other age groups. Let's discuss malnutrition and older adults.

337
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:34,790
So adults over the age of 65, it's associated.

338
00:39:34,970 --> 00:39:45,430
Malnutrition is associated with other commodities and people who are medications really, because there's a lot of appetite for these medications.

339
00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:53,320
Also, some medications can cause entropy, the inability to absorb nutrients, which can cause these.

340
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:00,970
The biggest example I can think of is HIV, which can cause entropy and associated associated malnutrition.

341
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:09,760
And because the population around the world is aging so much and society's public health systems aren't prepared for it,

342
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:12,760
this is becoming a really severe problem.

343
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:24,190
There are a lot of example, a lot of assumptions on how to reduce malnutrition populations, but a lot of them don't really work that well.

344
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:33,490
The first assumption is people assume that just by improving economies, you will improve nutrition outcomes.

345
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,050
So there's different countries.

346
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,050
The stomach problem for us is that GDP per capita.

347
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:56,280
And look, if you were just to assume that probably that as something goes down, as GDP goes up, you'd be blue lighting up.

348
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,360
But the actual green line here is,

349
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:07,170
you see there's still a gap between something and where you actually stand here ready to expect it to be by eliminating poverty.

350
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:10,740
And again, a big reason for this is probably inequity.

351
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,400
And nations come out of poverty. And we'll talk about that in a second.

352
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:18,480
But also, don't forget the double and triple burden of malnutrition.

353
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:28,110
You can see over here that as per capita GDP goes up, you have a pretty big increase, particularly in the initial stages of BMI.

354
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:35,610
It's kind of what we hear is that stuff's getting unhealthy depending on certain factors.

355
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,910
And this is well within the line of best fit.

356
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:49,270
Going back to the inequity issue similar to the economy, people assume that when you have increased food production,

357
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:56,320
there'll be better nutritional outcomes for the population, less malnourished, undernourished children.

358
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:59,620
And this is to some extent true.

359
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:10,420
But you see in countries with thousand calories per person, you still have a 10 to 20% rate of stunting, which is which is quite high.

360
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:13,720
You'd expect this to be low if those calories were distributed accurately.

361
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:27,630
And the other issue is people think siloed interventions will impact malnutrition, but solid interventions in public health almost never, never work.

362
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:36,549
People might say by providing food, we might be able to use medication.

363
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:43,420
And it works sometimes, but it needs to be combined with counseling and improved sanitation, decreasing taxes, these all kinds of things.

364
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:49,000
Similarly, you can fortify foods, but people don't know that that's foods that children, not for them.

365
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:55,120
You know, that's quite useless. Breastfeeding can be very, very important,

366
00:42:55,450 --> 00:43:01,299
but you have to also support the mother when it comes to breastfeeding and support parents and safe

367
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:07,750
reading from breastfeeding to complimentary best breastfeeding and to no breastfeeding at all.

368
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:12,790
And these are all you know, there's a million different interventions you can look at.

369
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:17,020
But these are some of the most prevalent ones.

370
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:29,810
And we will just now talk briefly about nutrition in emergencies to kind of prepare you for the exercise you will do on Thursday.

371
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:36,079
So in emergency for children, there are two big things you want to do for nutrition.

372
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:43,910
The first is you want to promote breastfeeding. There are very limited circumstances in emergency where you tell a mother she should not breastfeed.

373
00:43:46,070 --> 00:43:51,250
Living with HIV is one, but even then they will try to put the mother on HIV,

374
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:55,160
get them virally suppressed, and make sure the baby's on prep if possible.

375
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:59,780
And the reason for that is breastfeeding is so low cost, it's great formula.

376
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:04,040
You don't have to worry about the safety of the water you're mixing the formula with.

377
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:11,510
It's good for mother child bonding. And because, you know, using plastic water bottles, it's better for the environment.

378
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:22,170
In a emergency. You also want to make sure you can treat malnourished children as quickly and easily as possible.

379
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:27,570
And this is what they give them if they're capable of eating. This is called a peanut.

380
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:34,560
It's essentially a peanut butter, but it tastes horrible. I'll certainly get some of the class, but like to import them from France.

381
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,649
It's a whole hassle. But it's tiny.

382
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:43,080
But it's like this bag has 500 calories, 32 kilograms of fat,

383
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:50,190
£12 protein and really good amount of calcium, vitamin C, iron, folic acid, vitamin E and vitamin A.

384
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:59,700
So if you give a kid, you know, a couple of these up a few weeks, that could get them from severe acute malnutrition to being healthy quite quickly,

385
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:04,530
of course, making sure they're avoiding infection and have safe water and all of those things.

386
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:10,770
And I'll just play the short video on nutrition in adults.

387
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:31,150
One. That's really.

388
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,510
As a result of this, I decided to.

389
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:12,350
Okay. Well.

390
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:20,100
Right now, like I said.

391
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,630
You have to be. Yes.

392
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:49,530
Okay. That's not the policy. And a little bit.

393
00:46:54,610 --> 00:47:00,690
I'm just. Well, I.

394
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:14,050
That. The Danish.

395
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:28,700
Anthony. But I.

396
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:40,150
We're trying to. I.

397
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:03,430
What does that say? Like.

398
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:21,000
So what used to happen in refugee camps was they would just hand out food that you would line up, and it could be as bad as they would say.

399
00:48:21,020 --> 00:48:26,630
Every household gets one bag of rice, one one like packed into beans, whatever,

400
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:31,910
and they wouldn't even break it down by how many people live in the houses really badly managed.

401
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:36,980
So they then moved to a system where it was like they would give the amount of food you need for your household.

402
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:40,760
But, you know, still you getting the food they give you, there was no choice at all.

403
00:48:41,990 --> 00:48:50,630
They're starting to move towards a system where every person living in a refugee camp is given, you know, essentially a preloaded debit card.

404
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:58,700
And then they can go to a, you know, a local store or, you know, a refugee camp store and spend that money over there on the food they need,

405
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:06,049
which is awesome, because they can get that food, the food they need. But it's also always given to the women in refugee camps.

406
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:12,320
So this actually works out as well for women to make better decisions about the health of themselves and their families.

407
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:19,280
Between those two steps, you often find what's being done over here, but they kind of follow this out on pregnant women.

408
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:28,860
So we are now going to move into a discussion and Jonathan is going to come up and show us how to use something called jumbled.

409
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:37,690
You figured it out. All right.

410
00:49:37,870 --> 00:49:47,680
I don't know if any of you have used gym or clubs before, but I've used it in a few of my classes and I think it's pretty helpful for discussion.

411
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:54,390
So you're going to break up into groups of. Four five.

412
00:49:54,410 --> 00:50:00,170
That's four groups. You get the side of the country and then you can just take notes right on here.

413
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,570
Defining the problem of malnutrition or obesity.

414
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,490
Identifying interventions at the country level. Evaluating their efficacy.

415
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:14,870
And then identifying next steps for what needs to be done further.

416
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,010
You can just add sticky note. So.

417
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:24,240
Because it's ticking now. Change your size. It can change your color.

418
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:28,590
And then just place them on your. To fill this out.

419
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:32,580
So I'll put the questions back up.

420
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:37,140
But the link to the GM part is on the home page on the Excel.

421
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,780
It's also in the PowerPoint that's been uploaded to the file that you can access either way.

422
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:54,800
But the problem is then you all can go ahead and break up into four groups.

423
00:50:55,400 --> 00:51:04,790
And as groups, let's say a group at the end, whoever is judging will be group four.

424
00:51:05,390 --> 00:51:13,030
I'm just going to read them. During the movie. Two, one, two and three, two, four.

425
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:20,790
One, two, three. Yes.

426
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:32,630
Give me. Sorry.

427
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:46,800
I know what it's for.

428
00:51:49,830 --> 00:51:57,960
It might not be enough time. But if we can start reporting back what you discussed in your groups, so which group wants to go first?

429
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:01,760
Let's talk about.

430
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:11,810
We can go first. We're on our way.

431
00:52:11,820 --> 00:52:16,830
So we didn't get there. These are obviously these are complex issues.

432
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:37,620
And similarly, throughout the families, you have a child rates of about 20% of children wasting and then about 16% experiencing obesity.

433
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:44,729
We're not declaring based on the literature that we found so far, that they're from a rural,

434
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:55,050
urban divide here and that urban areas are experiencing higher rates of obesity as occurs in rural areas that are experiencing more child wasting.

435
00:52:57,230 --> 00:53:01,370
And I suspect that's because of the success of access to the quality of food.

436
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:11,000
It's food insecurity and through the reforms of poor access to nutritional balanced diet in urban areas where you.

437
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:18,110
My calorie intake versus the nutrition areas.

438
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:29,090
And I just do lack of access to food in general. But also I've never seen anybody else in the group have anything more to add.

439
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:34,910
Yeah, that's absolutely correct. So you're in Kuala Lumpur for about four months.

440
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:43,580
And, you know, so much of the how cheap the unhealthy food is, you get like fried rice or something like that for like one ringgit, which is $0.20.

441
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:48,370
If you were to buy a salad, you're paying like, you know. Four or $5.

442
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:51,720
So 20 times the amount of fried rice costs.

443
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:58,000
It's a really big issue over that. Okay, fantastic.

444
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,350
Any questions that group or does anybody have any responses to that group?

445
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:11,320
Who wants to go next? Okay?

446
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:16,170
Yep. You guys help yourselves.

447
00:54:17,490 --> 00:54:24,510
So some of our problems that we kind of identified was low birth weight, which be way,

448
00:54:25,110 --> 00:54:37,230
as well as an increase in food insecurity because of COVID and a high prevalence of obesity and people being overweight or so and all age group.

449
00:54:37,770 --> 00:54:46,830
And then I kind of mentioned Zika virus that may be somewhat related to low birth weight and children being underweight.

450
00:54:47,610 --> 00:54:51,410
And then we kind of went over some interventions.

451
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:58,140
So, for example, offering a family grant program for undernutrition,

452
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:07,120
a trans fat policy that has a 2% limit for industrially produced TFA in all oils and foods.

453
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:18,230
So I think TFA stands for trans fatty acids and then a government support program for at risk populations such as like extreme poverty,

454
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,040
like communities that have relatively high poverty.

455
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:29,459
And then as well, talking about new regulations on nutrition label,

456
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:36,210
it's simple and clear icons like the size, high content of saturated fat, added sugar and sodium.

457
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:47,190
And then focus on reduce the obesity rate and reduce at least 30% of consumption of sugary beverages in adults.

458
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:54,500
An increase by 17.8%. The proportion of adults who regularly fruit and vegetables.

459
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:02,000
So that when we look at evaluating our efficacy, we talk about like a family grant program.

460
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:12,770
So although the program has had a positive impact on reducing poverty and inequality, Brazil still has a relatively small budget in the country.

461
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:18,360
And then looking forward, we can further educate the public,

462
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:27,470
the public regarding food security and policymakers and implement local gardens with fresh and affordable produce.

463
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:34,490
But another thing that I think is important is investigating and creating more research

464
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:41,360
regarding malnutrition between areas of higher and common areas with lower income.

465
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:44,720
So one example would be like the favelas and Rio.

466
00:56:45,230 --> 00:56:51,080
And then looking at like we found them all, which is like a relatively wealthier part of Rio,

467
00:56:51,410 --> 00:56:58,310
and seeing the differences between those two communities, anybody else, a group has something more to that.

468
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:06,380
Any questions or responses from the class? But I know we've done there as well.

469
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:16,790
So this is my analysis. I was a little kid. There's a program called Zero Hunger in Public Schools where they give you little like comic books,

470
00:57:16,970 --> 00:57:21,620
like characters from our literature and explain like how important it is to your wealth.

471
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:27,170
And you'll see this literature observable since their grades are taught how to do it properly,

472
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:31,400
and that everything that we do is that all public schools, they offer free lunches.

473
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:35,810
There is no visiting a pay line, so it just goes down by Christmas.

474
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,510
And as soon as my little my little sister school run out,

475
00:57:38,810 --> 00:57:45,890
she goes the whole month or like in her squadron of like what she's doing, how many more transport are there?

476
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:49,909
So this is a program nationwide and then we want to statewide.

477
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:52,190
I know that my home state, we have a restaurant,

478
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:57,950
they fly through the Saints and you have a whole complete meal of it when visiting the trans people there two times a day.

479
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:03,390
I didn't ask anyone to just pick it up and go and eat it. So, yeah, that's really interesting.

480
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:09,020
Do you think having those programs in schools translates to a healthier lifestyle that adulthood,

481
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:17,950
or do you think you just get about it when they go there? I'm curious because I grew up going to my public schools and I know like seven year olds,

482
00:58:17,970 --> 00:58:22,910
like first grade, we had a little garden class that we go to the garden like,

483
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:30,499
you know, we plant carrots, spinach, we do like recipes from basil since we're a little kids will learn how to freeze veggies and legumes.

484
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:34,580
And, you know, obviously it's like how to cook them in the kitchen. So we get to use them.

485
00:58:34,910 --> 00:58:40,340
And also, as you point out, a lot of people go there to glorify a fast food culture a lot.

486
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:48,620
So is the people. Even though we have high risk cities that bring up more resources, more money for those places,

487
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:52,489
but younger people, you know, they don't got that always fast from as much as here.

488
00:58:52,490 --> 00:58:57,229
So but it's really interesting it's really good to see is that is such a all

489
00:58:57,230 --> 00:59:03,020
encompassing intervention that's not just solitude impacting the children.

490
00:59:03,020 --> 00:59:09,200
And then you have all these things that adults and impacting the economy that's it's there's a lot going on there which is lovely.

491
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:13,980
Who wants to go next? Which group? Yes. Yes.

492
00:59:14,090 --> 00:59:18,200
And Ethiopia or UAE.

493
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:29,870
So. Yes, so we did the UAE. Some of the problems that we found of their high rates is like anemia over the obesity.

494
00:59:29,870 --> 00:59:39,000
Be like one of the big ones that kind of really stood out. And we also have about 6% of the population in the UAE is.

495
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:43,220
And you also mentioned there was a high migrant worker population.

496
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,590
Um so what we found or at.

497
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:57,470
Caroline. Caroline found out how to have lower incomes which contribute to their having me

498
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:03,139
being undernutrition or undernourished acutely and in some of the interventions.

499
01:00:03,140 --> 01:00:09,469
So we found that the government had been to sell junk food in school canteens

500
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:13,880
and try to limit the number of fast food or casual places around schools.

501
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,200
There is like a health campaign in Abu Dhabi,

502
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:27,109
which is the second largest city where they're basically having like food and grocery stores being clearly identified as healthy.

503
01:00:27,110 --> 01:00:38,810
So kind of like a. And then there's also the national security strategy, which is one which like aims to have resilient agriculture,

504
01:00:39,020 --> 01:00:42,200
resilient agricultural practices to increase food productivity.

505
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:51,290
And if you check if anybody has the group have anything more to add, these are one question.

506
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:57,380
So you mentioned 6% of children were undernourished or was the population persistent population?

507
01:00:57,980 --> 01:01:08,360
I also feel like I want to add something. I know that in the United Arab Emirates, especially, like in Dubai, we have a lot of outsourced workers.

508
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:14,210
The comment that live a completely different lives than most of the citizens hearing.

509
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:22,030
So I'm just curious what the differences are in terms of nutrition for those workers that are helping.

510
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:30,719
Don't look like. Brand. Yeah, that was pretty good Christmas.

511
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:35,750
Talking about the migrant population, at least from a little bit of the time,

512
01:01:35,750 --> 01:01:40,760
seems to be more likely to have the undernourishment problem versus like the

513
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,479
data that was collected on the obesity problem because that's so prevalent,

514
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:50,959
seem to be more people who work for it. So because a lot of that that was assessed like epigenetic factors and stuff,

515
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:58,730
which I think was just for the people who were like, No, but don't forget, you also have two migrant populations in the UAE.

516
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:04,130
You have who they call the expats who are rich by your book that's coming from the UK or USA.

517
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:08,570
And you know, they're very well off. They are probably undernourished.

518
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:15,200
But then you have the people who you call the migrant workers coming from Pakistan and Bangladesh or other countries,

519
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:20,510
and they're the ones who are probably going to be undernourished. Any other questions for this group or comments?

520
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:25,430
The last group on Ethiopia.

521
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:35,050
So most of the issues surrounding malnutrition and Ethiopia were focused on undernourishment, specifically that of like infants, children and women.

522
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:40,490
So I found a statistic and that was that.

523
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:51,600
25% of the population was undernourished and 57% of the population experienced moderate or severe food insecurity.

524
01:02:52,170 --> 01:03:00,180
And more specifically, 38% of children under five are stunted growth and 24% are underweight.

525
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:09,660
And one of the major issues that they're facing is inadequate maternal nourishment so that the infants and children can be fed properly.

526
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:20,850
Despite the fact that 97% of intensive breast fed, only 58% are exclusively breastfed and only 45% are fed at least three times a day.

527
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:27,030
And so that's a really big issue and something that we've found and like the data on there we're looking at it

528
01:03:27,030 --> 01:03:35,129
is that the undernourishment and malnutrition and Ethiopia had been declining pretty steadily until about 2016,

529
01:03:35,130 --> 01:03:40,380
which is when the civil war broke out and which started rocketing up again.

530
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:48,270
So the lack of food is impacted by factors like the Civil War, as well as flooding and droughts and 2021.

531
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,970
It all sort of came together in a really horrible storm.

532
01:03:51,480 --> 01:04:02,190
And in the Tigray region, I'm not sure how to pronounce that, that there was a massive drought and I can't remember.

533
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:09,120
It was like a massive ecological event and the entire region was left stranded without food for a really long time,

534
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:14,370
and they're still feeling the consequences of that. And you found that a little bit.

535
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:27,270
Yeah, I found a couple articles on this war in Tigray, but it seems to have left the majority of the population,

536
01:04:27,270 --> 01:04:33,420
especially of people, very undernourished, dying of starvation.

537
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:40,710
So this is like 50 to 100 deaths per day and a little bit too.

538
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,720
Obviously, there might not be food over the first thing, but the Civil War,

539
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:50,310
so the government might be stopping the food from going in the first country.

540
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,180
Yes, we found a lot of USAID interventions.

541
01:04:54,480 --> 01:05:03,990
There's pretty long list of them, but we found buried there and at least in the USAID paper, there is no evaluation of their efficacy.

542
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,660
But there was a considerable number of programs that are still running.

543
01:05:10,390 --> 01:05:18,000
Most of them were like up to 2025. I think you touched on most of the main points of that.

544
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:25,200
It's such a complex issue. I mean, everywhere, but especially in Ethiopia, especially since the civil war.

545
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:36,590
So, so great. If you go if you have more questions on Ethiopia, Suzanne Gosselin who lectured last week on the lecture on Thursday.

546
01:05:37,170 --> 01:05:41,969
I'm pretty sure she spent some time over the Civil War, at least in a similar context.

547
01:05:41,970 --> 01:05:49,410
So certainly ask her any any questions at all before we wrap up.

548
01:05:50,910 --> 01:05:56,720
Oh, yes. I was just wondering whether you think that the camera's for excellence.

549
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:02,410
Honestly, no reasoning or something.

550
01:06:02,780 --> 01:06:07,180
I think at first I could use a because this so interesting and it's quite different.

551
01:06:07,190 --> 01:06:16,460
But the burden of ABC over that and the network Malaysia because I live this and know quite well and then.

552
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:22,670
Brazil and Ethiopia. I have no idea. Mm hmm.

553
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:26,700
Any. Any other questions? Okay.

554
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:30,800
We'll see you all on Thursday. Jonathan Ima.
