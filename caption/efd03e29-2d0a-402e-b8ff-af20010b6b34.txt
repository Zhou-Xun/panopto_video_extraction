1
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:31,410
Okay. Good morning, everyone. So first of all, just a couple of things.

2
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:35,990
So you may have noticed that they posted homework, too.

3
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:43,180
So it's going to be due October 10th. So let me know if you have any questions on it.

4
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:55,330
And then so I keep getting questions during office hours and otherwise on the limits of sense and especially things like this.

5
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:02,140
So what you see on the first lines or why is the countable intersection of uh, uh,

6
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:15,490
and then to the open on the left with a uh minus one over, uh, is going to become the closed one on the left with a point a being the.

7
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,090
Left end of the interval. Uh.

8
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:33,800
So, um, I told you that I'm fine with you treating these things intuitively, but it appears that that does take some time to develop that intuition.

9
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:40,790
So. Uh, what I did, I spelled out why this is the case with all the bells and whistles.

10
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,750
Um, and essentially, if you want to show.

11
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:51,530
So with this equation, the countable intersection is a set and the interval of the right is a set.

12
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:02,390
So in order to show that two sets are equal. So the proof technique is to show that every point of the first set is also a member of the other set.

13
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:11,970
So that's the. That the first step is a subset and then a need to show that there is nothing extra in that second set out there.

14
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:17,490
So you need to show it the other way around that. The second set is also a subset of the first one.

15
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,860
Right. And so the.

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:33,190
And so I'm simply inviting you to look at the note if you don't yet have an intuition for how to write these things.

17
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:45,300
Uh, but, uh. So essentially. First thing to show is that, uh, the point, eh, is actually going to be part of that intersection.

18
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,840
And that's because the point is part of the every single interval, regardless of when.

19
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
Right. And that's by definition what the intersection is going to be.

20
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:03,370
Intersection. So that gives it one way the subset statement.

21
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,930
So the other way I work through a complement.

22
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:17,680
So I say that if I take any point left away or any point right of me, that's not going to be in that.

23
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:23,700
Uh, countable. Intersection. So.

24
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,990
And that. That's the complement thing. And then.

25
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,610
Something somehow did not sync correctly.

26
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:44,640
Because I apparently have more to it's. I'm hoping I put the full note.

27
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:30,000
Right. So this is a better one. So I show that nothing left or right, uh, of, of A or B respectively, uh, is in the countable intersection.

28
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:35,040
So namely that then the union of these two pieces.

29
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:42,150
So left of A and right of B is actually part of the complement of what we want.

30
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:51,180
Right. And then I'm using, uh, some, uh. Quick note on.

31
00:04:53,550 --> 00:05:01,830
The relationship between the something being a subset of the compliment and then what it means for.

32
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:09,100
So if A is part of the compliment, so what does it tell us about B?

33
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,600
So that means B is part of a compliment. So there's a small argument.

34
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:25,690
About it. And like I said, you can either use the formality that's on the left of the circled area.

35
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:30,160
That would be kind of an algebraic argument to it.

36
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,660
Or you can simply use a van diagram. For that.

37
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,780
Right. And simply visualize what what's going on. Right.

38
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:48,139
So the first thing to show is that A and B are in this joint because of the air being part of the complement.

39
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:52,480
And then. Anyway.

40
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:59,650
Okay. And then I have a couple of notes in general on treating infinities and limits.

41
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:06,340
So what this example shows is that so we cannot actually take a limit.

42
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:13,929
So something you have accountable in the section accountable union in some sense inside it depend on.

43
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:16,960
And so there's a sequence of them, right?

44
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,950
So it's actually not always the case that you can take the type of set you have,

45
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:29,709
which in this case is and then in the interval closed on the right and open on the

46
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:40,180
left that's under the countable union and then take a limit of A of M and writes,

47
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:46,329
The answer is still an interval of the same type open on the left,

48
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:58,990
closed on the right with a of an replaced by the limits of K of Amazon of anything that doesn't work right and or that does not always work,

49
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:08,050
let's say. And so you, you should have some intuition for why this is the case, because you can't do it with functions, right?

50
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:17,170
Uh, if you have a sequence and you're considering a function of X and where exactly is a sequence of numbers,

51
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,890
you can say that the limit of that function is the function of the limit of access,

52
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:32,019
not always, at least, because what you can say is that, well, if the function is continuous, then it is the case.

53
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,710
But in general it's not right. And same thing here some.

54
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:39,640
Sometimes there is continuity like that, sometimes there isn't.

55
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,440
Then another note probably to clear up possible other confusions.

56
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:56,410
Is that so? Whenever in mathematics you have an integral or a union to or in the section that goes to infinity.

57
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:01,410
So the itself is not included. Right.

58
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:08,950
So the. So if I take, for example, accountable union of some OEM's.

59
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:14,560
Uh, like, uh, I have right here.

60
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:29,650
Like a half here. Right. So a Infiniti is actually not part of that union.

61
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:37,150
Same with the Integrale. So if you take an integral from some point to infinity of whatever d x,

62
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:44,340
so that the integral is not taking over the value of this function at infinity.

63
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:52,030
Right. That infinite is excluded. And I gave an illustration briefly.

64
00:08:53,140 --> 00:09:02,680
Um. One of the previous lectures that was related to pure models in survival analysis.

65
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,140
So if you kill somebody, that means survival time to to.

66
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:16,739
The survival time for the bad events is infinitely larger because it never happens if you killed the person.

67
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:26,820
So that means and if there is a non-zero chance of this happening, then the probability that t is equal to infinity is going to be greater than zero.

68
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:37,810
Right? And if you have a pdf of T and integrated the way PDFs are usually defined, so that will give you something less than one.

69
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:41,370
It will not include the point of infinity, right?

70
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:47,040
So it would actually be one minus probability that T is equal to infinity.

71
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:54,970
Because that integral does not include what happens right at your feet.

72
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:00,910
And so you can see it also in the notation that's used in mathematics.

73
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:06,100
So whenever you have an interval of up to infinity, it's open here, right?

74
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:11,490
So you may have noticed that. And this is for a reason whenever I write it like this.

75
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:18,790
Right. That's because. And then to go from zero to infinity is defined as a limit like this,

76
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:28,299
where needless to infinity and the limit may or may not coincide with the value of the function at the limits.

77
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:39,890
Right. And the integral like this has actually taken over, uh, this type of notation that's open at infinity.

78
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,640
Okay. So that was kind of a brief note, preventing some confusions.

79
00:10:49,640 --> 00:11:00,120
So I guess the message here is a. So why is it?

80
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:03,980
Why? This is why it's not sinking.

81
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,709
I'll give it a second. If it doesn't work, I'll just do offline.

82
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:53,050
And then. You go out. What's the problem?

83
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:02,690
Reason it's not sinking. So do have connection.

84
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,660
Just. That's.

85
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:26,060
Oh, yeah. So now it works. Okay.

86
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:37,160
So that was the note. Motivated by your questions on the homework and lectures.

87
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:43,790
And by the way, so the more questions you ask, the more notes like this, I will put as a clarification.

88
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,070
So it's actually a good idea to ask as many questions as.

89
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:57,700
You have. Part of the learning as I found myself.

90
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:06,510
Was asking yourself stupid questions. All of this stuff, and that clarifies things a lot.

91
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:15,660
So don't be afraid that people will think it's a stupid question.

92
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:27,030
Stupid questions are most valuable, actually. At some point you will learn to ask them of yourself and then find answers to them.

93
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:30,150
And this is where you are self-sufficient in learning.

94
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:39,650
Okay. So let's briefly look at what we had, uh, during our last lecture.

95
00:13:51,300 --> 00:14:01,590
So we looked at the types of distributions and we defined, uh, kind of the, we are of the animals in those.

96
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:11,390
That was singular distributions or distributions with singular support, and they were the ones that give continuous CDF.

97
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,930
Uh, that's, uh, constant, almost everywhere.

98
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:25,770
And yet it manages to grow from 0 to 1 on the set of measure zero while being continuous.

99
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,160
In a comment or function that I alluded to was an example of that.

100
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:43,380
Uh, then so we looked at the integrals because I'm trying to approach a point where I can define an expectation.

101
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,899
Hopefully that's going to be today and later on it's going to be conditional expectation.

102
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:54,470
That's kind of a short term outlook of of what's going to happen in the next couple of lectures.

103
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,770
And the expectation will be an integral.

104
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:09,050
That's why we bothered refreshing kind of our knowledge on what were the integrals in calculus and then what are the generalizations of those?

105
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:16,080
Um. Into the ones that are used in real analysis and probability.

106
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:25,260
And so the short message will be that the expectation in general is in the bag integral.

107
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,320
So we need to find out what what that is.

108
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:35,160
Well, we looked at the integrals that are defined in calculus and a bit more.

109
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:44,970
So first was the Riemann integral. And the idea of that integral was that we drop the x axis to find an area under the curve.

110
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:58,500
Then we minimize and maximize the function on each of the intervals and then build to some of the minimal or maximal value of that function.

111
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:08,130
That would be the the low in the upper w sums times the length of the interval and then take the limit as the intervals become finer and finer.

112
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,170
And if that limit exists, we said that this is the remaining integral.

113
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:24,140
Right. So that's a good thing, except it doesn't work really well for, uh, uh, some of the functions.

114
00:16:25,130 --> 00:16:34,700
And also it's, uh, it doesn't spell out what happens to functions that have a discrete components or functions that jump.

115
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:40,590
Um, and we have cases where CDV jumps.

116
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,540
And we know that CDV is an integral over the PTF.

117
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:55,790
But what would be a PDF of the jump? Uh, so we know CDF is a derivative of the pdf, but at the jump the derivative is well.

118
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:05,250
So if you are taking calculus one or one or whatever, where they talk about derivatives for the first time, they will say it's undefined, probably.

119
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:13,200
Uh, but there is a way to define it and define it specifically with a probability of the statistics in mind.

120
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:22,920
And we took a page from, uh, uh, the, uh, the thing that exists in mathematics, which is generalized functions.

121
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:25,710
And one of them is difference delta function.

122
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:35,760
And we defined it, uh, uh, kind of from a six or one point of view as a limit to a normal distribution or in fact any other.

123
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:41,070
Uh, there are infinitely many distributions that will have these there.

124
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:47,400
Now the function is limited. We took the normal one and said that we, uh, drive the variance to zero.

125
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:53,370
And at the minute, we will have a function that's zero everywhere except the point where it's sitting.

126
00:17:54,480 --> 00:18:04,540
And that would be the mean of that normal distribution. Uh, and so at that point, we both had a spike to infinity.

127
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,220
So the value of that function is.

128
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:19,910
Infinity at that point does have a property inherited from the fact that it's still a distribution of now of a degenerate nonrandom variable.

129
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:24,229
And as a distribution, if we integrate it, that gives us a Y, right?

130
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,940
That's a PDF. And that brought us to a.

131
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:42,460
The, uh. And in a parallel development, we basically looked at a generalization of the Roman integral in that.

132
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:55,270
So the Riemann integral used delta X in that limit of the double sum and delta x was the size of the interval, the length of the interval.

133
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:58,629
And we can say that this is that length is a measure.

134
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,990
So this is a measured length.

135
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:07,239
So what if we replace it by not necessarily in the bag measure,

136
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:18,800
but any other probability measure and that would make a difference between CDs and uh, in terms of such seeds that could,

137
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:25,209
they could be of an absolutely continuous random variable giving us a probability

138
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,330
measure that's absolutely continuous with respect to the bag measure.

139
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:35,200
Or we can have a mixed one, uh, that's both discrete and continuous.

140
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,510
Right. And in that case of generalizes, the uh, integral, uh.

141
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:50,380
And so then so we defined an integral that deals with jumps.

142
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:57,610
And so finally we.

143
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:08,690
Sad that, uh, we will actually consider, uh, PDFs now of mixed discrete continuous distribution.

144
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:13,020
So pdf. Of mixed.

145
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,630
He's created continuous. Distribution.

146
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,400
That they have a form of. Um.

147
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:42,670
The pdf of the continuous part. Plus some of the key.

148
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:52,060
Of some probabilities peak times those delta functions X minus x.

149
00:20:54,110 --> 00:21:05,780
I. And that has a form. Uh, so if we want to grab something like this, well, there's a PDF until there is a point, uh, x one.

150
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:10,610
And at that point there is a spike right to infinity.

151
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:19,400
That's the delta function sitting at that point. And there's still some behavior, continuous behavior.

152
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:24,800
Then we have the next point x2 and then there is another spike and so on.

153
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:36,570
Now, if you integrate this from zero to some X, what's going to happen is that, well, because it's the sum of the two components.

154
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:45,149
So the first one will give uh, uh, kind of a similar thing to a pdf of an absolutely continuous random variable,

155
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:51,480
except that it's not going to give you one if you integrate it from minus infinity to infinity.

156
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:58,380
But then you will have each of these spikes because they are delta functions, they will integrate two one.

157
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:06,780
Uh, and so you will take that integral over so any of the spikes that are included in the area of integration.

158
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:14,200
So you could say that the CTF of a discrete continuous random variable.

159
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:27,360
Just create a continuous random variable that's going to be integral minus infinity, two x of the continuous component of it.

160
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:45,340
Plus you will have a sum over key such that x k's less or equal x of the p ks and the deltas will integrate to work.

161
00:22:53,650 --> 00:23:03,430
Right. And you can write it in general for any area of integration, not necessarily from minus infinity to X as well.

162
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:19,090
Okay. Then we said, well, okay. That serves all the cases where we have a sample space or a simpler thing where our Omega is, uh, on the real line.

163
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,649
Yeah, it's, it's number one. It is a number, right?

164
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:30,880
But the way we defined the fundamentals of the probability theory is that we.

165
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:36,340
Can we want to have a generality that Omega is not numbers.

166
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:41,290
It could be anything. And we don't have an integral for that.

167
00:23:41,430 --> 00:24:00,400
Um. Anything. And then so we finished with an idea of the big integral, and that's going to be the one that partitions, uh, the function of Omega.

168
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,990
Right. So this is some function that we want to go and say, Excellent.

169
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:11,550
And I'm integrating it somehow. And I want to do.

170
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,090
And then the growth of X of omega.

171
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,890
DP of Omega. Something like this.

172
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:30,240
So I want an integral with respect to Masa that's not defined in the real line that is defined for an arbitrary Omega.

173
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:43,380
Yeah. But I may not know how to, uh, partition my x axis now that it is not necessarily an axis of numbers.

174
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:48,950
So I don't know what this is. Because I'm in the general situation.

175
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:54,650
So instead. So the idea is to partition.

176
00:24:55,810 --> 00:25:00,850
Uh, the Y-axis. Right. And we took an interval on the Y axis.

177
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:05,650
Let's see the I. Right. So that's the element of that partitioning.

178
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:19,360
And because we know that Acts of Omega is a measurable function, uh, we know that we will be able to find, uh, X minus one of the.

179
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:27,430
And that's going to be pre imaged. Right. That's the set of Omega such that the values of my random variables fall into the interval by.

180
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:34,450
Right. And in this picture, these are two in total.

181
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,760
So this is one of them. This is another one.

182
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,260
And if the function goes back up, then well, maybe more of them.

183
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:57,200
Right. But the fact about them is that because X of Omega is measurable, I can find a measure of the union of these intervals on the omega axis.

184
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:03,860
So I would know what the probability of the pre image of the eye is.

185
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:26,460
Right. So and I have I can approximate my function, let's say while analog have a lower divorce rate, I can take the minimal value off my ex.

186
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:43,780
Minimal value of X of Omega. Uh, on the x minus one was the I.

187
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:53,500
So what is it? So now I don't need.

188
00:26:53,920 --> 00:27:00,940
So in the case of Everyman or even steel, it's integral to get that their boots on.

189
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:07,060
I actually have to maximize and minimize the function within the delta interval

190
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:12,340
to find out what the minimal value of it is and the maximal value what is right.

191
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:17,020
But in this construction, I have them already by definition, right?

192
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:24,280
So if I say that my set is formed by taking a pre image of the eye.

193
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:31,959
So that's a set of of omegas that give me x of omega values in the interval.

194
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:42,450
By then the lowest value of x of omega on that side will be the left hand of the eye, and the highest value will be the right hand of the by.

195
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,390
Right. So the minimum is actually right here.

196
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:58,430
That's it. Lieutenant.

197
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:04,349
By saying with the maximum. So the maximum will be the right.

198
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:17,420
And that would be. Now we won't need the device that we have to send with our integral, uh,

199
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:23,530
the kind of an approximation to our integral between the lower their boots, some of the upper their bosom.

200
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:29,350
We can just do the lower one and namely approximate x.

201
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:35,270
By the lowest rate. So this will be.

202
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:44,170
So these two values will be the approximations.

203
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:50,550
Of Acts of cornaga. On.

204
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:58,500
The intervals like these by the left hand.

205
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:07,510
Of the I. That is the lowest value.

206
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,440
Yeah. So far I made. On.

207
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:27,810
X minus one. Here. Okay.

208
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:35,130
And you can picture what happens if I do it for every single element of my Y access potential.

209
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:40,500
Right? So I will have a function that is kind of a step function.

210
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:46,220
Right. That's lower than the target function x of omega.

211
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:54,200
Right. But it's not happening in one interval intervals because the generally the pre image can give me many.

212
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:06,390
And then all of these intervals. So X is approximated by, uh, the lowest, uh, value.

213
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:16,540
So that means that. That approximating the integral.

214
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:39,240
So the integral will be called eventually back. Uh, right.

215
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:43,880
So I basically defined the function in a five major.

216
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,890
And I see that it's equal to, uh, the left and.

217
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:03,210
Of the. On.

218
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:09,420
X minus one of BMI.

219
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:15,220
And I have the eyes.

220
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:23,950
I from one to ends, let's say I divide my Y-axis into n intervals.

221
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:33,570
So this is a partition. Of the range.

222
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:44,490
Yeah. And that range of axes are in general.

223
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:06,130
Okay. And then. So I can say that my integral.

224
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:20,100
The approximation to it. Is going to be equal, the sum of those values.

225
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:32,920
So let me give them some notation. Right. So the left hand of by next time.

226
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:36,700
Oh. So that's going to be the x i m.

227
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:56,720
By definition. Right.

228
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,300
Then this is going to be a somehow from one to and.

229
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,450
It's ten times the probability.

230
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:12,070
Oh, that's. Set.

231
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:26,700
So how does it feel? So if I asked you to characterize what kind of random variable excel of Omega ese that I had just built.

232
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:34,760
What would you say? Because we had a classification of them, right?

233
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:43,650
That they're absolutely continuous, discrete, mixed, uh, that singular distributions of omega.

234
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:48,600
What kind of distribution is going to have. What's your feeling?

235
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:59,140
So I apparently have, uh. A partition.

236
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:05,920
Oh, and by the way, partition of the range of X actually induces a partition of Onaga.

237
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:13,350
Right. So my sense. X minus one.

238
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:22,980
Of the I. He's.

239
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:30,410
If partition. Army guy.

240
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:36,150
Well, maybe not exactly a partition in the sense that the union makes up the whole of it.

241
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:41,590
So that will happen only in the limit where when that goes to infinity.

242
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:49,250
Of. Uh. So more accurately would be of a subset of only the.

243
00:34:55,690 --> 00:35:05,010
So a finite segment. I wanted to. Right.

244
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:09,020
So now if I look at things backwards, right?

245
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:20,360
So I have some intervals that make up a subset and I define a random variable such that it's going to be a constant on those intervals.

246
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:26,510
Right? That's the left hand of the B is going to be a constant on X minus one of B,

247
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:36,950
and there is a probability to that constant, attached to that constant, which is this P of x minus one by one.

248
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:47,540
What what is that? So if I have, it's a disjoint set of sets and I define my random variable as being constant in each of them.

249
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:59,980
That's a discrete random variable, right? So this construction means that my approximate accelerometer.

250
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,040
He's. A discreet.

251
00:36:07,990 --> 00:36:13,540
Random variable. Right.

252
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:20,920
And this almost brings me to the definition of laid back integral.

253
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:38,360
So let me just do it. So the.

254
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:51,410
First of all, I will define the class of discrete vendor variables that I used here in this example.

255
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:57,830
Namely, I want them to be non-negative and I want them to have finite values.

256
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:10,050
I will just call them simple. Random variable x and these.

257
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:17,340
A discreet. Non negative.

258
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,090
Random the variable. We?

259
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:34,240
Finite. Number.

260
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:47,450
Of possible values. And in this case, it's family.

261
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:56,150
The number of values he. Then I will define notation.

262
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:16,430
For the bad in the growth. So.

263
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,210
And that notation will be the expected value of X.

264
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:28,010
It's going to be an integral.

265
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:45,510
Over acts of omega, the p of omega, right where x is a random variable and I have the probability space that's the capital of omega if.

266
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:50,860
P and X is measurable.

267
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:05,960
On the measurables pace on the graph. And so we approximate this.

268
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:13,750
And this. He's defined.

269
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:23,250
For. Is is the limits.

270
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:40,300
Of. And the growth of X Dam of omega GP omega.

271
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,490
Four. Simple. Yeah.

272
00:39:48,770 --> 00:39:56,820
Yeah. Well. That's an approximate.

273
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:09,170
Yes. Better and better.

274
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:15,140
This is a somewhat informal definition, so we need to fill the blanks to make it formal.

275
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:24,050
So what is it that I don't yet know.

276
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:31,310
So I don't know how to define the back end to go for simple random variables.

277
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:38,370
We haven't defined that, but we did make a note that those simple random variables are discrete when the variables.

278
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:49,130
So we know from six a while how we define the expectations of discrete random variables is just the sum of values, times, probabilities.

279
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:54,540
And this is how it's going to happen. Then. So we don't know how.

280
00:40:55,650 --> 00:41:00,480
What does it mean? That exam approximates X better and better.

281
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:10,290
So this is kind of an analog to, uh, the step functions that represent their bosoms in women, in the girls.

282
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,210
So we need some measure of what it means, right?

283
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,720
It's intuitively clear that. So if I do these approximations.

284
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:33,770
Um. Then I will have an approximation of my currency function by step function in general that that would discrete is it.

285
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:41,520
Right. And then we need to say what it means that this curvy function approaches the,

286
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:47,630
the approximating function approaches, uh, the function we have as then goes to infinity.

287
00:41:49,330 --> 00:42:00,250
Uh, then we need to show that this approximation is always possible, because otherwise, uh, there would be cases where the bag integral is undefined.

288
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:06,920
And this is not a good thing to have. Um.

289
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:14,190
So. Well, we'll just go over all of these things and formalize them.

290
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,750
So this. He's.

291
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:33,110
A vague definition. So we need to spell out.

292
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:49,060
So what is? Integral of X in the B.

293
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:57,630
Then we need to say. So what does it mean?

294
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:07,950
X and. Approximates.

295
00:43:08,730 --> 00:43:20,190
Bread and better. So this is some convergence statement about.

296
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,900
And. That's right. So in what sense? Excel converges to X.

297
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,640
Then we need to figure out. Uh, so how is.

298
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,710
Uh. And how does it look like?

299
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:51,930
In terms of. Random variables.

300
00:43:54,830 --> 00:44:00,450
I have some sense. X minus y.

301
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:18,400
The father of. Of b i. So this would be a general form of discrete random variable using indicator.

302
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:23,350
Random variables or perhaps other things as well.

303
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,010
Right. So there's a bunch of things we need to formalize.

304
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:37,210
So let's start with the. The approximation, probably.

305
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:12,999
With convergence. Let's do convergence. So yes.

306
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:18,580
And convergence to X, almost surely.

307
00:45:22,670 --> 00:45:33,050
If and only if X and of Omega converges to X of promega for any long ago.

308
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:37,490
Except. Perhaps.

309
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:57,740
Set of measure zero. So, uh, we defined it just because we need to define some kind of convergence.

310
00:45:57,740 --> 00:46:03,530
But, uh, later on this will be used, for example, if in and this is.

311
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:10,410
An estimate, then this would define strong consistency of that estimate.

312
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:15,360
If it converges to the true value of the parameter, which is the generate the x.

313
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:28,480
Uh, also, uh. So you see that convergence of random variables here is reduced to the calculus notion of convergence of numbers,

314
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:35,409
because in this right part of the definition on a base fixed right.

315
00:46:35,410 --> 00:46:42,670
So it is just the sequence of numbers from calculus converging to another number x of omega.

316
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:49,479
Right? So this limit, uh, we understand in the calculus sense, right?

317
00:46:49,480 --> 00:47:00,220
So the only probability flavor to it is that we require that this is happening for all the omegas, except perhaps the ones that.

318
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:06,130
Have a zero probability, as I said. Right.

319
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:15,240
And that means that this convergence is actually it actually needs a mention of that probability.

320
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,540
So the more accurate statements.

321
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:34,060
He is X and converges to x.

322
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:41,620
He all of us truly. So that statement actually mentions that probability that.

323
00:47:44,450 --> 00:47:49,560
Some will exclude some sense of obligation if if if they have a zero.

324
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:51,320
To that.

325
00:47:53,010 --> 00:48:03,660
So yeah, that explicitly exposes in the notation that the definition depends on the probability space and on the probability that we defined there.

326
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:10,660
Okay. Um, that is a notion of approximation.

327
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:22,900
Then. So we. So they begin to grow over a simple functional.

328
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:47,130
And I could see here that it's not just about a simple X and but any discrete, and that would work just as well.

329
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:58,170
But traditionally it's done for simple ones. So one patient will be some taking an integral over some set of lawmakers.

330
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:08,680
It's in deep. So it's defined as the sum.

331
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:17,590
So first of all, my simple exam, I will do a specified.

332
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:26,690
It means I have some sense in one to.

333
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:39,910
So on 8 a.m. and I have values of my random variable that would be x1x2.

334
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:45,759
So an x and, and I have probabilities of those sets.

335
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:49,360
That's p1p to and so on.

336
00:49:55,560 --> 00:50:03,750
P m, right? So this table kind of defines a discrete the variable because it's non-negative.

337
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,990
So my exercise grade equals zero.

338
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:15,390
So that would be kind of our usual six or one definition for the random variable.

339
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:23,960
And like I said, we will update. Waste to represent a simple random variable or a discrete random variable.

340
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:28,940
But the definition would be that this is a sum. Um.

341
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:43,540
Key from one to m values times probabilities and probabilities would be of key keys intersection.

342
00:50:47,600 --> 00:51:04,170
These are the days. And the.

343
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:12,770
We can also say that a key is the pre-match.

344
00:51:18,190 --> 00:51:39,370
Of the single. Because by definition of the simple random variable.

345
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:47,320
So x one is the value that x takes whenever omega is in the A1, right?

346
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:58,640
And part of it is that, well, if we define it like a pre image of x and minus one of x day,

347
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:06,920
so that would be the set of goes such that x takes the value that by definition is eight K.

348
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:20,100
Okay. So then another definition is.

349
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:34,310
A representation. Of a discrete random variable.

350
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:48,010
By their newly. Around the variables.

351
00:52:54,500 --> 00:53:00,040
So first of all, a discrete random variable, let's say Excel, right?

352
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:07,270
Yes. And then the variable that's a function of our mega.

353
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:18,530
That takes. Values.

354
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:31,740
So it's not actually a definition. That takes values x key and disjoint.

355
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:40,180
Since. You can make up some kind of a petition.

356
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:52,950
Now. Why are they disjoint? Because we allow any automaker to have only one value of access to it.

357
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:58,920
Right. So there's no multi value functions of Omega.

358
00:54:00,150 --> 00:54:13,230
And because of that, so if I take different X Keys, let's say x one and x three, uh, they cannot overlap in their brain images.

359
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:24,980
Because well, the pre image of one is a set of articles that gives the value x one and not x three.

360
00:54:24,990 --> 00:54:31,890
So there won't be any element in that four image that's common to a three.

361
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:49,370
Okay. So yeah. And right now I'm in front of a task to basically write a mathematical formula that expresses this.

362
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:54,050
Uh, where do you text? Right. And that is.

363
00:54:55,320 --> 00:55:01,200
So x m of our media is going to be equal to some.

364
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:06,860
He went to an exclusively.

365
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:12,010
Times indicate how far they got.

366
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:20,580
Right. I'm suggesting that we all look at this formula and.

367
00:55:21,500 --> 00:55:25,370
Uh, so verify that it doesn't match the words.

368
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:32,870
Right. So if I take Omegas from SIB from a Sep, a.k.a.

369
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:38,989
So the, uh, indicator function will turn into a one because sets are disjoint.

370
00:55:38,990 --> 00:55:47,020
This will be the only indicator in the formula that will. Turn into a one and that some will filter out a single element.

371
00:55:47,030 --> 00:55:52,790
Next cake to it. Right. So when?

372
00:55:54,870 --> 00:55:58,770
It belongs to some arbitrary e k.

373
00:55:59,670 --> 00:56:08,700
So this would mean that the i e of omega is going to be equal to one o other.

374
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:18,950
Indicators of a I of it when I is.

375
00:56:22,220 --> 00:56:27,800
So they are going to be zero for that army go is not equal to okay.

376
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:53,700
Because they are disjoint. And so it would follow that X and omega is going to be equal to x k.

377
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:59,700
For such. Oh, my God.

378
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:11,250
And I mean such be this. And this is just what we wanted from that random variable.

379
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:20,240
Okay. So. And I can't help but.

380
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:26,920
So this is a form and general form of a discrete random variable.

381
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:41,170
In terms of Berlin only once. And I can't help bringing up the analogy with with the linear algebra and

382
00:57:41,170 --> 00:57:45,010
functional analysis to some extent for those of you who are familiar with it,

383
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:58,890
because you could tell me that, well, if I fixed my Omega right, then the I have a vector i.e. K of zero once.

384
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:11,730
Right, and there is only 114i fixed on the got to that vector and this is essentially a scalar product of some K efficient six K times this next task.

385
00:58:14,790 --> 00:58:19,230
It's also you could say that if I vary its case,

386
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:26,190
what will happen is that such variables out of Army guys going to be are going to be a

387
00:58:26,190 --> 00:58:32,760
linear span of the basis of actor indicate in the actors indicate the functions right.

388
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:48,020
So we could consider. This is just a note in passing that I will probably later come back to we can define.

389
00:58:51,710 --> 00:58:55,440
In a space. Of.

390
00:58:57,670 --> 00:59:05,010
Such. When the variables that share.

391
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:14,200
Since we went in, but have.

392
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:30,320
Different values. Key.

393
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:45,720
Right. We could call it the linear span. The basis functions.

394
00:59:53,080 --> 00:59:56,620
I in case of Farmiga right.

395
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:07,509
In their case from one to in. So I have and basis functions like in the linear algebra you have and the vectors and the three dimensional space.

396
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:10,870
There are three vectors the size of one, right.

397
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:17,530
1000101001.

398
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:21,910
So these functions play the same role, right?

399
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:29,110
And the whole three dimensional space we live in is a linear spin that's in the media algebra.

400
01:00:30,370 --> 01:00:39,429
And there is a similar thing happening here. Uh, we just built a linear combination of these basis functions with some coefficients,

401
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:44,500
and as we vary these confusions, we get a whole space of functions like that.

402
01:00:45,310 --> 01:01:00,400
So if you pay close attention and kind of cross-check this story with the definition of measurable function, you will find that this will be a space.

403
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:14,330
He's a space. Of random variables that are measurable.

404
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:30,600
With respect. Two Sigma algebra that's built from a key as basic sense.

405
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:40,360
Generated from that right. Because remember, we had an exercise of generating sigma algebras from basis sets.

406
01:01:42,090 --> 01:01:45,540
So these are the random variables.

407
01:01:46,950 --> 01:01:53,730
So all random variables that are measurable with respect to that sigma algebra will have to form.

408
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:59,030
So where is my general form? We'll have these for.

409
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:06,470
Okay. Also with the sets a k being fixed.

410
01:02:07,380 --> 01:02:12,360
So these variables will only be different in the values x.

411
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,510
K. Right.

412
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:24,989
So we will later have a general theorem on that, namely will say that if random variable X and Y are measurable with respect to sigma algebra,

413
01:02:24,990 --> 01:02:31,920
the same sigma algebra then x is actually a deterministic function of Y and the other way around.

414
01:02:32,730 --> 01:02:37,980
And we can see this happening because it's just a table that defines a vector

415
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:44,070
of X case that defines the difference between one x like that and another one.

416
01:02:44,340 --> 01:02:48,870
Right. And they are long random. Right? There's nothing random about these coefficients.

417
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:58,620
So it's a deterministic relationship between two variables that's literally in that space that's literally given by two sets of values x.

418
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:03,190
K. But the people. Okay.

419
01:03:03,460 --> 01:05:53,190
Let's have a five minute break. Yeah.

420
01:06:11,180 --> 01:06:14,570
So the measure actually the probabilities assigned to since came.

421
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:19,480
It's a discrete measure. It's.

422
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:29,450
It's. So the probability measure simply gives probabilities of sense.

423
01:06:30,790 --> 01:06:40,900
So in order to specify probabilities of all sense in the sigma algebra that's generated from a case, you only need to specify probabilities of a case.

424
01:06:41,970 --> 01:06:45,570
These are the case. So that's probably what you measure.

425
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:09,010
It's. Yeah. So the discrete render variables are variables that take fixed constant values.

426
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:16,550
On when Omega is. In the 74% of that case.

427
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:26,270
The probability matches the case assigned to those sets.

428
01:07:27,410 --> 01:09:41,890
Right. Okay.

429
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:52,070
Shall we continue? So.

430
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:55,790
Let's review what we did.

431
01:09:56,630 --> 01:10:08,120
So we defined the back end to growth by simply taking a page from 6 to 1, namely how expectations of discrete random variables are defined.

432
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:16,660
They, um. Uh, we talked about, uh, the.

433
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:28,120
General form of those discrete random variables, building some in ways into how we later on defined spaces of random variables.

434
01:10:28,130 --> 01:10:33,320
Right. So this is just one of the most primitive spaces we can have.

435
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:49,300
Then we alluded to the fact that the sigma algebra generated by the Sensei K is actually the one that acts and is measurable with respect to.

436
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:59,830
Right. Because. Yeah. Then what else?

437
01:10:59,910 --> 01:11:05,080
Uh, we basically made a note that we will later generalize,

438
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:11,110
namely that if there are two random variables measurable with respect to the same sigma algebra.

439
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:16,840
So in this particular example, so the sigma algebra is generated by basis sets,

440
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:26,290
a.k.a. then the two random variables will only be different in the values that we set for them, either X or y.

441
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:36,460
And that, uh, then you that case, the two random variables X and y will be deterministically related to each other.

442
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:44,110
And that function is literally this table of correspondence between the values of X and values of Y.

443
01:11:45,130 --> 01:11:53,640
Right. So I see exactly how x k's put in correspondence with Y and the other way around, and there's nothing random in that thing.

444
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:57,880
It's just a function given a discrete function given by a table.

445
01:12:00,630 --> 01:12:10,860
Okay. So I keep doing some preparatory notes that will help us later.

446
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:20,040
Um, I. Well, I still have in mind that at some point we need to show, uh,

447
01:12:20,610 --> 01:12:30,810
that's an approximation of any ex by a simple random function exists such that the results show a convergence of one to another.

448
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:43,380
Um, and so this is basically a technical exercise of actually building it at this point that should be pretty intuitive that we can always do this.

449
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:46,770
It's kind of all in this picture, right?

450
01:12:47,220 --> 01:12:55,560
Doing a partition, replacing the function by an approximation, by the lowest value of each interval of this partition.

451
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:05,820
Why we're guaranteed to have a partition of the omega excess into different sets because x is measurable and that's the definition,

452
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:11,990
so that the pre images of any such interval are going to be in the sigma algebra f.

453
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:20,250
Right. Such functional minorities actually the the actual functions approximated from below.

454
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:27,120
And it's clear that. So as I make the partition fine there and fine there will be.

455
01:13:29,690 --> 01:13:35,180
So my ex and uh, defined like that will actually approach ex of omega.

456
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:44,570
And I will spell this out literally. It's just an exercise in indexing things currently.

457
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:52,800
Uh, so I'll do that later. Um, then what will also need.

458
01:13:52,890 --> 01:13:59,970
Um, so now that I alluded to spaces of random variables, spaces are functions.

459
01:14:00,540 --> 01:14:06,900
So let's look at. It's algebra.

460
01:14:12,980 --> 01:14:15,940
Right. So it deals with vectors and.

461
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:30,630
So if I have access, uh, belonging to honor and then access is actually understood as a vector with components from x one to X and.

462
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:40,430
So for such vectors, you remember they defined the scalar products X and Y.

463
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:48,930
Right for both X and Y being vectors. And this is the end product, right?

464
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:58,130
X transpose times y. We also have the length of a victim.

465
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:14,910
That is. No.

466
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:23,890
They called it norm of the vector. And this is the square root of a scalar product of X with itself.

467
01:15:29,410 --> 01:15:34,900
And the cs square of the sum of its components.

468
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:50,380
Right. If we spell out what this is. And then what we will need is a distance.

469
01:15:55,960 --> 01:16:02,380
I because I alluded to a approximating of one random variable with another random variable.

470
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:11,230
So random variables are functions. So in order to define approximations, we need a notion of how one random variable is close to another one.

471
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:21,670
So we need a notion of a distance. And I'm using linear algebra as a useful analogy to quickly develop intuition

472
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:27,310
that would be functional of analysis of the domain of functional analysis.

473
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:31,270
So the distance between two vectors.

474
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:40,480
X and Y. It is defined as the length of the difference.

475
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:47,740
Between them. And it would spell that out.

476
01:16:48,790 --> 01:16:53,350
That's a square root of X minus Y.

477
01:16:53,960 --> 01:16:57,020
Transpose times X minus Y.

478
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:07,480
Or more familiar. The square root of the differences between components.

479
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:30,470
Okay. So that was the theory in linear algebra and the linear space.

480
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:39,400
Was represented as. Uh.

481
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:51,550
Set of factors. Acts that have the form.

482
01:17:53,650 --> 01:17:58,900
X one times in one class and so on.

483
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:03,690
Sex and times and where.

484
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:10,470
E. Uh, basis.

485
01:18:13,770 --> 01:18:19,260
Doctors. They had to have the form zero.

486
01:18:19,290 --> 01:18:24,740
Then the case takes place as a12 and then it's again zero.

487
01:18:31,590 --> 01:18:35,910
Right. So we already have the analogy of that thing, right?

488
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:39,540
Where we had the functions indicator,

489
01:18:39,540 --> 01:18:48,960
functions indicator and the variables instead of the basis that there was an excise tax and a values of the discrete and the variable.

490
01:18:50,010 --> 01:18:53,660
So that's also the. And they largely.

491
01:18:55,180 --> 01:19:05,080
Uh, now we can have, uh, similar stuff to this algebra, uh, situation.

492
01:19:10,910 --> 01:19:16,230
So now in. Functional analysis.

493
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:28,510
Random variables. But I also functions, right?

494
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:32,620
So if I have to run the variables X and Y.

495
01:19:34,620 --> 01:19:44,260
On some probability space. Not necessarily deterministically related.

496
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:47,470
So later on, we'll talk about how to define.

497
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:57,840
Probability space is for multiple random variables at the same time that are not deterministically related to each other.

498
01:19:59,340 --> 01:20:03,630
Uh, but for now, I'll just give analogy definitions.

499
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,150
To the scalar product between two and the variables.

500
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,070
So that's going to be the expectation of that product.

501
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:21,640
We defined the expectation as being an integral right.

502
01:20:22,890 --> 01:20:27,720
So it's X times Y is functions of I'm a good deep of Omega.

503
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:37,550
So when we finish defining the battle in the Gulf, this will start.

504
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:49,060
Making sense then. So the norm in a similar way is defined as the square root.

505
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:56,290
Expected value of x x squared. So the x times itself.

506
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:15,589
It's the scalar product of X and x. And this is integral x squared DP two, one or two or so.

507
01:21:15,590 --> 01:21:23,630
The ones that had functional analysis will recognize that this is a metal tuning arm of a function.

508
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:29,690
Uh, but they're a function of numbers. And here it's the functions of omegas.

509
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:36,799
And so what else? So finally. Yeah.

510
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:43,490
We, we define distance in a similar way. Uh, distance between X and Y.

511
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:51,240
He's going to be square and. Of a scalar product of X and Y.

512
01:21:52,390 --> 01:22:06,420
Uh, X minus Y with itself. Right. And I will exploit that later.

513
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:08,280
So this is it for today's.
