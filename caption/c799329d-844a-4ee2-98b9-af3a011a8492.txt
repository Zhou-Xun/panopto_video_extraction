1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,640
Okay. All right. So we are on to liquids, so an entirely different macronutrient here.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,140
So like I said, there's five needed for liquids, restructuring it and digesting digestion and oxidation of a breakdown in a transport unit.

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,760
So these are the learning objectives for all four here.

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:25,080
Okay. So we'll start with as I start with all these nutrients with the recommendations that the United States government sets.

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,940
So they named the over fat is 20 to 35% and remember, it was 45 to 65% carbohydrate.

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:35,520
So the recommendation is that it's lower. But for all the reasons we'll talk about in this unit.

7
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:44,610
Not zero. There's a bit of a sort of somewhat interesting policy discussion that's going on around upper limits for fat intake.

8
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,440
So as we'll talked about a lot over the next five lectures, there are associations between fat,

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,429
specifically saturated trans fats, muscle cholesterol and cardiovascular disease.

10
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,810
Cardiovascular disease is going to be units equivalent with diabetes,

11
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,550
where a lot of what we're talking about is how do you reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, the one specific focus.

12
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:09,810
So there have been general recommendations to reduce intakes through the Dietary Guidelines for Healthy Americans.

13
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,210
So right now, the reduction, though, these are the recommendations of saturated fats would be less than 10% of full calories.

14
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,010
So that saturated fat, not all that trans fats should be completely removed.

15
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,590
And that's been done largely at the food manufacturer level. And then cholesterol that as low as possible.

16
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:30,209
And I'll talk a little more of a cluster of it. To be clear, these are recommendations.

17
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,670
These aren't actually set as tolerable upper limits. Right. So these weren't set based on any real good, strong data about this.

18
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:46,800
It's a lot of sort of observational epidemiology and associations with cardiovascular disease which have have different terms.

19
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,790
So there's sort of three, three types of fat that have maybe potential risks for being too high.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,440
And then there's the two essential fatty acids that these are the intakes here.

21
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,160
So most people, population wise, get sufficient amounts of omega six fatty acids,

22
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:07,800
which 70 grams per day for men, 12, when again, the difference is just purely based on body size.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,030
If anything, people tend to be a little bit low in the omega three fatty acids.

24
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,240
And we'll talk a lot about who make up the three fatty acids and what they do. So a lot of stuff.

25
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,330
So that's sort of what the guidelines are. So there are three ish, maybe four nutrients of concern, one nutrient that maybe we get, but not enough.

26
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:32,290
Okay. So I'm going to kind of walk us through all the different types of lipids here with a couple of different examples as for you.

27
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,250
So the first thing to keep in mind is there's really three different types of lipids.

28
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,410
There's two types of lipids recalled cholesterol lipids. That's because they have glycerol on it.

29
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:45,749
So diglycerides and triglycerides most likely trans that we're going to talk

30
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:49,410
about here are phospholipids and triglycerides as a major energy storage unit.

31
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,930
And in the lab class, which, as you can tell, the other two are sterols.

32
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,060
So this is cholesterol, this is a structural cholesterol. This is what we would call free cholesterol.

33
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:05,340
It's free cholesterol because it has this really hydroxyl group right here.

34
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,350
And so that makes it somewhat and for Patrick, it's a little hard to tell sometimes looking at these structures,

35
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,740
whether these are partially soluble or partially insoluble.

36
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,570
Cholesterol is partially soluble.

37
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:22,110
However, most of the cholesterol we eat animals and cholesterol in our body is actually in this form here, which is the scarifying cholesterol.

38
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:25,470
And so the difference between the two is now where that hydroxyl was.

39
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:33,680
Now there's a fatty acid chain attached to it. So where this was somewhat hydrophilic water like in here, this is very, very, very hydrophobic.

40
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,860
So this makes cholesterol. Ester is specifically very hydrophobic.

41
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,060
It affects their biophysical nature and it affects sort of what their function is.

42
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,920
The thing that I'm going to kind of keep going back to over and over again, this is maybe the analogy to me,

43
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:55,979
kind of like a secondary lecture is that the four lipids, the like having a fatty acid on it affects the structural properties of it.

44
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,110
And that's going to be really, really, really important. But there's gonna be a ton of variation, so I'm just showing a fatty acid here.

45
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,750
But this fatty acid can be literally any other fatty acid.

46
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:07,500
So lipids may seem straightforward, like, oh, good, there's only triglycerides and diglycerides,

47
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:12,389
but you have to imagine there's probably at least 20, maybe 30 different types of individual fatty acids.

48
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:19,379
They could all be conjugated in different ways to that. The other general thing I'm going to talk about a lot is that the thing that makes fatty

49
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,700
acids so problematic from a lot of the digestive physiology is really the transport.

50
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,910
And that's because by definition, they are not water soluble.

51
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:34,110
Right. So that means all the process of the digestion and of intracellular transport have to some point deal with the solubility problem.

52
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,469
Right. If you just take oil and water mix, the oil will float. That doesn't work.

53
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,650
If you're trying to eat it, it doesn't work if you're trying to get it from one tissue to the other.

54
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,640
So there's a lot of steps that are going to be involved in soluble position, right?

55
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,100
So that's one that empathic nature is going to kind of keep coming up overwhelming.

56
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:54,930
Okay. So cholesterol has primarily heard of cholesterol as being bad or causing cardiovascular disease, which we'll talk about in a minute.

57
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,680
But it has a lot of really, really important role. So we everybody makes cholesterol.

58
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,040
Everybody makes almost all. Cholesterol that you have in your body.

59
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,519
The vast majority of us, the vast majority of cholesterol in our body is made indigenously.

60
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,919
But levels of cholesterol in our bodies is like at least 100 times higher than the amount

61
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,550
of cholesterol that even the most cholesterol filling person could plausibly eat.

62
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,410
It really two main roles and this is again going to come up over and over again with lipids.

63
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:23,480
It's got a role in terms of how it functions within membranes. So it's got a biophysical role.

64
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,790
So cholesterol being apoptotic tends to be on the water facing side of cellular membranes.

65
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:34,519
That enhances their fluidity, right? And that advances their ability to bend and stretch and be able to be morphed into different things.

66
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,200
Right. So that's one really important role of cholesterol. If you do not have enough membrane fluid in your body.

67
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:46,900
Well, to create more cholesterol to get another number. Absolutely. So that's one major role to at all three of the lipids we're going to talk about.

68
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,940
They all have a structural role which has something to do with membrane biophysics, but also a lot of them have biological roles.

69
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:58,159
And so in the case of cholesterol, cholesterol is a precursor to all sorts of different bodily compounds,

70
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,410
one of which bile salts we've already talked about quite a bit.

71
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:06,709
But you can see if you look, all of these look vaguely cholesterol ish, but they're all slightly modified, right?

72
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:12,020
So everything from cortisol to vitamin D to astronomical to testosterone to pile salts are all derived from cholesterol.

73
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:18,200
Right. So that means for you to be able to make, say, alcohol, gallstone, testosterone or progesterone, you have that cholesterol available.

74
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:22,610
Right. So it serves as a signaling molecule as well as a biochemical molecule.

75
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,879
Again, cholesterol, much like glucose, is not essential.

76
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:29,900
It can be made by cells if you make too much of it and it gets in your blood, that is not great.

77
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:36,110
Again, similar to glucose, if you have too much in your blood, that right side is a very, very straightforward thing.

78
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,639
Higher LDL cholesterol containing particles. And I'll talk more in a couple of minutes.

79
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,240
What I mean exactly by that is tightly linked to cardiovascular disease.

80
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,110
So many of you probably have a question here. Yeah.

81
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:54,830
So like, I know there's some conflicting stuff with like how dietary cholesterol is metabolized.

82
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:59,930
Like, what are your thoughts? I'm like, oh, you're going to you're going to hear my thoughts on the digestion absorption of cholesterol.

83
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:07,060
Let me tell you, in fact, there'll be a whole lecture of my thoughts, not just my but other people's thoughts.

84
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:12,290
But ultimately, let me go through the next two slides because I think what's what you're getting at and then we can come back to the evidence.

85
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,680
Okay. So many of you probably heard cholesterol primarily does either causal or associated with cardiovascular disease.

86
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:23,240
And so I'm going to walk you through a few uses of data and some projections that maybe highlight that.

87
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:31,160
So the first thing is, it's unambiguously true that people who eat more cholesterol have higher incidence of cardiovascular disease.

88
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:37,880
Right. That is very, very, very clear from observational studies. We've known that going all the way back to the 1960s with studies, financial cues.

89
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,910
That does not mean that is what causes the cardiovascular disease.

90
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:46,250
It just meant that people with diets tended to be higher in cholesterol, tended to also get cardiovascular disease.

91
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:52,400
Now, for most of my life, the recommendation, therefore, was eat a little cholesterol as possible.

92
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,270
Right? Because the idea was people with high cholesterol in their blood and people with high cholesterol in their diets get cardiovascular disease.

93
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,400
Those two things probably are related to each other.

94
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:07,460
Therefore, if you just reduce the amount of dietary cholesterol, you'll also reduce the amount of cardiovascular disease.

95
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:13,549
And that was broad nutrition guidance worldwide from late 1960 something through about 2010.

96
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,110
Yes. And in some places still currently.

97
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:21,380
And that's very strong epidemiologic studies and reproduced in many, many, many, many, many, many different populations.

98
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:21,920
Now,

99
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:28,370
where it's a challenge is people have then started using that as a basis for either policy interventions or randomized clinical trials where they say,

100
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:33,950
oh, well, let's take a population of people and just reduce their dietary cholesterol and that'll make their cardiovascular disease go.

101
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:40,310
And let's design programs where people can replace cholesterol containing foods with other foods, and that'll make cardiovascular disease go away.

102
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,010
And that that was not happening. That was definitely not happening.

103
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,819
And so that's where people started getting a little concerned about what is actually the

104
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:51,290
relationship between the dietary cholesterol and the risk of cardiovascular disease.

105
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:56,450
So on the left, here are a bunch of observational studies. And like I said, they're pretty consistent that there's an increase.

106
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:06,050
And on the right is a whole ton of short, medium and long term randomized clinical trials where they use prawns and eggs.

107
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:13,579
So the reason people use prawns in a lot seems like a weird thing to use are eggs are unique in a way that eggs have very,

108
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,209
very high cholesterol but very, very low saturated fats.

109
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,260
The same thing is true of prawns.

110
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,890
One of the limitations of the observational studies is that people who tended to eat a lot of eggs also tended to eat a lot of saturated fats.

111
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:31,459
So it was always unclear, like, well, what's the problem? Is it, you know, the saturated fat or is it the cholesterol?

112
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,830
And this is analogous to the the thing I mentioned before,

113
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:38,209
like people like coffee was causing lung cancer, but is it coffee or is it the cigaret with the coffee?

114
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,180
And now we are pretty sure it's the cigaret, not necessarily the cup.

115
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:46,189
So we've made things much, much more, much more difficult for us to understand because all these RC TS,

116
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,450
if they had an effect, it was extremely small and many of them had almost no effect at all.

117
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:58,310
So there's really sort of two explanations here. So one is that this is entirely mediated by dietary saturated fatty acids.

118
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:06,220
So if you look at. The study is also regional studies and adjusted for the mediating impact of saturated fats, that mediates most of the effect.

119
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:13,480
So if you control for the amount of saturated fat, now, there's very little association between dietary cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.

120
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:21,190
So that's one explanation. And so that has been why, going back to my first slide recommendations are now to reduce saturated fat,

121
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,740
but not necessarily focus on reducing cholesterol.

122
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:30,400
Just one side and I'll get to the other question here is, is this maybe true for some people, but not.

123
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:38,160
All right. So it's possible that for some people there is no dietary relationship between cholesterol and LDL cholesterol or the panel.

124
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:45,020
But in a subset of people, there is a there is an association and some data for this as well.

125
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,100
So this is looking at observational studies where they group people into nonresponders and hyper responders.

126
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,710
And you can see within the hyper responders as a general trend.

127
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,690
And for some people and this is somewhere between 15 and 20% of people, they are sensitive to dietary cholesterol.

128
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:03,880
So their LDL cholesterol is treatable by modifying the cholesterol in their diet, but maybe not for all people.

129
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,889
Right. So that's sort of a different sort of analysis and that's hard to capture in the dietary guidelines because

130
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:14,650
we don't exactly know chemically or genetically what causes certain people to be sensitive to that.

131
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:30,250
But we do know some people are not. So I just wanted to bring attention to a paper that I actually added to one of the comments in the past week and

132
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:37,569
just mentioned that it's a very significant paper on the topic in our field and I would recommend reading it.

133
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:44,530
And it does explore this and it does talk about how high cholesterol foods are,

134
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:52,060
either themselves typically high in saturated fat or combined with foods that are high in saturated fat.

135
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:58,660
And it does bring up how it was removed from the dietary guidelines, but also how it has.

136
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:05,900
This is still a guideline for people. And one more thing.

137
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:13,900
It was thought that the overall population of the average cholesterol intake for the general population is two nine.

138
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:17,470
So it's below even. Right. So that with yeah.

139
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:22,120
So kind of reiterates that paper which there is an activity on recraft if you want to get a

140
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:28,750
little more detail is a consensus recommendation from the CEO and he was able to take it all.

141
00:12:30,490 --> 00:12:33,760
And yeah, and that's what led to this action, this change in guidelines.

142
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,170
Right. So some people think the change in guidelines, for example, was largely driven by corporate interests.

143
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,310
Sometimes people say the egg industry was pushing the change of guidelines, but that's not true.

144
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,610
It came exclusively from people trying to really understand what the relationship between dietary cholesterol is.

145
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:51,220
And we'll talk more about this and especially more about the mechanisms once we get to, as I mentioned, you know,

146
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:56,650
the actual mechanisms that drive cholesterol absorption and control, which are complicated and intricate studies.

147
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:05,920
Okay. So that's cholesterol. I guess we will keep talking about this is the amount of intelligence, cholesterol that we eat affect.

148
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,170
How much do I produce it? Yes, absolutely.

149
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,300
And that's one different like this is something we'll talk about when we get to regulation and not just cholesterol production,

150
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:17,650
but that is one potentially distinguishing characteristic between responders and non-responders.

151
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:22,960
So maybe the responders or the people who don't downregulate their cholesterol enough compared to the responders who do.

152
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,440
That's certainly a plausible explanation.

153
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:33,760
Okay. So that's cholesterol for now. But again, as I said, we will come back from many, many, many, many events over the next five lectures.

154
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,770
Okay. So I'm going to move on phospholipids.

155
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,900
So Phospholipids are called phospholipids because they have a phosphate group on the side, one position which is right here.

156
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:50,340
So the phosphate group here has a very, very strong negative charge, usually a negative to charge that makes this an extremely anthropomorphic limit.

157
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:56,890
Right. So that makes this part of the lipid very, very, very water soluble and this part of the lipid very water insulin.

158
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:03,489
So because of that phospholipids generally form barriers, they form barriers and they form surface surfaces of things.

159
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,059
Right. So I've been talking a little bit about this problem of transport, right?

160
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,740
How do we get things from one place to the other?

161
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:13,960
One way we transport things as we put them in little shells and those shells are generally made of phosphate.

162
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:14,370
Right?

163
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:20,560
So you have to have enough of the shell to make an LDL particle or kind of microbial yogurt, all things that we'll talk about the next few minutes.

164
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,899
Right. So Phospholipids are very important for that. They also exist in our food, but it's a relatively minor contribution to our food.

165
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:33,900
It's usually about 1 to 2% of our total lipid content, almost every phospholipid we can generate independently on our own.

166
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,840
Right? So it's not like we necessarily with potentially one exception I'm going to get to in a moment,

167
00:14:38,050 --> 00:14:41,380
need to consume phospholipids for the sake of phospholipids.

168
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,589
There are different headers for these phospholipids, so you can see they're all consistent in that they have to that essence inside chains.

169
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:51,010
So you just imagine there's a bang acid that's not drawn here for our one and R2.

170
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,720
They all have a phosphate group here and then they have a different what's called head group.

171
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,680
And so what that head group does is dictates the function of the.

172
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,720
Full of the actual phospholipids.

173
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:16,050
So just as an example, if you look at for example, so it's not shown on your false, that's as it would be just the phosphate but with no no big head.

174
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,580
So you can imagine it was pretty as it kind of looks like a square. Right.

175
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:25,410
So it's not like a phosphate group on it and it's on two fatty acid sidechains, but it doesn't have very much else going on up here.

176
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:34,860
Right. If you then extend it out to say something like Hospital at the Normal means, which is here, it has this big positive charge to it.

177
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:40,890
What that actually means by physically for the lipid is if you try to pack a bunch of these together,

178
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,180
they're going to form more of a rounded structure.

179
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,410
Right. Because these head groups, these positive charges are going to repel each other.

180
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,340
So that's one example. And this is also true, for example, of Foster calling, which I'm going to talk about.

181
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:01,350
Right. So the size of the head group actually is important for the function of within flatter, shorter head groups,

182
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:10,200
which would be your in all the tunnels, your diet glycerol and your fossil phosphoric acid are all going to be sort of flat surface,

183
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,790
a really good for plasma membranes,

184
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,470
whereas things that are rounded and things that have bigger bulkier figures tend to be more for rounded surfaces, right?

185
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,850
So things like mitochondria, lipoproteins, things like that.

186
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:31,370
Okay. So calling up here on the top left is the one exception kind of to the rule that most of these things are dietary dispensable.

187
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,060
So call it. Have you ever heard of choline? Is it a vitamin?

188
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,020
It's not wheat. Vitamin something in eggs, but it's in eggs.

189
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:39,650
Right.

190
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:45,709
Literally the big saying I was going to say it is used in it and it has a bunch of biological roles that we'll talk about throughout this class.

191
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:52,400
And then in nutrition security one, if you take that now the fish and here's the adequate intakes for coli across different groups.

192
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,470
So there are biological outcomes that can that can be associated with deficiencies and coli.

193
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:06,680
There are developmental defects, high anxiety, low intelligence in children, not with fatty liver disease, muscle weakness and our mentioned anxiety.

194
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,850
So, Pauline, I mentioned positive Colleen looks like this.

195
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,450
Right. So that's the structure of hospital.

196
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:19,009
For most of the calling that we get in our diet is actually the structure for most people of hospital, right?

197
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,999
So we're getting that vitamin of which the thing that matters is just this piece here,

198
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,940
but we're getting a lot of it digested and absorbed in this form here as a particular phospholipid.

199
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,979
All of the rest of these you might be showing, you can kind of see these are all calling derived things,

200
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:41,090
one of which is acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter which probably mediates some of the insulin effects as aforementioned.

201
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:43,120
Cooling was really, really, really high an act.

202
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,950
And in fact, in Western countries, most people's dietary supply is very easily met by having like one egg every other day.

203
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:54,740
Right. And so for a long time, we didn't even know that coaling was essential because so many people were eating eggs.

204
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,520
Everybody was replete. We had no idea that there was such a deficiency could occur.

205
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,070
But because of some of the cholesterol guidance that I was talking about before, people got very concerned about actions.

206
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:09,080
But still you get very concerned about egg yolks, whichever high both in cholesterol, but also coli.

207
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:15,620
And so people started to notice deficiencies like muscle weakness, fatty liver disease as people were cutting their eggs out of their diet.

208
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:24,680
Right. So this is kind of a public policy version of the idea that beriberi was caused by getting rid of vitamin B one from grains of wheat.

209
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,130
Right. It was something that was removed from our food supply for good intention reasons.

210
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:32,510
But then people started becoming deficient in the thing that we didn't even know most people needed to get.

211
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,210
And but this wasn't everybody. And that's what made it so confusing, right?

212
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,530
It wasn't like beriberi. It wasn't like everybody was getting the same disease.

213
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,800
And the reason for that is that there's actually some pretty interesting genetics that underlie cooling deficiency.

214
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,140
And so this is a study here where they took people and they randomized them into various different diets.

215
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:58,040
Mostly the role of thing is called individual. That sort of includes obviously no eggs and they were monitored for these various signs of deficiency.

216
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,969
The main thing that they were interested in here is liver fat because it's very easy

217
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:05,000
to measure and then muscle strength because that is also pretty easy to measure.

218
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:09,350
Anxiety is is much higher. So what they found and if you want the details,

219
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:17,120
you can get a little study is that there was a particular gene P and pulse that had an aluminum METHYLTRANSFERASE If you are buried in that gene,

220
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:27,470
they gave you a 2525 X 0.25 0.025, 25 times increased risk of having these symptoms if you were deficient in cold.

221
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:32,540
Right. So people who had that variant are very sensitive to Colleen in their diet.

222
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:37,040
Now, not everybody has this variant and BR sort of interesting sort of transcriptional reasons.

223
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,800
This is actually more true in women than men.

224
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:47,390
So this variant is it's not X-linked, but it tends to be associated with women because there's an e r signaling event that goes on with it.

225
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,400
So what's happening biochemically?

226
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:55,720
It actually turns out that when you make endogenous, Colleen, what you're using is you're starting with ethanol amine,

227
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:03,050
which was another one of those phospholipids I had on that previous slide and you methylated and then you create phosphatidylcholine, right?

228
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:10,510
And then that cooling can be removed and used for all the various other things that Colleen can do in our, in our bodies.

229
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,360
Right. So the way that we make calling endogenous Lee is through this BMT.

230
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:19,340
So hopefully you can appreciate that if you now do not have a good activity of EMG.

231
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:23,510
Now, you were entirely dependent on the dietary codeine supply to do all the cooling.

232
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:29,600
That's right. And again, if you were eating plenty of cooling in your diet, you may not even notice that this deficiency was occurring.

233
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:39,770
But if you are of this variant and 33% of people have this variant with 55% of people having at least one copy of it in in most societies,

234
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,380
you are now very sensitive to Colleen. Right. And again, it's something that we didn't really we didn't really know about before,

235
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,159
and that this is just cooling deficiency across different ethnicities.

236
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:55,820
So you can see very, very, very common in wetter populations, somewhat less common in Southeast Asia.

237
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:03,350
These are the loss of function variance in of one of the cooling deficiency to the heterozygous individuals who have lower levels.

238
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:09,559
Heterozygous individuals have a less active nucleus, not quite as pathological, but somewhat less so.

239
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,150
It's a very, very common thing in the.

240
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:20,600
But so roughly what this means is about half of people in these populations here are at risk of coaling deficiency and having some symptoms.

241
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:25,350
But the other half. It doesn't matter if they know clean it up. They can make plenty clean all by themselves.

242
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,280
Right. So they are they do not work.

243
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:37,260
So that makes calling not semi essential because it's purely essential for some people, but inessential for others.

244
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,139
Right. So there's a dichotomy of the population that some people,

245
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:45,060
it's an essential nutrient and other people it is not an essential, which kind of makes it a little hard.

246
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:48,989
So I don't want to go into the groups here because we already spent a little too much time here.

247
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:52,649
But I guess I want to ask kind of the group here. Let's start with the second question.

248
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:56,040
So now that I've told you that there are some people and we could do genetic tests,

249
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:59,040
but let's presume people don't have genetic testing that are sensitive to coal,

250
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:02,219
it shouldn't be considered a vitamin because it's not it's just cold calling.

251
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:09,270
It's not providing security for vitamin C, but it's not like vitamin B 13 or anything like that.

252
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,860
If it's semi essential for people, do you think it should be considered a viable.

253
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,670
But it's calling it a Biden change versus just saying it's essential.

254
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,550
I think it like frankly, I like biochemistry, obviously, and I nothing we could call it.

255
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,450
You know, if you call it a toilet, it wouldn't be publicly, though.

256
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:34,879
I think people might like. I'll give you a better example. There is no cooling in my multivitamin.

257
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:41,540
I take a multivitamin. I take it does not give equal. Right. But if people thought of it as a vitamin, it might be a supplement.

258
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,720
But I think about like following that folate sort of identity supplement or, you know, oil is definitely about supplement.

259
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,290
Right. Yeah. Or even a reason why all this vitamin reason.

260
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:56,720
Oh, well, there you go. Can it be considered like EPA or DHEA or.

261
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:01,470
It's like an essential fatty acid, you know, it's like kind of that, but not also that.

262
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:08,120
It's not a buy, right? Well, why isn't it applied? I guess that's my question, because it's like it's not a micro.

263
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:13,450
It is because it is available in tiny amounts.

264
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:20,140
And it does have a biological effect. It is I would argue it's actually very similar to fully biochemically.

265
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:29,950
What I wanted to add. Wasn't it consistent with the vitamins because they share the same water soluble one carbon metabolism?

266
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,580
It could be. Yeah, it could be. Right. So by the name and I would call vitamin B 13.

267
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:38,960
Right. Because I'd be like it's like a B vitamin, but it's not the same as something that has a cholesterol base like vitamin D.

268
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:44,140
It's going to be. No, it doesn't have a cholesterol base. No, it's all right.

269
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:51,670
Yes. It's just having a little a little problem, that sort of thing. Something similar to vitamin B then, like structurally?

270
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:55,060
No, all the B vitamins are like structurally very heterogeneous.

271
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,990
Yet the thing that holds them together is they support metabolism and they are water soluble.

272
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,560
But then if you look at all their structures, they would be super duper different.

273
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,080
But it is you know, it's an interesting question.

274
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,740
The reason I bring it up here is like, are we sure, like, sure, sure, sure that a 100% of people really need vitamin C?

275
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:19,840
Like, are we positive about that? I don't think we are right. Maybe 20% of people are.

276
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,140
You know, if they were, pirates would never get scurvy or whatever. Right.

277
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,760
We just know this for this. But when we started studying it in a newer era of genomics, right.

278
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:31,899
There might be people out there who actually don't really need that folate or maybe don't need any book.

279
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,920
Right. And they can survive entirely on their own without that. Same with.

280
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,160
And some of them are almost clearly broken.

281
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,319
But other than they had different pathways. Right?

282
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:46,660
So I guess the reason I bring this up is it gives this idea of like what we define as a vitamin or even what we define as

283
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:53,020
essential isn't as clear cut as maybe what we think this kind of goes back to my original comment way back in a fiber is like,

284
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,250
are we sure that fiber is essential? Well, look, we can't make it. So it's like essential in that way.

285
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,490
But are we sure 100% of people are going to have some pathology if they have no fiber?

286
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,729
Like maybe I don't know. It's hard to say. Right? We don't know.

287
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:08,170
Right. And as we learn more about individual variation, we tend to be more and more astonished by this sort of problem.

288
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:16,630
This is critical. Okay. So coming back to sort of a more more narrow question, calling deficiency is going to result in liver fat accumulation.

289
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:22,540
So so do you want to maybe suggest why hoarding deficiency might cause liver fat accumulation?

290
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,330
They'll be a very clear answer, but it's coming in like two issues. But here's the bottom.

291
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,250
Because. So you go for it.

292
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:46,460
So is it because, as you mentioned, that's important part of the life of protein particles and that their properties are required to transport.

293
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,290
And so that's why it might be affecting. Yeah, exactly.

294
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:59,380
I presume that things like seconds that may be getting fat out of your liver actually is a lipoprotein dependent process.

295
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:03,230
Right. There is no fatty acid or fatty acid lipolysis like there is without it.

296
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,540
So if you have fat in your liver the way you get it out and as you put it, if you don't have choline,

297
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:16,700
which is one of those big charged particle groups, you cannot assemble that like protein in your liver and then the factor stays in your liver.

298
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:22,340
Right. So that's potentially, again, one reason why there is a super high level of fatty liver disease that might be

299
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:27,080
somewhat related to people maybe inadvertently restricting their ability to take.

300
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,240
What's up little Pauline help remedy fatty liver.

301
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,899
It can. So the challenge is it has to be in the form of phosphatidylcholine.

302
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,360
Right. You have to supplement with the lipid form. Yeah.

303
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,510
There's some evidence that that is helpful for for the people that cannot make their own call.

304
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:45,200
Of course, many people have fatty liver disease for lots of other reasons, fatty acids.

305
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:50,060
But that is one major reason you wouldn't expect somebody who is in that case to

306
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:55,550
necessarily be an alcoholic or somebody who fighting liver disease in a small body.

307
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:58,810
It might imply that maybe that's a good thing.

308
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:05,060
I can tell you that at least. Okay, so that is phospholipids.

309
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:11,990
So now I have somewhat briefly covered phospholipids and cholesterols and cholesterol esters and derived products.

310
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,599
So what about the triglycerides? The triglycerides, when we talk about that, that's actually most of what we're talking about.

311
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,420
For 95% of human fat, we call it that is in the form of triglycerides.

312
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,959
It is by leaps and bounds, way, way, way, way more. I forget the math.

313
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:29,960
It's in the notes. The largest energy store in our body. We can survive for weeks, maybe months on our fat storage.

314
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,190
We can only survive for days, maybe even day on our life insurance.

315
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:36,559
So the vast majority of our energy is stored in a form.

316
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:42,980
Triglycerides are usually in adipose tissue, glycerol backbone with three able chains, and it is a neutral limit.

317
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,860
So triglycerides have been 95% of all.

318
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:54,420
Fat, obviously can vary between people, and that variation is based on the different fatty acids that could be attached to that particular fruit.

319
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,860
So there's a bunch of different ways that we can classify fatty acids.

320
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,090
So I think it's pretty important to be able to identify a fatty acid and figure out,

321
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:06,169
based on its structure, what kind of properties would you predicted that?

322
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:11,989
And we'll talk about a lot of these today. I do not care if you ever remember or forget the name of a fatty acid.

323
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:16,820
Right. I probably can't name almost all of that based on on their name.

324
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:23,630
So the structure is the important thing. And you can get the structure by knowing their carbons and the number of desaturated bonds.

325
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,930
So that astronomically jaw is like this.

326
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:31,340
The first number here is how many carbons exist in the fatty acid as you get longer, longer.

327
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,740
And then the second number is the number of clubs that you have right now.

328
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:40,880
Again, that number is bigger for somebody else. So there's few different ways you classify them.

329
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:47,630
Short chain fatty acids we've already talked about, and that's primarily biologically relevant in terms of fiber fermentation.

330
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,710
There's another group called medium chain. Fatty acids go from 6 to 12, long chains go from 13 to 21, and then they're very long chain.

331
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:00,049
They go up to about 22. So these are sort of generic biological cutoffs.

332
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:02,830
But as we'll talk about, the biochemistry of these varies.

333
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,950
And when you get to sort of that middle cap point of like what about a medium chain fatty acid as well,

334
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:10,550
it's kind of like a midway between a medium chain and one of the bars.

335
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:15,589
And then of course, they're classified based on the number of double bonds and they have no double lines.

336
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:19,040
It is a saturated fat. It is one is a mono unsaturated body, but it is more than one.

337
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:27,080
It is a polyunsaturated fat. So like I said, you should be able to look at a base and predict some things about its structure and its biology.

338
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:31,580
So the first thing is length. So if it is longer, it's going to have more energy to it.

339
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:38,240
And if it's longer, it's going to tend to be more salt, right? So vinegar, short chain, fatty acid, very much olive.

340
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:45,470
Right. Whereas butter largely palmitic acid, which is C 16, corn o is generally solid, right?

341
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:53,150
Olive oil which is oleic acid, which is C 18 corn one monounsaturated fatty acid tends to be right.

342
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:56,510
So that's one thing. So, you know, the length of it, you can kind of predict some of the properties of it.

343
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:01,999
The second thing is the number of double ones as it has more double bonds and it tends to be more liquid.

344
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,390
And as we've talked about before, it tends to be more prone to oxidation.

345
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:12,890
Right. So that's why fish oil is an oil, whereas milk fat tends to be it's not because of the saturation differences.

346
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:13,940
Okay.

347
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:22,370
So first groups, such short chain fatty acids, we already talked about the derive from fiber as they trade in Propionate are sort of the main menu.

348
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:27,260
They're extremely soluble and they're generally absorbed without any regulation that we know of.

349
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,730
Right. So they tend to be just absorbed as we as we get them and again, in our case, mostly in our colons.

350
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:39,350
We can change tastes. So medium chain fatty acids are generally considered high in both palm and coconut oil.

351
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:45,920
And I'm going to talk a little bit about coconut oil in a minute. So they have a different metabolism and trafficking than the long chain fatty acids.

352
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:52,550
So the first thing is a medium chain fatty acid will generally tropic straight to the liver where the long chain fatty acid,

353
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,840
as we'll talk when the digestion unit is going to be packaged into a thing called

354
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:59,629
a kind of micron and go everywhere else first and then end up in the liver,

355
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:03,440
right? So it's going to go to the periphery first and then end up in the liver, whereas a medium chain,

356
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,239
fatty acid and also a short chain fatty acid is generally going to go straight through your blood, right to your liver.

357
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,660
Right? And so that's going to affect its oxidation in the way that, for example,

358
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:17,270
fructose gets primarily oxidized in the liver, as does as is the second pretty important difference.

359
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:24,530
And again, we'll talk about this. We get to fatty acid oxidation in a couple of lectures is it is oxidized extremely rapidly so we can by the acids

360
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:31,370
generally avoid the key regulatory step the rate limiting step of it oxidation which is an enzyme called CPT one.

361
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:36,390
Since it avoids that step again, much like alcohol, it just gets metabolized right away, right?

362
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:41,149
So it gets broken down for energy or into some of the way without much regulation.

363
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:44,220
So medium and short chain fatty acids are not regulated as long.

364
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,630
So you may have heard of medium chain fatty acids primarily in terms of coconut oil.

365
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,270
So coconut oil actually does have a reasonable amount of lead.

366
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:59,530
So this is the breakdown of culture. Well, from Wikipedia, icons like coconut oil or, you know, like an affected region.

367
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:05,990
And you can see there is a reasonable amount of C12 12 fatty acid in food as well.

368
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:10,070
So I know many of you have had coconut oil in your house or have coconut oil in your house.

369
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:16,120
Coconut oil is an interesting property of like sometimes in the summer it's like a liquid and sometimes in the winter it's like a solid fried.

370
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:20,209
So in Miami it's like coconut oil, but in Canada it's like coconut butter, right?

371
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:24,090
Because of that and that is because of the length of the body.

372
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:31,480
Shorter fatty acids tend to be more soluble. Right? So if you just take some coconut oil and you put it out on a warm day, it will turn into a liquid.

373
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:38,540
But I guess what I want to point out here is a couple of things. So people are like, oh, sure, medium chain fatty acids must be healthy or something.

374
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:42,950
That's probably not true. It's still 94% saturated fat, right?

375
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:45,140
So it is almost exclusively still saturated fat.

376
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:52,190
I'm a little ambivalent about whether medium chain fatty acids and launching fatty acid should be considered both as biologically problematic.

377
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:57,260
But even if you ignore that, you can see there's still a lot of palmitate and risk.

378
00:32:57,410 --> 00:33:02,930
So these are likely fatty acids in the actual oil, the actual triglyceride that's in that's in college.

379
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:11,629
Right. So there is another type of coconut oil that is sometimes called MCT oil, medium chain triglycerides.

380
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:14,540
So that should be exclusively these things. Right.

381
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:19,670
And again, it's a supplement to who knows what the validity of the testing are, but that's the distinction between MCT oil,

382
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,079
which now is almost always going to be liquid at room temperature and coconut oil,

383
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:34,620
which is a combination of all of these things with these longer chain fatty acids, the things that are making it solid at room only in general,

384
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:41,350
the essence the ones that were given as dietary supplements to decrease inflammation along with your weight.

385
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:44,920
Oh, yeah. I mean, like all of everything is given as a supplement to lose weight.

386
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:49,450
Not that I need to do it, but I know the general type of like you're eating a macronutrient is going to be eaten.

387
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:54,340
Right. That seems like an energy reality because they often oxidize that.

388
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,090
So there is good benefits to empty one.

389
00:33:57,110 --> 00:34:04,370
So for example, if you have a fatty acid oxidation effect of oils, like if you had a dissection CBT, one version of a medium chain fatty acids,

390
00:34:04,370 --> 00:34:10,879
you get injured fatty acids because they get metabolized so quickly, create a huge number of people lives because again, there's no regulation.

391
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:18,020
So people who are actively trying to elevate the people running like and seed oil and crude oil because you get this big burst because again,

392
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:21,380
the oxygen will go straight to your liver, it will get off its oxidation.

393
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,979
We'll talk about a couple of examples where individuals might be helpful. But broadly, unless there's like a genetic,

394
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:32,690
I generally don't think there's much evidence that would be an outcome unless it's a release or replacement.

395
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:35,989
Right. If you were like replacing butter with coconut oil, I could see an argument.

396
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:43,879
Right? But if you're just like supplementing with coconut oil, I think that's a little bit of an asset like my brother used to.

397
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:48,230
To gain weight is not just because it's high in calories. Yeah, it is super high in calories.

398
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:50,450
Is nine kilocalories per gram like all. That's right.

399
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:55,790
So yeah, no if you want to gain weight it's like he could also Disney butter that would also be gaining weight.

400
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,949
There's a lot of calories in putting it into smoothies.

401
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:02,900
It's not just like yeah know people do that it is a bit it is a very dense energy source and probably taste better.

402
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,110
Although I don't like Spoonful either. Yes.

403
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:12,800
Okay. So that's coconut oil. That's what exactly was fats and the composition of it.

404
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:19,100
And like I said, sometimes we try to reduce fats like olive oil is like move out and coconut oil is like mostly C12.

405
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:23,989
Right. But as you can see from here, even though coconut oil is canonically, the thing that is like mostly C12,

406
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:32,470
it's less than half of it is right most batter okay like biology for complicated they have a lot of different things so what I want to.

407
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,870
You guys to do now because I need to take a break from talking committed is I want you

408
00:35:36,870 --> 00:35:43,950
to go to the USDA page and I want you to pick out your favorite oil or Mac or whatever.

409
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,999
And I want you to look up the relationship of the fatty acids.

410
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,819
So what fatty acids are in it? How much of them there should be a Google doc that you can use and you can answer this on and you should be

411
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:13,440
able to calculate sort of the relative fat composition of each of these gentlemen right now I want you to see.

412
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,950
And make sure you put your initials on the thing to get.

413
00:37:36,080 --> 00:38:25,190
Just. You know you are a terrorist.

414
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:52,560
Oh, I know.

415
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:21,160
This is. It just gives you all it gives you all this stuff gives like it has to be who finds we just happened together.

416
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:34,920
So I think. But I think that there's two different categories in these roles and each.

417
00:39:47,990 --> 00:40:12,900
Yeah, he's. You mean you want to talk to me here?

418
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:32,560
He. I just hope that this is just a car that doesn't seem like this is just as bad as this is seeing an interaction.

419
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:36,510
So I don't want you to understand.

420
00:40:43,290 --> 00:41:04,930
Yeah. So it's like the site of the six U.S. State Department said this is normal because all the U.S. government is saying,

421
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,669
okay, so it looks like most people have gotten at least partial with yours.

422
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:17,760
So let's just take a quick survey of people. So.

423
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:23,009
So do you want to volunteer? Which oil they picked? And then I want you to tell me one interesting fact about that oil.

424
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:26,700
Like what it's high in or or if it had micronutrients or something like that.

425
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:41,190
All right. You can trace for a total of 11 together, 63 grams versus nine of saturated fat.

426
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:47,270
Okay. So it's more like 70% plus, is it mostly 18 three or 18 two?

427
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:51,270
It is mostly 18 to 18. Two is omega six.

428
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,090
Okay. But I've never had one on your head.

429
00:41:55,270 --> 00:42:01,920
Yeah. That makes sense. I want. I want to point out, because of its proposition, you can't cut it at all.

430
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:13,860
Yeah, not really. Okay. Somebody else want to volunteer an oil or that they would tend to follow somebody in the middle groups group here.

431
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:22,210
You. I use soybean oil.

432
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:26,410
Okay. And it also contains higher.

433
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:37,600
Plus, it's like 57.6 grams and it is higher in C 82, 72.

434
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:42,700
So it's another other. So that's good. So that's going on? Yep. And then how about somebody on here?

435
00:42:43,410 --> 00:42:55,840
Did one of you pick something other than walnuts or soybeans? I did extra virgin olive oil, which is mostly unsaturated fatty acids.

436
00:42:56,610 --> 00:43:02,440
So I end up doing so mostly 18.1, right?

437
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:07,240
Yes. Yep. Let's hear so economical. Okay.

438
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:13,230
That's great. So this is from last year. So this is just a visualization of some of these different oils.

439
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:20,370
So, for example, your butter is large coconut oil and hydrogenated oils and we'll talk about trans fats in a minute.

440
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:26,979
They tend to be mostly saturated fats. And then in the middle here, soybean, canola, peanut olive tend to be roughly movers.

441
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:35,740
And then up here, cottonseed, soybean, corn, flaxseed tend to be mostly right.

442
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,960
And again, we'll talk more about this.

443
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:45,339
So I'm going to go on a little bit sort of the structure here of saturated versus unsaturated fatty acids and why this matters so well.

444
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:51,249
First, start about the double bond. So technically, biochemically, most double bonds can exist in two different orientations.

445
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:54,500
One's called the CIS orientation and one is called the trans oriented.

446
00:43:54,610 --> 00:43:59,139
So the one on the bottom here is with this orientation and because of these two hydrogen,

447
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,450
which are on the same side here, what that causes is a kink in the look, right?

448
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:07,570
So if there's a pink in the lipid now, those lipids cannot pack that tightly together.

449
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:14,290
So even though all three of these lipids are the same length, the fact that this one has a kick in it because of this double bond,

450
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:23,290
which is not potentially stable or is not available, that makes olive oil or make acid in one very, very, very liquid.

451
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:32,140
Right. And if you compare that to Stearic acid, which is a hormone, which is something you'd find in cocoa, for example, is very saturated.

452
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:36,790
And so it's very easy to pipe these things together. Now, there's a third group here which is trans fats, right?

453
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:40,990
So trans fats are now the two hydrogen groups are on opposite sides.

454
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:47,620
See here and here compared to peer to peer. Now, what that does is it makes it look makes it look like a saturated fat.

455
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:54,489
It packs like a saturated fats with saw it at room temperature. But it's going to behave biochemically more like a model in saturated fat, right?

456
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:57,100
Because we digest it. You've got to get rid of that bubble.

457
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:04,030
And so trans fats are pretty rare in natural food products, but they are they were historically largely made industrially.

458
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,419
So, for example, you might take a bunch of olive oil or canola oil,

459
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:12,010
which has a lot of pufas and then you add hydrogenated to try to make them mostly saturated.

460
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:19,410
But every once in a while you would get a trans fat. So when you talk about trans fat, that's what being a trans generally move back here.

461
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:24,820
And these are very, very, very tightly associated with cardiovascular disease, as we've since learned.

462
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,170
Now, the reason people did this is because it's somewhat inconvenient to have an oil right.

463
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:33,100
It's hard to spread oils on planes and things like that. It's hard to bake, but it's hard to measure appropriately.

464
00:45:33,250 --> 00:45:35,680
So a lot of shortening, which are vegetable oils,

465
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:41,770
were included and there was a very long time going back to the cholesterol stuff from before where the argument was,

466
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:46,720
well, vegetable oils, because they're from plants and therefore don't have cholesterol, should be much healthier.

467
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:55,390
Right. So vegetable fats such as shortening, must be much healthier for people than animal fats such as butter or lard, which was was used before.

468
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:02,590
And it turns out that was not true because trans fats are by far the highest cardiovascular risk of these four different types of fats.

469
00:46:02,590 --> 00:46:07,959
Right. So this is looking at the the amount of energy you're getting from fat across these different groups.

470
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:17,980
And you can see that trans fats are by far the highest rate of overall mortality, and this is almost exclusively due to cardiovascular disease.

471
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:25,060
So the fact that is the most problematic is trans fats. And if you compare that to the other three, the slopes of these other three lines here,

472
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:29,080
you can see that saturated fats are two trends that are really, really different.

473
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:34,990
So saturated fats tend to increase mortality, but much, much, much, much less so than trans fats.

474
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:40,150
Again, trans fats are not naturally occurring. They're not anything that we need in our bodies.

475
00:46:40,150 --> 00:46:46,620
We they're not essential for anything. And so they have largely been banned from most Western societies in the food supply.

476
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:52,870
So a lot of those a lot of trans fats in largely processed food supplies up until two or three years ago.

477
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:56,560
And now they've been effectively largely banned as of January 2001.

478
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:03,010
So like, if they like if they're unsaturated and they become more saturated,

479
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:09,970
like like how how can it like biochemically does that make it so different to the cardiovascular outcomes?

480
00:47:10,210 --> 00:47:13,780
Yeah, so and so that's sort of two questions. I'll start with the easy part, which is a lot of things.

481
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:19,840
So if you take a fat like this and you hydrogenated the idea, what you're trying to do is turn this into this.

482
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,420
So the hydrogenation is you're adding the two extra hydrogens.

483
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,900
So it's called hydrogenation, but as a byproduct sometimes you make this right because it's a chemical analysis.

484
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:32,670
So you generated that. So that's why this happened. It wasn't like there was any intent to make trans fats, it was just whitening.

485
00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:38,290
So why they are problematic, it actually turned out to be somewhat hard to study because it was by the time

486
00:47:38,290 --> 00:47:41,590
people identified the epidemiology of these as decomposing cardiovascular disease,

487
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:45,070
it was a pretty easy decision to be like, well, that's like not them. Right.

488
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:48,430
And so there haven't been a ton of studies on exactly why we do those some.

489
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:55,020
Things like, for example, it raises your LDL cholesterol and it tends to increase inflammation tends to be associated with obesity.

490
00:47:55,770 --> 00:48:01,160
But we don't exactly know what the mechanism about that and probably will not know any more because it's largely out of place.

491
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:06,180
This is not true in a lot of developing countries which thought plenty of trans fats and because they have,

492
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,580
they have not always been, although at this point most countries have.

493
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:19,589
Again, and this I'm just showing you this here to show that most of the trans fat associated all cause mortality is because of cardiovascular disease.

494
00:48:19,590 --> 00:48:29,040
There's a limited effects on type two diabetes and this is we still androgyny fat foils how would that not

495
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:34,410
translate I guess though is still in business so how are producing it without that is an excellent question.

496
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:38,050
So let me have the answer on this very blog.

497
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:46,530
So this is what people have been eating fat wise in America in the last I guess it's starting to cut to up to 2010.

498
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:49,200
And you can see there was a lot of butter lard. Right.

499
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:56,099
And then because of cholesterol consciousness concerns that was largely replaced with margarines and margins were a primary source of trans fats.

500
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,220
You can see butter has decreased and I don't think you can move buy lard anywhere.

501
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,820
So it's pretty grim. So what have we replaced? We have replaced that with palm oil.

502
00:49:03,060 --> 00:49:08,730
So palm oil is largely, for example, what is in Crisco. That is what it is not necessarily hydrogenated fat.

503
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:14,160
It's usually palm oil has the advantage of being a vegetable, but also being stable at room temperature.

504
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,440
It's a solid picture of people over time.

505
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:21,180
If you put it in a fridge, it will cool down and you get that.

506
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:25,950
Yeah, I'm sure. Again, I'm just saying you don't like when I go to the store, I see margins that I see,

507
00:49:26,190 --> 00:49:35,999
I see Butters and I think I don't know, you can make margin, but largely that's what we've done.

508
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,159
Right. And so we now replace margin with palm oil.

509
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:42,530
I do the presumption that this time we got it right and for sure this time this fat is not going to come back,

510
00:49:42,570 --> 00:49:48,990
bite us and cause health problems in the future. But like I said, if you look at palm oil, consumption has skyrocketed in the last ten years,

511
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:55,140
largely due to place a precipitous declines of Warburtons know how to convert.

512
00:49:56,130 --> 00:50:00,180
This also has pretty profound environmental effects because obviously palm trees don't grow everywhere.

513
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:03,060
For example, very rarely you find in Canada.

514
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:09,660
And so it involves a lot of pulling of palm trees and processing them in countries that were previously doing that.

515
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,260
So this is what palm oil looks like, right?

516
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:19,469
So palm oil is 44% palmitate 38%, albeit it's all the being the same thing.

517
00:50:19,470 --> 00:50:26,640
That is the move in in in old, right?

518
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:32,610
So if you compare the two, you can see it actually looks chemically a lot closer to butter than it does to Oliver.

519
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:34,200
Right. That is why it's something, right?

520
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:40,829
So the idea that we've replaced it with palm oil, effectively, you've just sort of found the plant version of butter, right?

521
00:50:40,830 --> 00:50:45,960
It's very similar to what is used on basically a plant based butter and replace that with that.

522
00:50:46,020 --> 00:50:50,160
Right. So that's what. Oh, my God. That's right. And it's solid because most of it.

523
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:55,709
All right. So I'd have a hard time believing that there's going to be any differences now between Palmitate

524
00:50:55,710 --> 00:51:01,710
and butter in terms of their effects on all these different supplies of saturated fatty acids.

525
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:07,980
It's more of a plus for miles.

526
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:13,200
Okay. So I'm going to move on to the nomenclature. We're going to do one more activity and then the food of the day for today.

527
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,700
So like I said, there's a common name which usually is historical, promoted,

528
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:25,080
literally age, weird lipid numbers, and indeed where that is at a balance.

529
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:29,710
And then generally you also want to say where the double bond is, right?

530
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:33,720
So it matters where that double bond is. A lot like where we get to movies in a moment.

531
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:41,670
So you need to name exactly where that market. And as you can see from this one here, you can see where this bond is either by starting from here.

532
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:52,180
129.29 So if you start from hydroxyl in BlackRock, you got nine or you could come from this end, in which case it would be a seven.

533
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:56,129
We could count it because usually that is called the omega number, right?

534
00:51:56,130 --> 00:52:01,770
So all fatty acid, tampoco omega name and the delta. It's a little confusing why we have both.

535
00:52:02,670 --> 00:52:03,600
It turns out excellent.

536
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:10,770
And semantically the delta nomenclature makes more sense because all enzymes introduce double bonds relative to the hydroxyl end.

537
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:16,400
Right. So that an enzyme doesn't care how long a fatty acid is. But it will, for example, at a double bond with the Delta 90,

538
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:22,620
which is what we're as omega out atomically here is more useful from a nutritional standpoint because we usually

539
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:28,740
can discriminate between omega three fatty acids as the two defense to two indispensable fatty acids that we.

540
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:49,320
Okay. All right. So what I want you guys to do is we're going to spend about 5 minutes on this, and I want you to try to draw just one of these.

541
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:54,510
I've actually submitted, if you want to submit an activity in the middle 3.3, but try to draw one.

542
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:58,079
And if you're drawing it, if you're going to include a system of mindfulness,

543
00:52:58,080 --> 00:53:06,690
such as the one try to draw in that case with a very clear what that does is so just giving you the name of the party.

544
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:23,930
I think there is a mention of.

545
00:53:48,120 --> 00:54:10,470
We haven't seen. New Year's Eve.

546
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:43,920
He's. Why?

547
00:55:15,100 --> 00:56:14,819
Let's. So again, after usual, if you're struggling with any of this, of the drawing, just make a little note to submit it.

548
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:21,770
On breakout, you try to draw all four. But like I said, if you get confused for a little circle for our attention to where you're struggling,

549
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:26,429
but one of the goals of what we're trying to do, at least in this particular unit,

550
00:56:26,430 --> 00:56:31,709
is for you to be able to draw any value and given it's canonically true and then

551
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:36,000
also be able to derive to see another feature from the front fatty acid as well.

552
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:42,420
Okay. Let me move on to our first essential nutrients if we're not gonna go into every fiber.

553
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:45,870
And that is the thing that was originally called vitamin F.

554
00:56:46,530 --> 00:56:51,030
And the reason we thought about this was because going back historically in the 1920s and thirties,

555
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,730
there's a lot of studies on mice and rats where basically they would give them

556
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:56,640
synthetic diets to try to figure out what is it that they actually need.

557
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:02,220
And we just slowly synthetically chemically add certain things in to support that growth.

558
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:09,059
And so what they found was there was a particular set of rats that if they were in this synthetic diet, they did not look right.

559
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:14,190
And this was their, you know, not through anything was these rats just sort of stopped stopped growing.

560
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:21,420
And that's because they were missing something in their fat. And the thing they were missing was eventually identified as being methyl linoleic.

561
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:26,999
Right. So that's linoleic acid that is now we know an omega six fatty acid at a time.

562
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,190
They called it out and there was a lot of debate about could it be a vitamin for all the reasons we talked about, for some small molecule.

563
00:57:32,370 --> 00:57:35,700
But it is an essential nutrient vitamin A omega six fatty acids.

564
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,690
So why why is it essential? So it turns out that this is a biochemistry of double bond formation.

565
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:48,269
And as I said a few minutes ago, this catchphrases exist and they work from the hydroxyl.

566
00:57:48,270 --> 00:57:51,210
And so they work from the side that I'm standing on right now.

567
00:57:51,330 --> 00:57:56,280
So you can introduce double bond and they have specificity of where they introduce double bonds.

568
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,849
Right. So a negative adult, 90 surgeries in humans is called a C.

569
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:03,839
One can only put a double bond in the Delta nine position.

570
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:08,700
Right. It cannot put it anywhere else on a body yet. So that's why we can make oleic acid ourselves.

571
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,260
But we take that what can't make it up to eight or ten.

572
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:21,230
There are Delta 12 and Delta 15. These exist in plants and in fish, but absolutely not.

573
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:25,170
We do not have the Delta one, Delta 15 saturation.

574
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:31,020
Right. So what that means is that we are unable to make double bonds any farther than the Delta nine position.

575
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:35,100
Okay. We'll go through this when we get to the synthesis unit, too.

576
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,599
But if I tell you that fatty acids, we can increase the number one out 2.9,

577
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,280
you should be able to given the length of patriots has been covering with the

578
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:46,649
tendencies unit be able to figure out why we cannot make these two fatty acids.

579
00:58:46,650 --> 00:58:52,860
If you take a C 16 fatty acid, you add a Delta 12 bond, you end up with Linoleic acid, which is omega six fatty acid.

580
00:58:53,100 --> 00:59:00,060
If you also have a Delta 15, actually, now you're going to make a three, which is alpha little acid, which is three values.

581
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:07,259
Okay. So the main source of most of these tiny acids is going to be in fish.

582
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,149
And so that is going to be what we're going to finish today,

583
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:15,690
which is going to be our Fruit of the Day, which is sent off a few slides after the Fruit of the Day.

584
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:19,290
And I'll cover those Monday. Yeah.

585
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:35,700
Yeah. Hi, guys. So I put of the day salmon.

586
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:42,120
And so we're just going to go over the history of and talk about macro and micro ethics and some of our allocations,

587
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:47,939
different cooking styles, and then I'll take questions. And so we're kind of going over the history.

588
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:51,900
Salmon originated 6 million years ago, and it really was.

589
00:59:52,350 --> 01:00:04,920
And with time, Lewis and Clark in their expeditions and then that trade began in 1849 can begin in 1866.

590
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:11,610
And now we can find a zoom in between the U.S. and Europe and countries like Norway and Scotland.

591
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:18,899
And we can also find salmon in Chile. So different types of salmon that we're going to look at first.

592
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:27,510
To understand that salmon, you have to recognize that it's some kind of salmon, which is common chum.

593
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:34,890
So before we get into salmon, there's two different ways we can classify salmon either as farmed or as wild.

594
01:00:35,550 --> 01:00:37,200
When we look at farmed salmon,

595
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:47,190
it has more than maybe three fatty acids and more saturated fats where it is more harmful because it has more pollutants in wild salmon,

596
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,270
it has fewer calories, less condiments, and is a safer option.

597
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:58,200
And when you go shopping for salmon and you see Pacific or Atlantic Pacific salmon is usually categorized as wild salmon.

598
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:01,290
And that really salmon is categorized as farmed.

599
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:11,760
So looking at the nutrients, I decided to look at King Salmon as a specification and it has 177 clean calories.

600
01:01:13,350 --> 01:01:23,040
And we're looking at one fillet of salmon. There is 20.4 grams of protein, 13.3 grams of fat, approximately 1.5 grams of fatty acids.

601
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,020
Omega three fatty acids are initially salmon.

602
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:34,320
But in this piece specifically, there is a point for four grams of omega three fatty acids and point seven grams of omega six fatty acids.

603
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:45,540
Here are the micronutrients. I had the DRI for each micronutrient and I mean, calcium is pretty low in semen along with iron and sodium,

604
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:54,090
but there is a fair amount of vitamin E in here and clinical applications and health claims.

605
01:01:56,130 --> 01:02:02,220
So that says that they can reduce inflammation in chronic heart disease, as I like to today.

606
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:11,110
Also diabetes and cancer promoting cognition, hence why there's a lot of vitamin E, c, and it also promotes brain development.

607
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:17,009
And when I was a little further into the brain development for infants and I looked

608
01:02:17,010 --> 01:02:24,120
at the clinical clinical trial where it looked at preschool children ages 4 to 6,

609
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:28,169
and the total population in that trial was 205 children.

610
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:37,320
And the hypothesis that they tried to test was does increased dietary intake result in better cognitive outcomes than science?

611
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:46,530
So they took farmed salmon and they gave three meals before and after each test that they did for 16 weeks.

612
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:55,980
So looking here at this picture, three each meal, EPA and DHEA,

613
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:01,139
which are omega three fatty acids, were relatively normal between seven and eight years,

614
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:10,350
but they increased significantly, significantly enough that they it was statistically significant after each meal.

615
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:17,580
And there's also an increase in iodine, but it wasn't enough to really work on this particular significant.

616
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:29,450
And then in this graph, there's a lot of scattered points. So overall, they realize that it doesn't really have an effect depending on the test.

617
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:33,920
But the two tests that did have a significant test was the picture,

618
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:42,739
concept and symbol like subjects so that we know the different styles we have there.

619
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:52,310
Five were very focused and from my reading both in actually gross and big because I like to make them doing fisticuffs.

620
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:59,900
If any of you have had three fish or two new chicken, it's kind of the same thing, but it's not cooked in a jiffy.

621
01:04:00,500 --> 01:04:06,319
But I like to marinate it with all the spices from my home and yogurt oil,

622
01:04:06,320 --> 01:04:09,979
and then bake it and then boil it for the last 2 minutes to give it a real effect.

623
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:26,940
And then some of these, like a taco and put some chutney on. Yeah.

624
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:32,980
You know why they chose farmed salmon versus wild salmon?

625
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,490
Farmed salmon is just easier to find. Yeah. That was the only reason.

626
01:04:37,350 --> 01:04:45,250
Yeah. So it says like you were talking about brain development in infants, but the kids that were chosen were 4 to 6 years old.

627
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:51,150
Yeah. So why so brain development and health is just for specifically younger children, right?

628
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:56,739
It doesn't really have an effect on adults. When you eat fish oil, everything is just when your brain develops just during that time.

629
01:04:56,740 --> 01:05:06,639
So they thought they would take the population. Can you go back to that?

630
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:11,440
You know, because I think I wasn't 100% sure which one that's harder than the next one as well.

631
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:14,850
Yeah. So like, I guess I'm trying to study a little bit.

632
01:05:14,860 --> 01:05:21,790
So is it that they were told to eat salmon, but then individuals eat like wildly varying amounts of salmon and that's what, you know.

633
01:05:21,790 --> 01:05:29,019
So they were broken up into two groups and one group was supposed to eat salmon three times each week and then for 16 weeks.

634
01:05:29,020 --> 01:05:33,040
And the second group was just eating a normal diet of meat specifically.

635
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:35,470
And so then this was like, Yeah,

636
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:41,229
I guess I'm wondering why there's so much variance across the number of things like left or right, plus lots of follow up.

637
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:44,680
Maybe some people don't want to eat salmon all through meals, right?

638
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:53,230
Yeah. So I guess I get a sense that doesn't look like an important event, but specifically in two subgroups, there was a correlation in.

639
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,970
Okay. Knew the questions. Okay.

640
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:09,740
So thank you. Now. These slides are beginning next class.

641
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:16,070
So the exams are laid out here in numerical order, starting with the first digit of your you on my right.

642
01:06:16,070 --> 01:06:16,310
So there's,

643
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:25,430
there's ten different files and so feel free to grab them and then we'll post the three of the right answers to multiple choice on the website,

644
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:52,060
I promise. I don't. But also, I don't think there's so much room for me somewhere to ask, like, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

645
01:06:55,700 --> 01:07:01,940
I was always like, always. No, I knew I was like, Oh, there's somebody else who didn't call me that often.

646
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:12,070
Luckily, you got one right.
