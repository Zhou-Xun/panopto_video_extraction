1
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:30,740
How to foster within my students, that self-critique

2
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:35,069
That ability to be, to bring a racially conscious self-critique.

3
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,400
To their own work and to themselves.

4
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:46,380
But also to begin to understand how the institutions and systems within which we work.

5
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:55,060
Have these power dynamics that reinforce the existing racial inequities.

6
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:05,190
So. That's a very difficult place to be and it's a place of what I call it requires what I call.

7
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:21,940
Sort of, constant decentering, dynamic decentering of our own selves, in the sense that I come to this work as one who feels often like an outsider,

8
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:30,520
who comes from the social margins and is now operating within a position of privilege within an academic institution.

9
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:41,620
And so as I walk through my my days and my weeks in this work, I carry both privilege and disadvantage with me.

10
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,350
And I'm constantly navigating both across nearly every interaction that I have.

11
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:59,800
And this is just common for for all of us. So the dynamic, the centering is about not allowing my own personal experience to obscure.

12
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:07,600
The, the, the still important role that I can play in addressing the institutional racism.

13
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,820
Right. So it's not just about the ways that I, myself,

14
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:22,050
am marginalized in this experience and through institutions and the persistence of racism within the institutions,

15
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:33,030
but also the ways in which the institutions and perhaps even including myself within the institutions, play a role in

16
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:39,700
helping to perpetuate inequities. And so in that respect.

17
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:54,360
To be anti-racist is really to be in a state of constant sort of tension, both within myself, how I approach my work, striving to do it with humility,

18
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:02,010
open to the next generation who might offer insights that I can't perceive myself,

19
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:14,700
and then constantly pushing against the very institution that's paying me, the very institution I represent to others, pushing

20
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,260
to force it to reflect the ideals of equity.

21
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,180
That our institutions and also the field of public health

22
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,660
articulate. Working toward anti-racist teaching is also essential in the field of public health.

23
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:38,740
We have to not only think about instances of overt racism,

24
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:45,370
but often institutional instances of racism when sometimes those involved may not be overtly racist.

25
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,110
I always remind my students that the most secure, efficient,

26
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:57,730
racist system is one that can actually be run by non racists or people who otherwise believe they're not racist.

27
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:05,140
And this is what anti-racism is about. It's uncovering the structures and the systems that lead to racial inequities.

28
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,900
Whether or not the individuals involved are engaged in overt racism or believe they're racist in the first place.

29
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:19,000
One thing I also try to do in my class to create more of an anti-racist environment, especially in small lecture classes,

30
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,910
is make it clear to students that knowledge comes from a range of different sources.

31
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,430
Academic knowledge is important, experiential knowledge is important.

32
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:33,190
And similarly, academic writing, public writing, music, poetry, art.

33
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:39,070
So I do think having the empirical literature on which to draw is essential for public health students.

34
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:43,629
But I also want everyone in the class to understand that when their peers are

35
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,730
sharing about a personal experience that will shape their understanding of racism.

36
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:57,580
Equally, if not more than the original empirical article would. Being anti-racist public health scholars isn't just an intellectual endeavor.

37
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:02,739
The way I look at it, it needs to be something you're driven to do emotionally attached to.

38
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:10,150
Right? And often our emotional connection to the material comes more from the student who shares his experience, perhaps in a home raid,

39
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:17,230
or the student who shares her experience about coming out both as an undocumented immigrant or about somebody who likes someone of the same gender.

40
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:24,849
These are the experiences that are personal, that bring us closer to our understandings of these systems that arguably keep us working

41
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,780
in what can be a really challenging field for the rest of our professional careers,

42
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:34,040
if not our lives. So what does anti-racist teaching mean to me?

43
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,790
You know, I think at the core, you know, we are in our society as a whole.

44
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:55,760
You know, we see this in some ways as backlash against really truth telling about the history of our nation and like I said,

45
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,169
other racialized societies.

46
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:09,200
And so you have these attacks on things like critical race theory and but really what it is is an attack on truth telling.

47
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:26,180
And so part of anti-racist teaching or teaching from an anti-racism perspective is unapologetic truth telling and creating an environment for

48
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:38,450
critical dialog and critique and reflection on the ways in which racism operates to influence health and influence racial health inequities.

49
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:43,430
Right. And so that the teaching does a number of things,

50
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:52,130
one of which I think is goes back to if we've excluded certain voices from the field and from the discourse,

51
00:06:52,520 --> 00:07:04,700
how in our teaching and in our training do we include a diverse set of scholars from a diverse set of disciplines outside of public health?

52
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:11,600
Right. So one thing I think that is that is necessary if we're going to move the field of public health,

53
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:20,959
is that we have to draw on the really rich and rigorous scholarship from individuals within other fields like sociology,

54
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,060
like anthropology, like history,

55
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:32,510
who bring to bear the pieces of the puzzle that we need to incorporate in our curriculum in order to really create that kind

56
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:41,030
of foundational knowledge base that students need to understand these issues because they're, they're complex.

57
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,510
You know, racism is complex. It's multifaceted.

58
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,010
And understanding of it must, again, be multidisciplinary.

59
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,980
And so, for example, in the class that I teach, you know,

60
00:07:53,060 --> 00:08:03,320
my, my syllabus is full of anthropologists and sociologists is full of both contemporary texts, but historical texts.

61
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:11,150
So I think anti-racist teaching is important because we're training the next generation of scholars and practitioners, right?

62
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:18,770
Like if we don't teach it, if we don't have it as an essential part and as a fundamental part,

63
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:27,590
as a required part of our curriculum, we're doing a disservice to our students. The students coming into our schools

64
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:37,000
want that the ability to articulate what's going on in the world and how it's how does it influence health and how does it influence it?

65
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:42,219
So we're doing a disservice to our students if we don't have this as a part of our curriculum.

66
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,320
And I think they're, they're hungry for it. Students are hungry for this perspective.

67
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:51,520
They're hungry for places to understand, and then they're hungry for now

68
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,060
how do I take this and apply it to the work that I'm going to do in public health?

69
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:03,280
Right. And so we do a disservice to our students when we don't take this perspective and make it really central to our curriculum.

70
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:13,440
I think about creating learning spaces that affirm the lives of all people and

71
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:26,100
I walk into those learning spaces, thinking about some of the teachings of my mentors, my native elders, and

72
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:37,440
folks who've surrounded me in helping me to come from a place of strength and wholeness when I'm teaching to university students.

73
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,250
When I walk into those spaces, it's unusual.

74
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:50,010
It's unusual for them to see me as a native woman in a space like that, creating the space, guiding them in this space,

75
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,620
offering them a learning experience beyond hierarchy and hierarchical approaches,

76
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:02,580
binary thinking, but a learning experience that is centered in relationality.

77
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:11,880
For us to all show up as our best selves, to remember that we're learning that we're not perfect, and to trust the process.

78
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,870
It's funny because I learned how to teach

79
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:26,800
from my, my elders and the mentors in my community and those who've shaped me outside of the university setting.

80
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,660
I bring my indigenous values into that space.

81
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:39,760
And I know just that action alone is interrupting narratives of trauma.

82
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:43,480
It's interrupting narratives of white supremacy.

83
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,560
It's even interrupting actions of white supremacy.

84
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:57,580
I'm already thinking about the protections that I have around me and in my life, the blessings so that I can walk into that space with a good heart,

85
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,190
with a remembering that we're all learning and that we're doing something

86
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:10,360
different than what I experienced in a white dominated Western education system.

87
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:18,880
So me walking into that space is radical for some students and unusual for most.

88
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:28,570
The experiences that I offer the students in that space are important because I know other indigenous

89
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:39,360
educators and scholars and activists and mentors and elders that as indigenous people we generate lives that live lives.

90
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:50,220
This is what Leanne Simpson says, and I want to offer that sort of experience and perspective to students so that as we're thinking about public health,

91
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:56,540
how are we thinking about creating the conditions that uplift the lives of all?

92
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:05,940
And how do we do that when Native people have been systemically have been experiencing

93
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:13,500
conditions of erasure because of the conditions of settler colonialism and if students

94
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:19,680
don't get the real truth in their educational experience and then come to my class

95
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:29,909
that can be really unsettling for them. And so often I'm teaching them just the basic information about settler colonialism

96
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:35,650
and reminding even many of them that indigenous people are alive and thriving.

97
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,049
We're in the current space.

98
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:47,370
We're not in in history, and we're actively contributing to building a future that is indigenous and is beneficial to all lives.

99
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:51,629
U.S. Nation State experience racism,

100
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:56,520
but we also experience the harms of settler colonialism.

101
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:02,790
Settler colonialism is this ongoing system designed to eliminate and erase

102
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:12,960
indigenous people from the land, so that the land can become owned and produce wealth for white settlers.
