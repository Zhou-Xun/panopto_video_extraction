1
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:25,960
Hey, we are thinking about different careers and epidemiology.

2
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:34,750
We've got our guest, Vivian Curtis here, project senior manager at Michigan Medicine, a graduate from our program from 2010 and I think.

3
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:42,190
Right, yeah. So our MPH epic program back then and has that had been through the career journey she's going to share with you today.

4
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,649
So please ask questions.

5
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:52,480
Think about what you want to know for her journey and we'll kind of help you some questions after do so be in and you just great thank you.

6
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,920
Thank you. All right. Good afternoon, everyone.

7
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:02,560
So I have these slides to just kind of like guide the presentation, but feel free to ask questions, comment throughout the presentation.

8
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,010
All right, you got it.

9
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:18,110
So to give a background on my education going into Henry Ford health system and medicine, your work and then any lessons learned.

10
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,310
Key takeaways that I have throughout my 12 years of working in the field.

11
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:31,850
So I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2008 with my Bachelors in Biological Anthropology and my own health.

12
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:37,150
That was because I've always had a scientific background, and that kind of helped me in most of my gaps.

13
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:44,910
Right away. After graduating with my bachelor's, I went into my MBA program in General Epidemiology.

14
00:09:44,930 --> 00:09:51,700
In 2010, I graduated. I didn't have an early research exposure.

15
00:09:52,460 --> 00:10:01,460
I was part of the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program at U of M, and I did that in my freshman and sophomore years of undergrad.

16
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:11,240
My first job was to work in pain management research up at the VA hospital, and that was a very entry level research position.

17
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:18,410
But it gave me ideas of what kind of jobs there were in the research group working at the VA,

18
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,840
which has a lot of regulatory things that you have to go through in order to work there.

19
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:27,860
But that was a very simple did an injury finding.

20
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,920
And then there was data where I would just make graphs.

21
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:37,070
Honestly, it was very boring, but it did give me a start into research.

22
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:46,210
Then in my sophomore year of college, I worked in the psychology research lab and that was focused on LGBT issues and hate crimes.

23
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:55,700
There I did interviews with research participants and actually did the interfaith intervention with the

24
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:01,700
research participation participants and then the data collection that was a little bit more interesting,

25
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:12,000
but it was qualitative research versus quantitative research, and that was my very early decision to move away from qualitative research.

26
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:18,410
I knew that I was more interested in looking at data points that were related to

27
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:25,370
labs and how that was like a disease or something versus this qualitative work.

28
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:33,280
And then after Europe, I knew that I was still interested also in public health in general.

29
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:36,169
There was just as I'm doing this guest lecture,

30
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:45,080
there was a seminar where it was people from the admissions office at the School of Public Health came and spoke to the students.

31
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,400
And this was my freshman year. That was my first exposure to public health.

32
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:53,710
And so from that point, I knew that I was generally interested in public health.

33
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,640
And so when the grant program ended for me after my sophomore year,

34
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:03,920
I specifically was trying to find a job at the School of Public Health and I was able to find one.

35
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:07,940
And so from junior year through the end of grad school,

36
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:16,819
I worked in the Department of Epidemiology under Dr. Mary Frances Hours and Dr. Kerry Carmen Gutierrez.

37
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:20,630
I don't know if we've ever had her as a professor. She's fabulous.

38
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,840
Take a class with her, talk to her, learn from her.

39
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:30,320
She's wonderful. But those two were my main mentors junior, senior and then grad school.

40
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,680
I worked at Hispanic Women's Health across the nation. I did all kinds of things.

41
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:43,820
And that what was nice about that was it was a smaller group focused on a very specific area of research.

42
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:48,730
And so there was like one analyst, one programmer and guy.

43
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:58,370
We had 20 research students. So you kind of get to see how a research group would be set up at the V.A. hospital and the research lab.

44
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,370
The psychology research lab. It wasn't structured in that way.

45
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:07,099
And so this was a little bit more interesting for me. But I was patient.

46
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:15,290
Instead of doing surveys like blood draws physical functioning assessments to people to the hospital, get MRI x rays.

47
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:26,479
And then once I got into grad school and learned about SAS, I did data cleaning data programing and did a lot of this stuff with higher BS.

48
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,420
And so it gave me incredible exposure to what a research group in public health look like.

49
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:40,940
So then it came time for it to second year and be my first year of grad school.

50
00:13:40,950 --> 00:13:46,829
You get to like what a summer internship would be like. And also in grad school,

51
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:56,400
you're trying to figure out do you want to do chronic health or infectious diseases international or a local hospital or a local health department?

52
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:04,860
What kind of work that I want to do that I want to be an analyst. You know, you've actually got so many biostatistics classes.

53
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:14,490
I have hardly used it in my career yet. I was just being present.

54
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:24,190
And how hard do you see the course changing following?

55
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:30,340
That can take time in general. Every student at school.

56
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:36,250
I wish I did. All of them just get into a wonderful program.

57
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,490
I'll tell you why it's relevant in there. So what I did that I could never forget it.

58
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,780
What other kind of work that I want to do, anything I want to pursue of BHP?

59
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:54,460
No, I was done with school after my Masters program.

60
00:14:54,490 --> 00:15:03,610
I hated being a student, so I my next program, I knew I'd done so.

61
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:08,800
Then I really had to think like, oh my God. Like I really start thinking about my career.

62
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,160
Where am I going to get a job? And I did some call.

63
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:16,330
I was like, I'm interested in maybe working at a hospital.

64
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,469
I wanted to try something other than U of M at that school.

65
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,640
At U of M, I got all my job that do it that I needed to get out of doing that.

66
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,270
So I emailed the department chair of the Public Health Sciences Department and report helps us there.

67
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:35,240
And I was like, Hi, can I have an internship? And she said, Yes.

68
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:42,850
B.A. connected me with a woman that was overseeing students, and they're like, Come on in.

69
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,839
And it was Just do it. Just put yourself out there.

70
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,190
The worst thing you do is say no and then you're bad. You have nothing to report.

71
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,400
So I was. I is.

72
00:15:55,990 --> 00:16:01,120
And I wanted to do something to that I knew I could use for my master's thesis.

73
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:09,190
And so this actually all worked out really well. I ended up working with a woman that focused on reproductive health,

74
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:15,339
and that was my interest because of my background in undergraduate minor in women's health.

75
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:22,390
And so I did a project where I developed the surveys, the complex data dictionary,

76
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:33,190
the database to collect the data and then sat and abstracted patient data from their medical records for 8 hours a day for three months.

77
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:42,310
And it was very, very terrible. But I knew what I didn't want to do in my career and what I did want, like had zero vision of it.

78
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:46,299
And then I was able to use that data to do my master's thesis.

79
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:51,100
And so it was on the effects of beta blockers on ovarian cancer progression and survival.

80
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:59,680
So, um, and what I was told there too, even during my internship, people were very nice, very open.

81
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:04,930
And if you're interested in a job after you graduate, just let us know.

82
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:14,469
So I did that. So I think it was like January, February, my second year in grad school.

83
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:20,020
I reached out back to the woman I mainly work with and the department chair.

84
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:26,380
And I don't know if you have Christine come in at work. She's not coming this year, but she has come before.

85
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:33,470
Yeah. Christine Yeah, yeah. Oh, those are the things that come, right?

86
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:42,070
They both work. You're right now. Oh, which one doctor go to devote their day like would you at it.

87
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:53,410
Oh yes. Oh yeah. And so Christine so she was like, yeah, we have ethics positions open, apply, apply.

88
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:58,150
And you got the job. And I mean, it was.

89
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:07,290
It was nice because I kind of knew what I was going into. However, I didn't have no choice on the content area that I could work.

90
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:13,300
It was, we have these projects, we need you to be overseeing projects.

91
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,090
And so I was like, okay. But they had a whole mix of project.

92
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:21,910
They had work where an effort would actually be hired to do the analysis.

93
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:36,390
There was proposal writing. There was manuscript writing. Some of the projects were focused on budget and just kind of processes,

94
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,219
and then they have these collaborative quality initiatives that the department

95
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,410
had three of several of these projects and they needed somebody to oversee them.

96
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:54,640
And so that's how I got working in the Blue Cross Blue Shield Mission Plan, the initial quality initiatives and policy wise.

97
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,250
And then so for these projects. They are state run registries.

98
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:10,100
They have a coordinating center and the hospitals can participate to submit their data to this registry and do quality improvement projects.

99
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:20,159
And the overall goal is to improve quality, improve outcomes, but that hospitals have the incentive for a bonus dollars for their hospitals.

100
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,950
If they do, well, at least you are. And so each of these projects had like a report card.

101
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,970
And depending on how you scored on these report cards, you got bonus dollars for the execution.

102
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:39,330
So I was very good at figuring out how to get for the most money.

103
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:47,129
So over time with each project, I would go generally about 6 to $7 million.

104
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:52,320
I was overseeing for these projects and a couple at the other hospitals.

105
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:59,760
And then I would also in the Department of Health Sciences, there are physicians that are interested in getting their own projects.

106
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:07,050
And so they would reach out to the departure of the P.A. and say, you know, we have this project idea.

107
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,760
What do we need in order to do this project?

108
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:18,850
And so they would typically assign, like an epidemiologist, a junior epidemiologist is a Ph.D. level epidemiologist.

109
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,130
They had more of the grant writing and the manuscript writing,

110
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:33,250
whereas the MPH level epidemiologists did more of overseeing the projects, the databases, and then the staffing on the practice.

111
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,490
So knowing data, which is what I just.

112
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:48,830
No. Any data, no way to describe you guys, but knowing data and knowing like what's going to be needed for the analysis,

113
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,420
how to structure your data, it's all very important with these research projects.

114
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,979
So that was my role to working with the programmers and then how the data

115
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:03,410
would be collected in order to have a nice clean data set ready for analysis,

116
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,460
in order to answer any questions that would be brought up for the project.

117
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:12,440
So physicians would come, they would ask for this project,

118
00:21:12,830 --> 00:21:21,649
we would do a visit and we would go over for project timelines and then a full proposal on what this project would be like.

119
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:28,330
And I heard they had money to do this or we found money to do this screening.

120
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,540
At one point I had a petition that we wanted a project that's for failure.

121
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:40,310
I have no idea about liver failure, but you did a little bit of reading, you understand some things, and then you take from other experience.

122
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,410
You have to be able to build the project knowing like what kind of scaffolding you would need,

123
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,770
how much data you would need, and then how to build the database.

124
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:56,210
But then I had to I did this from before, and then the physician and I were leading this project,

125
00:21:56,600 --> 00:22:05,340
did a proposal in front of the emergency department saying, look what this project would do, how we would do it, and we got $25,000 for it.

126
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:12,230
For my second year of working, I was like, All right, however, women.

127
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,850
There are still some men out there that will say the worst thing to you.

128
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:25,440
I remember during this proposal, God asked me, So what happens if you get pregnant and you get off of the project?

129
00:22:26,810 --> 00:22:32,880
You got an exam? What does that even mean?

130
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:43,860
So while these things do happen and you just have to be aware that they're making a fool of themselves in front of these people.

131
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:46,590
Just maintain your cool and give them a very real chance.

132
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:54,120
I will come back home trying to believe it's a temporary thing, and I'm not the only one working on this project.

133
00:22:54,870 --> 00:23:01,740
But it does happen. It's happened several times in my career, and fortunately nobody seems to be into it.

134
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:18,740
But men are getting better. Oh, and then in addition to that, I still try to keep some of those same skills and some of the final statistics feel.

135
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:22,920
I feel like an advocate for the Society of Epidemiological Research.

136
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:31,350
It was cool. I didn't want to get information. I've got to go to Montreal, but I don't get asked about any of that stuff anymore.

137
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:38,069
So it's always been an option in every one of the jobs I've been in to write manuscripts,

138
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:44,430
to do posters, to go to conferences and to do any kind of presentations.

139
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:49,300
And then I would do presentations and posters for the Henry Ford College expos that were annual.

140
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:55,800
So any questions here for this job? First job as geologist.

141
00:23:56,670 --> 00:24:04,350
I did that for three years and it was cool. And then Henry Ford created the paper performance and registry manager.

142
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:13,140
So they realized that I brought in a lot of money and added a lot of great quality improvement in their clinics.

143
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,120
And so they created this role where there was a system of oversight of these projects.

144
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:25,049
And because of my experience as epidemiologist and my last role, I was able to secure this position.

145
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:28,430
And so I did the contracting.

146
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,980
I helped with diabetes, staffing, budgeting,

147
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:42,000
and then any kind of reporting out that needed to happen to the Board of Trustees or quality department or CEOs, chief medical officers.

148
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,340
And then people would feel I was the main person reporting out of these projects.

149
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:56,610
It was a lot of fun. It ended up being about over 20 plus projects that I was overseeing, 30 plus staff members,

150
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,510
and at that time was about $20 million that I was overseeing for this system.

151
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:08,910
So this was great. A lot of this job, there wasn't as much the final staff that I had to do here.

152
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:16,220
There wasn't as much of the nitty gritty research things that we had learned in school.

153
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:20,060
It was more so understanding the process and these projects.

154
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:30,390
So I would say of all of my job, this was probably the least researched G effort stuff that I did, but I needed to change.

155
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:37,620
Our health system was a 45 minute drive for me and I had little gurus and it was difficult.

156
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:43,950
So ladies, it's okay to have kids. You don't have to change your career and change options for kids.

157
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:49,020
Don't feel like you can't do that. We live in a world now where that's completely okay.

158
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:54,220
All right. So then I started my role at Michigan Medicine.

159
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,870
It was in internal medicine nephrology.

160
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,160
I've never had any interest in things or nephrology.

161
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:04,790
So again, this is just happened to be where I ended up.

162
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:09,590
Oh, I did the last the first job for three years.

163
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,610
I did this job for three years. This one, I actually did it for four years.

164
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:22,570
I made four years. And so I was overseeing the United States Renal Data System Coordinating Center.

165
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:29,090
So this is a national registry of all of the kidney data in the country.

166
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:40,940
And it is used to create and report data requests, provide data to researchers, and then to answer data queries and questions.

167
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:46,850
And so that was my main piece. I was kind of 80% of my effort was called the ambulatory.

168
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,320
Oh, so what you will find, you know, a lot of the time working in health systems,

169
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:56,149
you're not going to be on one project, you're going to be on multiple projects.

170
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:00,650
And these projects could be related or they could not be related.

171
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:04,940
So I think that's where my science background helps quite a bit because I was

172
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:11,210
able to understand enough of a subject area to be able to work in it well.

173
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,210
But at the end genealogy process, you're only doing kidneys.

174
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:25,820
So United States renal data system, every project has a cute little logo, it's CKD surveillance.

175
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:31,370
So if you go to the CDC website and you to talk CKD chronic kidney disease,

176
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:38,090
if there's a specific website at the U of M team that's doing that website and doing all of the data for that.

177
00:27:39,470 --> 00:27:44,090
And there were several V.A. projects that were focused on creating native registry,

178
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,070
kidney research and then doing geospatial analysis of CKD in the US.

179
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:54,650
That was okay. Um, I think my favorite project was the United States.

180
00:27:55,050 --> 00:28:05,060
It was getting all of that PMS data, industry data, and then other sources of data to combine and then create this full data registry.

181
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:11,090
So the logistics of that was fine, I suppose. And then I would say.

182
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:17,810
This project is a mess. We just heard it. I hope it is successful.

183
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:27,620
But this was a pragmatic clinical trial where they are looking at inter diabetics, hypertension, and we were the data side of that.

184
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:32,179
And because it didn't really take off very much, I didn't really work on this project very much.

185
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:41,959
But overall, when I was in this role, I worked on it for different areas and so I had a lot of great exposure to state funding with my CQ.

186
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:51,870
I work in Blue Cross funding and then here I started to get more into federal funding and doing grants.

187
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:57,170
I love proposal writing, proposal writing for me and I took a class.

188
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:05,660
I don't know if it's something offered. It was chronic disease and the whole class was focused on writing a proposal.

189
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:14,400
Like all the pieces of the proposal that are being offered, if you can get it around like, Oh,

190
00:29:14,570 --> 00:29:23,330
I'm not sure where to propose on writing, I can find out drafting or understanding what goes into proposal.

191
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:30,170
That would be really, really great for you because if you don't have money, you can't do any research.

192
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:37,820
And so in every single job that I've had, I had to do proposal writing, I had to do budgeting,

193
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:44,300
I've had to figure out how am I going to get the resources in order to do the work that I want to be doing.

194
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:49,280
That's what I wanted to do. So.

195
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,720
This one for years. There were some contract changes.

196
00:29:56,110 --> 00:30:05,259
And then instead of doing adult medicine like adult nephrology as an adult, I went over to pediatrics nephrology.

197
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:17,620
And so I continued working in kidneys where I was a lead practice manager for several and I had FDA funded observational studies.

198
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:24,970
You're getting that to Mary now. And then there were a couple of like smaller clinical trials, like overseeing too.

199
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:33,670
My biggest one last year, and that is a project that has 66 sites in four countries.

200
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:40,330
And so I was the lead project manager at the coordinating center overseeing regulatory bodies,

201
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:49,150
how you like data issues, databases and staffing along with different hospital sites.

202
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,870
But this is a lot of organization and understanding.

203
00:30:54,820 --> 00:31:02,680
This is more human subject research, whereas in internal medicine it was health services research.

204
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,620
Human subjects research is a little.

205
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:19,780
Slower and there are a lot more things that have to be considered by severe adverse events or how are you going to talk to parties directly?

206
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:27,490
How can you do blood draws? How are you going to implement this in 66 different clinics and 66 different institutions?

207
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:35,920
What kind of training is needed? How to collect the data consistently and accurately across all of these sites?

208
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:39,579
And then what does that data need to look like in a database?

209
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:45,970
How women need to be given to people in order to do research, question or answering questions.

210
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:53,740
And so in this role I did, it was mostly again today looking at timelines,

211
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:00,399
statements of were what proposals we want to prepare in a proposal here in this job.

212
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:07,300
And that was so much fun. That was a 6.5 million proposal for five years.

213
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:10,750
Duration is almost $10 million.

214
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:17,020
Next, humans are outside of million and then are smaller clinical trials.

215
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:23,680
They don't get into anything like this about 200 to 300000 or so.

216
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:27,760
The body is overseeing a lot of money.

217
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:35,750
If you're not going to do the project management side of things, you don't really need to worry about this as much.

218
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:41,350
You just want to make sure that your role is on. All right.

219
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:55,059
So in this town for two and a half years now, I didn't do it because, you know, I didn't really get place for almost seven years.

220
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:59,290
And I had a lot of great experience that a lot of wonderful people.

221
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:05,319
I was able to work with the CDC, FDA and I h I still have an industry.

222
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:08,590
So having all of that background, I'm really excited.

223
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:12,880
You started med during the chronic pain and the research center.

224
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:20,800
I'll be looking at the actually the effects of medical marijuana on management and I'll be in the Department of Anesthesiology.

225
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:25,240
This is another pragmatic trial that will have two arms to it.

226
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:31,000
And clinical trials are not my strong point, but it's a new adventure.

227
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:41,709
So I know and all of the skills and the background of the classes, background with the work that I've done should be fine for this role.

228
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:48,130
So that's why I make sure I can think what we. That's one of the key takeaways.

229
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,280
It's a page that I get. Really?

230
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:56,950
Okay. I do it every year. You have it down right on time.

231
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:01,030
It's never mind. It might be that you really, really to.

232
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:13,450
Our skills are transferable. We learn a lot of great things in this program and you can do a lot of different things with those skills.

233
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:21,730
And then understanding many aspects of research and the research process has taken me very far.

234
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:32,350
So not focused on one part of research, but the whole like big view of what our research project is and the different pieces of research has been.

235
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:40,110
So that's and then any kind of research quality or jobs, it's all going to be dependent on money.

236
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:43,200
I cannot stress this enough. It's really kind of sad.

237
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:49,110
But this will affect everybody is fine, but it will affect you.

238
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:57,030
The more you know about proposals, the more you're going to try to go get the money, all of that, the better it's going to be that.

239
00:34:58,010 --> 00:35:06,010
That's awesome. Thank you so much. Plenty of time for questions and further questions around.

240
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,260
I was going to ask just a follow up on that last point.

241
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,170
In the different job you've had, just thinking about funding and making sure your own funding is stable.

242
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:20,770
Like, how do you manage that? Or under or come to understand that over time in your different channel?

243
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:29,410
I. Well, so my job from adult to pediatric nephrology, I was part of my transition.

244
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:36,190
I did not feel like my functional stable and your all and people had been right.

245
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:40,540
So a risk is a reduction in force and it happens.

246
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:45,790
I have ripped several people and it's just unfortunate.

247
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,830
But when you get a reduction in funding, people start to go if there is a backup funding.

248
00:35:51,100 --> 00:36:02,709
And so after seeing what was happening with things or near stable and so you have to think about how are you going to get more money somehow?

249
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:14,180
And you have a guy that's really into it and does great proposals and can get that money easily or you know, I have always worked for a position,

250
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:28,479
believe all of my roles except for this next role I have rewarded up to a position and it's been an MP and they just have a little bit okay,

251
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:36,280
I'm going to be one of my questions. What's it like working with doctors and get a different view of where this is?

252
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:48,460
My opinion and we're still friends of mine and yet but they're having to lose their job like those physicians are.

253
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:56,710
They're set and they don't have as much in it to like, worry about what their livelihood is for me.

254
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:01,330
And so you like I have had to think about that for myself and.

255
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,360
And I think you would be silly if you didn't think about that for yourself.

256
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:14,220
You have to be aware of where your funding is coming from, how long that funding is going to be, and is it sustainable for a while?

257
00:37:14,790 --> 00:37:21,270
So I've always been aware of where my effort has been allocated.

258
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,010
Is it 10% of this project? How long is this project?

259
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:30,960
Should I be picking up another one? And you'll have people that you're working with that are also looking at that for you.

260
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:35,760
But that's what I do with all of my staff and I'm very real with people on.

261
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:44,590
If you're not interested in doing something else, this is how long it's going to be there.

262
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,200
And my role and I'm just leaving now.

263
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:58,170
She had a surplus of farm. There are some people that just I mean, millions that just have gone.

264
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:02,980
And that's because she is so brilliant. People are coming to her with money.

265
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:09,980
She has private donors. And so getting with somebody like that, you're guaranteed job security.

266
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:16,930
If I had wanted to stay in my job with PDX Nephrology, I probably had a job there guaranteed for ten years.

267
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:22,390
Like that. You'll understand when you're in a role what the potential longevity is.

268
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:27,639
Yeah. I think that's a fair thing to say to just even in academia too.

269
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,840
There's a lot of people that we hire that are grant, you know, it's grant dependent.

270
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,760
So I think it's really fair to just understand,

271
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:43,659
like what the long term plan is and look out for yourself because they're not going to care about, you know, what's true, irreplaceable.

272
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,350
And you really need to look out for yourself around you a little bit.

273
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,250
But like, yeah, well, the questions are out there.

274
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:55,419
Yeah, well, we have all a lot of people. All right, now.

275
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,130
How are you guys? Yeah, I'm right here, but, um.

276
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,670
Oh, sorry. When you first started and even now, did you ever have, like, imposter syndrome?

277
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:11,010
Like, and how did you handle that? And so we started.

278
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:15,870
We started. Oh, yeah.

279
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:22,380
All that money was, like, feeling like, okay, I need.

280
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:30,120
You learn that if you have those skills, you have them.

281
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:36,089
There's also an idea of people getting nervous about looking at Michael or nervous

282
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:41,579
about looking at a contract or trying to develop a whole statement of work and stuff.

283
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:47,960
And so I think I just I was like, well, nobody else is doing this like this.

284
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,730
And it seems to be like testing all of them.

285
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:01,240
So I think it was just like after doing it over and over and over again and seeing that working like I have a masters in common anymore.

286
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:06,500
Okay. Thank you. Okay.

287
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:10,200
So this is so weird. I actually had two questions.

288
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:19,320
So my first question is, when you're managing, like, a lot of money, like how much room is there for you to make a mistake?

289
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:24,360
You know? Yeah. So, I mean, it depends on what kind of money.

290
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,680
I think it depends on.

291
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:35,250
So, for example, a lot of that money was like bonus dollars.

292
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:42,900
So there was, I think, a little bit more wiggle room because it was huge, like a surplus.

293
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:49,320
And it was just and even estimating how much those bonus dollars that were coming into was an estimate.

294
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:57,300
I mean, you do like I work with our CFO at the hospital to understand, oh, so that's what I'm doing.

295
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:08,620
You cannot be hesitant to talk. I mean, here I was like this little epidemiologist e-mailing a CFO at one of the hospitals, like, hi,

296
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:16,149
can you tell me who I can reach out to to understand your finance systems and how this money comes in from Blue Cross,

297
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,330
who is managing it, and then how you guys are using it.

298
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:24,190
And then show me the reports that you have. And people could have said no to me.

299
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:32,530
But I also had really great people that I was working with that was just kind of like included this discussion or whatever.

300
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,850
So about being able to just go out there with people out there, that helped quite a bit.

301
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,209
So there was a little bit more wiggle room there,

302
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:49,540
but it has to be a research grant and I think an FDA are very well aware of where the money is like to expect.

303
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,550
So you have to track everything.

304
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,880
You have to know how much you're spending on everything.

305
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:05,590
For finance, we have monthly meetings where our people in the finance department this has been in most of my day,

306
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:11,940
but there is usually a finance person that I sit with that I'm like, okay, this is what I have in my appointment.

307
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:17,079
You tell me in the official systems what you're seeing, where are the discrepancies?

308
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:21,100
Where are we over money on your money and then just work on it that way.

309
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:26,410
And so you do have to be with the federal agency is a little bit more exact.

310
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:32,979
Okay. And clinical trials, you have to be very next to a sorry trial.

311
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,230
Sometimes it's a fixed fee rate, so you have to invoice what you got.

312
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,800
And so they'll say, you know, you've got a meeting of this day.

313
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:45,250
This was this many hours in many dollars.

314
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,860
And so, like, you end up knowing a lot about budgets and invoicing and direct dollars.

315
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,110
And then my second question, you kind of already answered it,

316
00:42:55,110 --> 00:43:01,650
but do you have any advice for someone who's just starting out and like managing money or working out of a grant?

317
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:14,560
I would say. Reviewing example market if you can understand how some other budgets have been set up.

318
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,110
Reading a budget justification,

319
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:26,690
knowing where the money is coming from and the flow of those funds and then how the money gets dispersed, I think is very helpful.

320
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:33,580
So, I mean, I certainly did. And if you guys want, I'm happy to provide my email address and phone number.

321
00:43:33,910 --> 00:43:37,930
So if you want to connect with me afterwards, I'll give you an example.

322
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:43,790
I'll let you know what resources they have. I think everybody.

323
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,050
Like their father or. Oh, yeah, we have that for you about that.

324
00:43:51,050 --> 00:44:00,760
And the you know so many helpful online friends say that there are but any ones for price management like specifically budgeting,

325
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:08,980
credit management, budgeting for research and just like taking courses like that and having examples and templates.

326
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:14,630
Thank you. Right.

327
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:23,180
Okay. So my main question is just sort of like looking back on your career and on the way that you your job search,

328
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:27,319
how much would you attribute to chance like you were just at the right place at the right time.

329
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:36,010
You just need the right person versus like your personal hard work, like you went out there and you got what you needed to get it.

330
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:50,659
Because I think happy so especially that role from where I was an epidemiologist working with like right and then all of a sudden the

331
00:44:50,660 --> 00:45:01,520
system created that position by balance is very scary to be able to have that background and then go to that manager system role.

332
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:07,160
And I would say in my career that's probably been my biggest lead because it was just.

333
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:13,050
It worked out very nicely for me. I think the rest of my work has been me.

334
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:18,809
Seeking something one me to be interested in taking care of myself,

335
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:24,900
knowing what I can do, what my background is, and then where I keep on going forward.

336
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:38,590
Um. Yeah, I wanted to ask, like, I feel like, you know, the first step that we're about to take is to, like, go into interviews.

337
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:47,360
And I feel like that's also a place where a lot of people kind of get messed with, like, in terms of, like, what people are asking of us.

338
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:52,630
And so, like, you know, I've heard that sometimes people ask us to like code things and things like that.

339
00:45:52,630 --> 00:46:01,840
So like, where are boundaries? Like sometimes I've heard people being given entire datasets and running in, like asking to be running a full analysis.

340
00:46:01,840 --> 00:46:05,790
And I know a lot of people said like, that's not appropriate, but like what,

341
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,340
what are some of the things that you've run into and what are like reasonable boundaries

342
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:16,550
for us to set as we go on this journey that I would never code an entire dataset.

343
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:27,240
Yeah. And I would never ask somebody to be any kind of higher and higher than an analyst if that or a programmer that wasn't interested in it more.

344
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:34,400
So I'll give somebody a written staff code and ask them, What did you do with code?

345
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:43,170
What is this? Actually, tell me, what would be the next step if you were writing code to in order to do some kind of regression?

346
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:47,040
But other times I'd ask it more.

347
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:51,490
I have to ask like there's this problem or this research question.

348
00:46:51,950 --> 00:47:03,120
Do a ten slide, 15 minute presentation of what you would do to try to get you a project to answer this recent question.

349
00:47:03,570 --> 00:47:09,520
So those kinds of things are pretty typical, but I want to do much more than that.

350
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:16,860
No. Yeah, absolutely. And then additionally, this is an open ended question, so I apologize.

351
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,790
But like, what would be the best advice you would give to, I guess,

352
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:29,000
people in our situation as like where we are applying for jobs, we're talking to people who will be our bosses.

353
00:47:29,010 --> 00:47:34,170
Like what would you say are like the biggest red flags and the biggest green flags to be looking for?

354
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:43,250
If so, if they don't have a well defined role for you right away,

355
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:49,940
because then that will mean they're going to give you anything and everything and you will change your life.

356
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:58,700
So you should make sure that what you're going in and how a lot of people know know you're getting that we're getting there.

357
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:02,150
You to have 3 minutes. We're still good.

358
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:10,040
Well, if I'm job if people don't see it and you can usually read the room,

359
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:17,780
but if there is like awkward body language and if people aren't like excited about the work that is being done.

360
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:28,780
Red flags do not go to that job. I mean, if even if during the interview process, things are a little light scattered,

361
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:32,770
it usually means that the research group is not well put together.

362
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:42,879
And so you want like a kind of you'll notice they got very polish sort of group that you'll be a little bit typically you'll be a

363
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:51,070
little bit more taken care of and have more resources and be set up better for success versus people that are just like scrambling,

364
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:55,370
trying to get stuff done. Communication. That's your the question where we are.

365
00:48:56,950 --> 00:49:00,580
There isn't a good night's approach to the end.

366
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,090
It's awesome. Follow ups. It's always good to follow up with interviews if somebody doesn't follow up with you.

367
00:49:10,550 --> 00:49:14,990
You probably getting at the job and it's not what you plan to do.

368
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:18,380
I always. And hopefully you write that too.

369
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,150
I always let people know in that first interview if they're going to make it in the next hour.

370
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:28,600
And I hate meeting people and like leaving them to, hey, I was like, you were great.

371
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,410
We're going to having a reviewer. Thanks for talking to me.

372
00:49:32,470 --> 00:49:39,520
We're going to end it right here. I, I just found to be very direct, but tactful is usually pretty good.

373
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:45,420
So I'm hoping that you take it editor in chief and you'll most likely be going to write.

374
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,740
Entry level roles, and that's okay.

375
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:55,620
And even if you do that for a year or two years, chances are you'll keep on going.

376
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,870
I mean, I was an epidemiologist for all of.
