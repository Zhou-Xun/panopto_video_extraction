1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,846
In this video, we will assess the
available evidence on the impact of health

2
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:16,040
insurance on clinical and
financial outcomes.

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:19,343
This will incorporate both the effects
of having insurance or not, and

4
00:00:19,343 --> 00:00:21,620
the extent of cost-sharing
within insurance.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,561
That is the generosity of coverage.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,660
This video will help meet our
learning objectives of predicting how

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,857
economic actors are likely to respond to
incentives, and applying a typology of

8
00:00:32,857 --> 00:00:37,261
sources of market failure to healthcare
to analyze why suboptimal outcomes occur.

9
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,740
What are the potential benefits
from having health insurance?

10
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,025
The most obvious, at least to economists,

11
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:49,240
is protection from financial risk
caused by random health events.

12
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,240
That sort of protection is fundamental to
the demand for all sorts of insurance.

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,354
Everyone who isn't an economist, the most
obvious answer is likely to be better

14
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:00,661
access to medical care and
improved health.

15
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,496
The causal pathway that could
underlie such a relationship is that

16
00:01:05,496 --> 00:01:10,195
having health insurance reduces the price
of care, which increases the use of care,

17
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,761
which we then hope will
lead to better health.

18
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:18,718
It may seem obvious that having health
insurance will improve health, but

19
00:01:18,718 --> 00:01:21,240
studies offer conflicting results.

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,240
Many studies are confounded by
adverse selection into insurance.

21
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,117
If individuals at greater risk of bad
health are more likely to get insurance,

22
00:01:29,117 --> 00:01:32,643
or get more generous coverage,
it shouldn't be surprising when those

23
00:01:32,643 --> 00:01:37,240
studies find that health insurance
is associated with worse outcomes.

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,389
Therefore, we will focus on studies with
strong methodologies to protect against

25
00:01:41,389 --> 00:01:44,040
finding such spurious results.

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,908
Those are studies using experimental or
quasi-experimental designs,

27
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:51,661
whose validity is least threatened
by unobserved selection factors.

28
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,392
The most famous of these is the RAND
Health Insurance experiment of the 1970s,

29
00:01:58,392 --> 00:02:02,540
one of the first large scale
experiments in the social sciences.

30
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,475
In that experiment, people were
randomized into plans with coverage

31
00:02:06,475 --> 00:02:11,840
ranging from free care, to 95% coinsurance
up to an out-of-pocket maximum.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,072
So the experiment created random variation
in the first step of the causal pathway we

33
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:17,940
described earlier.

34
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,918
It then clearly established the second
step as those with free care use 35%

35
00:02:22,918 --> 00:02:26,640
more than those of the 95% coinsurance.

36
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,455
However, it largely failed to establish
the final step on the pathway for

37
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:33,120
most participants.

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,298
The extra use stimulated by more generous
coverage didn't affect health in either

39
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:38,840
direction.

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,662
There were improvements for the 6% of
participants who were the poorest or

41
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:44,403
sickest at the start of the study.

42
00:02:44,403 --> 00:02:47,585
But those improvements were only
statistically significant for

43
00:02:47,585 --> 00:02:51,651
4 out of 30 measures, including blood
pressure control and corrected vision.

44
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,914
Sample sizes and follow-up were
not sufficient to make definitive

45
00:02:55,914 --> 00:02:58,761
statements about some important
outcomes like mortality.

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,792
The Oregon Health Insurance experiment,
which started in 2008, included

47
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:10,019
lower income adults who applied to be
part of a Medicaid expansion available.

48
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,749
State funds were insufficient
to cover everyone, so

49
00:03:12,749 --> 00:03:17,340
randomly selected applicants were
offered the opportunity to enroll.

50
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:21,263
Like the RAND study, this experiment
showed that care use increased.

51
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:24,963
Both inpatient admissions and
outpatient visits went up, and

52
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:26,861
total spending rose by 25%.

53
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,308
Those gaining coverage received
substantial protection from

54
00:03:31,308 --> 00:03:32,840
financial risk.

55
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,142
Despite the increase in care use,
they had lower out-of-pocket spending, and

56
00:03:37,142 --> 00:03:39,821
were much less likely to
face catastrophic costs,

57
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:41,961
incur medical debt, or skip payments.

58
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,414
Evidence on the health effects of
Medicaid coverage was more mixed, but

59
00:03:48,414 --> 00:03:50,440
still generally positive.

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:54,484
Those gaining coverage had better
self-reported physical and mental health,

61
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:59,140
with an average improvement of 0.2
standard deviations of the measures.

62
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:02,951
They also had higher rates of diagnosis
of, and treatment for depression.

63
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:07,902
They did not experience improvements
in the control of diabetes, lipids, or

64
00:04:07,902 --> 00:04:09,340
blood pressure.

65
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,810
Most of those effects were
in the expected direction.

66
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,986
But the study sample may have been
too small to detect those effects at

67
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:16,751
a statistically significant level.

68
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,321
The Oregon experiment set the stage for

69
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:25,471
the evaluation of Medicaid expansions
under the Affordable Care Act,

70
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:30,240
which affected a similar population,
because some states chose not to expand.

71
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,351
This facilitated a large number
of studies comparing pre and

72
00:04:34,351 --> 00:04:38,714
post ACA outcomes in states that
expanded to those that did not.

73
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:42,260
Because states chose whether to
participate, rather than being randomized

74
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,161
into participation,
these studies aren't quite as strong.

75
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,904
A review of this literature showed that a
large majority of studies found increases

76
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:53,940
in access to care and financial security.

77
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,650
Fewer studies examine self-reported
health, or other health outcomes.

78
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,661
But again, the large majority
showed favorable outcomes.

79
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,531
While the ACA insurance mandate was
enforced, the IRS actually helped generate

80
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:10,240
some experimental evidence on
the health effects of insurance.

81
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,840
Some taxpayers were subject to the penalty
for not getting qualified coverage.

82
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:19,148
The IRS sent a letter to 3.9 million
randomly selected taxpayers who paid

83
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:20,540
the penalty.

84
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,172
That letter described how getting
insurance would avoid that penalty in

85
00:05:24,172 --> 00:05:25,940
future years.

86
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,339
Those receiving the letter
were 1.3 percentage points,

87
00:05:29,339 --> 00:05:33,601
about 2.8% in relative terms more
likely to get coverage in the next year

88
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,751
than those not receiving the letter.

89
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,940
45 to 64 year olds who
received the letter were 0.06

90
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,370
percentage points less likely to
die in a subsequent two years.

91
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,340
That amounted to 1 avoided
death per 1648 letters sent.

92
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,379
That may seem like a small effect, but

93
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:55,840
it generates a scary good
cost effectiveness ratio.

94
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,861
Even if it costs $10 per letter,
it would only be $16,480 per life saved.

95
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:07,634
Now let's shift gears a bit to focus on
the quality of decision making when facing

96
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:09,340
cost-sharing.

97
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,634
We expect a rational consumer facing
an out-of-pocket price of P star on this

98
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:16,240
graph to choose the quantity Q star.

99
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,139
That would result in them consuming
the most valuable care, while avoiding low

100
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:23,761
value care, all those units worth
less than the out-of-pocket price.

101
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,843
If the plans cost-sharing increases,
raising the out-of-pocket price,

102
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:32,461
we expect the consumer to respond by
eliminating the lowest value care.

103
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,330
People clearly cut back when faced
with higher out-of-pocket prices.

104
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:41,840
But a number of studies found they do so
indiscriminately.

105
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,239
That is, they cut back on both high and
low value care.

106
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:49,783
RAND health insurance experiment
participants with higher cost-sharing

107
00:06:49,783 --> 00:06:54,940
cutback equally on care that clinical
experts seem to be high or low value.

108
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,738
Similarly, a study of higher out-of-pocket
costs in Medicare part D prescription drug

109
00:06:59,738 --> 00:07:03,653
plans showed that beneficiaries
reduced their prescription fills, and

110
00:07:03,653 --> 00:07:06,240
suffered higher mortality rates.

111
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,272
Some of the reduced fills were clearly
of high value, including statin and

112
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:14,251
antihypertensive fills by those at
risk for a heart attack, or a stroke.

113
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,283
Another study looked at what happened
when a large employer switched all of its

114
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:23,840
workers to a high deductible plan.

115
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,932
The expected reduction of care use
occurred was spending falling by about

116
00:07:27,932 --> 00:07:29,240
13%.

117
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,140
However, the other results
were disappointing.

118
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,929
The deductible should have given
an incentive to shop for lower cost

119
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:40,595
providers, or substitute to less expensive
procedures, but neither happened.

120
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:44,387
Again, care reductions occurred
indiscriminately between high and

121
00:07:44,387 --> 00:07:45,551
low value services.

122
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,742
One recent study does give us some hope.

123
00:07:49,742 --> 00:07:53,758
In a different large firm switching
to a high deductible plan,

124
00:07:53,758 --> 00:07:57,640
the use of low value
services declined by 13.7%.

125
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,846
That decrease was significantly larger
than the overall decline in services,

126
00:08:01,846 --> 00:08:04,858
suggesting that enrollees had
some ability to laser in on

127
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:07,951
low value care when responding
to the higher deductible.

128
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,391
Although the savings were driven
mainly by lower quantities of care,

129
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:15,251
there was also some evidence
of increased price shopping.

130
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,340
Standard cost-sharing
is a blunt instrument.

131
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,225
An unneeded drug costs $25 out-of-pocket.

132
00:08:23,225 --> 00:08:26,940
A life saving drug costs
$25 out-of-pocket.

133
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,485
That wouldn't matter if people lasered in
a low value care when facing cost-sharing

134
00:08:31,485 --> 00:08:35,855
by throwing the first prescription in
the garbage, and only filling the second.

135
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:39,240
Cost-sharing would work
exactly as intended.

136
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,081
However, the evidence that people don't
actually make decisions like that

137
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:46,440
motivated the idea of value
based insurance design.

138
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:49,884
This concept was developed at
the University of Michigan.

139
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:54,440
V-BID sets the out-of-pocket price
to reflect the value of care.

140
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:58,782
For example, antihypertensives could be
made free to those at risk of heart attack

141
00:08:58,782 --> 00:09:03,311
or stroke, while high cost-sharing could
be implemented for non-emergent use, or

142
00:09:03,311 --> 00:09:07,361
imaging studies for low back pain that
has not been conservatively treated.

143
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,736
In summary,

144
00:09:09,736 --> 00:09:13,740
we can draw a number of conclusions
about the impacts of health insurance.

145
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,490
Insurance clearly improves
financial outcomes.

146
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,911
It increases access to and use of care.

147
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:23,340
Insurance also seems to improve
at least some health outcomes.

148
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:28,520
The impacts are often modest, but
they are larger in low income populations.

149
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,670
Few studies have
sufficient sample size and

150
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,640
length of follow up to make definitive
statements about outcomes like mortality.

151
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,025
Finally, although consumers
definitely respond to price,

152
00:09:39,025 --> 00:09:42,147
most evidence indicates they
cut back across the board,
