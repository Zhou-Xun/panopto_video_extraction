00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,240
Welcome to today's session, you may ask yourself where did am I come from?

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,276
Well, today we're going to answer that question,

3
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:22,486
we're also going to address the evidence base for MIs effectiveness and

4
00:00:22,486 --> 00:00:27,940
then discuss a few places where it's the standard of care.

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,707
So what is MI's birth story, well,

6
00:00:30,707 --> 00:00:36,740
it's generally linked to a 1983 article by Bill Miller.

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,540
Originally, I was primarily used to treat heavy drinkers.

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,517
It then migrated into other substance use and it crossed over into public health and

9
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:50,670
primary care medicine through smoking cessation.

10
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,330
Of course it's an addiction, but

11
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,740
it's also generally treated in other areas besides addiction counseling.

12
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,055
Since crossing over,

13
00:00:58,055 --> 00:01:03,040
it has now been applied to almost every health condition you can think of.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:07,534
Primary and secondary prevention, heart disease, cancer, medical adherence,

15
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,840
even recruitment into clinical trials.

16
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,071
The evidence base is pretty thick, there's over 3500 published papers that

17
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:22,226
address motivational interviewing of those between 300 and 400 are randomized trials.

18
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:25,519
And there are now even multiple meta analyses or

19
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:30,208
reviews of intervention studies, here's just a couple of those,

20
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:36,440
including one rewrote around pediatric obesity a few years ago.

21
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:41,740
What does it all mean, what does the known efficacy of MI.

22
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,726
Well, to answer that question, we have to define an effect size, an effect size in

23
00:01:46,726 --> 00:01:51,091
public health is generally communicated by standard deviation units.

24
00:01:51,091 --> 00:01:55,383
That is comparing the change in the intervention group to the change in

25
00:01:55,383 --> 00:02:00,840
the comparison group using standard deviations as the common metric.

26
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,611
So, an intervention that shows a change at his 0.2 to 0.5.

27
00:02:05,611 --> 00:02:10,183
Standard deviation units greater than the control group is considered having

28
00:02:10,183 --> 00:02:15,100
a small but yet significant intervention effect, if it is 0.5 to 0.8 standard

29
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,640
deviation units, that's a medium intervention effect.

30
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,076
And finally anything exceeding 0.8 standard deviation units is

31
00:02:22,076 --> 00:02:25,640
considered a large intervention effect.

32
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,547
In general motivational interviewing has achieved effect

33
00:02:30,547 --> 00:02:36,940
sizes around 0.2 to 0.3 that is in the small range.

34
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,801
Now you may ask, well, isn't that a tiny effect?

35
00:02:39,801 --> 00:02:42,812
Is that worth it, to help answer that question

36
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:47,240
we have to understand that MI is generally considered safe.

37
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,274
There are very few side effects and very few studies where it's ever caused harm.

38
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:55,961
That helps us understand that even a small or

39
00:02:55,961 --> 00:03:00,944
modest effect can still a great public health significance

40
00:03:00,944 --> 00:03:06,041
given in fact it's relatively safe and of only modest cost.

41
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:13,659
So where in public health and in medicine is MI the standard of care.

42
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,338
It's a complicated answer, so for example,

43
00:03:17,338 --> 00:03:21,491
the American Heart Association recommends that for

44
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:25,374
risk factor counseling MI is the gold standard.

45
00:03:25,374 --> 00:03:29,005
Particularly as we see in the bottom bullet for

46
00:03:29,005 --> 00:03:33,761
low motivated or resistant clients for pediatric obesity.

47
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:36,708
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends MI and

48
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:39,850
you can see here it says use client centered counselor and

49
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:45,140
it referenced MI and even recommends using our importance and confidence rulers.

50
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,152
However, the general national guidelines for

51
00:03:48,152 --> 00:03:53,040
adult obesity don't reference motivational interviewing.

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,570
Now I think over time you'll see more and more recommendations to include MI.

53
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,829
At least to help build motivation or,

54
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:05,540
as we said earlier in the y phase of behavior change counseling.

55
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,350
So today we've talked a little bit about the origins of MI and how it started in

56
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:16,540
addiction and gradually spread across public health and primary care medicine.

57
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:20,440
We talked a little bit about the meta analyses that have shown generally

58
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,079
positive effects for MI.

59
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,491
In the small range 0.2 to 0.3, standard deviation units and

60
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:29,248
finally, we showed you some examples for

61
00:04:29,248 --> 00:04:35,175
when MI is considered the gold standard or the treatment of choice.
