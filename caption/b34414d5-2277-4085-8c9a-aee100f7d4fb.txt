1
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,514
The Food and Drug Administration or
the FDA is charged with

2
00:00:12,514 --> 00:00:16,434
ensuring the safety and
efficacy of drugs brought to market.

3
00:00:16,434 --> 00:00:21,321
The agency faces a difficult balancing act
in determining how much evidence should

4
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,850
be required before an approval decision.

5
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:28,668
Acting with less data increases the risk
of making a Type I error by approving

6
00:00:28,668 --> 00:00:32,599
a drug that was ultimately shown
to be unsafe or ineffective.

7
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:35,684
This creates harm while
the drug is on the market but

8
00:00:35,684 --> 00:00:40,083
could ultimately be remedied by
withdrawing it or restricting its use.

9
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,751
On the flip side, Waiting for

10
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:46,740
a lot of evidence can lead to type two
error not approving an effective drug.

11
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:51,857
If the approval eventually occurs, we lose
the benefits of the drug during the delay.

12
00:00:51,857 --> 00:00:56,785
More pernicious problem occurs if
the effective drug is denied or abandoned

13
00:00:56,785 --> 00:01:01,566
by its manufacturer, in which case we
never get the benefits of the drug.

14
00:01:01,566 --> 00:01:03,744
The FDA is more likely to be blamed for

15
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,440
Type I errors of letting it
unsafe drug onto the market.

16
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:11,440
While many Type II errors may never
even become known to the public.

17
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,040
This may lead to excessive
regulatory caution.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,640
Several legislative changes have been
implemented to speed the approval process.

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:25,551
One study of these changes concluded that
more rapid access to effective drugs Save

20
00:01:25,551 --> 00:01:33,440
140k-310k life-years while the approval of
unsafe drugs cost at Most 56k life-years.

21
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,230
However, another study found that serious
adverse reactions, hospitalizations and

22
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:42,373
deaths each increased about 20% per
one standard deviation reduction in

23
00:01:42,373 --> 00:01:43,161
review time.

24
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:46,940
Let's shift to another
controversial issue.

25
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,229
Pharmaceutical marketing and promotion,
is often noted that relative to other

26
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:56,040
industries, pharmaceutical companies
have high marketing and sales expenses.

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,161
So there is debate about how
this should be measured.

28
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,198
This includes promotion to patients and
providers,

29
00:02:02,198 --> 00:02:06,074
direct to consumer advertising is
prohibited in many countries, but

30
00:02:06,074 --> 00:02:11,039
is allowed subject to regulatory
requirements in the US and New Zealand.

31
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,312
The primary objective of DTCA is
increasing demand by influencing patients

32
00:02:15,312 --> 00:02:17,430
to seek advice from a physician.

33
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:21,974
The gatekeeper of the prescription,
promotion to physicians through methods

34
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:26,514
such as journal ads, drug rep visits,
dinner talks, and conference booths is

35
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:31,351
intended to influence prescribing patterns
conditional on the patient visiting.

36
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,650
Promotional expenses are often
discussed as if marketing and

37
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,740
innovation are substitutes.

38
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,864
That is, if the drug company
spends more on marketing,

39
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:48,440
that inherently means it has less
money left over to spend on R and D.

40
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,733
That assertion relies on
the assumption that executives

41
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:56,615
have a fixed budget to allocate across
inputs, creating an unavoidable trade off.

42
00:02:56,615 --> 00:03:01,212
However, it may be more plausible to view
promotion innovation as compliments.

43
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:06,059
Both types of expenses will be set in
a manner that maximizes overall profits.

44
00:03:06,059 --> 00:03:10,503
Ads presumably increased sales and
profits, and the NPV formula

45
00:03:10,503 --> 00:03:15,123
showed us that higher profits
increase the incentive to innovate.

46
00:03:15,123 --> 00:03:18,577
Put another way,
suppose a firm decides not to promote any

47
00:03:18,577 --> 00:03:23,140
products that develops and
as a result, its sales languish.

48
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,474
Rather than freeing up extra
dollars to pour into the labs,

49
00:03:26,474 --> 00:03:29,875
it would reduce the profitability
of any drug they develop,

50
00:03:29,875 --> 00:03:33,961
and therefore create an incentive to
spend less, not more on research.

51
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,052
That leaves us with a big question of
whether drug advertising is good for

52
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:43,940
society, promotion as potential risks and
benefits.

53
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,039
The primary risks are that there is no
incentive to promote low cost therapies,

54
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:49,190
like generic drugs.

55
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,816
So successful promotion by brand
name drugs could lead doctors and

56
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,053
patients to use expensive drugs
when less expensive drug or

57
00:03:56,053 --> 00:03:59,340
non-drug therapies could be just as good.

58
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,848
Promotion may also create
inappropriate demand for drugs,

59
00:04:02,848 --> 00:04:04,574
even when they're harmful.

60
00:04:04,574 --> 00:04:09,361
The primary benefits are that by enhancing
profits, promotion increases the incentive

61
00:04:09,361 --> 00:04:13,317
to innovate, and that if promotion
is informative can improve decisions

62
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:16,860
by causing appropriate patients
to seek and receive treatment.

63
00:04:19,323 --> 00:04:24,226
Conceptually, what criteria should be
used to answer the question of whether

64
00:04:24,226 --> 00:04:25,943
drug advertising is good?

65
00:04:25,943 --> 00:04:29,396
Economists would suggest
that the right question is,

66
00:04:29,396 --> 00:04:33,085
does advertising mitigate under use or
promote overuse.

67
00:04:33,085 --> 00:04:36,661
This inherently needs to
be assessed drug by drug.

68
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:40,221
There is evidence that marketing for
drugs like antidepressants or

69
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:42,740
statins mitigated under use.

70
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,940
The case of antidepressants
is particularly interesting.

71
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,668
Shapiro found the 10% increase in
antidepressant advertising led to

72
00:04:50,668 --> 00:04:56,040
a 0.3% increase in new prescriptions,
costing $32 million.

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,637
That was followed by reductions in
workplace absenteeism worth about $770

74
00:05:00,637 --> 00:05:01,261
million.

75
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,668
He found no evidence that advertising
affected prices, generic penetration,

76
00:05:07,668 --> 00:05:12,855
drug switches, adverse effects,
not adherence rates or therapist visits.

77
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:16,378
Conversely, OxyContin
marketing promoted overuse.

78
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:20,269
Interestingly, OxyContin promotion
was more targeted to physicians

79
00:05:20,269 --> 00:05:21,251
than consumers.

80
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,540
More generally, many drugs have
low marginal cost of production.

81
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:30,935
So unless the drug is actually harmful
to the extra patients who take a due

82
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:31,872
to promotion,

83
00:05:31,872 --> 00:05:36,571
it might be reasonable to presume that
under use is more common than overuse.

84
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:39,749
This may not be true for
expensive biologics,

85
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:42,776
which are increasingly being advertised.

86
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:47,183
In summary, the drug research and approval
process is lengthy and costly, and

87
00:05:47,183 --> 00:05:51,610
incentives to innovate are threatened
by the public good nature of knowledge.

88
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,961
Therefore, adding a 2nd
source of market failure,

89
00:05:54,961 --> 00:06:00,253
patents creating monopoly power, may
mitigate harm from the 1st, public goods.

90
00:06:00,253 --> 00:06:04,754
And adding a 3rd source of market
failure insurance, distorting prices,

91
00:06:04,754 --> 00:06:06,809
they mitigate harm from the 2nd.

92
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:08,365
It's complicated.

93
00:06:08,365 --> 00:06:13,882
Regulators have to balance risks of
approving drugs too quickly or too slowly.

94
00:06:13,882 --> 00:06:18,215
Finally, advertising could be
socially valuable or harmful, and

95
00:06:18,215 --> 00:06:22,861
the key litmus test is whether it
induces overuse or prevents under use.
