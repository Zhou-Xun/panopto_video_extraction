00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,940
Hey, this is Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,370
In this lecture, we're
going to introduce

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,200
descriptive statistics
that we can

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,600
use to summarize
longitudinal data.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,870
To begin, let's take a moment
to remind ourselves what

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:25,860
the objectives are for
longitudinal data analysis.

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,170
Our goal is to understand within

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:30,260
subject change in our
outcome over time,

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:32,430
and to identify
factors that lead to

10
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:35,070
differences in the
outcome between subjects.

11
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,900
In the previous lectures,

12
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,610
we address these objectives using

13
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,040
graphical representation
of the data.

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,070
The graphical analysis is

15
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:46,535
a highly effective start at a
longitudinal data analysis.

16
00:00:46,535 --> 00:00:48,710
But we also need a
more succinct means

17
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,320
of summarizing the data.

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,190
In this lecture, we are going to

19
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,844
discuss how we can use
descriptive statistic,

20
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:57,170
many you are already
familiar with,

21
00:00:57,170 --> 00:01:00,560
to capture key properties
of longitudinal data.

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,050
We'll start with
a quick review of

23
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:06,175
univariate descriptive
statistics for numerical data.

24
00:01:06,175 --> 00:01:08,480
Numerical data has a distribution

25
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,985
which is the set of
all observed values.

26
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:14,120
We use descriptive
statistics to summarize

27
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,525
the shape and location of
the data distribution.

28
00:01:17,525 --> 00:01:19,745
To begin, we'll consider

29
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:21,875
univariate descriptive
statistics.

30
00:01:21,875 --> 00:01:23,570
Which considered the distribution

31
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:25,960
of only one variable at a time.

32
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,030
The first important property
we typically want to

33
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,680
capture is the location

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,735
or the center of
the distribution.

35
00:01:32,735 --> 00:01:34,850
The mean or average is

36
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,795
a good descriptive statistic
for accomplishing that.

37
00:01:37,795 --> 00:01:40,700
Intuitively, the mean
can be thought of as

38
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,330
the location at which the
distribution would balance.

39
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:47,150
The next property of the
distribution we want to

40
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:50,650
capture is the spread or
variability of the data.

41
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,490
Variance or standard
deviation are

42
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,930
descriptive statistics for
variation of a distribution.

43
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,510
Intuitively, the variance is

44
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,760
the average squared distance of

45
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,515
the set of measurements
from the mean value.

46
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:06,340
The standard deviation is

47
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,620
the square root of
variance and has

48
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,450
the nice property that it is on

49
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,080
the same scale as the
measurements themselves.

50
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,350
Making it a bit
more interpretable.

51
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,970
In either case, larger
values of variance or

52
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,910
standard deviation
indicate a wider spread

53
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,945
to the data and more
variable measurements.

54
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,130
Mean and variance are

55
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,710
univariate descriptive
statistics because they

56
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:32,725
summarize the distribution
of just one variable.

57
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:35,920
Bivariate descriptive
statistics summarize

58
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,670
the relationship
between two variables.

59
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:42,760
Two examples of bivariate
descriptive statistics

60
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,425
that you're already familiar with

61
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:47,200
are covariance and correlation.

62
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,560
Remember that when we view
a scatter plot showing

63
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,845
the bivariate distribution
of two numerical variables,

64
00:02:53,845 --> 00:02:57,115
we want to describe how the
variables change together.

65
00:02:57,115 --> 00:03:00,235
As the measurement for
one variable increases,

66
00:03:00,235 --> 00:03:02,380
do measurements for
the second variable

67
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,524
tend to increase or decrease?

68
00:03:04,524 --> 00:03:08,315
Covariance and correlation
capture that information.

69
00:03:08,315 --> 00:03:10,945
For both covariance
and correlation,

70
00:03:10,945 --> 00:03:13,030
a value of zero indicates that

71
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,050
the two variables have

72
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:16,505
no relationship or
are independent.

73
00:03:16,505 --> 00:03:19,180
Positive values of
both covariance and

74
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,710
correlation indicate

75
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,064
a positive relationship
between the variables,

76
00:03:23,064 --> 00:03:24,715
as shown in the figure here.

77
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:26,920
As one variable increases,

78
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,465
the other tends to
increase as well.

79
00:03:29,465 --> 00:03:32,925
A negative value indicates
a negative relationship.

80
00:03:32,925 --> 00:03:35,855
Meaning that as one
variable increases,

81
00:03:35,855 --> 00:03:38,260
the other tends to decrease.

82
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,370
The numerical magnitude of both

83
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:42,725
covariance and
correlation increases

84
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:44,210
with the strength
of the relationship

85
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:45,935
between the two variables.

86
00:03:45,935 --> 00:03:47,600
The major difference is that

87
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,060
covariance is a scale
of measurement.

88
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,250
Whereas correlation
is standardized

89
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,970
to be between
negative one and one.

90
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:59,075
Now that we've reviewed basic
descriptive statistics,

91
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:02,855
let's see how we can apply
them to longitudinal data.

92
00:04:02,855 --> 00:04:05,180
To do this, we'll first

93
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,870
define notation for
longitudinal data.

94
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,510
Let's assume there are capital
N samples in the dataset,

95
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:15,185
and n_is measurements are
collected on the i_th sample.

96
00:04:15,185 --> 00:04:17,840
We can denote the
j_th measurement in

97
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,020
the i_th subject as Y_ij.

98
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:23,840
For example, if the
first individual in

99
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,125
the dataset has measurements
at four time points,

100
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:30,835
we would indicate these as Y_11,

101
00:04:30,835 --> 00:04:36,160
Y_12, Y_13, and Y_14.

102
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,710
This Ys of ij notation
provides flexibility.

103
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,770
It can be applied
to a sample with

104
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,000
an arbitrary number of

105
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,975
measurements taken at
any points in time.

106
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,920
Making the notation valid for

107
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,240
both balanced and unbalanced
longitudinal designs.

108
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:56,690
A natural quantity that
we want to describe in

109
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,939
longitudinal data
is the distribution

110
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:02,020
of measurements at
fixed points in time.

111
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,090
Intuitively, this
is like isolating

112
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:08,090
all the measurements at a
specific time point or within

113
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,940
some time interval for
unbalanced studies and

114
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,680
computing descriptive statistics

115
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,080
on just these measurements.

116
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,620
Let's take time.3 as an example.

117
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,265
The measurements at t_3
have a distribution.

118
00:05:22,265 --> 00:05:23,870
We can use the mean and

119
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,005
standard deviation to
summarize that distribution.

120
00:05:27,005 --> 00:05:31,400
A concise method for summarizing
longitudinal data is to

121
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,320
create a table that
gives values of

122
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:36,235
the descriptive statistics
at each time point.

123
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,660
We can repeat the process by

124
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,525
computing descriptive
statistics for each time point

125
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:43,610
or time interval and adding

126
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,965
the resulting values
to the summary table.

127
00:05:46,965 --> 00:05:49,360
The table now summarizes

128
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,910
the pattern contained in the
original Spaghetti Plot,

129
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,175
sometimes in a clearer fashion.

130
00:05:54,175 --> 00:05:55,750
If the plot contained a lot of

131
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:58,360
samples or was
particularly noisy.

132
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,760
Given this table, you can address

133
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,670
questions about the change in
the mean outcome over time.

134
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,845
Is it increasing or decreasing?

135
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:07,210
Does it appear to level off

136
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,890
after a certain amount of time?

137
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,205
We can also inspect how
variants is affected over time.

138
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,959
Is the spread or variability

139
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,805
of measurements
fairly consistent,

140
00:06:15,805 --> 00:06:18,145
or does it change over time?

141
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,710
Longitudinal data often has

142
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,570
missing observations
or measurements,

143
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,510
usually unintentional
and the result of

144
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,035
an outcome not being recorded
at a plant time point.

145
00:06:29,035 --> 00:06:30,850
We've previously seen that

146
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:34,615
spaghetti plots can be useful
for spotting missing data.

147
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:36,310
Can you spot where a measurement

148
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,330
might be missing in this figure?

149
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:42,760
Assuming this was a
planned balanced study,

150
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,530
it appears the
outcome is missing at

151
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,410
the second time point for
the indicated sample.

152
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,120
Importantly, just

153
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,055
because this sample is
missing a measurement,

154
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:54,325
does not mean that it cannot
contribute to our analysis.

155
00:06:54,325 --> 00:06:56,080
The measurements at the first,

156
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,840
third, fourth time
points for this sample.

157
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,870
Indicated by the red dots
are still included in

158
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,580
the computation of the mean and

159
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,125
standard deviation of
those time points.

160
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,770
We can actually take note of

161
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,870
missing observations by reporting

162
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,520
the sample size or number of

163
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,740
measurements at
each time point and

164
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,030
reporting that in our table of

165
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:17,585
descriptive statistics as well.

166
00:07:17,585 --> 00:07:20,485
To this point, we've summarized

167
00:07:20,485 --> 00:07:24,115
outcome measurements for
individual points in time.

168
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:26,920
But remember, the
distinguishing feature of

169
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:29,110
longitudinal studies
is the collection

170
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,660
of repeated measurements
on the same sample,

171
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:34,450
resulting in within
sample dependency.

172
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,940
Our next task is to quantify

173
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,675
this dependency using
covariance and correlation.

174
00:07:40,675 --> 00:07:42,940
As a reminder, when we think

175
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,905
about covariance and correlation,

176
00:07:44,905 --> 00:07:46,660
we are considering
the distribution of

177
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:49,030
measurements across
two time points.

178
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,860
Here, for example, we are

179
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:53,020
considering measurements
taken at time points

180
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,540
3 and 4 in which
measurements correspond to

181
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,470
the same person indicated
by the connecting lines.

182
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:02,050
It is a little easier
to think about

183
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,485
the measurements from time
3 and 4 in a scatter plot.

184
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,830
Now, we can more directly
observe their relationship

185
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,510
and it is clearer to see how

186
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,330
covariance and correlation apply.

187
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:16,060
We can then consider
the dependency

188
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,980
of measurements over time by

189
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:20,140
computing covariance
and correlation

190
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,100
across all pairs of time points.

191
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,210
Depending on the number of

192
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,340
time points at which
measurements are taken,

193
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,980
that can be a lot of
covariance values.

194
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,920
The full set of covariance
measurements are typically

195
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,010
summarized in a variance
covariance matrix.

196
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,750
The diagonal elements of

197
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,495
the matrix contain variance
at each time point.

198
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:43,030
The off-diagonal elements contain

199
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,935
the covariance
between measurements

200
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:46,885
for the specific row and column.

201
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:49,855
For example, the quantity
in the first row,

202
00:08:49,855 --> 00:08:51,850
third column is the covariance

203
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:54,835
between measurements at
time points 1 and 3.

204
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:56,635
It is also important to note

205
00:08:56,635 --> 00:08:59,440
the variance covariance
matrix is symmetric,

206
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,795
meaning the lower
triangular portion

207
00:09:01,795 --> 00:09:05,170
is identical to the upper
triangular portion.

208
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,800
The form of the variance
covariance matrix

209
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,585
should look familiar.

210
00:09:10,585 --> 00:09:13,030
It is actually very
much related to

211
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:16,030
the scatter plot matrix that
we have previously seen.

212
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:20,124
Each off-diagonal element
of the scatter plot matrix

213
00:09:20,124 --> 00:09:21,879
graphically shows
the relationship

214
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:24,535
between measurements
at two time points.

215
00:09:24,535 --> 00:09:26,470
The corresponding element in

216
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:28,254
the variance covariance matrix

217
00:09:28,254 --> 00:09:31,380
gives the covariance
of those measurements.

218
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,325
For example, the indicated
scatter plot in the first row,

219
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:39,835
second column is summarized
by the covariance measure

220
00:09:39,835 --> 00:09:41,620
in the corresponding location of

221
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:44,275
the variance covariance matrix.

222
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,945
The variance covariance matrix

223
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:49,089
quantifies the within
sample dependency

224
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,740
of observations over time

225
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,485
expected in longitudinal
data analysis.

226
00:09:53,485 --> 00:09:55,180
It allows us to confirm that

227
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,520
the dependency exists
in the direction,

228
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,565
which we expect will
usually be positive.

229
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:03,970
Now that we've used
descriptive statistics to

230
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:07,330
achieve our first goal of
longitudinal data analysis,

231
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,000
describing the change
in outcomes over time.

232
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,275
We'll shift attention
to the second goal,

233
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:15,269
identifying between
subject differences

234
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:17,430
that affect the
outcome measurements.

235
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,230
We can use the same set of

236
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,360
descriptive statistics to
summarize outcomes by group.

237
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,810
Remember how we used color to

238
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,315
differentiate groups in
our spaghetti plots,

239
00:10:28,315 --> 00:10:30,370
we can think about each color or

240
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:33,640
group having its own
distribution of measurements.

241
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:36,985
We can then compute the
mean, standard deviation,

242
00:10:36,985 --> 00:10:39,085
and sample size by group for

243
00:10:39,085 --> 00:10:40,840
each time point and efficiently

244
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,615
displayed these
quantities in a table.

245
00:10:43,615 --> 00:10:46,930
The table allows
easy comparison of

246
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,515
mean measurements between
groups at a given time point,

247
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:52,810
as well as an overall
idea as to how

248
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:55,420
the means are changing
in each group over time.

249
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,580
Similarly, we can compare

250
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,940
variation in the
outcomes between groups.

251
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,960
A good exploratory
analysis consists of both

252
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,670
visualizing your data and

253
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,280
computing descriptive statistics.

254
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,230
In this lecture, we showed

255
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:14,230
how basic statistics that you
are already familiar with,

256
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,850
like mean and variance,

257
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:17,335
can efficiently capture

258
00:11:17,335 --> 00:11:19,600
critical elements of
longitudinal data,

259
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,780
such as change over time
and comparison of groups.

260
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,730
Correlation and covariance are

261
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,620
particularly important
for summarizing

262
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,480
longitudinal data because of

263
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,105
the dependency of the
repeated measures design.

264
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:34,040
At this point, you are
now ready to perform

265
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:38,496
your own exploratory analysis
of longitudinal data.
