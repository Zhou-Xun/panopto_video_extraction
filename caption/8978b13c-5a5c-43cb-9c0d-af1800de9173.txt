1
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:09,320
So I was like, all right. For our news article, folks today.

2
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:40,660
I was sort of. The crowd.

3
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:55,590
Oh, sorry. Oh, there we go. So our article talks about the effects of the new abortion laws that are going into

4
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,209
effect that ban abortions in different states and how cancer physicians will have to,

5
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:08,310
like, use these state laws when talking with patients who are pregnant and their treatment options with cancer.

6
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,770
So the article mentioned that cancer does occur in one in a thousand pregnancies.

7
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:20,700
So it is a relatively it's very important to talk about this are the most common cancers in pregnant women are breast,

8
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:24,210
cervical melanoma, lymphoma and leukemia.

9
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:29,700
And so the problem with this is that a lot of the medications and treatment options are very toxic

10
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,280
towards the developing fetus and also can cause a lot of birth defects once the baby is born.

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,630
So even though some of these abortion laws do have like medically exempt, like reasons for why you can get one.

12
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:51,570
A lot of the physicians in these states where there are the abortion bans are saying that the laws are very unclear and a lot of the physicians

13
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:59,970
are very nervous because they don't want to misinterpret the information that's been given to them and then treat the patients in a legal way.

14
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:06,180
So, for example, like in the past, patients who were pregnant, who had brain cancer,

15
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,560
a lot of times they would give them the option to get a medical abortion.

16
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:17,399
But now in states such as like Georgia, a lot of the physicians are unsure if this is even legal anymore.

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,370
And so there is increased wait time to do the treatments, which is becoming harmful.

18
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,690
So the case focuses on Dr. Deborah Platt, who's an ecologist in Austin, Texas and Texas,

19
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:33,990
going to state that a lot of like a lot of controversies since the overturning Roe v Wade.

20
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,540
And she's dealt with more than two dozen pregnancies like, well,

21
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:43,229
their patients and her patients have cancer and there's like a lot of ethical dilemmas.

22
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:53,730
And that's within her hospital side because there's the argument that they were able to perform medical abortions in the past because like the cancer,

23
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:58,260
it's like the baby that's killing the mother, but now it's like the cancer that's killing the mother.

24
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,100
So there isn't like a really a medically induced reason to perform this abortion.

25
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:07,980
And she talks about a patient that she had that was early in her pregnancy who was diagnosed with breast cancer.

26
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,690
And the tests showed that the cancerous growth was spurred by the hormone estrogen, which was like really prevalent.

27
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,510
The pregnancy like grows a lot and Sarah gets it, which causes it to metastasize.

28
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,770
Um, and as a side note, because of like the changes in the breast that occurred during pregnancy,

29
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:27,270
like there's a lot of changes and breast cancer can be like really difficult to

30
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:31,079
diagnose because like as the breast grows and with different things inside of it,

31
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:38,390
it's like complicated. And for this reason, pregnancy related breast tumors tend to be larger and diagnosed at a higher stage.

32
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:45,570
Patients that are pregnant. So pregnant women with breast cancer are more likely to have large tumors, positive nodes,

33
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:51,060
testes and vascular invasion families from like the regional or from the globalized, the the regional side of it.

34
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,750
And hospital ethics committees are actually in charge of deciding whether or not their patients can get a medically induced abortion.

35
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:04,020
And while it might be the mother's choice in some states in Texas, they're really worried about getting prosecuted.

36
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,309
It's also election season.

37
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:12,300
So prosecutors that want to get reelected might be like overeager to like prosecute the cases and like get people more on their side.

38
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,930
So and it's not necessarily just physicians that are on this ethics committee.

39
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,060
It's also administrators,

40
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:23,850
the other people in the hospital who might have like other orientations and might not be professional like cancer and like pregnancy with cancer.

41
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:32,549
So it's definitely an issue in her hospital there, and it's creating a lot of social or health disparities because some patients

42
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,090
are taking it upon themselves to travel to outside states to get abortions.

43
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:42,990
However, the article speaks a lot about how, like, not everyone can just take off a day of work and drive and go for a consultation,

44
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,010
and that in some states there's laws that you need to get a consultation for you to make the appointment.

45
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:54,030
And like there's many stops and a lot of people, especially in the States where these laws are very strict, like don't have the means to do that.

46
00:04:54,390 --> 00:05:00,840
So it creates an either like an even wider gap between the rich and the poor and the people that have money,

47
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:08,909
like have access to abortion and have access to travel to it, and which means that they can then get an abortion and pursue their cancer treatment.

48
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:15,660
Whereas that article talks about patients that can barely even afford their cancer treatment, can barely even afford to travel to their chemotherapy.

49
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:25,390
So this is creating like a lot of issues to. Any questions or comments?

50
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:34,900
Just keeps getting worse. Like all of the ripple effects of this just keep keep getting worse.

51
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,750
You know, even I mean, I wouldn't have thought of this and I study cancer, you know what I mean?

52
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,910
But it's. Certainly I don't think the lawmakers completely thought this through.

53
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,090
When you. Nuances of trouble they were going to cause.

54
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,210
Or maybe some of them just didn't. All right.

55
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:03,670
Any other thoughts? That was a good one.

56
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:20,980
Thanks, guys. All right.

57
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:31,960
Any questions before we move on and start? I just started recording before we start doing our next kind of biology lecture.

58
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,950
It's biology week here in public health for a month.

59
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:45,980
Okay. So last time we talked about for the biologic basis of cancer and now we're going to talk about inherited and familial cancer.

60
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:53,110
So this is. I think it ties nicely together because you can see how these mutations and these tumor

61
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,160
suppressor DNA repair genes that you were born with cause really high rates of cancer.

62
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:04,120
So it really demonstrates how important and seminal these genes are right for cancer risk.

63
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,659
All right. So it's just the outline. I'm not going to read it to you. Okay.

64
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:14,490
So let's talk about the poly genic effect. So cancer is determined by the joint effects of multiple genes.

65
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:19,439
So that is called the poly genic effect and their interaction with environmental factors.

66
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,400
So this is similar to other chronic diseases write other chronic diseases behave this way as well.

67
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,889
And as we said last time, many mutations have to occur before you get cancer.

68
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:37,920
So remember how many we said it was like 3 to 7 mutations in these key tumor suppressor and anchor genes and DNA repair genes lead to cancer.

69
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,620
Well. So how do we get those mutations?

70
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,059
Well, there's kind of two ways, and I think this is the way we mostly think about with cancer.

71
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:53,629
Right, is that you have a normal cell. For some reason, this is a bone cell and then mutation occurs.

72
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,300
And so you have mostly normal cells,

73
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:02,360
but then you also have all of the daughter cells of this one where the mutation occurred that have these altered genes.

74
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,660
Right. And that is called an acquired or a somatic mutation.

75
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:15,720
Right. Hereditary mutations, on the other hand, occur during conception, right?

76
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:20,530
They occur when the egg is fertilized by the sperm.

77
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,190
And so all of the cells in the body will have that mutation.

78
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:33,160
And so germline mutations like this occur with a frequency less than 1%.

79
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,820
So a very small fraction of the DNA sequence variation within a population.

80
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,520
The word mutation is a little bit squishy, right?

81
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,180
So when people say there are definitely polymorphisms in genes, right?

82
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,040
Everybody's genes, not everybody. I mean, we share a lot of the same DNA, obviously.

83
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,490
But there are differences in genetic code that make our hair color different and

84
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,249
color different that maybe are those like slight susceptibility or resistance genes.

85
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:10,600
Right? So there's all kinds of variation in the genome. People call it a mutation usually when it is deleterious, so bad, causing problem and rare.

86
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,540
Does that make sense? So there's no like hard and fast rule,

87
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:22,270
but when you hear people will usually pull out the word mutation when they're talking about something disease causing.

88
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,020
So the vast majority of variations are due to his polymorphisms, like we just said.

89
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:33,940
Single nucleotide polymorphisms, more foursomes or snips? How many people have heard of snips?

90
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,320
So snips are single nucleotide polymorphisms. That means that.

91
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:43,930
Remember how we talked about all the base pairs? One of those bases is nucleotide, right?

92
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:49,700
And so single changes in those are the most or most of the variation in the genome.

93
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:53,769
Right. Or you can have other kinds of microsatellites.

94
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:57,140
We're not going to go into that. Okay.

95
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:02,870
So how many people remember Mendelian inheritance? Mendel and his plants.

96
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,980
And your Punnett squares from high school biology? Yeah. Okay.

97
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,530
So remember, Mendelian inheritance is determined by a single gene. It can be dominant resources or sex links.

98
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,419
And also, will dominant disorders occur at a higher frequency than autosomal recessive within

99
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,230
a family because one bad copy of the gene is sufficient to confer the disease.

100
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,120
So just. In these autism disorders.

101
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,880
All affected individuals have at least one affected parent,

102
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:37,679
and about 50% of the offspring are affected by one parent is affected and the other is normal and recessive.

103
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:43,229
Diseases occur in an ensemble. Recessive diseases occur in individuals who are homozygous for the defective genes.

104
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,220
We need two bad copies to get the disease for a recessive disease.

105
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:58,890
So remember, this is a dominant situation. You have an affected father, so he has one mutated copy, the big C for cancer and the little C,

106
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,760
so he has one bad copy and therefore has the disease and is affected.

107
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:09,780
The mother does not have the disease. And so 50%, if you do the products where 50% of the children will be affected with one bad copy.

108
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,979
Recessive. On the other hand, you need you might have a carrier and father and a carrier mother.

109
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:26,580
So each of them have one good copy but one bad copy, but it is recessive so they are not affected and only 25% of the children will be affected.

110
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,840
So I will tell you this, the vast majority we're going to get into this in a bit.

111
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:40,040
All of the cancer hereditary cancer syndromes I know of, follow this autosomal dominant trotter.

112
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,430
We're going to discuss it in a little bit more detail later on.

113
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:48,090
And they are basically in tumor suppressor and DNA repair genes, not so much homogeneous.

114
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,980
Okay. So let's talk a little bit about Knutson.

115
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,890
In 1971, he came up with this two hit model. So who's heard of retinoblastoma?

116
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,180
This is an eye tumor that occurs in children.

117
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:08,820
It's fairly rare, but I have known a couple of people in my life who have had prosthetic eyes because they have this as a child.

118
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:18,390
So it's not like vanishingly rare. It is caused by the RB one gene on chromosome 13, the tumor suppressor gene.

119
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:22,350
So with one affected parent, 50% of children inherit one copy of the defective gene.

120
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,729
The tumor will not occur until a second copy is mutated or deleted in somatic

121
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:30,630
cells as a result of environmental insult or chemical exposure or a chance event.

122
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:33,480
So let's talk about this a little bit. I think this confuses people.

123
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:40,500
I've told you that these are mostly autosomal dominant disorders in tumor suppressor and DNA repair genes.

124
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:47,410
I also told you last time that tumor suppressor genes are like the brakes and you need two bad copies to get the disease.

125
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:50,610
So that seems like I have just told you two different things, right?

126
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:54,389
I told you a lot of them will dominate, which means you need one bad copy of disease.

127
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:57,420
But I've also told you that you need to lose both copies to get the disease.

128
00:12:58,540 --> 00:12:59,860
How is that possible?

129
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:09,100
So you will hear these referred to as autosomal dominant disorders in the literature a lot and they are talking about the phenotype of cancer.

130
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:18,370
If you do a family tree for people getting cancer, these will appear to follow an autism,

131
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:23,250
a dominant pattern with about 50% of the offspring getting cancer with one effective care.

132
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:33,639
That is because they are born with one bad copy and during their lifetime they're very likely to lose that second copy just

133
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,760
because they're existing in the world and they're exposed to normal environmental insults or chance mutations or whatever.

134
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:46,540
So if the lifetime risk of cancer in a person with one bad copy is very, very high, does that make sense?

135
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,860
So if you're born with one bad copy, you're very you're pretty much going to get the cancer.

136
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,879
So, one, if you're looking at the phenotype of cancer on a pedigree, a family tree,

137
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:01,690
it looks like it's autosomal dominant now that we know how the genes work.

138
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:10,360
We know that genetically it is typically recessive because you have to lose that second copy before you get the cancer.

139
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:19,809
Does that make sense? I see some confused faces.

140
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:25,780
So if you don't if you don't understand, we can go through it again. Yes. You can lose a copy if you want to get turned off.

141
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,630
Could be could be turned off epigenetically. It could be mutated so that it doesn't work.

142
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:39,740
Yeah. So, like, you're born say you're born with one bad copy of P53.

143
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:45,840
Okay. You have what we're going to talk about in a minute is the problem baby syndrome.

144
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:53,400
The lifetime risk of cancer is basically 100%. So if you do a family tree, a pedigree of a family that has lead from any syndrome,

145
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,530
if you have one affected parent, you're going to have half of their kids get cancer.

146
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:03,120
So based on the pedigree, you would say, aha, this is an autism,

147
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,320
all dominant disorder because we've got one affected parent and half the kids get the disease.

148
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:14,870
Right. But we know now that we can now that we can phenotype things and we know how tumor suppressor genes work.

149
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:24,090
We know that they were born with one mutated copy of p53 such that they don't make the protein that controls apoptosis correctly.

150
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:31,420
The other copy is still working when they're born. So they're not born with cancer right throughout their lifetime.

151
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,280
Maybe they smoke. Maybe they live with a smoker and have been exposed to secondhand smoke.

152
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:40,950
Maybe they eat a lot of processed meat. Maybe there was just an accident while their DNA was replicating and that

153
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:45,900
second copy got lost or mutated such that the protein is not working correctly.

154
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:52,410
Then then we have trouble. It's just very, very likely that that is going to happen within that person's lifetime.

155
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,310
So when you look at a pedigree, it looks autism. Yes.

156
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:01,500
So it. Okay.

157
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:09,380
Let's talk. Like one of them is one of them.

158
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:15,530
Yup. And then one of them. Like in that environment?

159
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:24,830
Yup. What? Then they have no working copies of that tumor suppressor gene protein.

160
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:34,169
That's why that's where the focus. Remember something about the one that caught me from Save Your Dad and the good coffee from their mom.

161
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:38,309
So their body is still making the appropriate proteins and doing what it is.

162
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:46,320
It's got that emergency brake. So right. But then the other emergency brake is locked, the brakes are off and we're off to the races.

163
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:50,610
And then you need you still need the other 2 to 6 hits.

164
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,620
Right. But remember how we talked about that kind of snowball effect once you've got one big hit.

165
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:03,000
It speeds up. So they don't mostly retinoblastoma the bad example because it is childhood cancer.

166
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,780
But most of the people with these hereditary cancers get get cancer in young adulthood, like around you guys's age, 2030s.

167
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:17,850
Right. And so much younger than people who probably do not have a predatory cancer syndrome,

168
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:25,290
but they still need a little bit of time to lose that second copy and accumulate the additional mutations to get cancer.

169
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:36,610
Does that make sense? So they. When both the copies are not working and they've accumulated the additional mutations necessary to cause cancer.

170
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:45,510
Because remember, we've got this picture back here. They're born here, right?

171
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:52,339
They're born at this time. At this stage. And then they lose.

172
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,470
You know, actually, they're born halfway between here and there.

173
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:59,270
Right. They're born with one bad copy of a tumor suppressor.

174
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,190
So they got to only lose one copy and get here. And then you keep going.

175
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,140
Does that make sense?

176
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:15,920
And so the the this process is sped up so, so much that they get cancer in their twenties and thirties instead of in their seventies.

177
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,740
Does that make sense? I'm sorry. I look like you guys, but.

178
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:26,490
No, it's fine. Fine. Okay, so, I mean, these are actually like.

179
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:36,610
I guess that is it. When. That's right.

180
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,040
So remember, if we go back to this is good because I think everybody's a little bit confused about this.

181
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,090
So we're going to go back to last week's lecture.

182
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,740
Do you remember this from last week? Your last time. Okay.

183
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:01,380
So you have a mutation that inactivate the tumor suppressor gene. People are born halfway to this.

184
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:08,160
When they're born with one bad copy of P53 or one of these major pathogens, they have to lose that second copy.

185
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,930
And then the tumor suppressor gene is totally inactive and they're ready to go down the rest of this path to cancer.

186
00:19:13,150 --> 00:19:22,740
Okay. Yeah. Okay. So it's just that if you look at a pedigree, almost 100% of people get here in their lifetime.

187
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:31,890
And honestly, by the time they're like 30, 40, 50, they'll get to the stage because they're born with such a big step already.

188
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,110
How have. It's in every cell in the body.

189
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,830
Right. So there's all of these cells that have a chance to lose that second copy and then continue down this path.

190
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,530
And remember, we said it's a little bit like a snowball. All of the rest of these happen much faster.

191
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,940
Once you've got a big one. Right. Does that make sense to you guys?

192
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:58,740
Yes. There is, and that is what we'll talk about.

193
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:04,670
Genetic testing, lecture. So you can get genetic testing. People who are who have these predatory mutations.

194
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,200
It's usually fairly clear because they have a very strong family history.

195
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,040
And we're going to show I'm going to show you some categories of these families and what it looks like.

196
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:24,250
Okay. Everybody feel pretty good about this autosomal dominant or excuse me, phenotypically dominant, but in a typically recessive concept.

197
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:33,160
Okay. All right, so we.

198
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:38,080
Oh, let's go. Oh! Oh, no.

199
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,969
Okay. So back to retinoblastoma.

200
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:51,480
This is this eye cancer. So it's a malignant tumor of the retina. Two thirds of these occur before age two and 95% occur by the age of five years.

201
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,700
So this is a child with cancer. Approximately one in 15,000 children have this.

202
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,230
So it's about 300 cases per year. There's not an equal male to female ratio.

203
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,790
There's really been no change in incidence in the past 40 years. It just sort of bumps along.

204
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:13,220
And one of the biggest symptoms is Luca chorea, which is this like if you shine a light in the eye, you see this kind of reflection.

205
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,760
It can be hereditary or sporadic. One out of three kids have this happen in both eyes.

206
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,400
What are the three who get the cancer? Have a habit of both. Not one out of three of all children.

207
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:35,610
About 40% is heritable. So all of the cells of the individual have the RB mutation, and about 60% are carrying mutations only in the eye.

208
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,480
And so that means that it's only a somatic mutation. Okay.

209
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:48,880
So Nixon proposed this hypothesis in 1971 that two hits are needed to the retinoblastoma gene to cause a tumor.

210
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,880
With this occurring at the somatic level and the sporadic form where one hit is inherited in the familial form.

211
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:00,700
So he looked at the incidence of retinoblastoma in children. He compared the incidence in the inherited form,

212
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:07,240
which he defined as those who had it in two eyes versus the sporadic form where they only got it in one eye.

213
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:15,490
He fitted a statistical model and he concluded that the only plausible explanation was given by a two bit model.

214
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:21,829
And they did not identify the retinoblastoma gene until 1987, and it was in fact,

215
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:25,490
a tumor suppressor gene, and you had to lose both copies to get cancer.

216
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,950
I think this is fascinating when people could do this. I mean, he came up with this hypothesis.

217
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,960
He understood how it worked without actually knowing what the gene was or what the protein product was or any of that.

218
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:43,700
This is his model. So the line, okay, the squares are the bilateral cases.

219
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,330
So in both eyes and the circles are the unilateral cases.

220
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,100
So you can see that the bilateral cases happen like earlier.

221
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:59,299
Right. And age and the lines are his statistical models.

222
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:05,650
So they fit the data precisely. So this was his data for his to hit hypothesis.

223
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:08,980
I don't know. I think that stuff is really cool. I think people like that are really smart.

224
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:13,809
Must have been pretty like. I hope you still live. In 1987 was like.

225
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:17,470
See it told you. Justified. Vindicated.

226
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:24,280
Okay. So let's talk about some of these features are hereditary, high penetrance cancers.

227
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,390
Do you remember what I mean by high penetrance? Do you remember what penetrance is?

228
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,310
Anybody know? It's too early to remember what kind of trances.

229
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:40,590
Okay. Penetrance is the probability that you get the disease given that you have fatigue.

230
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:45,030
Okay. So penetrance is a probability of getting the disease.

231
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:54,090
If you have some sort of genetic change. Okay, high penetrance means if you've got this gene, it's really like when you're going to get the disease.

232
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:57,300
Okay. All right.

233
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:01,290
So these are caused by mutations or deletions of genes and critical functions.

234
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:06,930
Their DNA repair, cell proliferation, cell cycle control and paper ptosis.

235
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,740
Mutations of those genes lead to altered function or altered production of the gene product.

236
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,180
So they are functional mutations that change the protein product such that it does not work properly.

237
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,640
On the other hand, low penetrance genes.

238
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,940
Which are like those jeans on that little curve that we showed you that make you like a little more susceptible or more resistant.

239
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,950
These are only moderately elevate or modestly elevate your risk of cancer.

240
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:40,610
Okay. The example we gave last time was that men not to achieve the changes.

241
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:50,130
How detoxify women's right. These act by increasing individual susceptibility to environmental carcinogens so they're not in those critical functions.

242
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,380
They're following more affecting cell function, dealing with the metabolism of these compounds.

243
00:24:55,680 --> 00:25:02,790
Okay. So it's not like this critical cancer related protein product gene.

244
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,830
Okay. This is sort of a comparison table.

245
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:13,040
This is a really good summary. I think high penetrance, these tend to be causal.

246
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:20,570
They tend to be almost both necessary and sufficient in some sense, given that if you get one, your lifetime risk is so, so high.

247
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:27,590
Right. So they're very rare. Most cancers are not caused by these high.

248
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,010
There's a very clear familial hereditary pattern.

249
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:37,640
If you do a high degree in a large in a family, you're going to see what looks like absolutely textbook, like Mendelian inheritance of these genes,

250
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:44,160
really high strength of association, meaning that if you have this gene, your risk of cancer is super, super high.

251
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,000
Okay, but the population attributable risk is low.

252
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:56,059
Remember, we talked about population attributable risk. That means the portion of the whole pie of cancer that is due to this exposure.

253
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:01,250
In this case, the exposure being the gene is small because they are so rare.

254
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,210
Right. So if you have a gene, your risk is high.

255
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:08,600
But most cancers are not caused by this gene. Yeah.

256
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:15,350
And the role of the environment. Exposure is secondary and kind of variable depending upon exactly which one we're talking about.

257
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,760
Low penetrance on the other alters your susceptibility.

258
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,419
Neither necessary nor sufficient. Remember if you have that mapped to gene that makes you more susceptible to erode

259
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:30,950
means and you never smoke and are never exposed to earlier means doesn't matter.

260
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:36,530
Right. Okay. It's not going to give you cancer. These are very common.

261
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:43,520
There's not going to be a really clear hereditary pattern if you look in a pedigree, maybe a slightly elevated family history.

262
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:47,740
Nothing super clear the strength of association as well.

263
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,050
If you have that gene, your elevated risk of cancer is small.

264
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:55,940
But the population attributable risk is high because they are so common.

265
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:02,870
And the role of environmental exposure is critical. Remember these alter how you respond to environmental carcinogens.

266
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:07,640
So if you're not exposed to that thing, it kind of doesn't matter, right?

267
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:14,879
Okay. I'm not going to go through this table. These are some examples we're going to talk about specific ones of these.

268
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,180
But if you're interested, you can see kind of what some of these are.

269
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,120
I remember we talked about this texture last time.

270
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,979
So these are those high penetrance, rare cancer predisposition genes that we're talking about today compared with some of these lower penetrance,

271
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:33,209
common things that have a lower individual risk associated with them,

272
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,990
where the role of the environment is very important, but where actually they're there,

273
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,870
maybe responsible for a larger piece of the pie of all the cancers.

274
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,890
Okay. Heritable proportion of human cancers.

275
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,200
I think my little twins picture is probably out of date. Probably. No one has seen this having really seen this movie.

276
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:58,930
Then if your parents like for you to watch this, they do it like that is a very old like eighties movie.

277
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:04,480
And somehow, like Danny DeVito and Arnold Schwarzenegger were fraternal twins that found each other later.

278
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:07,550
And, like, somehow they had, like, created them in a lab and like,

279
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:11,229
given all of the good genes to Arnold Schwarzenegger and all of the bad genes to Danny DeVito.

280
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,600
It was terrible. Very bad movie, anyway. Huh?

281
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,190
It's got twins. That's why it turns out it.

282
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:27,020
Look, I'm joking with you. Yeah. Goblins played a terrible movie night just to make fun of it.

283
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:34,550
Okay, so this is my example of identical twins, and this is my example of fraternal twins.

284
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,790
All right, so have you guys heard about, like, twin studies?

285
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,540
Do you know how they work?

286
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:47,870
The idea is that you look at the like the risk of you compare the risk of cancer in two identical twins to the risk of cancer.

287
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:56,060
And. Right. And so if you because the idea is that they probably similarly share in utero and like early life exposures.

288
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:03,170
And anything else, you know, in later life, I suppose it's like whether they chose to smoke or whatever couldn't be different.

289
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:06,230
Right? But but the genes.

290
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,850
Identical. My brain wanted to see individual twins, and that is not what they are.

291
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,900
They are identical twins. But like I really had to push past that word.

292
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:24,860
Identical twins share their genes 100% right, whereas fraternal twins, they share just as much as regular siblings.

293
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:34,640
So if you see of a higher concordance of cancer risk in the identical twins compared to the fraternal twins,

294
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,480
that suggests that there is a heritable component, a genetic component.

295
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:45,440
Right. So this is a clever study designed to kind of get at what proportion of a disease, not just cancer,

296
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:50,660
to do it for all kinds of things, but what proportion of a disease is due to genetics versus other risk factors?

297
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:55,280
So you can see that there's actually a pretty sizable chunk.

298
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:00,319
You know, this is 42% down to 21% of these cancers.

299
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,590
That is that is heritable. Right. So genetics may make a difference.

300
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:11,060
So like we said, these characteristics of these very rare hereditary cancer syndromes,

301
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,110
carriers of these genes have a very high risk of developing cancer,

302
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:21,350
up to 80% of lifetime breast cancer, 80% risk of lifetime breast cancer, BRCA1 and two carriers.

303
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:26,900
So if you have a BRCA1 gene mutation, you may have an 80% lifetime risk of cancer.

304
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:31,370
Now, when we get to the genetic, I'm going to tell you, when we get to the genetic counseling lecture,

305
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:34,040
you're going to see lower penetrance estimates for BRAC one or two.

306
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:39,050
These were some of the earliest studies came out with these very high penetrance estimates.

307
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:46,640
Why do you think that is? Why do you think the earliest studies from really high nerd ability and later studies have as much?

308
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:57,240
Like if you didn't know what Gene was causing breast cancer, but you were on the hunt for a really strong familial gene.

309
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,940
Like What kind of people would you recruit in your study to try to find out you?

310
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:12,830
Yeah. A family history of breast cancer and not just like, oh, my mom had it was she was like 16.

311
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:16,580
You're going to get people who have the worst family history, right?

312
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:23,480
You're going to want people to have really, really strong, like tons of relatives in their family with breast cancer.

313
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,090
And you're going to figure out what's going on with those people. Right.

314
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:31,880
So the earliest studies pick the very worst family categories essentially for breast cancer.

315
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:41,570
And so they had there are different there's there could be different mutations within the gene that confer different risk.

316
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:46,489
And so they were kind of cherry picking the very worst to try to find those gene.

317
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:50,480
Right. So the overall penetrance estimates are actually lower.

318
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:56,570
All right. Rare the general population low attributable risk for some of these.

319
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:58,670
Not all carriers develop cancer during their lifetime.

320
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:03,080
Like we said, even with the highest estimates, that's an 80% lifetime risk for this bracket, 1 to 2.

321
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:08,090
So there is some role for these other things. Remember, you still have to lose that second copy.

322
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:14,510
You have to get all those other mutations like we talked about. So there's some chance that you might not in your lifetime.

323
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:17,630
Right. But most people do with these kinds of mutations.

324
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:25,160
All right. Importantly, they are young onset.

325
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,650
So one of the one of the red flags when a family history is young relatives who got cancer quite young.

326
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:38,120
Right. Or people who get cancer very young. That's a red flag for a potential hereditary syndrome, multiple cancers in the same person.

327
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,640
And we're going to learn that like we know now that some cancers that track together,

328
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:48,770
colon and endometrium, for example, is really strongly associated with them.

329
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:56,360
So there are some like pairs of cancers where you're like, ooh, red flags, dignity, and then Mendelian patterns of inheritance in a category.

330
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:07,280
Okay. So we're going to talk about a few examples, the family syndrome, FIP each and PCC and familial breast and ovarian cancers.

331
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:11,580
Okay. So leave from ABC.

332
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:16,470
I'm going to brag for just a minute. When I worked at NCI as a postdoc.

333
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:26,510
The director, the division director at the time was Dr. Coming of Leave from Haiti Syndrome.

334
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:31,500
I have met him. He's very, very accomplished.

335
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:36,280
I I think you kind of have made it if you have a syndrome named after you write.

336
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:40,120
Is that the answer? Is that how you know. So and Dr. Lee as well.

337
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:46,640
So they worked together. So it's family. All right. This is an example of an autism, all dominant disorder.

338
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,270
It is a germline mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene.

339
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:59,000
So when I say it's out double dominant, do I mean that it is, you know, typically or gene or typically on his double dominant.

340
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:05,190
Phenotypic correct, because it is in a tumor suppressor gene.

341
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,380
So how many copies you actually have to lose gene a typically in order to get the disease.

342
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:23,160
So, yes. Okay. So Gina typically recessive, but these are typically autosomal dominant.

343
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:29,790
If you look at a pedigree, it's going to look like a Mendelian Mendelian inheritance, autosomal dominant pattern.

344
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:38,060
50% of the kids are going to get cancer if they have one parent. You get familial clustering of childhood sarcoma.

345
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:42,889
So that's those bone and muscle tumors. Young onset breast and brain cancers.

346
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:46,460
People who have this or otherwise a typically normal so they don't look any different.

347
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:55,850
And these people are born heterozygous for defective p53. The tumor cells become homicidal homozygous when the normal oil is lost or mutated.

348
00:34:55,850 --> 00:35:01,100
So there is some time needed for the second mutation. So penetrance among carriers increases with age.

349
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,100
So with all of these cancers, you're going to see age specific penetrance estimates, right?

350
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:12,980
You're going to see lifetime risk or penetrance by age 45 or penetrance by age 65.

351
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:20,480
Okay. So with in we from any syndrome people, 50% penetrance by age 45, 90% by age 65.

352
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:26,150
Some pretty nasty ones. Okay.

353
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:29,300
And this is a really tough one because there's not a lot to do.

354
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:33,970
We don't have I mean, breast cancer, we do have screening for.

355
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,950
Right. But like the brain tumors, the childhood sarcomas,

356
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:47,240
there's not like a lot of screening you can do and the tumors happen kind of so systemically with this mutation that there's not a great way to.

357
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:52,130
Treat these patients. It's tough.

358
00:35:54,320 --> 00:36:02,150
In contrast, now we're going to talk about some of the colorectal cancer family history or excuse me, hereditary syndromes.

359
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:06,290
Okay. So this is the whole pie of colorectal cancer, right?

360
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:12,410
So most of them occur 65, 85% of cases occur in people who are at average risk.

361
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,970
They're just sporadic due to environmental exposure or random mutation.

362
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:23,410
10 to 30% occur in people who have a family history but not a familial cancer syndrome.

363
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:27,170
Right. So that might be some of those more common, lower penetrance genes.

364
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:32,690
On the other hand, you've got 5% of all common cancers are caused by H and PCC.

365
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:38,090
1% are caused by FP. Okay, so this is what we mean when we say they are rare.

366
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:46,870
Let's just look at this real quick. This is the approximate lifetime risk, the lifetime risk of colorectal cancer in different people.

367
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:51,490
So this is the lifetime risk in people who have no family history, about 2%.

368
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,920
You have 1/1 degree relative. It's about 6%. Do you know what that means?

369
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:03,470
First degree. It means us right now, actually like a father, mother, child, sibling.

370
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:11,930
So not like grandparents, aunts, uncles, right. Even if you have 2/1 degree relatives, your lifetime risk is only 17.

371
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,400
Only 17%. If you have an age and PCC mutation, your lifetime risk is 17%.

372
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:23,560
Okay, so this should show you what we mean by like the difference between these kind of more common,

373
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:28,390
lower penetrance, genetic risk factors and these very clear hereditary syndromes.

374
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,840
Right. Okay.

375
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,140
So let's talk now about FP Familial Adenomatous Polyposis.

376
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,790
1% of all cases of colorectal cancer. The gene for FIP is on the long arm of chromosome five.

377
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,530
This is a major tumor suppressor gene.

378
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,080
People who have a therapy will start getting hundreds to thousands of polyps in their colon, starting in their teens.

379
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:56,350
This is like a cross section of a piece of colon. So it's supposed to be a tube that cut it out and then they open it up.

380
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,640
So you're looking at the inside of the colon. It is supposed to be smooth.

381
00:38:02,290 --> 00:38:04,990
Each of these little bumps is a polyp.

382
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:12,100
Most people who go in for their colonoscopy in their fifties and sixties will have a couple of polyps they get rid.

383
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,010
So this is. A lot. Very abnormal.

384
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:25,030
So all patients will develop. All people who have had people develop colorectal cancer from the colon polyps, usually by age 40.

385
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,290
So patients with FIP must have the colon and sometimes the rectum removed.

386
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:35,320
So they have a prophylactic, prophylactic colectomy and they have a colostomy bag that they want.

387
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:43,900
So the FIP abnormal gene is present in all of the body cells. So other organs may also develop cancer even if they do this prophylactic colectomy.

388
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:49,540
So this is another picture. This is from a colonoscopy. So this is not this is in a person's body.

389
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:54,069
So. Right. They've done a very nice job with their colon prep.

390
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:58,450
So you can see everything is all clean and each of these is a polyp.

391
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,330
Right. Like none of these little bumps should be there.

392
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:10,450
So the estimated penetrance for adenomas is about 90%, meaning that if a person carries the gene,

393
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:15,040
90% of them will start getting these polyps in their teens.

394
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:19,750
If they get the polyps, the penetrance for colorectal cancer is 100%.

395
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:22,970
Does that make sense? Okay.

396
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:28,430
There's also a risk of extra colonic tumors and these other places, c h r p e may be present.

397
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:33,980
I'm going to tell you what that is in this letter, too. And untreated polyposis leads to 100% risk of cancer.

398
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:38,800
Okay. This is what CHP is is common in individuals with IP.

399
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,690
It's when the retinal pigment epithelium is thicker than normal, producing a black spot in the back of the eye.

400
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:47,860
It's usually asymptomatic and identified during routine eye exams.

401
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:58,990
So keep in mind, there's kind of two ways you can have one of these familial cancer syndromes you can inherited from a parent, right?

402
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:06,460
Or you can be one of the unlucky people who had a de novo mutation, meaning during fertilization,

403
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:12,280
when you were being formed, there was a mistake and you ended up with one of these mutations.

404
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:18,130
So some people do have these familial cancer syndromes with no family history.

405
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:29,440
And some of those people find out because they go to the eye doctor and this is found. There's also attenuated FFP, which isn't quite as bad.

406
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:37,180
The polyps start happening a bit later. You get fewer. But still to many it's not associated with the HRP.

407
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:44,230
These people often get upper GI lesions also, and it's associated mutations of certain pieces of it.

408
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:53,189
PCG. So it follows phenotypic autosomal dominant inheritance plasma mutations in the APC tumor

409
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:58,649
suppressor gene on chromosome five to up to 30% of patients have de novo germline mutations.

410
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:03,930
So that means they do not have a family history. But they were the unlucky ones who got this mutation during conception.

411
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:10,850
Most families have unique mutations. So this is something we're going to learn about during genetic counseling.

412
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:19,310
Is that like when if you want to look for a gene mutation, you're testing for known mutations, known changes in the gene.

413
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:25,100
There's like a catalog, right? Of all the different changes that can occur in that gene that cause this outcome.

414
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:31,820
But you can have a different change in the gene that still causes the outcome, but they don't know to test for it.

415
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:37,940
So a lot of people think that genetic testing is like this, yes or no answer, but it's much more complicated than that.

416
00:41:38,210 --> 00:41:41,350
Does that make sense? Okay.

417
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:49,240
So key points here, colorectal cancer is 100% in untreated epilepsy patients.

418
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:53,799
Genetic testing identifies most APC mutation carriers.

419
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,860
I will say that this is one of the best characterized genes.

420
00:41:56,860 --> 00:42:03,939
And so genetic testing is very successful for this particular gene mutation because we know a lot about it.

421
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:07,960
It's been studied for a long time. It's also just one gene, right?

422
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:13,000
One gene and one place that causes this particular type of hereditary colon cancer.

423
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:17,379
And so we've done a pretty good job of figuring out all the changes that can cause the disease.

424
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,820
And so genetic testing is pretty good for this gene.

425
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:29,920
Endoscopic surveillance and prophylactic colectomy can improve survival in people with this

426
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,270
mutation and non carriers can be spared anxiety and the need for increased surveillance.

427
00:42:34,270 --> 00:42:38,679
So this is what a pedigree would look like for a de novo mutation, right?

428
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:44,740
So the squares remember how pedigrees work. The squares are men, the circles are women.

429
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:49,930
When they're lined up together, they had kids together, right?

430
00:42:49,930 --> 00:42:54,430
Or they're married, I guess. And then they have children that come down, right?

431
00:42:54,430 --> 00:43:00,880
And then that person would get married and have children, etc., etc. A slash means that they died.

432
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,419
Usually the pro band is identified by an arrow.

433
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:09,250
That means the person who came to the clinic from whom the family history is derived.

434
00:43:11,230 --> 00:43:16,690
And then there's usually shading of some kind that indicates that this person has the disease.

435
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,309
So this person has no family history. They are the pro band.

436
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:25,750
They had colorectal cancer at age 45 with a fap. They had a genetic mutation.

437
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,060
Let's talk about age. So this is the general population.

438
00:43:31,510 --> 00:43:40,330
Start getting adenomas maybe in the forties, certainly like very common by the 6070s, you know, 40%.

439
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:45,940
And then this is the this is colorectal cancer, right?

440
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:52,210
So much less common than the polyps, but really kind of peaking in like around late sixties, early seventies.

441
00:43:54,810 --> 00:44:02,190
These are FIP patients. They start getting polyps in their colon and it develops much more quickly to to cancer.

442
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:06,680
And about 100% of them will get cancer if they're Internet. By age.

443
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,800
You know, 60 foot by 40, like 60, 70%.

444
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:16,770
This is a pedigree of a family that has this mutation.

445
00:44:16,990 --> 00:44:26,070
Okay. So here's our probe. And this woman came in diagnosed with FIP at age 38, had colon cancer.

446
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:33,930
Also, because FIP is the yellow and yellow and orange means that they had both the polyps and colorectal cancer.

447
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:38,070
Okay. Genetically tested APC positive.

448
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:45,740
All right. Her sister APC negative, but their mother died of colorectal cancer at age 31.

449
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,040
Super young. Her father died of colorectal cancer at age 45.

450
00:44:52,970 --> 00:44:59,320
So one affected parent. That's two thirds of the kids, right?

451
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:08,060
Carried the gene. This person started getting up at age 22 and had a colectomy, so they did not get cancer.

452
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,470
And then these people's children were tested. Right.

453
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:14,900
This person's system is tested. This person's kid.

454
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:22,490
This person has not been genetically tested, I guess, but they have had negative sigmoidoscopy and they're 33.

455
00:45:22,490 --> 00:45:26,930
So they probably don't have it. And this person's kids have been tested.

456
00:45:26,930 --> 00:45:31,340
And this this 16 year old is ABC positive. This 14 year old is APC negative.

457
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:40,360
So that 16 year old is probably going to be followed with frequent, like yearly colonoscopies to see if they develop.

458
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:47,450
If they're the lucky 10% that don't, they can keep their colon and have these yearly colonoscopies for their life.

459
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,600
And if they are unlucky and begin to develop polyposis, they will have a prophylactic.

460
00:45:55,340 --> 00:46:01,809
Probably at about you guys using. All right.

461
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:04,990
So this is a map of a gene just kind of showing you.

462
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:11,380
We understand this gene pretty well. And these are sort of the regions that are associated with those different manifestations of that.

463
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:19,570
Right. If you have a mutation in this region, you're going to get classic therapy with this kind of in here, you can have that classic AP, but no.

464
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:23,800
HRP And if you have a mutation in here, you might get that attenuated.

465
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:29,200
Right. This is called allelic heterogeneity.

466
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:35,490
Just a little bit of vocab. Multiple mutations in the same gene caused the same phenotype.

467
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,410
Almost all of these cancer syndromes have allelic heterogeneity.

468
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:48,629
Remember what we said about the natural history of colon cancer,

469
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:54,270
that losing APC is kind of this first step between normal and hyper proliferative epithelium.

470
00:46:54,840 --> 00:47:02,360
So that's why people who have APC mutations get tons of polyps, right?

471
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:07,889
Because all of the cells in their body don't have that that first copy of the APC gene.

472
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:14,360
So so many of them develop into polyps and then they kind of go through the rest of these steps to get to cancer in sort of a normal rate.

473
00:47:14,370 --> 00:47:20,280
It's just that they've got thousands of chances. Right? Whereas most people have to have a handful.

474
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:26,070
How to turn it into right. Okay.

475
00:47:26,370 --> 00:47:31,110
I'm not going to go into this. So indications for APC gene testing.

476
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:40,110
You know, if you have people who present with a lot of polyps, like more than 100 polyps, you know,

477
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:45,690
or if they have a known blood relative with their VP or a known APC mutation, you might go ahead and do that.

478
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,549
I'm not going to go into this in a lot of detail because we're going to talk more about it in the genetic testing lecture.

479
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:58,290
But essentially, it used to be that there were kind of these steps to figuring it out.

480
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:02,210
Now there's these chips that are so inexpensive that this is sort of obsolete.

481
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,500
Right. We don't really go through this process anymore.

482
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:16,650
So the idea is that if you identify an APC mutation carrier carrier in early disease intervention, maybe life saving, that would be great.

483
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:20,999
ABC mutation tests are not informative in all families, right?

484
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,889
But it is better than most. It's getting really, really good because we have such good coverage and understanding this gene.

485
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:36,120
Now you could identify non mutation character carriers and then they only have to do like population level normal screening for cancer.

486
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:41,640
Right. You could get a false negative, but I think that's very uncommon.

487
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:52,480
So I told you that this is kind of how an APC mutation negative person goes about 14 year old maybe in that category who didn't have the mutation.

488
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:58,689
They got a negative result when their familial mutation was not right.

489
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,850
So they were able to test for the mutation that they knew was in their families that are.

490
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:03,270
You do not have this your gut.

491
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:11,530
They had a baseline sigmoidoscopy maybe or a poll and ask me just to double check and then they would just follow the CDC guidelines for normal.

492
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:17,489
Those people perceived for rectal cancer screening. But a mutation positive person.

493
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:22,470
Like I said, maybe that 16 year old on the pedigree they got that they found the mutation.

494
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:29,550
Then they would have annual examinations. And eventually if they started developing adenomas, they would have a prophylactic colectomy.

495
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:36,870
But in the end, the also be enrolled in like chemo prevention trials and they would also then be surveilled for other extra kilometers.

496
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:46,030
Okay. So that's up. The other major predatory scenario for colon cancer is HMO PCC.

497
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,210
This is the one that men are FIP is about 1% of all cases.

498
00:49:51,220 --> 00:50:00,310
This one's about 5%. All right. So remember the general population, about 4% lifetime risk, whereas it's about 80% in 18 PCC folks,

499
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:06,540
the average age is about 65 in the general population, but like 44 in aging PCC folks.

500
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:10,830
So no. It's also called Lynch Syndrome.

501
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:17,430
So if you hear people talk about Lynch syndrome, it's the thing. They also have they have this very high risk of colorectal cancer,

502
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:23,640
depending on which kind of lynch they have, meaning exactly which mutations they have in these genes.

503
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:30,690
They might have LYNCH one or two. Lynch two is associated with other kinds of tumors as well, whereas Lynch one is mostly just colorectal.

504
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:36,600
One of the biggest ones is the endometrial endometrial cancer in women.

505
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:41,980
Okay. So this is a DNA repair gene mutation.

506
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:49,450
So lynch one, like I said. Okay. So H and PCC has ensemble dominant phenotype ugly.

507
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:53,290
But you have to lose both copies of the gene eventually to get cancer.

508
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,100
Not all patients again have a parent who have cancer.

509
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:09,069
You can have de novo mutations in this genes, these genes as well, you know, de novo mutations, but also incomplete penetrance.

510
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:12,969
Right. This is not like 100% kind of a thing necessarily.

511
00:51:12,970 --> 00:51:17,110
It might be more like that. Breast cancer, 80%. And it's lifetime risk.

512
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:23,230
Right. So you could be in that your parent could have in the 20% that have a gene but didn't actually get the disease.

513
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:27,850
And so then it looks like you you are on the patient, but you're all right.

514
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:30,459
Variable to cancer diagnosis.

515
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:36,760
So if somebody died of something else long like they were inactive or something and they never got old enough to get the cancer you would have.

516
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:47,200
Okay. So that's kind of the trouble, especially with smaller families. It can be hard to see these patterns in a category.

517
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:56,700
All right. There's a lot of information here. I'm not going to ask you to memorize all of these genes.

518
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:03,560
Okay. Each NPC is caused by a mutation in one or more several mismatch repair genes.

519
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,790
MSH two MSH 61 which are all on chromosome two, one, two and three.

520
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,870
MSH three on chromosome five. So what you should take from this is not to memorize all of these numbers and letters.

521
00:52:18,590 --> 00:52:23,910
What you should understand from this is that this is locus heterogeneity, which we're going to talk about in a minute.

522
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:29,360
Right. There are lots of genes that do mismatch repair on multiple different chromosomes.

523
00:52:29,630 --> 00:52:33,710
And if you have mutations in any of these, you could get Lynch syndrome.

524
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:38,110
It looks the same no matter what your indication is. Message to and AML.

525
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:43,910
Each one account for the majority of mutations. Lifetime risk is quite high.

526
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:45,930
Fitness cancers.

527
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:53,940
So like I said, this is locus of heterogeneity, a single disorder or trait caused by mutations in multiple genes at different chromosomal loci.

528
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,090
So like we said, this is that whole pie of colorectal cancer.

529
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:03,200
5% of them are caused by aging PCC.

530
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:12,919
If you then take that slice and make a pie of it, about 30% are caused by age to about 30% by MLH one, and then some are unknown.

531
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:20,170
And these other rare ones. Okay. So this is one where like the genetic testing is a little more complicated because

532
00:53:20,170 --> 00:53:24,520
there's lots more genes and there can be lots of different mutations that cause it.

533
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:35,130
Okay. So again, this is kind of the old approach to genetic testing that we don't actually care to do anymore because it's so cheap.

534
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,200
You can just do one chip for a few hundred bucks that covers like kind of all of this stuff, right?

535
00:53:41,190 --> 00:53:44,940
So it used to be that there were you were very conservative, like you tried this and you tried that.

536
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:51,240
You only do it in certain people. And now it's much more commonly done in lots of different people because it's inexpensive.

537
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:57,870
One thing that you will see in people who have Lynch syndrome is microsatellite instability.

538
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,130
So if you look at the genes of the tumor.

539
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:10,720
The genetic sequence of the tumor. You're going to see a lot of MCI if the tumor is because of mismatch repair gene.

540
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:15,430
Defense. Messiah repeated sequences of DNA.

541
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:21,550
They are normal, though the length varies from person to person, but each person has microsatellites of a certain length.

542
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,950
He's like, repeated sequences are kind of the same length in cells that have mutations in mismatch repair genes.

543
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:32,060
Some of these DNA sequences accumulate error, accumulate errors and become like long or short, right?

544
00:54:32,110 --> 00:54:38,409
So if you see in a person's colon tumor that they've got like all of these different microsatellites of different lengths,

545
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:40,720
that's like a red flag that there's a mismatch repair problem.

546
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:50,190
So in each of these tumors, about 90% of them A and as I said, only 15 to 20% spread of tumors.

547
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:57,350
Okay. And this used to be one of the criteria for determining if someone should be tested for Lynch syndrome.

548
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:01,310
But again, they don't bother with it that much anymore. They just do the test.

549
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:09,020
Again, both copies of the gene have to be altered before the person will develop cancer.

550
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:13,070
You get the first mutation inherited from the parent or de novo during conception,

551
00:55:13,070 --> 00:55:17,780
and then the second mutation occurs in whatever, whatever tissue ends up getting the tumor.

552
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:24,620
Again, the loss of both copies of that gene are just the first step.

553
00:55:24,890 --> 00:55:30,660
You then have to have our genes in tumor suppressor genes that get defects in order to get that uncontrolled growth.

554
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:37,040
It's just really likely it's going to happen when you come here with a big hit and in a mismatch repair.

555
00:55:40,830 --> 00:55:47,070
I'm not going to do this or this. So this is a pedigree PCC family.

556
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:51,870
They're not showing us who the pro band is here. But again, you've got George and Susan.

557
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:56,510
George had colon cancer. Two of his kids got it. That's a lot.

558
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:01,430
And this one, this child. Both of her children have it.

559
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:05,520
So this is a pretty horizontal, dominant looking family tree.

560
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:14,270
Okay. And so PCC will present with it, may present it,

561
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:20,090
will present with no symptoms unless you get the cancer and you have and it's bad enough that the cancer is giving you symptoms.

562
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:27,740
People with age and PC develop polyps at a normal rate, but those polyps degenerate to cancer really fast.

563
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:36,240
Right. So it's kind of the opposite. Right. Remember that that that sort of natural history timeline, APC is really early.

564
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:43,860
The APC, the AFP folks developed tons of polyps that then kind of degenerate to cancer at a normal rate.

565
00:56:43,870 --> 00:56:47,609
They just have so many chances that they're very likely to get it in the beginning.

566
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:50,820
Part of this process is pretty normal for mismatch repair, folks.

567
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:57,350
It's just that the rest of it happens really fast. So.

568
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,450
Again, there used to be all of these criteria for diagnosis.

569
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:07,750
Now that genetic testing is much easier, this is not really used clinically that much anymore.

570
00:57:08,710 --> 00:57:17,390
They just set up for genetic testing and something. Okay.

571
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:23,330
So if you have a risk associated mutations, you can get the colonoscopy.

572
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,640
You start very young compared to the general population and you do it really frequently.

573
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:36,530
So the normal screening now it's age 45 and older, used to be 50 and older, but still 20 to 25 is quite a lot earlier than that.

574
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:44,690
And if you have a normal if you don't have any polyps, you don't have to go back for ten years for a colon cancer screening.

575
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:49,700
But these people do it every 1 to 2 years for an immediate cancer.

576
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:54,769
We do not have any screening tests for individual cancer for the general population.

577
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:58,790
But because these people are at such high risk, they do kind of whatever they can.

578
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:02,000
So they'll do a transvaginal ultrasound or endometrial aspirin.

579
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:08,750
Does anybody know what a transvaginal ultrasound is? Because normally when we think of ultrasound, like when I was pregnant,

580
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:13,550
when you think of a person who's probably getting an ultrasound, you see like the you think about the wand on the outside of the belly.

581
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:17,060
But in very early pregnancy and for other kinds of things like this,

582
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:24,060
there's a wand that they have certain the vagina similar to like a speculum or something, and then they'll do a vaginal ultrasound, right?

583
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:29,030
They'll look at the end of the training of the fetus through vagina and then endometrial aspirate.

584
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:35,099
They can actually, like try to take. Put like fluid in the in the in the uterus.

585
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:45,260
And I get an aspirin out of some of the cells. So this does work.

586
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:52,520
These are people who have HIV mutations, and this is a study that had ten years of follow up.

587
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,870
You can see that in people with no surveillance, about 12% of them got cancer over the ten years.

588
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:01,250
Only four and a half percent of women, four and a half percent, got cancer over the ten years.

589
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,940
So it's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.

590
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:15,110
They could do prophylactic surgery and these people, they would do look like to me, you do a hysterectomy and nephrectomy in women.

591
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,860
Hysterectomy means the uterus and you forget to make me just the ovaries.

592
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,670
But that doesn't totally eliminate the cancer risk, right? Because you could get a tumor in other places.

593
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:32,650
And, you know, I don't I don't think any particular recommendation has been made.

594
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:38,309
But these are options that are available to people. All right.

595
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:44,520
So there used to be a lot of technical complications and obstacles to widespread DNA testing.

596
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:51,330
Most of these are eliminated due to high throughput testing and the cost coming way down,

597
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:56,430
except for the fact that there are multiple different mutations in the population and

598
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,950
and distinguishing neutral mutations from disease causing mutation is going to be hard.

599
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:10,740
So we're going to learn in the genetic counseling lecture that you might have somebody go in for testing and come back with a mutation in their gene,

600
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:14,940
but we don't know if it actually causes disease or not. That's called a variant of unknown uncertainty.

601
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:21,299
Right. So somebody can. So basically what the genetic counselor is saying is, well, you have a change in your gene.

602
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:27,560
We just don't know if it's actually causing cancer or not. Which is hard, right.

603
01:00:28,070 --> 01:00:31,070
Because then you don't really have anything to tell these people to do necessarily.

604
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:35,510
Although as we learn more and more about all of these genes.

605
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:40,730
The likelihood of getting one of those comes down over time, right.

606
01:00:40,910 --> 01:00:46,010
The more mutations we accumulate in kind of our database of possible mutations,

607
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:51,410
the more work that's done to try to figure out functionally what those mutations do or do not do.

608
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:55,040
Then you can kind of gain information.

609
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:57,920
Does that make sense? So we're getting better at that.

610
01:00:59,150 --> 01:01:03,440
The medical problem, this is a lot of what we're going to hear about in a genetic counseling lecture is,

611
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:07,760
you know, you really need thorough patient education to obtain truly informed consent.

612
01:01:09,210 --> 01:01:12,400
There's complexity, genetic counseling about test results on a large scale.

613
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:20,210
So you can't just test the whole population because you really do need a genetic counselor to help that person interpret their results.

614
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:28,970
It's not a yes no. Right. It is a complicated finding that needs to be interpreted for a patient by a genetic counselor.

615
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:33,800
And the people need to understand what they're getting into. They need to understand you might get a boost, right?

616
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:42,250
If you test for 30 genes, you're much more likely to get a boost than if you test for two that are really strongly associated.

617
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:47,209
Cancer risk. If we test for these two, we actually know what to tell you to do about it.

618
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:49,910
If you're positive, if we test for these 30,

619
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:56,630
we're going to test for some things that we don't have good clinical recommendations about what to do if you are if you do have imitation imaging.

620
01:01:57,020 --> 01:02:01,040
Right. These are complicated patient provider conversations.

621
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:04,700
And that's what genetic counselors do is navigate that for people.

622
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:09,470
So you really don't want to just have people willy nilly getting tested without that kind of support.

623
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:17,540
Right. And then, you know, there's this concern about the potential impact of DNA testing on health insurance cost and employability.

624
01:02:18,410 --> 01:02:21,470
Gina, is the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act? That was.

625
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:28,999
Passed the federal law saying that you can't be discriminated against based on these kinds of genetic test results.

626
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,850
But I think that concern is still there for patients. Right.

627
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,990
So people are really concerned about whether you can ensure confidentiality of these testing results.

628
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:42,160
And then there's this concern about the effect of testing on other family members.

629
01:02:42,170 --> 01:02:47,570
Right. So like, if you find out you have a mutation, you've got kids, you've got siblings, like, what did they do?

630
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:51,700
They may not want. She goes through this process.

631
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:58,870
Right. And now they're kind of confronted with this without really having chosen to be.

632
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:05,190
So that's that's another kind of ethical dilemma. All right.

633
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:13,830
So we really do want to understand the phenotypic characteristics of these these various mutations.

634
01:03:14,310 --> 01:03:15,840
It's kind of the epidemiologists,

635
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:23,040
genetic epidemiologists role to try to understand what these different mutations like what is the penetrance of each of these different

636
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:30,749
mutations with the help hope then of providing people with more information about how they can prevent cancer for themselves.

637
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:35,240
Right. You want to understand the genetic features.

638
01:03:35,250 --> 01:03:38,399
You want to review diagnosis and treatment and investigate screening methods.

639
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,980
So a lot of the epidemiologic studies around these familial cancer syndromes that these families are like,

640
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:47,350
okay, given exactly what mutation you have, what countries,

641
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:53,940
and therefore does early screening work, does this other screening test that we're not using in the general population,

642
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,510
but does it work in this high risk setting? What about Chemoprevention?

643
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:02,190
Right. Can we offer something to these people?

644
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:07,820
And then you want to explore the implications of these things on epidemiologic studies.

645
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:16,640
So this is our summary of what we discussed today. I'm not going to read it to you, but do you guys have any questions?

646
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:32,519
That's. Kind of a scary thing, right?

647
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,790
Because this has just happened to people so young.

648
01:04:35,790 --> 01:04:39,540
And then, you know, we talk about people going in for these very early.

649
01:04:40,890 --> 01:04:44,340
It seems like not such a big deal right up here. They just go for colonoscopy every year.

650
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:48,510
Oh, I have a family history of colon cancer.

651
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:52,049
Not to this extent, but I started having people ask if I was 30.

652
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:55,710
I'm like, let me tell you, it is zero fun and it's really tough.

653
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:59,430
Right. So how many people know what goes into a colonoscopy?

654
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:04,350
A little bit like you've been you your parents have told you it sucks kind of a thing.

655
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:08,189
So you go, you have to do the prep, right?

656
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:12,780
So the prep is you have to drink this stuff that cleans out your colon.

657
01:05:12,780 --> 01:05:16,499
We all know how that occurs. You also can't like actually know anything for 24 hours.

658
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,430
It's like a clear liquid diet of 24 hours before, which is also zero fun.

659
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:27,660
So you go to this, you go to the pharmacy because they a lot of times, though, it's a prescription for this prep.

660
01:05:28,440 --> 01:05:31,950
And I actually went the first time I went to the drive through like, no, you have to come in.

661
01:05:31,950 --> 01:05:34,230
It's too big to fit in. The thing I'm like, Right.

662
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:39,840
And so I went in and they pulled out this like just it's literally like it's bigger than a milk jug.

663
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,739
It's like this big powder in the bottom of your foot, water in it, and, like, shake it up and that's your prep.

664
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,280
And you have to drink all of this over like a four hour period.

665
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:52,139
Like every 15 minutes you drink eight ounces of it and then you don't want to go anywhere.

666
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:57,240
It tastes horrible. It's like salt water, basically. They give you like a little lemon packet to put in it.

667
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:04,230
Like that helps. It doesn't help when when you guys have to do the sun, make it cold, get a straw,

668
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:10,320
put it way back in your mouth and just chug soda goes down your throat without actually touching your tongue as much as possible.

669
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,639
That is my advice to you. Next, the lemon packet.

670
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:18,450
Because it's a lie. It's just a lie. It does not help. So.

671
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:26,400
Yeah, so I mean, that's no fun, right? But like, imagine that you don't have a job with flexible hours.

672
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:32,460
Imagine you have like a cash register job, right? And you if you don't work, you don't get paid.

673
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:40,070
So you're definitely not working during the prep because that is not a public restroom kind of a situation.

674
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:46,950
Trust me, that is at home with your own toilet situation and then, you know,

675
01:06:46,950 --> 01:06:52,440
so you're taking that day off before you can't work the day off because you are going in and you're getting like sedation, right?

676
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:56,280
Somebody else has to take a day off, by the way, because they will not give you.

677
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:01,390
Is it the University of Michigan Hospital? When you walk in, they say, hey, where's your driver?

678
01:07:01,410 --> 01:07:06,810
Are they over 18? And they have to be there and like sign a thing like, I'm the driver, I'm over 18.

679
01:07:07,620 --> 01:07:11,639
And then they also hand your driver like little, you know, like at restaurants.

680
01:07:11,640 --> 01:07:17,310
What about when your table is ready to give them one of those for you for when you're done with your colonoscopy?

681
01:07:17,310 --> 01:07:21,600
I guess. And they have to because they can go to the, you know, cafeteria or whatever,

682
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:27,149
but then they have to come back so they get a little machine and then they have to drive you home.

683
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:33,060
So that other person also has to take a day off work. So if you're if this is your spouse, you have to arrange childcare.

684
01:07:33,240 --> 01:07:35,549
You have to arrange for that person to be off work.

685
01:07:35,550 --> 01:07:41,660
And you're missing like two and a half days of wages if you're working a job that doesn't have my mom.

686
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:46,950
Plus, I'll tell you, it's not a great experience. It's not super fun.

687
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:52,320
And if you have to do it yearly, you're like, Oh, my God, didn't I just do that why?

688
01:07:52,330 --> 01:07:57,030
We're doing this again? So it feels like it must feel like you're constantly doing this, right?

689
01:07:57,030 --> 01:08:02,700
It's no, it's even in the best case scenario, it's not it's not a good time to do a cause every year.

690
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:07,120
So. And to look forward to about 20 years.

691
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:13,520
That's fine. 25 years. But it's better than it's better than getting colon cancer.

692
01:08:14,210 --> 01:08:17,420
I will say that I would rather do that than a colon cancer. So.

693
01:08:17,990 --> 01:08:21,180
So I do. All right.

694
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:31,450
Any questions? US all.

695
01:08:32,940 --> 01:08:36,840
There is a governing body that recommends reading your reading.

696
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:42,780
Insurance companies are required to cover them and that. Affordable Care Act will some.

697
01:08:44,390 --> 01:08:50,850
Yes. But if you don't have health insurance, that's it's not a couple hundred dollars kind of situation.

698
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:55,190
Right. It's anesthesia and outpatient surgery kind of situation.

699
01:08:55,190 --> 01:09:03,020
Right. Yeah. So they're not as good.

700
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:09,600
So they do have out at home test. They're mostly studying, looking for people with cold blood.

701
01:09:09,730 --> 01:09:14,230
So there is a people a blood test that you can test, but that is looking for blood in the stool.

702
01:09:14,470 --> 01:09:21,580
And if you have blood in the stool, you already have a fairly at least a very advanced problem and not a cancer that's bleeding.

703
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:26,920
Right. The ideal situation and if you have a positive activity, what is the next step?

704
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:32,420
You have to go to colonoscopy, right? Because they got to get in there and see what's bleeding.

705
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:42,680
So it doesn't always help. They're also looking for like at home stool DNA tests, looking for like cancer, DNA and stool.

706
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:47,180
I don't think those are I don't know. It might be Cologuard.

707
01:09:47,370 --> 01:09:50,660
It might be the thing that might be a fecal blood test or it might be a DNA test.

708
01:09:51,110 --> 01:09:56,780
So those are not as good. And if they're positive, the next thing you have to do is colonoscopy anyway.

709
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:02,450
So if you have good insurance, you might as well go in for the colonoscopy, because then if they find a policy, they can take it out.

710
01:10:02,450 --> 01:10:07,550
And presumably they're going to find something a bit earlier with a colonoscopy.

711
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:14,750
Right. But like at a population health level, a public health perspective,

712
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:19,550
porn has to be a hard sell for a lot of people because it's expensive, because you have to take off work.

713
01:10:19,850 --> 01:10:24,120
Not everybody can do it. It isn't accessible for everybody. So that is certainly better than nothing.

714
01:10:24,140 --> 01:10:30,440
Right. We definitely want people to do that. If they can't do the ME Sigmoidoscopy is the other one that people talk about.

715
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:37,100
I mean, to do the thing like a the colon goes all the way around. Right. And so the colonoscopy goes all the way through.

716
01:10:37,430 --> 01:10:44,600
I don't actually know if I'm doing this the right direction. I always forget. But the colonoscopy will go around the bend and look at the whole colon.

717
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:47,630
Sigmoidoscopy only goes up to the back. Right.

718
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:51,829
So for the people with that BP, that's perfectly fine because they're going to get polyps everywhere.

719
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:59,900
If they're going to get them, you're going to find them with the sigmoidoscopy. But you still have to do colon prep like it doesn't save you much.

720
01:11:01,010 --> 01:11:09,140
If you're going to do it, go for the gold because you've already drunk the nasty stuff and sat on the toilet for 8 hours and not eaten anything.

721
01:11:09,470 --> 01:11:12,740
So like, why not just have somebody who can actually do the whole thing?

722
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:19,070
The why not is that you need a more trained person.

723
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:20,719
If people are untrained, you can.

724
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:29,980
There's a very small risk of like perforating the colon, particularly going around that band so the sigmoidoscopy can be done in the doctor's office.

725
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:34,070
But from my perspective, from most people's perspective, the worst part is the prep.

726
01:11:34,910 --> 01:11:38,850
So you might as well. Do the whole thing.

727
01:11:38,870 --> 01:11:46,290
If you're going to do it. And that is colon cancer screening.

728
01:11:48,110 --> 01:11:51,500
Not fine, but better than cancer. That's my that's my final reading.

729
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:57,850
Zero stars. All right.

730
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:17,570
Any other questions? Yeah. I don't think it's actually dangerous.

731
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:20,730
So the question is, is it dangerous to have this coolness barrier?

732
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:25,880
I suppose that there is a very small risk of things like perforation of colon or bleeding if they have to take polyps out.

733
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:32,390
So there's some increased risk. I mean, you know, you you take on that risk every time, but it's very small,

734
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,690
particularly if you go to someplace where they do this on a regular basis.

735
01:12:36,350 --> 01:12:40,730
So I don't think that there's a huge risk now for people.

736
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:47,780
There is a concern for like imaging tests for like for breast cancer, for example, for people who have rapid one or two mutations.

737
01:12:48,050 --> 01:12:51,140
Getting a mammogram every year actually irradiate the breast.

738
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:59,209
So if you're already at high risk and then you're going to irradiate the breast every year, that might actually be increasing the risk of cancer.

739
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:05,030
So that's why they do MRI's, for example, instead of mammograms for part of the reason that they would do an MRI instead of a mammogram.

740
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:12,260
So that's part of that, but not so much for the call because it's literally just like a physical exam of the bone.

741
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:20,920
It's just no fun. Questions.

742
01:13:23,330 --> 01:13:26,630
All right, everybody, go eat solid food. Enjoy not being on a liquid diet.

743
01:13:32,620 --> 01:13:35,890
Oh, I think there's another. Am I correct that there is another?
