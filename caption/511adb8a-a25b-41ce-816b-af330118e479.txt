1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,920
Okay. So welcome to lecture seven at 636.

2
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,670
What are you talking about? Cancer survival. Cancer survival modeling.

3
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,719
This has traditionally not been a part of Episodes 36,

4
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:22,980
but I think it's an important thing that I wanted to add this year because it brings

5
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,559
in a couple of things that don't always get covered in survival analysis classes.

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
I'll be curious to see at the end, This is us.

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,520
I've seen this stuff before or not, and gives us a chance to work with another type of cancer data.

8
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,040
So let's dove in here. So who's had some survival analysis before?

9
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:59,560
Okay. Half the people. So the idea behind survival analysis is trying to understand time to invest data in the context of cancer.

10
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:03,130
That means what age does cancer occur?

11
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,590
Or perhaps how long does one live after cancer is diagnosed?

12
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:16,860
That's what we usually mean in terms of cancer survival. But there are other outcomes as well, such as recurrence after treatment.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,470
So we might ask how long after treatment? Until cancer.

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,080
And so there are multiple questions that we can ask in the context of survival analysis.

15
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:34,150
And much of what we're going to do later in the class in weeks, eight, nine,

16
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:40,570
ten is going to be thinking about this first question of when does what age does cancer occur?

17
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:48,310
Today, we're going to be thinking more about that, more traditional cancer survival context of how long does one live after cancer is diagnosed.

18
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:56,830
So the outcome of this data may variously be called failure time or survival time or event time.

19
00:01:57,250 --> 00:02:01,780
And I'll tend to use these interchangeably. Hopefully that's not too confusing.

20
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:09,670
One important part of working with survival data the data are censored.

21
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:19,690
If we know that an event has not happened at a certain time, typically, but we don't know if or when the event might ever happen.

22
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:33,490
So in the context of a cancer recurrence, for example, if somebody dies from another cause, that's a cardiovascular disease after their treatment.

23
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,430
We don't they're never going to have their cancer.

24
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,860
SE But we don't know when it would have happened, if it would have happened had they lived.

25
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:51,790
And so this type of censoring is a hallmark of survival analysis.

26
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:59,970
And the survival function is one of the sort of and more important concepts.

27
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:05,520
It's the idea of the probability that you survive until time t.

28
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:14,490
So if big T is a random number, you know, at the time of the actual event here, we'll say cancer death after diagnosis.

29
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:19,800
Then what's the probability that that death happens after a certain time?

30
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:29,160
So as to the safety will have to decrease over time as let's say months after diagnosis.

31
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:38,430
So for this cancer, let's say that after two months, 37% of people have not died.

32
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:45,140
QUESTION Why is it 90? Um.

33
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,160
Yeah. So if the, um.

34
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,180
If you died before, you can't, um. Die, essentially.

35
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,410
So events that have happened can't be taken back.

36
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:14,620
And that's why it's also capped at one because you can't have more than a 100% chance of not dying at a certain time.

37
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,600
Right. So the properties are that it's smooth as to be a non increasing function and that's what we were just talking about.

38
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:29,920
And everyone's alive or no, that's happened at time zero and eventually.

39
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:36,640
Uh oh. All events have to happen at some point.

40
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:47,050
This one we can play around a little bit. Um, I think I added curve models to this and that kind of plays around with that assumption a little bit.

41
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,070
Okay.

42
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:55,000
But there are multiple different shapes that there are other functions that take this kind of more exponential decrease shape that's fairly common.

43
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:03,340
But you could also have that it's that there's a it's not sort of like exponentially distributed,

44
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,530
but maybe gamma distributed so that it takes it some time before the event start happening.

45
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,270
A lot of them happen around the median time and then you have an actor.

46
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:23,200
So they're all kind of chunked around a certain time. Perhaps even more important than the survival function to our purposes is the hazard function.

47
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:28,210
And although it looks a little bit scary, it's actually fairly straightforward.

48
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,720
It's the idea of the instantaneous rate of the event, given that no event has happened yet.

49
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:43,180
And so when we think about it, it's the probability of happening in the next Delta T time given that you're still alive.

50
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,100
Okay. And this limit over the T, that's just the idea of the.

51
00:05:51,790 --> 00:06:01,270
As we will see. I'm not sure how much we go into it today, but in the case of cancer occurrence or cancer incidence,

52
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:06,460
the hazard function importantly corresponds to age specific incidence.

53
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:12,730
And so this is what we're going to throughout the rest of the term, be connecting our data to.

54
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:20,630
Um, another sort of important sort of piece of function is this idea of cumulative hazard.

55
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:24,410
And that's just the accumulated risk up to the threat type point.

56
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:31,110
So you just integrate the hazard up to time, t. Survival has a continual hazard.

57
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,830
All have relationships here.

58
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:42,540
This, I think, is useful to have and don't necessarily expect you to like memorize it or anything.

59
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:52,740
But if we kind of go through bit by bit, this first step is taking advantage of the definition of conditional probability.

60
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:56,340
So we take that conditional and divide by the point already that happened.

61
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:03,030
Recognize that the top is actually a difference in survival functions from T and T.

62
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,620
Actually you I have this backwards b t plus delta t minus s of t.

63
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:14,610
Oh, no. Excuse me. This is correct. They look backwards, and that's why we get this negative here.

64
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:23,490
But essentially this becomes the negative derivative of survival over survival, which is the derivative of the life of survival.

65
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:35,220
It's a little bit may feel a little tortured, but it is an important quantity.

66
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:44,310
If we know any one of survival or cumulative hazard or hazard, we can find the other ones because they're all intimately connected.

67
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:54,140
And so the so often we'll say overfitting the hazard data, but that tells us survival.

68
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:03,130
Two questions at this point is I sort of just I'm going to put a bunch of stuff on the screen.

69
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,290
Feel free to come back and look at it later. We won't necessarily dove into necessarily all the details.

70
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:16,840
Since I'm not in this course, we're going to mostly be focusing on using the end outputs of things as opposed to focusing.

71
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:22,420
Maybe for more stats perspective on the theory behind it. But I still want you to have access to the theory.

72
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,220
Okay. So that's survival and hazard.

73
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,600
What does survival data look like? In general, there are two pieces of information that we need.

74
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:42,310
The time and the nature of the event and time is that time of the failure event or it's the time of sense, right?

75
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:48,640
Essentially the idea that someone is no longer being followed beyond due to an ineligibility,

76
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:56,100
perhaps they've died of other causes, or perhaps because they've dropped out of being followed by something.

77
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:03,700
Now we just need to denote whether that event is a failure event or a sensory event, as we'll see later.

78
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,770
We may also want to account for multiple types of events. Okay.

79
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:14,470
So how do we estimate survival from surviving theta?

80
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:22,240
Um, the typical non parametric estimate here is the kaplan-meier function in which you can be familiar with already.

81
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:29,500
And I think I have some examples of we also will. Sometimes these parametric estimates are so an exponential function.

82
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,770
Why go gamma like normal? These are all fairly typical choices for survival.

83
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,900
Sure. So what is this kaplan-meier estimate that I mentioned?

84
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:46,930
Again, it looks a little ugly, but it is fairly straightforward.

85
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:57,070
The idea is, at any time point at which we observe an event, we see how many events happened at that time and how many people are left at risk.

86
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:02,680
And so this whole thing tells me how many people are left alive.

87
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:10,450
And then I just product it because again, you don't become alive again after being there.

88
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:19,120
Frequently, the event can't be taken back. And so, for example, I might say and assume one, there's one event and 100 people left.

89
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,530
So the survival at time one is about 99% of time too.

90
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:40,300
Um, there is, there were two events and so the survival function is, uh, one minus two over 99 times what it was before.

91
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:47,920
So point 99 times point 97. And then there are no events, but there's a censoring at times three.

92
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:54,130
So I lose. Um, there are no events.

93
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,980
Uh, today somebody one drop out at time three.

94
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:07,460
So, um. Right.

95
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:12,160
So there's no change, no change in the survival. We just are losing information.

96
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:21,070
So we have these tick marks. What we have in our survival data that typically denotes censoring events, which there's no change in hazard.

97
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:28,840
But at the next timestamp, we have to account for there being fewer people that could have the event.

98
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:35,559
And so it could be what that means here. And these two sort of couple of miners is that we're looking to see if there's

99
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:41,980
a difference in how survival changes over time for one group versus another.

100
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:46,450
In this case, um, people would see neighbors as people with degree.

101
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:58,190
And a parametric. This is an example of the waning of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.

102
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,980
Here they've plotted. I think it was actually just an exponential that I don't remember on my head,

103
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:11,000
this dotted line, which is just a exponential survival curve on top of the Kaplan-Meier.

104
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:16,130
How many people are no longer having antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 over time?

105
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:28,830
A common question that we like to ask in the context of survival is how do you compare survival between two different groups?

106
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:35,250
And the challenge is that it's hard to compare survival directly because survival is kind of a weird function.

107
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:41,460
It's bounded between zero and one. It's not discrete, not increasing.

108
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:48,690
And the comparison really depends on where you're at within the curve.

109
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:53,400
So what we do instead is compare hazard rates.

110
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:57,420
So at any given time you're saying, what's my risk?

111
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:00,330
And that's the idea of hazard. What's my risk?

112
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:09,480
Given that I still live at this point, the common assumption is to make the assumption of proportional hazards.

113
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:15,380
So if the hazard are proportional between groups for some set of covariance affects,

114
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:20,340
so you have some baseline hazard that may be parametric, maybe non parametric.

115
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:30,450
But what we really are interested in is how is this sort of coefficient on the baseline hazard that depends on the quote variance.

116
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:42,360
And so the x an exponential of this value beta is the log hazard ratio.

117
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,190
So this should actually just be hazard ratio. Beta is the log hazard ratio.

118
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:52,980
Exponential beta is the hazard ratio for the covariate X versus some referent group.

119
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:58,860
So if X is one we're left with, hazard is based on hazard times,

120
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:06,270
exponential beta and if X is zero, the reference hazard is the baseline hazard times one.

121
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:18,870
Just the baseline. And so what this might look like here again in the context of winning cites, conviction, positivity.

122
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:28,229
Here are again the kaplan-meier curves for asymptomatic versus clinical people who are asymptomatic.

123
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:30,240
COVID versus clinical COVID.

124
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:42,480
How their antibodies wane differently with the proportional hazards assumption of the hazard being proportional to which other?

125
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:56,740
Questions at this point. This is these are kind of the the introduction their whole courses on survival analysis.

126
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:03,190
Just try and give you the previous of introductions here.

127
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,480
Yes. How is that proportional hazards assumption playing out in this curve here?

128
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:17,360
Yeah. So it's a little bit hard to see directly, but I do on this and I have to I'll do homework.

129
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:27,700
So they're saying that if I can remember that's a T we're actually.

130
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:38,180
Probably so. Forgive me if I am just a little bit incorrect, but, um.

131
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:45,760
So as a T or an exponential it is one minus two minus lambda here.

132
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:53,640
So the hazard only lambda E2 minus lambda t.

133
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:18,100
And so what we would be saying is that for asymptomatic is lambda zero to the -50 and for clinical you have lambda zero times some parameter,

134
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:31,800
let's say theta, you might have to take related data to be more consistent with what I had slides ago.

135
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:37,290
Okay. So how are we seeing that in the graph?

136
00:16:37,460 --> 00:17:02,540
Right. So then what we would do is. Use this expression and say, okay, so as t is the exponential integral -0 to t lambda not the minus lambda t.

137
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:11,870
Oh yeah. I understand how to make the curve. Just I'm asking like what what part of like how is proportionality like expressed in the,

138
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,130
like like are they like, how are the lines, the relationship between the lines?

139
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:23,330
Right. So the point I'm trying to make here, so if this is for asymptomatic and this is for clinical.

140
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:43,300
In general, it's very hard to tell, particularly if you have a parametric asset in non parametric baseline.

141
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:56,320
Okay. Um, in this case, probably, um, just even the beta can come out in some way and that way maybe the survival curves are proportional.

142
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:06,730
But that's really a particular, um, that's very particular to the assumption of exponential survival in general.

143
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:12,190
What you'd have to do is plot the hazards and see that they're proportional.

144
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,990
Okay. Because that's part of that's part of why survival is difficult to work with.

145
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:23,560
Because, yeah, there is this strange exponential of an integral of the thing that we get from.

146
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:29,940
Okay. So you can't really tell. Correct?

147
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:33,420
No, it's very hard to tell just by looking at the graphs.

148
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:43,290
Okay. You can tell that they're different, but it's not always easy to tell whether they're proportional or not.

149
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:47,490
Oftentimes, I will say people just are like they're proportional without actually checking.

150
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,640
And that's called Cox Proportional Hazards Modeling, which we will talk about a little bit.

151
00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:00,320
And then at the end, we're gonna talk about what you do when they're not proportional. They usually include giveaways.

152
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,520
If they cross that, they're yes, that's a particularly particular giveaway.

153
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,360
Is that crossing curves means oh, definitely not proportional.

154
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:12,510
Yeah, great. All right.

155
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:22,920
So this is something that I think often does not get covered in typical survival analysis, but is extremely important in the context of cancer.

156
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:32,880
So in our simple survival models, we're basically being like, you're alive until your death, okay?

157
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:42,090
But that doesn't really capture what's going on here because maybe you're alive and you die,

158
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:48,960
but maybe there's an intermediate condition that happens before you die in certain cases.

159
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,430
And then if you have this intermediate condition, your your your risk of death is very different.

160
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,820
So if you don't take that into account, that's really kind of messing up your inference around.

161
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:12,360
The these pieces of mechanism in the context of cancer were particularly interested in death from different causes because you may die of your cancer.

162
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,780
But many people that have cancer are older,

163
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:26,610
have comorbid conditions and are much more likely to die of other causes than than sort of the average person.

164
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,850
And we really need to take that into account or we're going to mess them things up.

165
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,780
So what? So and I'll show that example.

166
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,770
So what happens if we treat everyone who has an event other than the one of interest as sensitive?

167
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,640
So that means you have cancer.

168
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:55,260
We're waiting to see how long you live. Um, also, forgive me for being somewhat cavalier about talking about cancer death.

169
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:04,440
It's very hard to, to to do that in this very kind of statistical context.

170
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:11,640
But I want to acknowledge to you that it is a difficult and challenging and emotional.

171
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:25,000
Her. So, so forgive me for being removed from that somewhat in this context.

172
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,970
Um, the idea we might just say we only care about death due to cancer,

173
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:37,120
and if you die due to cardiovascular disease, for example, then we're just going to consider you censored.

174
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:46,030
You dropped out of the study. And so what we would do is we would do our normal kaplan-meier estimate here and we say, okay,

175
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,250
as we go along, how many people died of their cancer and how many people were at risk of their cancer?

176
00:21:51,980 --> 00:22:03,250
Okay. But if we do this, we're implicitly saying that we're no longer observing them, but they could still have the event.

177
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:10,430
So the idea of censoring is very specifically like we're no longer following you, but the event could still happen.

178
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:17,300
And if and if we're in this context of multiple types of death, that is no longer true.

179
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:28,850
And you will overestimate the deaths, the number of events, for example, the deaths due to cause one.

180
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,860
So what happens if we take an actual multi-stage approach?

181
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:40,280
So in this case, we use a different estimate called the Alan Hansen estimate.

182
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:48,260
And the idea is that we're trying to find not necessarily survival, but the probability of being in each state,

183
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:56,240
survival with just the possibility of being alive or a probability that now is the probability of being alive.

184
00:22:56,270 --> 00:23:05,659
Probability of being dead from cause one so that if it doesn't constitute acceptable and we'll explain a little bit more than second,

185
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:11,330
but it's a similar idea of taking the product of all the things that happened before,

186
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:21,770
but have now this transition matrix such that we have this familiar form from the familiar.

187
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:32,780
Um, but there's also we have to take into account transitions to the fraction that stay alive, fraction that have died.

188
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:39,680
And, and I've forgotten what these represent. But this is the correct estimate.

189
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,170
And what we'll do is we'll find cumulative incidence for each outcome separately.

190
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,800
So we had this is very similar to our cumulative hazard,

191
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:04,670
but we have to account now for both survival to any end point and the incidence of the outcome separately.

192
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:13,490
I did put some reading up on canvas to kind of dove more into the technical aspects here.

193
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:14,090
Again,

194
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:21,830
I'm going to cover this at a very high level to be a little bit careful because the incidence does not mean the same thing as cumulative hazard,

195
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,250
although we often say incidents and hazard are interchangeable.

196
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:32,180
So this is kind of one of these like horrifying biases to go on technical term nightmares.

197
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:37,920
So just to be a little bit careful about that. So incidence equals hazard.

198
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,200
A cumulative incidence does not equal to that of hazard. Okay.

199
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:50,670
So we talked about this already. Why do I care for cancer? People with cancer tend to be older, net morbidities and may die of other causes.

200
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:57,870
And this is not just theoretical. This actually makes a big difference for how you estimate cancer.

201
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:08,340
And this is for head and neck. If I treat deaths from other causes as sensory, then I'll save one way.

202
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:15,450
Let me take a step back for a second. The way that you read cumulative incidence plots is usually kind of flipped from how we think about survival.

203
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:18,840
Survival starts at one and kind of goes down here.

204
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,390
We think about everyone starting as alive and see the proportion of the other states as increasing.

205
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,500
So the same idea just we flip our y axis a bit.

206
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,070
So this is the proportion that have died due to cancer and this is the proportion that are alive.

207
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:42,450
But what we actually need to do is account for deaths from other causes as a separate state.

208
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:53,100
And as you can see, there's actually a very substantial fraction up to not maybe more than a quarter, less than a third here by 15 years.

209
00:25:53,550 --> 00:26:07,260
And although it hasn't made a hugely important difference, but you're off by a good five, 10% in your fraction have died by 15 years.

210
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:14,010
And probably that makes even more of a difference a little bit earlier on t by one or two years, right?

211
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:17,160
25%. Whereas up here it's that like 30%.

212
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:24,090
That's a pretty big difference when it comes to talking about thousands or tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of cancer cases.

213
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:32,790
Okay. So how does this translate into how we do our survival modeling?

214
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,560
Again, hazard rate is the rate of death conditional on the survival up to that point.

215
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:45,240
And from that proportional hazards assumptions, we have our hazard ratio,

216
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:51,840
which is how much faster or slower the rate of death is in some groups compared to the baseline.

217
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:58,110
Um, as I mentioned before, we often think about this in terms of what we call the Cox proportional hazards model.

218
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:06,780
And that's what I just put up over here. So do you have you have a baseline hazard times hazard ratio,

219
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:15,960
which is a function of some effects covariance with the covariance of just zero one, depending on which group you're in.

220
00:27:21,070 --> 00:27:30,459
What's nice about taking this hazard approach is that because hazards are instantaneous risks, we only care about who's at risk at any given time.

221
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:40,510
So we don't actually need to do anything special to to do our competing risk perspective.

222
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:47,230
If you only care about cancer death, for example, you can still do the same model,

223
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:55,540
proportional hazards model on cancer death, treating everything else as censored.

224
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:01,240
Right. But that that's true grit hazard. But it's not true for survival.

225
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:16,400
And I think the next page. That that in order to go from our separate hazards for each of the different types of death,

226
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,150
we need to be careful about how you turn those into survival.

227
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:32,629
So again, our Alan Hansen estimate, there is this probability of being in each state as the integral of the incidence times,

228
00:28:32,630 --> 00:28:46,160
the overall survival, while the overall survival is given by the sum of the hazards integrated and exponentially added.

229
00:28:48,140 --> 00:29:06,200
And so what I the takeaway that I want you to be aware of here is that we don't typically actually go as far as doing this.

230
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:17,780
In a lot of our work, because we we don't, for example, necessarily need a parametric version in each of these curves.

231
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,090
We're not necessarily trying to reproduce this diagram. This diagram just comes to us from the data.

232
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:30,980
But what we do want is to know the proportional hazard of death for different groups.

233
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:40,730
That's usually what we're focusing on. And so the point here is that we can still do our Cox proportional hazards models on cancer specific deaths.

234
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,510
But if we wanted to take those and make the actual survival, then you have to be careful.

235
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:55,070
So the point being is that you're the naive thing that we would want to do does work, that you have to be careful how it gets applied.

236
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:04,100
More. I think that will come into play again later in my lecture as well.

237
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:13,819
So the take away here, so models not always as simple as analyzing time to a single event of interest in the context of cancer.

238
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:21,740
We need to take that to the other causes into account. The car cuts, personal hazards models still can be used in the multistate framework,

239
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:27,049
but if you want to use them to calculate survival, then you have to be careful again.

240
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:31,820
The reading that I put on canvas will get a little bit more into technical details.

241
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:45,980
We pause there for questions. If not, let's talk about here, models.

242
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:55,050
So your models are accounting for the fact that after treatment, some people are actually cured.

243
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,930
They're no longer at risk of dying from cancer. The cancer will never come back.

244
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:07,260
However, we cannot know a priori if any individual is cured or not.

245
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:15,000
And so this very, very clear diagram is telling us that after treatment we have some unknown state,

246
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,720
we have some unobservable state where someone is cured or not cured.

247
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:29,190
They may die regardless of their cured or not cured, but only people that are not cured may recover their cancers.

248
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:33,690
But some of that's not cure. It may die before the recurrence.

249
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:44,010
And so we kind of need to take that into account in the way that we generally approach this is mixture models.

250
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:52,830
And mixture models are a way of saying that we have and our population is actually a mixture of populations.

251
00:31:53,250 --> 00:32:00,480
It's a population that won't die of cancer and a population that can die of cancer.

252
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:11,100
And so we have some survival fraction that accounts for the amount, and everybody else is subject to a survival function.

253
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:19,590
So we have here's our cure fraction. We're going to have an asymptote of our survival for everybody that was not here.

254
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,030
So this is where we're kind of getting back. In the beginning, I was saying that the survival functions have to go to zero.

255
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:34,380
As time goes to infinity, that's not true for cure models, but that would be true for this joint function.

256
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,680
Generally speaking, thermal estimation is not straightforward.

257
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:46,280
It's actually something I don't have a ton of experience.

258
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:54,010
And, um, but oftentimes you need kind of heavier statistical machinery, such as in algorithms.

259
00:32:55,340 --> 00:33:00,410
It's not I mean, it's certainly doable.

260
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,180
It just takes a little bit more figuring out.

261
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:11,480
Fortunately, A.I., which made your start, which made to End Point,

262
00:33:11,810 --> 00:33:19,670
does have another software called cancer that will fit those standards to our models and mixture care models for us.

263
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:23,840
So in this context of cancer, this is for the here.

264
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:31,790
They've taken the data and then the blue line is the excuse me, actual data.

265
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:42,030
And the red line is the cure fraction. The mixture model here, they're estimating the cure fraction is about 46%, something like.

266
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,310
We're not going to use cancer in this class. In fact, we're not going to do a ton with cancer survival.

267
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,640
But I have preloaded a bunch of code that will work on next week and last.

268
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,440
So you won't be doing a lot of coding,

269
00:33:56,710 --> 00:34:04,300
but you'll be using code that I provide for you because we are mostly working on Cox Proportional hazards models.

270
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:09,100
Okay. So let's cure models again.

271
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:17,330
I didn't want to get into too much detail, but I want you to at least be aware of them as something that tip that does show up in the cancer context.

272
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:27,440
The last thing we're going to focus on is time varying effects, and this is how we break the proportional hazards assumption.

273
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:36,320
So we're really asking the question is, are the effects of covariate on risk constant over time?

274
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:49,250
And so in the Cox proportional hazards model, we assume that they are that that this proportionality is fixed and true and doesn't change over time.

275
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:57,829
And that's um, but McKinsey context, especially over longer periods of time,

276
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:05,390
we can't necessarily guarantee that that's going to be true, particularly when you have something like treatment.

277
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:12,530
And so in the first couple of months or years after treatment, you're more vulnerable to people that are maybe older,

278
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:17,780
are more likely to die than people who can younger and can bounce back from the treatment.

279
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:26,150
And so there are reasons to think that we want to be careful about making this assumption for cancer.

280
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:35,320
And so we're taking the proportional hazards assumption here,

281
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:43,360
which is saying that the coefficient is constant over time and we're moving to the context where that coefficient is no longer constant.

282
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:49,930
Over time it changes. And so this is one way to break proportional hazards.

283
00:35:52,700 --> 00:36:01,490
So how do we what do we do with this data? How do you specify how do you estimate them?

284
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:11,030
Well, that's challenging because functions in general are infinite dimensional and not easily subject to.

285
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:20,420
We're not usually subject to inference. So we're going to have to find some sort of continuous,

286
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:29,450
low dimensional but still flexible parametric form to estimate the true infinite dimensional function.

287
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:38,630
And one way to do that are spines. We saw spines in the context of h period cohort models.

288
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:44,960
And they'll come up again later in the semester. Um, I like spines, so that's what we're going to focus on.

289
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,720
Um, they're different types of spines typically in this context where you baselines.

290
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,780
But don't worry too much about the different types of coins.

291
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:59,840
Generally, again, we're thinking spines in a piecewise smooth polynomials, typically cubic polynomials.

292
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:07,459
And the way that we work with spines in this context is we start with a spine basis so

293
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:14,300
that these are some number of cubic functions that we split depending on our knots.

294
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:22,640
And we put some choose some coefficients that give us a linear combination of our spine basis

295
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:31,419
that give us kind of this a combination of being a sum of each of these functions times,

296
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:42,170
some coefficient. And as you change the coefficients, you change the importance of each of these underlying spine coefficients.

297
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:46,580
So you can see here that like this blue and pink lines, um,

298
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:55,610
have maybe not as much loading in their coefficients because they're not kind of pulling up the black line as much.

299
00:37:55,970 --> 00:38:02,510
Whereas the green line probably has a lot of loading because the curve matches the green line at least somewhat.

300
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:14,500
So the idea is let's find the coefficients that pull our black when your combination into the right shape that match the data.

301
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:23,690
Okay. Um, this is a little technical. Um, some choose the idea of choosing knots and spines.

302
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:28,820
Oftentimes, when you pick one degree of freedom for every 5 to 10 years,

303
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,900
and then you can think either do you want evenly spaced knots or do you want them spread according to like a frequency of events?

304
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,720
So here these are evenly spaced,

305
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:49,460
and on the right we have changed where the peaks are so that we acknowledge that in cancer a lot of the deaths happened in the first year.

306
00:38:49,670 --> 00:39:00,350
So we want a lot of flexibility in our coefficient estimates and maybe there's fewer deaths later on and so we don't need as much flexibility.

307
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,610
So that's one that this one basis is doing as opposed to the one on the left.

308
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,549
And so what does it look like to have constant versus time varying effects?

309
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:20,630
So here this is time on the x axis and the hazard ratio for analogs here.

310
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,010
So again, the hazard ratio is this idea of E to the data.

311
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,800
And if we have proportional hazards or constant effects,

312
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:40,720
then the hazard ratio for females who is our referent is at one and the hazard ratio for males is a little bit lower and we're saying it's closer.

313
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:56,950
But if we allow time, varying effects, tagger and coefficients, then it could be that the initial difference is very great,

314
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:05,649
but it attenuates and is essentially gone by two years and this choice of high average

315
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:12,850
hazard is like trying to kind of like take how many events happened here that were faster.

316
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,720
And the fact that there's no differences here, kind of like smoothly average them.

317
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,929
So that's what our proportional hazards model is doing. That might be good enough,

318
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:30,880
but I think it actually is very meaningful to say that most of the sex differences for head and neck cancer happened in the first two years.

319
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,980
And why might that be and how different is that across different cancers?

320
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:44,710
Okay. So the thing that I want you to take away here is that the effects of covariance are not necessarily constant.

321
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:50,860
Over the period of interest, we can incorporate time varying effects into Cox proportional Heather's models.

322
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:59,770
Again, it gets a little bit tricky. I have made some code in the lab to be able to play around with it a little bit.

323
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:04,720
Slides are a popular choice, not the only choice, but that's why I like to work with.

324
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:11,260
I'll be a little bit careful because how you choose your knots will affect what your shapes look like.

325
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:17,320
Okay. So now I will pause for questions.

326
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:26,260
Yes. In the previous graph, what is the hazard ratio between males and females?

327
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:30,490
So you're you're not putting the hazard ratio ratios. You're finding the two separate hazards.

328
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:40,870
No, sorry. So this this this this is not the black line is not the hazard ratio for females.

329
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,950
Thing about it is the hazard ratio is for females against being female.

330
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,760
Okay. And so the red is for male versus female. Okay.

331
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:55,990
So we put I just don't know exactly. It's just it's just to say, like, what's the.

332
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:59,470
Yeah, the no effect. Okay. No effect with that one.

333
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:08,670
Yes, typically. So you say that your results depend on the cuts in inches?

334
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:09,150
Sure.

335
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:18,660
What's the way when you're writing a paper, presenting an analysis to kind of account for, you know, your choice versus what was kind of that process?

336
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:27,870
Yeah. So. It's like you have to kind of defend the choice you're doing.

337
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:32,400
Sensitivity analysis is great if you have the time and capacity.

338
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:40,110
I would say that there are fairly standard choices. Like I said here,

339
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:47,970
typically you want to space your knots out according to frequency of events and you want to essentially

340
00:42:47,970 --> 00:42:55,799
like have an it's one of these like like the adage of the Supreme Court knows what pornography looks like.

341
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:03,600
They can't define it. It's the same sort of thing here is that I know what a sufficient shape of spine is without it,

342
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,659
without being able to like always give you a specific answer.

343
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:14,729
So in this case, I'm like, this is kind of wavy, so that's probably not realistic.

344
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:21,060
So I might want more knots to be able to capture or if it's too or actually sorry,

345
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:26,550
typically it's to maybe I want fewer knots because I don't want to have quite so much, so many degrees of freedom.

346
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:33,270
And so there's a little bit of balance there on the plus side, I would say.

347
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:48,980
I typically think of this work as not being like this is the answer, but as opposed to like this is a gesture towards like what the effects look like.

348
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:55,880
It's hard to capture them directly. With this particular choice of basis, this is what it looks like you're going to kind of like.

349
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:02,000
So in here, it's like, how true is this little like debate?

350
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:12,110
I don't know. What we are going to do in the example is put confidence bounds on these and that can at least be helpful to do.

351
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:19,100
So there's not a like tried and true answer for what other people have done in the literature.

352
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:24,860
And let yourself be like, do what you need to convince yourself that it's kind of funny.

353
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:36,450
Other questions. Okay.

354
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:48,870
So I want to ask you. Sorry. Yes. Please give us a contract, like more specific contract between the 50 we want and we don't want.

355
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:58,420
Oh, yeah. Could you explain what you mean by that? Typically about divorce and premature.

356
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:14,580
Right. So. And it gets to that question as well.

357
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:23,560
So this is a hazard ratio then.

358
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:27,760
Like it's not super, you know,

359
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:37,750
you don't you don't typically want to have something that looks like this that's not particularly you're you're overfitting,

360
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:41,830
let's say right here, you're you're getting too many wiggles on the data.

361
00:45:41,830 --> 00:45:47,350
It's not really giving you the overall picture.

362
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:52,820
Um. So I think, again, it's.

363
00:45:54,930 --> 00:46:03,299
You could also imagine you doing kind of like a 48 transform to get some of sine waves to get your function.

364
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:06,660
That could also be a perfectly reasonable approach.

365
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:14,489
I like that less here because we're not doing the periodic function, so it's not necessarily a great choice in this context.

366
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:20,900
But there could be context in which it is good. Um, it's what I like sometimes.

367
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:25,590
Um, but like I for one, say for people who don't like spines.

368
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:31,470
One thing that you often see is like I'm plus Times Square.

369
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:44,760
That's a pretty typical, um, function. Or so when you're like three square and then you estimate a V and you get something that's like.

370
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:52,360
This maybe. I know, like, okay, it's pretty good.

371
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:58,630
It's not doing great. Like, Heil Hitler, but you're capturing the overall gestalt of this quadratic.

372
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:10,590
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. So, again, this is a different type of low dimensional beta.

373
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:17,370
My guess. What's the reason for your preference displays compared to other things that are out there?

374
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:25,440
It's just more common in the literature. I like swans for their flexibility and they they have a certain, like, elegance that I like.

375
00:47:26,490 --> 00:47:32,910
I find time plus Times Square. I do like incredibly inelegant and like, like, frankly, wrong.

376
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:38,549
Usually, like there's no real justification for it, I would say.

377
00:47:38,550 --> 00:47:47,160
And you can get a much better fit with two parameters with other options that but I also kind of get myself into trouble,

378
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,840
probably just like making that pronouncement. I'm sure they're perfectly reasonable times to use that.

379
00:47:51,840 --> 00:48:01,919
But um, one other thing I would say too is that, um, to be a little careful about how much data we have.

380
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,650
So like each percent square here might be fine because like there's no data back here.

381
00:48:08,310 --> 00:48:13,410
Um, and so really that where we do have data that we ask where we want to be fitting better.

382
00:48:17,290 --> 00:48:28,930
But that's also a good point that we really we want to have nice confidence intervals for our clients, but not next time, but for our hazard ratios.

383
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:38,620
There is a way to do that for spines. There's probably ways to do that, but even by kind of stimulation methods for other things.

384
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:44,230
But that's kind of a case by case basis, I would say.

385
00:48:48,020 --> 00:48:55,140
Other questions before we get into the example. Okay.

386
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:08,760
So this is from paper published a couple of years ago, but I think it's a nice example, both time varying effects and competing risks.

387
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:18,240
And it's going to be the basis for what you do in lab or this partially the basis for what you do in lab seven,

388
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:22,320
along with another paper that I have on canvas, but we're not going to talk about in the lecture.

389
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:29,040
So we've talked about head and neck cancer a couple of times, but just to refresh ourselves,

390
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,640
so HPV is responsible for an increasing fraction of that and others.

391
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:42,420
Traditionally, alcohol and tobacco use are also risk factors and and form a large fraction of cancers.

392
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:47,909
But let's see, I'm going to skip this.

393
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:54,960
We've talked about HIV before. HPV cancers, in fact, from multiple sites.

394
00:49:55,440 --> 00:50:08,429
Um, cervical cancer remains one of the highest sites, but due to the high number of oropharyngeal cancers,

395
00:50:08,430 --> 00:50:14,639
head and neck cancers, and then that head and neck has become HPV related.

396
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,320
Head and neck cancer has become the site of the most HPV associated cancers.

397
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,680
And so often Joe is kind of back on the radar.

398
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:31,710
We talked about two main etiologies, um, head and neck overall.

399
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:40,500
Um, there hasn't been too much of a change that this belies underlying increases in HPV positive head and neck

400
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:48,900
cancers or differentials specifically here and the decrease in smoking and alcohol or non HPV related cancers.

401
00:50:49,710 --> 00:50:57,930
And the reason we care about this, you know, if only because in addition to caring about how the trends are changing,

402
00:50:58,410 --> 00:51:06,210
HPV related head and neck cancer actually has a much better prognosis for survival than unrelated.

403
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,290
Um, there's lots of research sort of thinking about why that is.

404
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,190
There's a really a big difference in the survival probabilities.

405
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:23,050
And so the goal of this work that I'm going to show you now is to think about the time,

406
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:31,450
the effects of an atomic site and atomic site being a proxy for HPV type,

407
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:35,800
because most head and neck cancers HPV related are in their appearance,

408
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:42,700
whereas the ones in the oral cavity and hyper pharynx similarities tend to not be related to the taste.

409
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:50,559
So we're going to think about how an atomic site affects survival as well as age sex race.

410
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,620
Here, we're just going to do black and white due to the.

411
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:01,240
Constraints of thier market tumor stage.

412
00:52:01,450 --> 00:52:06,970
Tumor stage always has a really big impact on cancer survival and year of diagnosis.

413
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:22,190
So again, our overall survival depends on both our cancer specific survival and our all other cause mortality.

414
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:25,350
So we have this idea of that cancer death from other causes.

415
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:34,310
In this dataset, we started with 180,000 people 15 years down, 80,000 of them have died of their cancer.

416
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,930
60,000 have died of other causes, and 40,000 are still alive.

417
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,110
Again, we're not trying to reproduce this survival cumulative incidence plot.

418
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:54,930
We're trying to think about how death from cancer and perhaps death from other causes is impacted by the covariance.

419
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,230
So I think this is similar to the side that we saw before.

420
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,390
So we're having our Cox proportional hazards model, except instead of proportional hazards,

421
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:13,300
we have time dependent effects and we're going to use spines to model those.

422
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:33,399
And so here we're looking at the fraction that have died of their cancer as a function of the tumor stage that's already here.

423
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:40,150
So we see localized tumors have a much better survival, much less a smaller fraction of died from cancer.

424
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:44,740
Many more have died if they were diagnosed at a regional stage.

425
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:54,520
So it's in their lymph nodes. Um, and distant is metastasis and so much lower survival probability.

426
00:53:56,110 --> 00:53:59,230
Um, so we're being a little bit careful here.

427
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:03,310
This is probably overkill, to be honest.

428
00:54:03,670 --> 00:54:08,560
Um, we recognize that these underlying hazards are not proportional.

429
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:14,080
And so we're actually going to say that each of them have different baseline hazards.

430
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:21,160
So instead of having, um, they all have the same lambda, not based on hazard,

431
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:27,010
depending on whether they're diagnosed at local, regional or just to have a different one.

432
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,070
That's a little bit of a technical grade.

433
00:54:31,330 --> 00:54:36,940
And Jeremy Taylor and I are kind of go back and forth between whether we think that this is necessary or not.

434
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:45,999
Um, instead of this, you could just account for survival as another coefficient potentially because their

435
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,720
time varying then that will kind of take care of an underlying baseline hazard.

436
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:59,229
So it's a choice. Okay. So we know that people with or against cancer have smaller hazard,

437
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:07,360
so better survival than other sites, but the fraction of patients who die of their cancer is similar.

438
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:11,710
So on the left of we're looking at the fraction of people who have died from their cancer.

439
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:19,959
These are all pretty similar, right? Um, but what we see,

440
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:31,750
if we look at just the relative rate of cancer specific death oropharynx has a lower hazard than both oral cavity and type of pharynx larynx.

441
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,750
Um, which are both above above ones may have higher hazards more likely to die.

442
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:45,910
So how can this be? We know that they are less likely to die of their cancer, but there is no difference in who has died of the cancer.

443
00:55:47,020 --> 00:55:50,470
What do you think is going on? What are we missing here?

444
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:24,640
So what is our competing risk? Other calls consider.

445
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:34,420
Right. So this suggests that perhaps other cause death depends on your anatomical side.

446
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:42,519
And in fact, that is true. So this is the oh, this is not simply cancer specific.

447
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,450
This is other cause death and the cause of death.

448
00:56:46,930 --> 00:56:56,620
The likelihood of death from non or pharynx cancer is higher than than for oropharynx cancer as this is an across the board.

449
00:56:57,250 --> 00:57:01,450
And why is this? Because those other cancers are caused by smoking.

450
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:11,470
Smoking has a lot of other comorbidities. You are likely to die of macular disease or other other things.

451
00:57:11,860 --> 00:57:21,310
So although at first glance we might have thought that the site of your cancer shouldn't affect your chances of dying from other causes,

452
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,720
it turns out that the fraction who have died of other causes is very different.

453
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:33,220
So put that together with the fraction of die from cancer and all of a sudden there's no difference.

454
00:57:33,940 --> 00:57:41,259
Those that have died from their cancer because there are more people alive to die from the

455
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:48,340
cancer of oropharynx cancer because they did not die from their smoking related disease.

456
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:54,670
So even though they're less likely to die of cancer, given the same underlying population,

457
00:57:55,270 --> 00:58:01,720
because there are more people who live oropharynx cancer and fewer people alive from non or cancer,

458
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:05,260
it turns out that the number of people who have died is similar.

459
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,600
Does that make sense? It's a little bit of a twister there.

460
00:58:19,550 --> 00:58:23,390
Well, think about it and let me know if you have questions.

461
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:28,020
So. That's that piece.

462
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:37,500
So now we can ask how our demographic bearing or covariates impact our hazard.

463
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:44,520
So on the top row here, we have the cumulative incidence of death.

464
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:53,069
So the probability, the fraction of died of cancer is a function of age, sex and race in the body.

465
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:58,920
And we have the hazard ratios, time varying hazard ratios for cancer specific death.

466
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:06,870
That's what we see. So let's go to sex again. We have this little dip right after.

467
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:12,000
So, you know, I we have we don't know exactly why that is.

468
00:59:12,330 --> 00:59:22,649
Is that a response to treatment? Is it that men have mostly had female partners and they're better at taking care of their

469
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:26,610
male partners than their male partners are taking their female character or their spouses?

470
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:31,140
In this context, your question.

471
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:45,450
I just returned. Okay. So there's potentially a care disparity here and you just fairly clear where older people have higher hazard.

472
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:50,400
So the referent here is 70 plus and we kind of go down as we go.

473
00:59:51,510 --> 01:00:00,300
This initial blip is largely probably due to the impacts of surgical or other treatment.

474
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:04,920
Um, which people that are 70 plus are the least likely to survive.

475
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:11,489
Um, the racial disparity seems like it persists over the time period.

476
01:00:11,490 --> 01:00:16,710
Unlike the sex disparity, maybe it attenuates a little bit, but that does persist.

477
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,960
And then we see that survival has improved over time.

478
01:00:26,430 --> 01:00:35,470
So here the fraction who have died that were diagnosed before 1984, 1984, 1985, between 1985 and 2000, 2000, 2015.

479
01:00:35,490 --> 01:00:39,600
So the fraction who have died is kind of decreasing a little bit. It's not huge, but it's a little bit.

480
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:53,910
And that is shown here in the hazards of the cancer specific that the people who were diagnosed at 30,000 are the least likely to die,

481
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:58,500
have the lowest hazard rate, particularly immediately after.

482
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:02,790
So is this due to improved treatment?

483
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:11,550
That's probably our primary idea that over time we've gotten better at treating cancer.

484
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:18,130
Well, let's. We were looking at all sites combined.

485
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:23,020
Let's compare for a pharynx and nono reference.

486
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:31,330
And behold, this improvement is almost entirely among the oropharynx patients.

487
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:37,570
And no change. Hardly any change among the non or of various cancer patients.

488
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:48,220
Okay. And so what that is telling us is that let's think back to when we actually had HPV data.

489
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:52,600
We see that HPV has a better prognosis.

490
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:59,420
Oropharynx is not the same thing as HIV positive.

491
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:06,680
It's just all all cancers that are in our backs. That's where HPV likes to hide out and cause cancer.

492
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:13,520
So over time, the fraction of oropharynx cancers that are HIV positive has probably increased.

493
01:02:15,350 --> 01:02:21,950
And so that's what we're saying here, that this improved this improvement in survival is probably due to change in etiology.

494
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:27,040
So the cancers are more caused by HPV and fewer of them are caused by smoking alcohol.

495
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:37,430
So unfortunately, our treatments have not obviously gone significantly, but this may be partly a treatment issue,

496
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:43,830
particularly if our treatments are better at addressing HPV positive types of cancers.

497
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:52,580
And so we could be doing a better job of those, but we're not doing a better job of the non HPV non cancers.

498
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:57,750
Thanks. Okay.

499
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:05,590
So takeaways here. So we saw that fewer than 50% of people diagnosed with head and neck cancer were going to die of that cancer within 15 years.

500
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:14,980
We did not use a cure model here, but we did account for this sort of death from other causes.

501
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:24,320
People with oropharynx cancer have a smaller cancer death hazard.

502
01:03:25,250 --> 01:03:34,190
But there is no difference between the fraction who have died of their head and neck cancer than oropharynx versus nondrinkers,

503
01:03:34,820 --> 01:03:38,210
because people are more likely to die of other concerns.

504
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:44,300
We studied the effects of age and sex were greatest in the first year or two in diagnosis.

505
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:48,770
But the effects of race attenuated much more slowly, if at all.

506
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:58,250
And the improvements in survival in recent years may be due to changing etiology of or face cancer than necessarily effectiveness of the treatment.

507
01:03:59,090 --> 01:04:01,760
So even just looking at this kind of time,

508
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:12,680
varying effects have helped us a lot to understand what's going on in survival of head and neck cancer over the last several decades.

509
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:23,270
We're not going to dove in quite as much as this in your is is this is a fair amount of work.

510
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:30,350
And in order to do this carefully with a multivariable model, taking into account all of the demographic factors.

511
01:04:30,710 --> 01:04:36,800
Take some machinery that is not in like an R package, but what we are going to do,

512
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:42,890
I'm going to let you work with the small variable model that is a bit slow,

513
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:47,630
but will allow you to at least begin to play with some of these for each of your cancers.

514
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:59,220
And of course, if you want to. Like do this kind of analysis for your cancer or other cancer.

515
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,380
There's room in the literature for that to be published.

516
01:05:02,390 --> 01:05:08,640
So just putting that out there, I will say that those of you who have picked cancers that have poor survival,

517
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:15,400
so pancreatic cancer, probably time varying matters less.

518
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:20,830
But maybe we'll see that in labs. Okay.

519
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:26,080
So that's what I have for us today. Questions about cancer survival.

520
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:36,640
Could you speak on the effects of age and sex and why it might be that in the first two years after diagnosis?

521
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:40,420
A lot more. Yeah, that's a good question.

522
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:53,230
So I am not a physician and but we did talk with physicians and they also were not super clear on what's going on.

523
01:05:53,650 --> 01:06:00,970
So we think that it's largely, particularly for age, a treatment effect.

524
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:08,440
So when people are recovering from surgery, so head and neck surgery is a pretty invasive surgery,

525
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:17,770
hard to recover from for chemo radiation as it makes a difference.

526
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:29,080
I would also say that different people so age plays a role and who even gets what type of sort of treatment.

527
01:06:29,830 --> 01:06:37,000
So older people are less likely to qualify for surgery, for example, and so that.

528
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:47,200
And so if there are differences in what treatment people are getting, that can kind of go into this, that that probably is not the case for sex.

529
01:06:50,780 --> 01:06:58,910
But it could be like I said, it could be a care, um, a differential.

530
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:08,990
Um, and then being more likely to, to get care, um, than women had in the first couple of years.

531
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:16,820
It could be a responsiveness to treatment that probably could be looked up in the literature.

532
01:07:17,270 --> 01:07:26,120
I haven't checked recently, but what I will say is that this I've been working with Jeremy Taylor and some of his students.

533
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:29,659
We actually see this in a lot of different cancers.

534
01:07:29,660 --> 01:07:35,650
And so I expect most of you will see. So I set it up for you to do sex differences in Lab seven.

535
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:41,180
I expect many of you will see a similar pattern, but we shall see.

536
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:47,390
Um. Does that help? To answer the question? Um.

537
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:51,290
Basically, there's a kind of regression to the mean going on.

538
01:07:51,530 --> 01:07:58,610
Once you've survived your treatment, things kind of go back to normal and everyone's home.

539
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:08,330
So this may be like, who survives treatment? And then once you have survived treatment, then the risks kind of evened out.

540
01:08:13,300 --> 01:08:18,270
Okay. So, um, I'll stop there for today.

541
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:28,200
Um, next week, on Monday, we will be in the lab so that you can download cancer survival data.

542
01:08:28,830 --> 01:08:30,810
Apologies that were a little bit out of order here.

543
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:38,520
And it's because when we're able to get into the computer lab, I'd like us to know that we're still doing lab sex with the age cohort.

544
01:08:38,970 --> 01:08:44,700
But since we're only able to pull out on Monday, you know, download, you'll start Lab seven.

545
01:08:45,030 --> 01:08:53,010
Download the cancer survival data and then continue to work on Lab six and seven, however you like on Monday and Wednesday next week.

546
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:57,420
And we won't start lecture eight until the week after that.

547
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:07,570
And I believe that I pushed back the deadlines for life six and seven.

548
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:11,350
If we're having trouble finishing those, then I can push them back further.

549
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:21,900
Once we get into November, we're going to start doing the multi-stage carcinogenesis models that will finish up our last three or four lectures,

550
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:32,190
and then you'll be able to bring it all together on your cancers for the final project.

551
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:38,610
And there will also be the review of a paper that does modeling,

552
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:48,540
but I'll talk more about that once we get into the multi-stage modeling, and that will be to do with the honest answer questions.

553
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:52,260
Comments. No.

554
01:09:52,350 --> 01:09:54,330
I will pause the recording here.
