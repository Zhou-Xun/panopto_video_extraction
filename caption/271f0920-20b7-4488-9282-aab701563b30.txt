00:00:02,041 --> 00:00:06,519
Welcome to this introductory biostatistics
lecture on the different types of data you

2
00:00:06,519 --> 00:00:08,307
will encounter in public health.

3
00:00:08,307 --> 00:00:12,749
Now each variable in your data set is
like a character in a complex story.

4
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:16,682
Different types of variables, whether
they're qualitative or quantitative,

5
00:00:16,682 --> 00:00:19,932
give us different insights into
what a community is experiencing.

6
00:00:19,932 --> 00:00:24,036
For example, we might want to know if
the amount of disease is increasing but

7
00:00:24,036 --> 00:00:27,700
the severity of that disease
is actually decreasing.

8
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:33,076
Or we might wonder if a person's education
or income affects their risk of disease.

9
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:37,062
Understanding the unique types of data you
collect is essential to how you analyze

10
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:39,100
and interpret those data.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,000
So in this lecture, we'll discuss
the different types of data and

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,900
how to identify them
in an actual data set.

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,000
So the learning objectives
today are first,

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,200
to differentiate between qualitative and
quantitative variables.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Within qualitative variables,
we'll differentiate between ordinal and

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:58,000
nominal variables and
within quantitative variables we'll

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,400
discriminate between what continuous,
count and binary variables are.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,900
And then we will use these
Concepts in an actual dataset.

19
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:12,200
Now a qualitative variable is a variable
that is best expressed with words.

20
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,200
For example, you might ask someone's
opinion about something and

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,100
they will answer that they agree,
disagree, that they're neutral,

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:21,700
that they strongly agree or
that they strongly disagree.

23
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,700
Each of these responses does not have
a numeric quantity attached to them.

24
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,200
Therefore this variable is
considered to be qualitative.

25
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,700
In contrast a quantitative variable

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,400
is a variable that is best expressed
with an actual numeric value.

27
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,325
Now qualitative data can further
be separated into two categories.

28
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:45,043
An ordinal qualitative variable is
one that has a natural order to

29
00:01:45,043 --> 00:01:46,343
the categories.

30
00:01:46,343 --> 00:01:50,989
In my previous example of a response to
a survey we can think of the responses

31
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:55,713
strongly disagree, disagree, neutral,
agree and strongly agree having

32
00:01:55,713 --> 00:02:00,800
a natural order from lowest to highest
in terms of level of agreement.

33
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Because of the order we call
this variable ordinal and

34
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:09,199
we can actually apply numbers to these
categories if we wish so we have a one for

35
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,400
strongly disagree up to five for
strongly agree.

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,785
All other qualitative variables
are considered to be nominal.

37
00:02:16,785 --> 00:02:21,200
And these are variables that do not have
natural order within the categories.

38
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,098
These variables include someone's race,
someone's gender and

39
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:27,331
someone's political affiliation.

40
00:02:27,331 --> 00:02:30,625
Now quantitative data can
be one of three categories.

41
00:02:30,625 --> 00:02:33,106
The first category is continuous.

42
00:02:33,106 --> 00:02:37,837
These are variables such as age,
family income, blood pressure or

43
00:02:37,837 --> 00:02:43,900
a level of pain measured on a visual
analog scale or VAS from 0 to 100.

44
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,400
Each age for example in a dataset
can take any value that it wishes.

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,200
There are no natural separations or
categories.

46
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,500
So for example,
we could have an age of 30 and

47
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,900
age of 40,
any age between those two values, etc.

48
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,085
A count quantitative
variable is exactly that,

49
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:07,676
it's a variable that counts the number
of events or items in a person.

50
00:03:07,676 --> 00:03:12,174
Example is where we might want to know the
number of missing teeth that someone has

51
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:15,700
and again this variable could take
the value zero or one or two.

52
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,500
There are no fractional values
that would occur in this variable.

53
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:22,274
Another example is the number
of texts sent per day.

54
00:03:22,274 --> 00:03:26,600
And a third example is the number of
depressive episodes per week in a person.

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:32,379
Each of these would be a count
that is zero, one, two, etc.

56
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,400
And the third category of quantitative
data is a binary variable.

57
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,470
And this is a variable that can only
take one of two possible values.

58
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,787
Usually a zero is a response of no and

59
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:47,778
a value of one is used for
a response of yes.

60
00:03:47,778 --> 00:03:51,801
So for example in a dataset we might
want to know if a subject was missing

61
00:03:51,801 --> 00:03:52,491
any teeth.

62
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:56,517
Not the number of teeth, but just any
teeth so zero would be an indicator of no,

63
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:59,933
they were not missing teeth and
one would be an indicator that yes,

64
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,277
they were missing teeth.

65
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:05,777
Other examples include an indicator of
whether a person developed throat cancer,

66
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:07,587
or if someone experienced pain.

67
00:04:07,587 --> 00:04:11,337
Again, we're not interested
in the level of pain,

68
00:04:11,337 --> 00:04:14,243
simply if there was any pain, yes or no.

69
00:04:14,243 --> 00:04:18,855
Now, let's apply these concepts that I've
just discussed to one of the datasets that

70
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,572
we will be using in this course.

71
00:04:20,572 --> 00:04:24,048
In front of you, you see the first few
rows of the low birth weight data that

72
00:04:24,048 --> 00:04:27,100
we discussed in a previous lecture.

73
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,700
Now the third and fourth columns of this
dataset discuss the age of each woman in

74
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:36,400
the dataset and
her weight at last menstrual cycle.

75
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:48,091
Each of these variables would be
considered to be quantitative.

76
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:50,901
Because again, we are measuring
a quantity in each person and

77
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:54,900
both of these variables are continuous.

78
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,080
The actual age and

79
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,118
the actual weight of each mother could
take any possible value that we wish.

80
00:05:01,118 --> 00:05:05,286
Now the fifth column represents the race
ethnicity category of each woman in

81
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:06,100
the dataset.

82
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,900
You may see numbers in front of you.

83
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:12,791
But again, the numbers are used to
represent actual categories of race and

84
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:16,166
ethnicity.

85
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:23,194
So again,
this variable is instead qualitative.

86
00:05:23,194 --> 00:05:27,616
And because there is no natural ordering
in the race and ethnicity categories,

87
00:05:27,616 --> 00:05:34,416
this is a nominal qualitative variable.

88
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,763
The next column in the dataset,
labeled smoke,

89
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:39,060
again can only take one
of two possible values.

90
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,574
It indicates whether the woman was
smoking during her pregnancy with zero

91
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:46,140
indicating no and one representing yes.

92
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,700
So again, this is a binary variable.

93
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,748
And again,
I told you that binary variables typically

94
00:05:54,748 --> 00:05:59,587
fit under the category of
quantitative variables.

95
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:04,051
However, you could also think about
the fact that smoking really has two

96
00:06:04,051 --> 00:06:07,000
categories of not a smoker or
yes a smoker.

97
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,800
So you might argue that in fact,
this is a qualitative variable and

98
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,900
we're using numbers to
represent actual words.

99
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,293
So binary variables are unusual in
that they can span both the categories

100
00:06:20,293 --> 00:06:23,110
of quantitative and qualitative variables.

101
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:27,300
But in the end the analysis
approach is the same.

102
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,100
Now datasets by themselves
are certainly too large for

103
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,100
the human brain to digest and get all the
information that's being provided by all

104
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,600
the variables in the dataset.

105
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:40,594
So we'd like to know if we can make
a story from these data by summarizing

106
00:06:40,594 --> 00:06:43,074
the variables across all the individuals.

107
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:46,706
And we want to do this using
both pictures and numbers.
