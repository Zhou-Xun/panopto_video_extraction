1
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:07,450
In this section, I'm going to
talk about conducting interviews.

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,000
Actually, this is one of my most favorite
parts of conducting qualitative research

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,900
because it really gives the opportunity
to go out, speak to people,

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,350
learn about their perspectives.

5
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:17,786
Learn about their lived experiences and

6
00:00:17,786 --> 00:00:21,443
try to really get understand
the most in-depth information

7
00:00:21,443 --> 00:00:25,790
you can from the people who
are living this in their daily lives.

8
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:29,150
So usually in qualitative research,
when we are conducting interviews,

9
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,240
we use what's called an interview guide.

10
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,040
And this includes the questions that
you are going to ask participants.

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,060
So you have your research question, and
then through an interview guide, you're

12
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:41,460
turning your research questions into the
questions you'll ask participants in order

13
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,920
to get the information than you need
to answer your own research questions.

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,150
So interview guides can be really helpful
in how to structure the interview.

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:54,460
But we should remember
that this is not a script.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,230
So several things to keep in mind as
you conduct a qualitative interview

17
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,890
are to ask open ended questions.

18
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,600
So avoid yes or no questions and provide
examples for participants to agree or

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,910
disagree with.

20
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,190
The second thing to keep in mind is that
you should choose language very carefully.

21
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:12,655
So you need to try to use words
that your participants will use and

22
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,750
also be sensitive to community or
social norms.

23
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,984
The third thing to keep in mind
is that you want to structure

24
00:01:18,984 --> 00:01:23,142
your interview guide in order to provide
a logical flow for the interview.

25
00:01:23,142 --> 00:01:26,346
You don't want to start out with
the most sensitive topics but

26
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:30,289
you also don't want to wait and ask
the most important questions at the end,

27
00:01:30,289 --> 00:01:31,724
in case you ran out of time.

28
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:34,277
And so the interview guide
includes the main questions, and

29
00:01:34,277 --> 00:01:37,280
then also should include some ideas for
follow-up questions.

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,420
Though again, I'll remind you, you
should try to be flexible in adding your

31
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,730
own follow-up questions and
your own probes.

32
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:46,560
So you should be ready to
change the order of questions,

33
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,160
you should be ready to re-phrase
the questions, if needed.

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,515
And you should always be ready to
add new interview questions or

35
00:01:52,515 --> 00:01:55,365
follow-up questions based
on the information, and

36
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:59,970
based on you as an interviewer
being an active listener.

37
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,850
In qualitative research,
we've talked about this idea of probes.

38
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,620
So probing can really help
you to clarify details,

39
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,500
to go more in-depth on the subject.

40
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,759
Sometimes they're planned, so
you might have some ideas for

41
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,641
probes ahead of time to put
into your interview guide,

42
00:02:14,641 --> 00:02:17,601
but you should also be prepared
to do unplanned probes.

43
00:02:17,601 --> 00:02:21,834
And so these could be both verbal and
non-verbal, some time that is just asking

44
00:02:21,834 --> 00:02:26,160
people, tell me more about that, or
some of the hmms, uh-huh, interesting.

45
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,210
But they also include non-verbal
probes such as smiling, head nodding,

46
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,190
leaning in more to show interest and
to show active listening.

47
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,250
So qualitative research,
when you're conducting interviews,

48
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:40,450
you really need to think
about showing mental agility,

49
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:43,910
being sensitive to the participant,
to the language you use.

50
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:47,270
Cultural and social norms in
the community you're working in.

51
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,040
And I would really encourage you
to practice your interview skills,

52
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,250
because they're skills that
can be built over time.

53
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,720
The steps in conducting
an interview are first,

54
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,300
you want to recruit the participant.

55
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,760
Then, you want to ensure that you have
a private space to where you can conduct

56
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,830
the interview in confidentiality.

57
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:05,480
You go through informed consent.

58
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,460
So you tell the participant what
you're going to be talking about,

59
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,360
if you've promised anonymity or
promised confidentiality.

60
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,360
That you share that with the participant,
and if you aren't promising

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,500
confidentiality or anonymity that
you also let them know that.

62
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,020
Obviously, that their participation
is voluntary in the interview, and

63
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,510
give some information about what you as
a researcher are planning to do with that.

64
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:29,899
How you're going to disseminate
the information, etc.

65
00:03:29,899 --> 00:03:33,213
If you've agreed ahead of time that
you'll be recording the interview,

66
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,511
that's when you want to
then start recording, and

67
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:38,300
you should also take notes
throughout the interview as well.

68
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,070
And then as you start the interview,

69
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:44,060
the beginning is really about building
rapport, making the interviewee or

70
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,910
participant feel comfortable
in talking with you.

71
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:49,900
And then you ask the questions
in your interview guides,

72
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:54,870
demonstrate active listening skills,
and probe as necessary.

73
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,530
And then towards the end of the interview,
as you finished asking your questions,

74
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,350
you then ask the participant if they
have any additional thoughts or

75
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,460
ideas they want to share.

76
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,120
So in summary, conducting interviews
is a task in mental agility.

77
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,290
Flexibility is important.

78
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:14,195
Knowing your research objectives ahead of
time before you conduct the interview is

79
00:04:14,195 --> 00:04:17,985
crucial, so understand how you should ask
the questions and when to follow up and

80
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:18,729
when to probe.

81
00:04:18,729 --> 00:04:21,347
Active listening throughout
the interview is key.

82
00:04:21,347 --> 00:04:28,034
And really, practice is needed to
build your interviewing skills.
