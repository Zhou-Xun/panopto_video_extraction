1
00:00:12,427 --> 00:00:19,027
So the first thing we're going to talk about is are the basic principles of antimicrobial action,

2
00:00:19,027 --> 00:00:24,187
because as you probably know, all antimicrobial agents do not work in the same manner.

3
00:00:24,187 --> 00:00:29,407
So when you take an antibiotic antibiotic,

4
00:00:29,407 --> 00:00:37,507
it either needs to be in the active form or it goes to a change in your body and it will become go into the active form.

5
00:00:37,507 --> 00:00:48,697
So this all depends on FAQ pharmacodynamics and the structure and route that you take an antibiotic, whether it's oral I.V. IM, et cetera.

6
00:00:48,697 --> 00:00:53,287
So this is all built into how antibiotics are used.

7
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:59,437
And so when they're in the body, they become active if they're not already.

8
00:00:59,437 --> 00:01:07,207
It's also necessary to achieve sufficient levels of the antibiotic at the site of the infection.

9
00:01:07,207 --> 00:01:11,647
And and for and this has to happen for the antibiotic to become active.

10
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:16,627
And this all once again goes along with the pharmacokinetics of the antibiotics.

11
00:01:16,627 --> 00:01:22,747
So when they're making antibiotics and they're deciding how to use them and how much to give and how frequently to give them,

12
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:28,927
they worry about consider the rate of absorption of the antibiotic.

13
00:01:28,927 --> 00:01:38,137
How it's distributed through the body, it's distributed in serum or in other by other mechanisms.

14
00:01:38,137 --> 00:01:41,167
And how the body metabolizes the antibiotic,

15
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:47,347
is it already in an active form or does it have to be partially metabolized to become to be in an active form?

16
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:57,097
And then, of course, have to consider about healthy metabolites from the antimicrobial agent are excreted from the body and all of this?

17
00:01:57,097 --> 00:02:05,177
All these are considerations that go into creating a new antibiotic and getting its approval.

18
00:02:05,177 --> 00:02:13,347
Next slide. So here's a real simple chart, talking about an anatomic distribution of antibiotics,

19
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:22,167
and certainly we don't have all the antibiotics shown here, but we just have some so ampicillin, which is a beta lactam, is in the serum.

20
00:02:22,167 --> 00:02:26,277
It can be in the spinal fluid and it could be in the urine. Ceftriaxone is more.

21
00:02:26,277 --> 00:02:35,367
It's also a beta lactam. It's a much more advanced beta lactam, and it can be distributed in the same three sites in serum CSF and urine.

22
00:02:35,367 --> 00:02:48,057
Then we go one. We go down to vancomycin, which is used for resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus or other Staphylococcus species.

23
00:02:48,057 --> 00:02:54,597
It's great in serum, it's great in the urine. Some of it may get into the spinal fluid, but it's kind of questionable.

24
00:02:54,597 --> 00:03:01,827
The same thing happens with ciprofloxacin, great use in serum and for infections in the urine.

25
00:03:01,827 --> 00:03:09,807
But it's not the greatest drug to treat a CSF infection or a meningitis when we get down to amino

26
00:03:09,807 --> 00:03:16,107
acid gentamicin geremi essence meaning like side great great coverage for serum and urine,

27
00:03:16,107 --> 00:03:22,827
but none at all for us spinal fluid. And that's the same thing for clindamycin.

28
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:28,857
Grade and serum doesn't get into the spinal fluid, and clindamycin doesn't get into the urine, either.

29
00:03:28,857 --> 00:03:35,217
The final two drugs nor fluoxetine and nitrofurantoin are oftentimes used for urinary tract infections because,

30
00:03:35,217 --> 00:03:39,177
as you can see, they don't get into the serum and they don't get into the spinal fluid.

31
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:45,957
But they do do very well in the serum and usually drugs that get into the serum or will be concentrated in there.

32
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:55,207
So the final statement here on this slide is the anatomic distribution of a drug will determine its utility, and that's something to always remember.

33
00:03:55,207 --> 00:04:02,727
Some drugs work well in some types of specimens and some locations in the body, and some work better in others.

34
00:04:02,727 --> 00:04:15,227
Next slide. So they're going on with basic principles of antimicrobial action, in addition to what we've already talked about.

35
00:04:15,227 --> 00:04:25,347
We have to consider when when a physician prescribes an antimicrobial agent, how is it absorbed by the organism?

36
00:04:25,347 --> 00:04:29,837
How is it taken up? Is there intracellular uptake?

37
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:32,057
That's something to consider also.

38
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:48,437
And then what can make the antimicrobial agent inactive and so there can be target binding, which can lead to disruption of cellular processes?

39
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:54,857
There can be growth inhibition, which can be either bacteria static, just inhibiting growth,

40
00:04:54,857 --> 00:05:00,317
or it can actually be death of the organism, and that's bactericidal activity.

41
00:05:00,317 --> 00:05:10,037
And even considering all this, we know that resistance can develop at any point in this sequence.

42
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:20,147
Next slide. So also, it's important to remember that generally reducing the rate of an organism's replication provides

43
00:05:20,147 --> 00:05:27,137
adequate protection in individuals whose immune system is able to actually remove the infectious agent.

44
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:41,417
So if you can slow down if your body can slow down organ organisms, replication it much more effectively, get rid of that infectious agent.

45
00:05:41,417 --> 00:05:50,957
Also, when we're talking about antimicrobial agents, we need to talk about bactericidal agents because they are much more effective against

46
00:05:50,957 --> 00:05:57,857
organisms that are more difficult to control in combination with the host's immune response.

47
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:05,897
So bacteria static agents are quite effective for urinary tract infections and other types of infections,

48
00:06:05,897 --> 00:06:10,097
but sometimes they don't work so well with more difficult organisms,

49
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:20,657
and it all depends on the location of the infection and the antimicrobial susceptibility of the organism.

50
00:06:20,657 --> 00:06:21,677
Next slide.

51
00:06:21,677 --> 00:06:31,337
So here we have a chart I made of bactericidal agents versus bacteria, static agents, and on the bactericidal side, we have the aminoglycosides.

52
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:35,057
It's like gentamicin beta lactamase, like penicillin, ampicillin,

53
00:06:35,057 --> 00:06:47,277
then vancomycin Dapto Meissen phosphor license to distill it, which is not used much, very, very much the.

54
00:06:47,277 --> 00:06:51,747
Foxes and so Leila Clarkson, that's like ciprofloxacin and so on.

55
00:06:51,747 --> 00:06:57,087
We're Fanfan is primarily used for tuberculosis and other mycobacteria.

56
00:06:57,087 --> 00:07:06,147
Metronidazole is a great drug for parasites and then colistin is is a very, very potent drug for gram negatives.

57
00:07:06,147 --> 00:07:10,987
But it has a lot of side effects and and.

58
00:07:10,987 --> 00:07:19,087
Physicians would prefer not to give it unless there's no other drug that will be effective on the bacteria static side.

59
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:24,367
We have quorum physical a can, which is not given frequently unless it's absolutely necessary.

60
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:31,987
Erythromycin clindamycin both used oftentimes for gram positive infections.

61
00:07:31,987 --> 00:07:37,147
Then we have this sulfonamides and trimethoprim. They're used frequently in trimethoprim sulfur.

62
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:41,797
The combination drug is a great drug for urinary tract infections and other types.

63
00:07:41,797 --> 00:07:50,017
We have the tetracyclines, Typekit, cyclin linezolid and then one that's not used real often, but quite a pristine for a person.

64
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:57,067
But it is if you need it and there's nothing else available that will work, that that one will certainly work.

65
00:07:57,067 --> 00:08:06,227
Next slide. So next, we have to talk about mechanism of action because all the drugs do not act the same way.

66
00:08:06,227 --> 00:08:10,307
It depends on what class of antibiotics they are and how well they work at a certain site.

67
00:08:10,307 --> 00:08:15,347
So first one of the beta lactamase is the most commonly used drugs, I believe.

68
00:08:15,347 --> 00:08:25,187
This includes penicillin, cephalosporins and carbapenems, and these inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding penicillin binding proteins.

69
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:32,957
And these black arms are active against many gram positive organisms and some gram negative organisms.

70
00:08:32,957 --> 00:08:42,877
And it really varies which gram negative organisms will be susceptible to the beta lactamase and which beta lactam will be in use.

71
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:52,087
Next slide. So the next class of drugs are the amino glycosides, and this is gentamicin tobramycin, a case in streptomycin.

72
00:08:52,087 --> 00:09:04,087
That group of drugs and these the aminoglycosides inhibit protein synthesis by binding to the 36 ribosomal subunit.

73
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:11,707
And once protein synthesis is inhibited, the organism can no longer multiply and dies.

74
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:23,077
So the amino glycosides are active against many gram positive and many gram negative bacteria, but not at all against bacteria that are anaerobic.

75
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:29,317
Next slide. Another mechanism going on with mechanisms of action, we have the floor quinolones.

76
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:40,837
And these include ciprofloxacin and lethal fluoxetine, and the fluoroquinolones inhibit DNA synthesis by binding to DNA gyro gyros,

77
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:48,577
excuse me, DNA gyrus and TOPO summaries for and by binding to those two agents.

78
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:56,897
They inhibit DNA synthesis. The organism will then die, and it is active against many gram positive and many gram negative bacteria.

79
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:06,127
But this activity against these organism varies by the organism and how many antibiotics it's been exposed to also.

80
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:12,277
Then we have the glycol glycol peptides, and the important, really important drug here is vancomycin.

81
00:10:12,277 --> 00:10:19,087
And as you know, it's used against staphylococcal infections when the organism is resistant to other agents

82
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:25,717
and it inhibits cell wall synthesis by binding precursors of the synthesis process.

83
00:10:25,717 --> 00:10:34,117
It is only active against gram positive organisms and and generally only used against organisms that are

84
00:10:34,117 --> 00:10:42,487
resistant to other gram positive organisms like staph aureus that might be resistant to other antibiotics.

85
00:10:42,487 --> 00:10:48,237
Next slide. So then we have the macrolides and the Italian coast surmising,

86
00:10:48,237 --> 00:10:55,617
and this is a large group and the antibiotics that you might recognize here are erythromycin, azithromycin and clindamycin.

87
00:10:55,617 --> 00:11:05,727
Now these drugs, the macrolides and linkov sometimes inhibit protein synthesis at the 50 S. ribosomal subunit.

88
00:11:05,727 --> 00:11:13,017
Most Gram positive organisms and some gram negative organisms may be susceptible to this,

89
00:11:13,017 --> 00:11:20,697
these classes of this class of antibiotics, once again, susceptibility testing is is absolutely necessary.

90
00:11:20,697 --> 00:11:30,357
Then we come to the tetracyclines. And this includes tetracycline and doxycycline, and doxycycline is a longer acting form of tetracycline,

91
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:34,677
and these drugs inhibit protein synthesis at this.

92
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:46,047
And it's the 30 s ribosomal subunit that is affected affects both gram positive and gram negative organisms and intracellular organisms.

93
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:53,247
Now you have to remember that this is not all gram positive, nor all gram negative or all intracellular organisms,

94
00:11:53,247 --> 00:12:03,137
but some in each category and and even chlamydia can be treated with this class of antibiotics.

95
00:12:03,137 --> 00:12:07,637
Then we have the sulfonamides, and generally, as I said before,

96
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:12,707
the sulfonamides are combined with trimethoprim and they they make a great combination.

97
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:16,517
Trimethoprim sulfa Jews, commonly for urinary tract infections,

98
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:23,027
but inhibits different parts of the folic acid pathway affecting DNA synthesis in bacteria.

99
00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:30,167
So it is effective against many gram positives and many gram negatives are once again for all of these agents.

100
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:37,937
Susceptibility testing is mandatory. You cannot assume that an organism will be susceptible to any antibiotic.

101
00:12:37,937 --> 00:12:43,307
You have to test it and find out.

102
00:12:43,307 --> 00:12:55,927
So here's an exam type question which class of antibiotics inhibit protein synthesis and is effective against intracellular organisms?

103
00:12:55,927 --> 00:13:02,147
Since you're not here while I'm recording, I'm going to let you look it up. Next slide.

104
00:13:02,147 --> 00:13:08,797
Let's go on and talk about mechanisms of resistance, mechanisms of resistance, maybe biological.

105
00:13:08,797 --> 00:13:18,277
They may be clinical if they're biological. They would produce physiologic changes that result in a decrease in susceptibility.

106
00:13:18,277 --> 00:13:23,177
Maybe antibiotic is effective by binding to the cell wall of the cell.

107
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:28,897
Wall structure is changed. It can't bind it, and it would be ineffective.

108
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:31,087
Another mechanism of resistance is clinical,

109
00:13:31,087 --> 00:13:40,717
and that would be if there are physiologic changes that have progressed to a point where the drug is no longer clinically useful.

110
00:13:40,717 --> 00:13:46,807
And that would be physiologic changes ongoing.

111
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:53,687
Next slide. Then we have environmentally mediated types of resistance,

112
00:13:53,687 --> 00:13:58,877
and this might be physical or chemical characteristics that alter the agent or

113
00:13:58,877 --> 00:14:03,677
the agents physiologic or the organism's physiologic response to the drug.

114
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:14,027
So these might include this is a change. And if the change is great enough that the drug cannot be active, that might affect it.

115
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:21,107
If the or if the infections in a place where there's anaerobic growth and the drug

116
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:25,907
is only available effective against an arrow that would affect the presence of

117
00:14:25,907 --> 00:14:33,307
cations and various metabolites can also affect the physical or chemical characteristics

118
00:14:33,307 --> 00:14:41,267
that that would determine whether or not an antimicrobial agent is effective.

119
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:50,667
Next slide. Going on with mechanisms of resistance, we have microorganism mediated mechanisms of resistance.

120
00:14:50,667 --> 00:14:58,347
So if it's if it's microorganism mediated, there can be intrinsic changes.

121
00:14:58,347 --> 00:15:03,327
These may be predictable and due to the genetic structure or physiologic state of the organism.

122
00:15:03,327 --> 00:15:10,857
So if you're using vancomycin to treat a gram negative organism,

123
00:15:10,857 --> 00:15:17,727
the gram negative may not be able will not be able to take take up vancomycin because

124
00:15:17,727 --> 00:15:23,187
the differences in the gram negative cell wall and the vancomycin would be ineffective.

125
00:15:23,187 --> 00:15:28,917
So vancomycin is not used for gram negative bacterial infections.

126
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:35,487
The use of ampicillin against Klebsiella, particularly Klebsiella pneumoniae, oftentimes Klebsiella pneumoniae,

127
00:15:35,487 --> 00:15:41,937
has a resistance factor called AMP C, and the AMP and AMP C stands for ampicillin.

128
00:15:41,937 --> 00:15:50,247
And so Klebsiella species that have that possess Apsey are resistant to ampicillin.

129
00:15:50,247 --> 00:15:59,907
The inactivated and finally metronidazole, as I said, it's it's only active in anaerobic conditions,

130
00:15:59,907 --> 00:16:10,157
so it does not work against aerobic bacteria, and these are just some examples of microorganism mediated types of resistance.

131
00:16:10,157 --> 00:16:18,617
Next slide. So I know this is difficult, a little bit difficult to see, but I took a picture of a page in the textbook and and put it into a slide.

132
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:24,857
So I wanted you to be able to see the types of natural resistance and the mechanism.

133
00:16:24,857 --> 00:16:29,477
In some of these we have talked well and others we have not.

134
00:16:29,477 --> 00:16:34,397
So if we look here, we talked about anaerobic bacteria versus a like glycosides.

135
00:16:34,397 --> 00:16:41,177
And so the animals have a lack of oxidative metabolism, so they can't take up the amino glycosides.

136
00:16:41,177 --> 00:16:51,107
So as you read through this list, try and think about what it is that is making this drug not work against certain classes of bacteria.

137
00:16:51,107 --> 00:16:56,527
So if we go down here aerobic bacteria versus metronidazole? Yeah.

138
00:16:56,527 --> 00:17:03,607
Metronidazole is active anaerobic, Li.

139
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:08,527
And so if there's an inability to anaerobic cle aerobic bacteria, excuse me,

140
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:16,267
have an inability to anaerobic or reduce the drug to its active form, so it's not going to work aerobically and so on.

141
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:24,457
So you can look down here and you can see that there are very various mechanisms by which bacteria have intrinsic resistance.

142
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:30,087
These are all in types of intrinsic resistance to antibacterial agents.

143
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:36,057
Next slide. Now, another type of mechanism of resistance is microorganism mediated.

144
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:39,417
It's an acquired type of resistance.

145
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:50,397
We cannot predict which microorganisms will acquire resistance, which is why testing in the clinical microbiology lab is so important.

146
00:17:50,397 --> 00:17:56,487
When we test, we can detect if there's a change from susceptible to resistance from foreign,

147
00:17:56,487 --> 00:18:01,287
an organism that should be susceptible to the agents being tested.

148
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:06,267
And this this change, this acquired resistance may be due to mutations.

149
00:18:06,267 --> 00:18:14,877
It might be due to gene transfer or a combination of these factors or others also.

150
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:22,297
Next slide. So some common pathways of of resistance, and I've already talked about this,

151
00:18:22,297 --> 00:18:28,477
but let's go over them again so there can be enzymatic degradation or modification of the agent.

152
00:18:28,477 --> 00:18:32,827
So if it's degraded or modified, it probably won't work.

153
00:18:32,827 --> 00:18:46,177
There can be decreased uptake or accumulation of the agent, so as an organism becomes, maybe more hardy becomes more able to build up their cell wall.

154
00:18:46,177 --> 00:18:51,217
They may have decreased uptake of an antibiotic or less accumulation of the

155
00:18:51,217 --> 00:18:57,337
agent in the bacteria and resistant that goes along with an altered targeted.

156
00:18:57,337 --> 00:19:07,477
If the antibiotic is directed us at a specific target and the bacteria or fungus and the target is altered.

157
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:14,887
It's not going to work. So some organisms can circumvent the consequences of the agent.

158
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:24,997
So if it makes them their cell wall less less agent able to or excuse me, I'm saying this wrong.

159
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:33,487
So if if staphylococci can make their cell wall thicker, they won't be able to take off an antimicrobial agent, particularly a selective agent.

160
00:19:33,487 --> 00:19:37,537
And it's no good. They can't.

161
00:19:37,537 --> 00:19:42,697
There's uncoupling of the agent target interactions. Once again, think about that cell wall.

162
00:19:42,697 --> 00:19:51,067
If the agent can't affect their target, such as a thicker cell wall or a change in the cell wall, it won't be active.

163
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:57,617
And then there, of course, any combination of these of these factors. Next slide.

164
00:19:57,617 --> 00:20:03,677
So emergence of resistance is really survival of the fittest.

165
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:15,647
So we have a mixing of the bacterial gene pool and it's mixing constantly and we have selective pressure from excessive antimicrobial use and abuse.

166
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:16,997
Now what happens?

167
00:20:16,997 --> 00:20:29,887
We have survival of the fittest and the fittest and would be bacteria or other infectious agents that are able to resist being killed by antibiotics.

168
00:20:29,887 --> 00:20:39,107
Next slide. So there has been several new types of of resistance in the last 10 years, 20 years,

169
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:46,787
something like that, but resistance has always been a present when antibiotics are using.

170
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:54,377
So we have new genes, the emergence of new genes. So we have methicillin resistant staph aureus more.

171
00:20:54,377 --> 00:20:57,407
We have vancomycin resistant Enterococcus.

172
00:20:57,407 --> 00:21:05,297
That's a very we have Jesus and there are bad this is glycol peptide intermediate staph aureus and this is glycol peptides.

173
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:14,417
Vancomycin is a glycol peptide and it's used, as I said before, used to treat the most resistant, difficult types of staphylococcal infections.

174
00:21:14,417 --> 00:21:24,887
We have spread of all genes to new hosts, so we've we've had penicillin resistant, got going to caucus for a long time.

175
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:32,987
Now we have penicillin resistant staph aureus glycol peptide resistant staph aureus,

176
00:21:32,987 --> 00:21:40,947
and that's spread of old genes from penicillin resistant GC to staph aureus.

177
00:21:40,947 --> 00:21:47,457
And then we have no three mutations of old genes, which result in more potent resistance.

178
00:21:47,457 --> 00:21:54,807
So the extended spectrum beta lactamase type of resistance started from a mutation of an old gene,

179
00:21:54,807 --> 00:22:02,907
and it has now grown to be a much more potent type of resistance in more types of gram negative organisms.

180
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:08,277
And then number four, of course, we have emergence of intrinsically resistant opportunistic bacteria.

181
00:22:08,277 --> 00:22:14,617
So most people will never, ever experience an infection or still a triple bonus.

182
00:22:14,617 --> 00:22:21,427
However, this bacteria likes to seeks to become an opportunistic pathogen.

183
00:22:21,427 --> 00:22:26,887
And if the opportunity presents itself, whether the patients in cancer,

184
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:33,757
chemotherapy or the patient has been over treated with other antibiotics, it can come in and set up an infection.

185
00:22:33,757 --> 00:22:40,617
And it is a very, very resistant organism.

186
00:22:40,617 --> 00:22:50,727
Next slide. So here's a schematic, it's a well known schematic, gets in a lot of textbooks about how bacteria resist antimicrobial therapy.

187
00:22:50,727 --> 00:22:54,237
So in the top one, we have a beta lactamase beta lactamase.

188
00:22:54,237 --> 00:23:04,947
It's this long red arrow and above it we have beta lactam and it can break open the beta lactam so that it is no longer effective.

189
00:23:04,947 --> 00:23:15,687
And then in number two, we have an altered target. So the one on the left has a penicillin binding protein and the one on the right doesn't.

190
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:21,987
And because of the they both have penicillin binding proteins, but because the one on the left,

191
00:23:21,987 --> 00:23:27,807
the larger rectangular penicillin binding protein has been altered.

192
00:23:27,807 --> 00:23:29,817
The antibiotic is no good on it.

193
00:23:29,817 --> 00:23:39,177
And you can see so that this this organism that has this penicillin binding protein will not be killed by a beta lactam.

194
00:23:39,177 --> 00:23:50,177
And this all occurs in the murine peptidoglycan peptidoglycan can layer and down almost into the cell membrane.

195
00:23:50,177 --> 00:23:56,327
In the bottoms bottom schematic, we've got what happens with an altered target.

196
00:23:56,327 --> 00:24:05,807
I didn't mean to do that. And so what we have is beta lectins at the top.

197
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:12,377
And and then we have built like times nicer they have.

198
00:24:12,377 --> 00:24:24,967
If the the there's a change in the cell wall of the organism so that there is decreased uptake through the pawns by the left hand can't be active.

199
00:24:24,967 --> 00:24:35,107
OK, but remember, also, it's not just decreased uptake, but if they make a penicillin binding protein, the antibiotic will no longer be active.

200
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:48,247
So there are various mechanisms that can affect the deficiency of an antibiotic in two to treat what should be a susceptible organism.

201
00:24:48,247 --> 00:24:52,507
Next slide. So this is another well-known chart.

202
00:24:52,507 --> 00:25:00,397
It was designed many, many years ago, and it's still true. So it's about we always think about beta lactamase as in gram positive organisms,

203
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:06,457
but they're angry at gram negative organisms and particularly in the antibacterial S. We worry about them as well as in other gram negatives.

204
00:25:06,457 --> 00:25:12,817
So this chart just shows members of the other bacteria produce many different types of beta lactamase,

205
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:20,857
so the common beta lactamase is in antibacterial. Our Class A, Class B, Class C in Class D, that's pretty straightforward.

206
00:25:20,857 --> 00:25:31,177
Well, Class A beta lactamase is would be starting on the left either broad spectrum beta lactamase and the actual factors are 10s and shivs,

207
00:25:31,177 --> 00:25:36,967
and they are inhibitors of the team type reaction.

208
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:52,027
Then we have SBL extended spectrum beta lactamase and they are active, as you can see right by a variety of different types of SBL CTCs MS,

209
00:25:52,027 --> 00:25:58,627
for example, very, very detrimental to getting rid of of bacterial growth.

210
00:25:58,627 --> 00:26:03,847
And if we go over to Class B, these are the metallic beta lact Macy's classier.

211
00:26:03,847 --> 00:26:13,327
The Apsey beta lactamase is an Apsey. Beta lactamase is maybe either chromosomal or plasmid mediated chromosomal.

212
00:26:13,327 --> 00:26:20,767
They're always in the cell. Plasmid mediated, of course, can be shared and then in Class D with the oximeter, Lakshmi says.

213
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:24,937
So there's a whole variety of different types of beta lact.

214
00:26:24,937 --> 00:26:30,877
And while we can test for them in the test for the specific type of beta lactamase in the lab,

215
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:34,477
it's not really necessary unless there's an outbreak situation.

216
00:26:34,477 --> 00:26:43,687
Because what you need to know to treat a patient is, is this antibiotic going to work against this organism in my patient?

217
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:52,267
But also know that without good hand-washing and other other types of prevention mechanisms,

218
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:57,467
they can be spread throughout a hospital or throughout a ward, a nursing home and so on.

219
00:26:57,467 --> 00:27:01,657
Next slide. So how do we detect resistance?

220
00:27:01,657 --> 00:27:10,267
Well, our goal is to determine whether an organism expresses resistance to an agent or agents that may be used for therapy.

221
00:27:10,267 --> 00:27:15,607
And so the testing will determine the extent of acquired resistance.

222
00:27:15,607 --> 00:27:26,047
We know that organisms have innate resistance also and and and that that those types of innate resistance are fairly well known.

223
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:33,997
Next slide. So what are our goals for standardization? We need to optimize the growth conditions so we can grow the organism and test it.

224
00:27:33,997 --> 00:27:38,917
We need to maintain integrity of the antimicrobial agent,

225
00:27:38,917 --> 00:27:47,437
keep it refrigerated until it's it's needs to be used and then let it warm up to room temperature before it's inoculated and so on.

226
00:27:47,437 --> 00:27:56,497
And it's absolutely critical that laboratories maintain reproducible reproducibility and consistency of

227
00:27:56,497 --> 00:28:06,547
their testing process because any little change in the testing process may change the outcome of the test.

228
00:28:06,547 --> 00:28:11,577
Next slide. So how do we detect resistance?

229
00:28:11,577 --> 00:28:16,527
Well, there are a number of factors that are taken into account to attempt to standardize in vitro

230
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:21,597
testing methods and actually in vitro susceptibility testing is one of the most standardized,

231
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:29,247
highly standardized tests in clinical microbiology. So in vitro methods aren't designed.

232
00:28:29,247 --> 00:28:34,317
They do not recreate in vivo physiology in any way, shape or form.

233
00:28:34,317 --> 00:28:46,347
In vivo physiology can affect clinical response such that results of in vitro testing can't be used to predict clinical outcome.

234
00:28:46,347 --> 00:28:52,887
So it's always necessary to consider in vivo physiology and in vitro testing methods.

235
00:28:52,887 --> 00:29:00,747
But once again, susceptibility testing is the most highly standardized test in clinical microbiology.

236
00:29:00,747 --> 00:29:08,097
So how do we standardize it? And once again, this does not mimic the in vivo environment, the environment in the patient.

237
00:29:08,097 --> 00:29:16,527
So results cannot predict outcome because diffusion and tissue or cells may be changed in some patients.

238
00:29:16,527 --> 00:29:26,817
There may be a serum protein binding of a drug. There can be drug interactions between antimicrobial agents and not antimicrobial agents.

239
00:29:26,817 --> 00:29:33,057
The host's immune status and underlying illness greatly affects the efficacy of the

240
00:29:33,057 --> 00:29:38,787
susceptibility testing once again by growing the organism in the lab and testing.

241
00:29:38,787 --> 00:29:41,517
We don't know how virulent the organism is.

242
00:29:41,517 --> 00:29:47,637
It may be a highly, highly virulent staph aureus, or maybe one that just along for the ride, and it's not that bad.

243
00:29:47,637 --> 00:29:49,737
We can't tell that in the lab.

244
00:29:49,737 --> 00:29:58,017
And then, of course, the site and severity of the infection really play a huge role in how bad it will be and how easy it is,

245
00:29:58,017 --> 00:30:03,267
or how hard it is to eradicate the infection.

246
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:12,387
So once again, this is the most highly standardized testing in clinical microbiology, so we have to standardize the inoculum size.

247
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:16,977
The growth medium, the incubation temperature,

248
00:30:16,977 --> 00:30:23,247
the incubation atmosphere and the duration of incubation and then the antimicrobial

249
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:29,607
concentrations that are used and these antimicrobial concentrations are standardized.

250
00:30:29,607 --> 00:30:32,607
It's a standardized by the clinical laboratory standards,

251
00:30:32,607 --> 00:30:39,507
and they're used by an all licensed laboratories so that when you get a result from one licensed laboratory,

252
00:30:39,507 --> 00:30:47,697
it should be equivalent to a result from another licensed laboratory testing the same organism with the same antibiotic.

253
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:56,517
So. Next slide. So once again, Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, CSI, these have the testing and reporting guidelines.

254
00:30:56,517 --> 00:31:02,697
If you do not follow their standards and you licenses and laboratories are licensed

255
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:06,927
by the College of American Pathology and you are inspected every other year,

256
00:31:06,927 --> 00:31:11,817
if you don't follow CSI standards, you will get an error.

257
00:31:11,817 --> 00:31:17,427
Gigged on that, and it may cost your laboratory a lot of money.

258
00:31:17,427 --> 00:31:27,807
Next slide. So background information on seal aside, because many of you don't know what seals high is what they do.

259
00:31:27,807 --> 00:31:35,517
So I said already said antimicrobial susceptibility testing our procedures are standardized by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute.

260
00:31:35,517 --> 00:31:39,567
These are consensus statements by experts in all areas of the laboratory.

261
00:31:39,567 --> 00:31:47,547
So when we're revising a document, we have infectious diseases physicians, pathologists, clinical microbiology,

262
00:31:47,547 --> 00:31:55,437
laboratory directors, clinical microbiology technologists, pharmacists and so on on the committee.

263
00:31:55,437 --> 00:32:02,517
So everybody can present their point of view and they can come to a consensus and they show up the standards.

264
00:32:02,517 --> 00:32:06,667
The CSI standards show up on cap inspection documents, as I said before.

265
00:32:06,667 --> 00:32:12,327
Therefore, your lab, if you're not following the CSI consensus document,

266
00:32:12,327 --> 00:32:21,807
you better have a pretty good reason or you may not pass your your cause of American pathology inspection and to be a licensed laboratory,

267
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:25,847
you need to do that. Next slide.

268
00:32:25,847 --> 00:32:32,807
So this is an example, and when I brought the actual manual into the class and showed it, but this is an example of one table.

269
00:32:32,807 --> 00:32:38,177
This is zone diameter interpretive standards and equivalent minimum inhibitory concentrations.

270
00:32:38,177 --> 00:32:46,607
Or am I see break points for antibacterial? So the medium that has to be used is more hitting auger.

271
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:58,837
The inoculum is a direct colony suspension that is what is used most commonly the plates are incubated in 35 degrees ambient air, no CO2.

272
00:32:58,837 --> 00:33:10,567
For 16 to 18 hours, the only time we would use CO2 is if we had to test something like a Haemophilus or Nicea gonorrhea that doesn't grow without CO2.

273
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:16,747
We are our model for quality control. We use a couple of different E. coli strains.

274
00:33:16,747 --> 00:33:25,297
25, nine 22 is a susceptible strain and to our 35 to 18, it produces beetle lacked basis.

275
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:31,717
And so when you set your test up, you have to follow test certain drugs.

276
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:41,197
You don't have to test every drug. You have to test the drugs that are used a standardized for use in your institution.

277
00:33:41,197 --> 00:33:48,937
And then you have to follow these standards. So it shows you if you're doing a distribution test like a Kirby Bauer, there's there's results.

278
00:33:48,937 --> 00:33:57,277
And if you're doing am I see breakpoint? So this diffusion just shows you how large the zone of innovation is around the disk.

279
00:33:57,277 --> 00:34:04,557
The minimum inhibitory concentration is the minimum concentration of drug to inhibit growth.

280
00:34:04,557 --> 00:34:07,117
And so let's look at ampicillin.

281
00:34:07,117 --> 00:34:19,927
The disc content is 10 micrograms, and if you have a zone of less than or less than or equal to 13 millimeters is to isolate is resistant.

282
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:25,597
If the zone is greater than or equal to 17 millimeters zone of innovation around the disc, it's susceptible.

283
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:33,457
And if it's between 14 and 16, it's intermediate. And we would test ampicillin because you could see on the right side.

284
00:34:33,457 --> 00:34:38,857
It's the class representative for ampicillin and amoxicillin.

285
00:34:38,857 --> 00:34:46,267
So as you go down this chart, you can see additional information for mislatel or peppers, Caelynn Carbon, Iselin and so on.

286
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:53,977
And then down in the bottom rows, you have beta lactam beta lactamase inhibitor combinations.

287
00:34:53,977 --> 00:34:58,747
So ampicillin, LaViolette OK, acid or ansel back him.

288
00:34:58,747 --> 00:35:03,887
We have tip Tazo for facilities, so back to him and I tie castle equivalent of acid.

289
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:12,997
So the discontent has the drugs that have been standardized and I don't believe I said the standard standardized

290
00:35:12,997 --> 00:35:20,617
discount drugs that are standardized concentration of drugs that are tested correlate to what is achievable.

291
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:23,747
Serum concentrations.

292
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:35,077
And so you can see that we have break points both for this diffusion or curvy bower test and the equivalent am I see break points.

293
00:35:35,077 --> 00:35:45,577
Next slide. So, as I said, no standardized test in clinical microbiology, so one of the factors that we have to standardize is the inoculum,

294
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:54,847
and we use a standardized inoculum and we compare it to turbidity standards and to make your turbidity standards,

295
00:35:54,847 --> 00:36:01,597
you mix various volumes of one percent sulfuric acid and one point one five one seven five percent barium chloride.

296
00:36:01,597 --> 00:36:09,577
The actual standard that you use for standardizing your suspension before you inoculate your plates is a point.

297
00:36:09,577 --> 00:36:16,417
Five Macfarlane. And if you make a suspension of your organism that is equivalent to 0.5 Macfarlane,

298
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:22,507
that is equivalent to 1.5 times 10 to the eighth colony forming units per milliliter.

299
00:36:22,507 --> 00:36:25,897
And you can adjust this by or if you have any question about,

300
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:32,437
whether it's too concentrated or not concentrated enough, you can actually use an instrument to standardize it.

301
00:36:32,437 --> 00:36:38,287
So here are the Macfarlane standards. Point five, one, two and three.

302
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:51,757
And they exist in laboratories, and you can compare your suspension to this 0.5 macfarlane and see if it's approximately that amount of turbidity.

303
00:36:51,757 --> 00:36:57,407
If it's this much, you need to dilute it and so on.

304
00:36:57,407 --> 00:37:07,517
Next slide. So I think I've already mentioned that we do susceptibility testing on your hint generally does diffusion well.

305
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:09,587
Oh, it's just a fusion is done on Augur,

306
00:37:09,587 --> 00:37:17,327
you're hitting Augur minimum inhibitory concentration testing is generally done in broth unless you're using it test,

307
00:37:17,327 --> 00:37:24,587
which is a strip that you can read. Am I see off the the strip that you place on the plate?

308
00:37:24,587 --> 00:37:31,727
So the Meuhedet or Agar is standardized for H has to be a certain certain cat cation and concentration.

309
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:37,847
There are Mueller hidden plates that can have both blood and serum supplementation,

310
00:37:37,847 --> 00:37:46,997
and that is necessary if you're going to say test Neisseria gonorrhea or Haemophilus influenza, they will not grow on just plain more hidden broth.

311
00:37:46,997 --> 00:37:56,867
They have to have vomiting, and the thickness of the plate is standardized because if the plate is too thin, the drug will diffuse too rapidly.

312
00:37:56,867 --> 00:38:03,467
And if the auger is too thick, it will diffuse too slowly. Next slide.

313
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:06,647
Incubation temperatures, 35 degrees,

314
00:38:06,647 --> 00:38:16,867
no CO2 unless you're working with faceted or fastidious organisms such as Haemophilus influenzae or also Neisseria gonorrhea.

315
00:38:16,867 --> 00:38:23,227
Next slide. So how do you select the antimicrobial agents?

316
00:38:23,227 --> 00:38:30,487
There are standard patterns of drugs that you test for specific organism groups.

317
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:38,137
And so if we're doing antibacterial ACA, we have a standard group of antibiotics we test if we're doing staph aureus.

318
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:46,447
We have a standard group of antibiotics. We test and so on. We also have to know about any acquired resistance patterns in Lau Local Florida.

319
00:38:46,447 --> 00:38:55,297
You'd know that if you were working in the lab, you know, if you were seeing a lot of mercil or a lot of other resistance types,

320
00:38:55,297 --> 00:39:00,277
some antimicrobial agents can only be tested by one test method and not by another.

321
00:39:00,277 --> 00:39:06,487
So there may not be discs available to do our distribution testing.

322
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:11,767
So you may have to do both micro dilution or in each test if those discs are not available.

323
00:39:11,767 --> 00:39:15,107
The site of the infection also makes a big difference.

324
00:39:15,107 --> 00:39:23,227
There are different interpretations if the infection is in the urinary tract versus in skin or a wound, and so on.

325
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:27,877
And then, of course, we generally don't report drugs that are not in the formulary.

326
00:39:27,877 --> 00:39:30,247
We keep that information in the in the lab.

327
00:39:30,247 --> 00:39:36,997
Now our infectious diseases partners, the physicians can always call us and ask us if we can test another drug,

328
00:39:36,997 --> 00:39:41,377
cause the patients resistant organism is resistant to everything else.

329
00:39:41,377 --> 00:39:46,967
If we can't test it, we can certainly send it out to be tested somewhere else.

330
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:56,747
Next slide. So we want to directly measure the activity of one or more antimicrobial agents against and isolate.

331
00:39:56,747 --> 00:40:00,287
And we, as I said before, we can do it by just diffusion on Augur.

332
00:40:00,287 --> 00:40:10,847
We can do it by broth dilution in this maybe macro in tubes or each tube would have a different concentration or micro dilution in a micro titer tray.

333
00:40:10,847 --> 00:40:17,717
And that's a much more efficient way to do it unless the drug that you want to test is not available in a micro-targeted tray,

334
00:40:17,717 --> 00:40:25,217
in which case you can make broth dilutions in a variety of different tubes or send it out to another lab that can do that.

335
00:40:25,217 --> 00:40:31,637
So we want to directly measure the presence of a specific resistance mechanism for some isolates.

336
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:36,197
And so this would be we want we have specific tests for SBL.

337
00:40:36,197 --> 00:40:42,767
We have specific tests for carbapenems production and so on.

338
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:52,147
Next slide. So we're still talking about methods for detecting resistance, and we want to directly measure antimicrobial activity, how do we do this?

339
00:40:52,147 --> 00:40:58,537
As I said before, conventional methods are broth dilution in tubes or just diffusion.

340
00:40:58,537 --> 00:41:01,357
But the kind of commercial systems,

341
00:41:01,357 --> 00:41:11,587
whether it's micro scan or biotech or some other commercial system can do it with the least generally the least amount of personnel time involved.

342
00:41:11,587 --> 00:41:20,567
Now the systems are not inexpensive, but they do say the laboratory a lot of time and standardization is excellent.

343
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:27,467
Next slide. So going back to conventional methods, you need a pure culture.

344
00:41:27,467 --> 00:41:36,437
That's 16 to 24 hours old. And you would touch four or five isolated colonies and then you would put your loop

345
00:41:36,437 --> 00:41:43,827
that has touched four or five isolated colonies into a tube of saline and mix it up.

346
00:41:43,827 --> 00:41:52,067
You have to vortecs it. And then if it's not, if it's too concentrated, add more saline to adjust it down to a point.

347
00:41:52,067 --> 00:42:01,187
Five Macfarlane If it's not concentrated enough, you may have to touch a few more colonies and get some more organisms in there.

348
00:42:01,187 --> 00:42:10,637
Critical that you don't have mixed cultures and E. coli when you're trying to do a susceptibility on staph aureus,

349
00:42:10,637 --> 00:42:14,267
if they're mixed, they yield unreliable results and delay reporting.

350
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:19,637
They have to be repeated with pure culture isolates. There's no no variability.

351
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:26,017
The if they're mixed, they have to be repeated with a pure culture isolate.

352
00:42:26,017 --> 00:42:32,437
Next slide. So going along with brought with conventional methods, let's talk a little bit about broth dilution.

353
00:42:32,437 --> 00:42:36,397
So there are various concentrations of agent in broth. Each is in a different tuber.

354
00:42:36,397 --> 00:42:44,407
Well, and I've already told you that the range varies for each drug because you're going to have a range of drugs.

355
00:42:44,407 --> 00:42:47,917
So the am I see what might be in the middle for an organism,

356
00:42:47,917 --> 00:42:54,727
you'd want a large range because you're not going to be testing not only E. coli, but club pneumo and Serratia and other gram negative.

357
00:42:54,727 --> 00:43:04,127
So you're going to have a whole range of drugs. And they're typically tested at doubling dilutions and a term that you're going to hear.

358
00:43:04,127 --> 00:43:10,727
When you're talking about susceptibility testing is the Missy, the minimum inhibitory concentration,

359
00:43:10,727 --> 00:43:16,787
and that is the lowest concentration required to visibly inhibit growth.

360
00:43:16,787 --> 00:43:24,927
And so you're saying, how can a machine visibly inhibit growth, but they're set up to do that?

361
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:36,957
Next slide. If we're doing both micro dilution, the testing volume is zero point zero five two point one milliliter and that's in a micro titer tray,

362
00:43:36,957 --> 00:43:46,547
and the final concentration of the organism for inoculation will be five times 10 to the fifth colony forming units, per M.

363
00:43:46,547 --> 00:43:53,597
Next slide. So here's an example of a micro scan plate and.

364
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:59,427
You can see it has time enten Jimmy Pan-Am as Trans Am.

365
00:43:59,427 --> 00:44:04,677
And various drugs, ceftriaxone level suffer pain going down.

366
00:44:04,677 --> 00:44:08,907
And you can see that there are different deletions and this is all inoculated, you make your suspension,

367
00:44:08,907 --> 00:44:18,867
you put this suspension into the machine, you put the plate in the machine and the machine does all the inoculations.

368
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:25,887
So before we had micro, tighter testing, micro solution testing,

369
00:44:25,887 --> 00:44:33,837
we had just a fusion testing and this is what I've referred to as Kirby Bauer and the the publication was published by Bauer,

370
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:41,397
Kirby, Sherriff's and Turk. And this is they were up at the University of Washington Medical Center and this was published in 1966.

371
00:44:41,397 --> 00:44:54,177
This is one of the Bibles of clinical microbiology antibiotics susceptibility testing by a standardized single disc method.

372
00:44:54,177 --> 00:45:04,047
So this was published, as I said in 1966, and many labs were performing test diffusion susceptibility testing, but there was no standardization.

373
00:45:04,047 --> 00:45:12,417
So the results between labs really didn't mean anything. So this paper was published under the guidance of the World Health Organization,

374
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:21,717
and it provided a standardized method for susceptibility testing by the disk diffusion test.

375
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:30,147
Next slide. So the principle of this involves the placement of antibiotic containing discs onto Mueller Hinton agar plates.

376
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:36,657
And remember, the Mueller Hinton Auger has to have a specific page, has to be a specific fitness.

377
00:45:36,657 --> 00:45:43,227
And what happens is the plate is inoculated. Let's go down here to the second group of of statements.

378
00:45:43,227 --> 00:45:48,447
The plate has been previously inoculated with it with a bacterial suspension.

379
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:54,627
And so that because it's got the suspension growth will be even across the entire surface of the plate.

380
00:45:54,627 --> 00:46:01,557
And the plate is when you put your swab in the suspension, you streak your plate in three directions.

381
00:46:01,557 --> 00:46:11,037
Make sure the plate is totally covered with the organisms. And as soon as the disk comes in, you have a device that drops the disks onto the plate.

382
00:46:11,037 --> 00:46:14,727
As soon as the disk comes into contact with the moist August service,

383
00:46:14,727 --> 00:46:21,627
the water is absorbed into the filter paper of the disk and the antibiotic diffuses into the surrounding medium.

384
00:46:21,627 --> 00:46:31,737
And as the distance from the disk increases, there is a long mythic logarithmic reduction in the antibiotic concentration.

385
00:46:31,737 --> 00:46:43,007
So if the zone is very large? That means that the organism is very susceptible and will have a very low.

386
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:46,337
Am I see? But here we're not measuring devices. We're measuring discs.

387
00:46:46,337 --> 00:46:55,547
You'll have a very high, large its own size and that will correlate to a very susceptible organism.

388
00:46:55,547 --> 00:47:07,067
So, so down the second bullet, if a plate is previously inoculated with bacterial suspension, simultaneous growth of bacteria occurs on the surface.

389
00:47:07,067 --> 00:47:15,647
And when a critical cell mass of bacteria has reached inhibitory, activity of the antibiotic is overcome and bacterial growth occurs.

390
00:47:15,647 --> 00:47:22,277
So we go onto the next slide. So we have, as I said, it's the most standardized test in clinical microbiology.

391
00:47:22,277 --> 00:47:27,587
We have specific time is required to reach critical mass and that's characteristic of each species.

392
00:47:27,587 --> 00:47:33,587
It's influenced by the composition of the media and influenced by the temperature of incubation.

393
00:47:33,587 --> 00:47:42,617
And we also have a critical cell mass, which is a sharply margin in its circle of of inhibition of bacterial growth with the disk in the center.

394
00:47:42,617 --> 00:47:49,547
So to interpret the test for each disc, we have to measure the disk, excuse me,

395
00:47:49,547 --> 00:47:57,077
measure the zone size of the zone diameter across the center of the area of, of course, the center of the disk.

396
00:47:57,077 --> 00:48:03,527
So the concentration of diffused antibiotic at the edge of the zone is called the critical concentration and approximates the AM.

397
00:48:03,527 --> 00:48:07,817
I see the don't zone diameters are meaningless if they don't refer to AM.

398
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:16,497
I see correlates and interpret interpretive guidelines, and all that data is in the classified documents.

399
00:48:16,497 --> 00:48:20,657
And download it in the labs also. Next slide.

400
00:48:20,657 --> 00:48:27,717
So going on about distribution, testing, so once again, the surface of the agar plate is seated with a lawn of your test organism.

401
00:48:27,717 --> 00:48:36,857
Remember, swab is treated in three directions. Make sure the plate is totally covered and then the discs are dropped onto the onto the plate.

402
00:48:36,857 --> 00:48:42,767
We use a destroyer that can drop up to 12 discs at one time on the plate.

403
00:48:42,767 --> 00:48:44,357
They're well spaced out.

404
00:48:44,357 --> 00:48:53,597
You incubate the play for 18 to 24 hours and then manually measure the diameter of the zone, a vision of inhibition across the center of each disc.

405
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:59,877
So you're getting the widest, largest part of the zone. Next slide.

406
00:48:59,877 --> 00:49:11,187
So with this highly standardized test, we grow the bacteria on non inhibitory medium for our suspension,

407
00:49:11,187 --> 00:49:18,357
we use sterile nutrient broth such as chipchase soy broth, about four to five meals and a screw cap tube.

408
00:49:18,357 --> 00:49:25,457
Once again, we standardize it to a point five Macfarlane Turbidity Standard.

409
00:49:25,457 --> 00:49:30,947
And then we use a vortex to make sure that it's well, mixed up.

410
00:49:30,947 --> 00:49:36,047
We can use a few blocks or photometer to look through and make sure it is equal to that point.

411
00:49:36,047 --> 00:49:43,217
Five, Macfarlane will hit US standards for the meteor hitting all your plates the must be of the media.

412
00:49:43,217 --> 00:49:51,047
The auger must be must be between seven point two and seven point four and the auger must be four millimeters deep.

413
00:49:51,047 --> 00:49:57,497
There's no that cannot vary. It has to be for my very tenth of a millimeter on either side,

414
00:49:57,497 --> 00:50:06,407
but we go for four millimeters deep auger and the commercial plates are very good at hitting, at being at that four millimeters.

415
00:50:06,407 --> 00:50:15,487
If they're hampered, there's more variability and we can use calipers, a ruler or a template for measuring the zone sizes.

416
00:50:15,487 --> 00:50:24,277
Next slide. And we do have to do a lot of quality control on this test for gram positive organisms,

417
00:50:24,277 --> 00:50:32,187
we use staph aureus and a specific strain of each of these for our inner bacteria, a.k.a.

418
00:50:32,187 --> 00:50:40,227
We use an E! Coli Standard Quality Control standard, and for oxidase positive gram negatives, we use a Pseudomonas aeruginosa original.

419
00:50:40,227 --> 00:50:45,567
So once again, a specific isolate ATCC Islip.

420
00:50:45,567 --> 00:50:49,647
So what happens when there's a new drug every once in a while?

421
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:53,427
If a year or two a new drug will come out, we want may want to test it.

422
00:50:53,427 --> 00:51:00,057
We have to. When testing a new drug, we have to do 20 consecutive days of testing without any errors to make sure

423
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:05,187
that we can do it correctly and we get the right zone size if there's an error.

424
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:11,727
We have to extend the two consecutive days to 30 consecutive days without in the years after we meet.

425
00:51:11,727 --> 00:51:17,127
This goal is a 20 consecutive days without any errors or a 30 consecutive days if without any errors.

426
00:51:17,127 --> 00:51:26,097
After there's been a previous year, then we can do weekly quality control if we have an established IQ.

427
00:51:26,097 --> 00:51:32,057
Otherwise, we have to do it daily. Next slide.

428
00:51:32,057 --> 00:51:35,627
So once again, to prepare the inoculum, we use a sterile loo for a swab,

429
00:51:35,627 --> 00:51:40,727
we lightly touch the top of four to five identical colonies and inoculate the broth incubated

430
00:51:40,727 --> 00:51:48,917
at 35 °C until the growth matches the turbidity of a 0.5 Macfarlane standard vortex it.

431
00:51:48,917 --> 00:51:53,387
If it's too concentrated, we can diluted into another tube of broth. We can.

432
00:51:53,387 --> 00:52:00,257
Instead of doing the incubation step, we can just do a direct suspension from an 18 to 24 hour growth of the organism.

433
00:52:00,257 --> 00:52:07,307
A non inhibitory media. And that's very critical. Can't be inhibitory, meaning it has to be non inhibitory media because if it's inhibitory,

434
00:52:07,307 --> 00:52:11,347
we would have gotten rid of the organisms that we want to detect.

435
00:52:11,347 --> 00:52:18,857
Once again, standardize 2.5 Macfarlane, and this is the preferred method for our more difficult organisms,

436
00:52:18,857 --> 00:52:22,967
such as Haemophilus Neisseria gonorrhea, strep pneumonia and staph aureus.

437
00:52:22,967 --> 00:52:30,187
But we can use it with all types of organisms. Next.

438
00:52:30,187 --> 00:52:38,407
So going on with a inoculum preparation. So within 15 minutes of adjusting the turbidity of the inoculum suspension, we put a sterile swab into it,

439
00:52:38,407 --> 00:52:42,457
as I said, and ring the swab against the inside of the tube to remove excess fluid.

440
00:52:42,457 --> 00:52:48,127
And we're going to inoculate that Mueller Hinton Auger that has has to have come to room temperature.

441
00:52:48,127 --> 00:52:53,647
And as I said before, inoculated in three different directions rotating the plate 60 degrees each time,

442
00:52:53,647 --> 00:53:07,437
replace the plate and let it sit for up to 15 minutes to make sure that the surfaces is optimal for elution of drugs from the discs.

443
00:53:07,437 --> 00:53:08,817
Next slide.

444
00:53:08,817 --> 00:53:16,647
So then we use a multi-dose dispenser, which it makes it much easier than using sterile forceps for each disc and place the discs on the plate.

445
00:53:16,647 --> 00:53:25,737
What's that? Disc has been dropped on a plate. You can't move it because the the drug begins to immediately diffuse from the disc.

446
00:53:25,737 --> 00:53:31,077
Generally, Tampa each disc gently tamp, each just down to ensure uniform contact with the organ.

447
00:53:31,077 --> 00:53:35,787
You can do that with with forceps or a loop,

448
00:53:35,787 --> 00:53:41,607
and the discs should not be any closer than 24 millimeters from the center of one disc to the center of another disc.

449
00:53:41,607 --> 00:53:49,497
Because of this, we don't use the regular sized petri plates. We use a large petri plate and then we just replace the the lid.

450
00:53:49,497 --> 00:53:56,877
We invert it. We place it into 35 degree incubator. No CO2 for 16 to 18 hours before we interpret the results.

451
00:53:56,877 --> 00:54:03,577
We use a SELASI guidelines for interpretation. Next slide.

452
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:12,097
So once again, conventional methods, this diffusion zone sizes have been correlated with MRS the minimum inhibitory concentrations

453
00:54:12,097 --> 00:54:18,297
to establish interpretive criteria and no more than 12 or 13 discs on a plate.

454
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:23,217
Next slide. So now we're going to talk about measuring the zones, and I know I've mentioned this before,

455
00:54:23,217 --> 00:54:31,947
but we measure them with a calipers or a ruler to measure the zone of complete inhibition around a disc and we measure across the center of the disk.

456
00:54:31,947 --> 00:54:35,877
We measure to the nearest millimeter. And we include it.

457
00:54:35,877 --> 00:54:39,627
So we we measure from one end of the zone across the center of the disk to the other.

458
00:54:39,627 --> 00:54:47,327
Enter the zone edge of the zone. We don't use a magnifying glass to measure the zones we use and unaided eye.

459
00:54:47,327 --> 00:54:51,957
Well, you could have your glasses or contact lenses on, but you know, magnifying glass.

460
00:54:51,957 --> 00:54:59,487
Well, when we do it from the back of the petri dish with transmitted light against the black, non reflecting background.

461
00:54:59,487 --> 00:55:03,567
But we can't do that if the disk, if the media has blood in it.

462
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:13,557
So these have to be viewed from the top with the lid removed and use reflected light to illuminate the plate.

463
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:18,567
Next slide. So this is the back of a mule hitting plate.

464
00:55:18,567 --> 00:55:29,377
And you can see these three drugs. I have no idea what they are because the name would be on the top of the disk are totally resistant.

465
00:55:29,377 --> 00:55:39,697
I suspect that most of these are susceptible, but this one on the right hand side of the plate might be bordering resistance.

466
00:55:39,697 --> 00:55:45,007
You can see that the edge of the zone is not nearly as clear as some of the other for the other drugs, and the zone is smaller.

467
00:55:45,007 --> 00:55:50,227
So maybe that drug has a larger molecular structure and it doesn't diffuse as fast.

468
00:55:50,227 --> 00:56:00,097
Or maybe there's a little bit resistance showing up here. I can't tell you without knowing what the drug is and what the size of the zone is.

469
00:56:00,097 --> 00:56:01,417
Next slide.

470
00:56:01,417 --> 00:56:11,347
So we also have a newer methods antibiotic gradient diffusion, and the drugs are applied to in a gradient to a test strip by a company in Sweden.

471
00:56:11,347 --> 00:56:19,177
A B bio disk. The plate is once again streaked with an organism, as it is for the distribution of the curvy Bauer test.

472
00:56:19,177 --> 00:56:20,857
And then you apply the strip in general.

473
00:56:20,857 --> 00:56:33,337
Use this to test maybe a new drug or to get it's a it gives you an C type of answer mm or concentration, not mm.

474
00:56:33,337 --> 00:56:38,467
So the agent diffuses away from the strip to inhibit growth. And then there should be a picture.

475
00:56:38,467 --> 00:56:41,967
Yes. So this is kinesiology and you can see this.

476
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:47,497
This testing was done on blood agar. So it's a more fastidious organism.

477
00:56:47,497 --> 00:56:56,707
And you read the Am I c at the point that the not the hemolysis, but the point that the growth crosses the strip.

478
00:56:56,707 --> 00:57:06,547
And so it looks like it's at about point two three, maybe 0.3 to no higher than point three two point one six is a little bit too low.

479
00:57:06,547 --> 00:57:10,027
So because point two three is not a doubling dilution,

480
00:57:10,027 --> 00:57:18,237
it would be between zero point one six and point three two and it would be point three two that is reported.

481
00:57:18,237 --> 00:57:23,037
So let's talk a little bit about it, about interpretive categories we have susceptible.

482
00:57:23,037 --> 00:57:30,987
And that means the agent may be appropriate for therapy. Resistance is absent or clinically insignificant.

483
00:57:30,987 --> 00:57:34,677
We have a category of intermediate.

484
00:57:34,677 --> 00:57:44,067
And this means that the agent may be useful if the concentration at the side of useful is the concentration at the site of infection is appropriate.

485
00:57:44,067 --> 00:57:49,497
It may not be useful as other susceptible as some other susceptible agents,

486
00:57:49,497 --> 00:57:59,517
and it serves as a safety margin for variability in testing and then resistant, and the agent does not appear to be appropriate for therapy.

487
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:05,887
The dose inhibiting or the dose inhibiting growth is not achievable in serum.

488
00:58:05,887 --> 00:58:13,017
Or the organism possesses resistance mechanism or mechanisms.

489
00:58:13,017 --> 00:58:17,697
So those are your three interpretive categories. Next slide.

490
00:58:17,697 --> 00:58:22,377
Now there are automated systems, and I've mentioned that, so even with an automated system,

491
00:58:22,377 --> 00:58:29,157
you have to do a manual preparation of the Iceland suspension. You place the suspension into the system.

492
00:58:29,157 --> 00:58:30,397
And then, as I said before,

493
00:58:30,397 --> 00:58:41,517
a completely automated inoculation and then incubation is is automated in the machine and the machine will read the results at a specific time frame,

494
00:58:41,517 --> 00:58:45,177
whether it's 18 hours, twenty four hours or so on.

495
00:58:45,177 --> 00:58:50,037
And then, of course, because it's totally automated, there will be automated interpretation and data management,

496
00:58:50,037 --> 00:58:56,417
and that data will flow to the patient's chart if it's set up that way.

497
00:58:56,417 --> 00:59:01,907
And of course, the machine will tell you if there's an error or something's wrong, they need human help.

498
00:59:01,907 --> 00:59:08,237
Next slide. So here's an example of one piece of equipment the micro scan walkway inoculated here.

499
00:59:08,237 --> 00:59:13,937
You put the plates in and boom, it does everything and was the computer attached to it.

500
00:59:13,937 --> 00:59:16,037
Here and we've already seen the microscope and plates,

501
00:59:16,037 --> 00:59:24,227
who's the Vitek to put everything in here and it does does the work hook to the both of them are hooked to the computers?

502
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:32,087
And here's an example of the Vitek to play. You can see it is much smaller than the microscope and the typical 96.

503
00:59:32,087 --> 00:59:40,577
Well, am I see plate? And so you don't get as many results and you can't go back and go into one of these wells and take

504
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:47,787
an alcohol out and look to see if maybe a contaminant got in there or there was some other problem.

505
00:59:47,787 --> 00:59:54,527
Next slide. So what about direct detection of resistance mechanisms, so.

506
00:59:54,527 --> 01:00:00,317
The first one that we've talked about, extended spectrum beta lactamase is east deals.

507
01:00:00,317 --> 01:00:04,927
These are due to mutations in plasmid encoded beta lactamase.

508
01:00:04,927 --> 01:00:06,627
These.

509
01:00:06,627 --> 01:00:16,557
And they hydrolyzed the extended spectrum cephalosporins that astronomers such as ceftriaxone wood is an extended spectrum beta like beta liked him.

510
01:00:16,557 --> 01:00:21,897
More than 100 different types of Isbell's have been identified, and the number is always growing.

511
01:00:21,897 --> 01:00:29,427
And unfortunately, these isolates are often resistant to other classes of antibiotics also.

512
01:00:29,427 --> 01:00:32,877
So because we know that some organisms,

513
01:00:32,877 --> 01:00:41,097
the organisms shown here at the bottom E coli club pneumoniae club actually Toka and Proteus Mirabilis are known to have

514
01:00:41,097 --> 01:00:51,797
extended Spectrum Isbell's Isbell's that we have specific interpretive criteria for these four groups of organisms.

515
01:00:51,797 --> 01:00:59,757
In groups for specific organisms, if they're an SPL producer, they have different interpretive guidelines.

516
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:06,597
So an example of an SBL would be a with cephalosporin alone.

517
01:01:06,597 --> 01:01:14,487
The zone is way too small, but if you put the cephalosporin in a beta lactamase inhibitor, you get a susceptible zone of inhibition.

518
01:01:14,487 --> 01:01:22,107
And this is an easy way to think about what does a beta lactamase do forces due to susceptibility testing,

519
01:01:22,107 --> 01:01:24,957
you cannot interpret, oh, you can interpret this as resistant.

520
01:01:24,957 --> 01:01:33,117
But if you give a different drug, a cephalosporin and a beta lactamase inhibitor, it will be susceptible.

521
01:01:33,117 --> 01:01:37,887
Next slide. So going on with direct detection of resistance mechanisms,

522
01:01:37,887 --> 01:01:46,377
we have the carbapenems aces and these are plasmids that code for enzymes that destroy penicillins,

523
01:01:46,377 --> 01:01:55,227
cephalosporins, carbapenems and Astra Anam and they potentially the carbapenem aces can potentially be transferred to other organisms.

524
01:01:55,227 --> 01:01:58,587
So we're talking about much more serious things here.

525
01:01:58,587 --> 01:02:05,997
They can be inhibited by beta lactamase inhibitors such as Clive Zelenak Acid and tasto backed him.

526
01:02:05,997 --> 01:02:11,397
They used to be called Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenems,

527
01:02:11,397 --> 01:02:20,817
and you may have heard of KPC and that's what KPC stands for because it carbapenem cases were first discovered in Klebsiella pneumoniae.

528
01:02:20,817 --> 01:02:26,397
Now they're called Kreis or carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae because

529
01:02:26,397 --> 01:02:36,607
they're found in other enteric gram negatives and Serratia and E. coli and so on.

530
01:02:36,607 --> 01:02:46,397
Next slide. So once again, talking about the carbapenems says they can resemble Isbell's extended spectrum beta lactamase,

531
01:02:46,397 --> 01:02:50,777
and they may be inhibited by Clive Linick acid in vitro.

532
01:02:50,777 --> 01:03:00,917
But what we have to look at is are they resistant to earn a pension and earn a pension is the best inducer of a carbapenems.

533
01:03:00,917 --> 01:03:09,257
If if you tested in a gram negative and it's resistant to our Typekit them, you call it a carbapenems producer.

534
01:03:09,257 --> 01:03:17,027
Even if other carbapenems may appear intermediate or susceptible. You call it a CRE because they can be.

535
01:03:17,027 --> 01:03:28,637
They can destroy the antibiotics when they're in use the carbapenem antibiotics so we can use a modified hoj test for for detection.

536
01:03:28,637 --> 01:03:38,747
And so the carbapenems of the test organism destroys ERDA Pan-Am, allowing your control organism, which is a carbapenem susceptible E. coli, to grow.

537
01:03:38,747 --> 01:03:49,397
And we have a modified hoj test that will tell that for us, if it's CRE positive, if it's positive for carbapenem resistant.

538
01:03:49,397 --> 01:03:56,717
The guidelines and national guidelines, probably international guidelines, also is that the laboratory reports all beta actives as resistant,

539
01:03:56,717 --> 01:04:05,657
even as they test us as sensitive because of that ability to induce the resistance.

540
01:04:05,657 --> 01:04:14,387
Next slide. So here is a Hodge test, and that's the test that used to determine if an carbapenems producing organism is present.

541
01:04:14,387 --> 01:04:17,927
So this here we're testing M.E. PNM, it's used here.

542
01:04:17,927 --> 01:04:24,497
We've got a lot a lawn we struck, stripped out our plate in three directions with a quality control.

543
01:04:24,497 --> 01:04:30,797
E. coli, it's ATCC. Twenty five, nine twenty two and there are three suspect organisms.

544
01:04:30,797 --> 01:04:40,377
And what we have done is drop our drug, our any Pan-Am in the center of the plate and our three control organisms.

545
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:51,687
Are streaked from almost touching the disc out to the edge of the plate, and you can see the the organism at six o'clock,

546
01:04:51,687 --> 01:04:56,757
the in the bottom produces a carbapenems and will grow all the way up to the disk,

547
01:04:56,757 --> 01:05:03,807
whereby the other two organisms are and are not able to grow all the way up to the disk.

548
01:05:03,807 --> 01:05:15,447
OK. And so the other two that don't grow all the way up to the disk they stop at the zone of inhibition are not carbapenems producers.

549
01:05:15,447 --> 01:05:21,277
But this one at the bottom at six o'clock is.

550
01:05:21,277 --> 01:05:31,537
So there are other types of resistance that we need to detect in the lab and inducible clindamycin resistance is one that we use to detest.

551
01:05:31,537 --> 01:05:37,827
And if it is. The organism has inducible clindamycin resistance.

552
01:05:37,827 --> 01:05:46,417
It will be resistant to macrolides, and that can occur through an efflux mechanism called MSAA,

553
01:05:46,417 --> 01:05:54,067
where it pushes the drugs out of the cell or ribosome alteration called ERM.

554
01:05:54,067 --> 01:06:05,407
So if the resistance pattern is erythromycin resistant and clindamycin susceptible, it could be the efflux mechanism MSAA or an inducible, erm.

555
01:06:05,407 --> 01:06:12,187
But if both drugs Clinton and aristo are resistant, it's a constitutive, erm, gene in the bacterium.

556
01:06:12,187 --> 01:06:20,017
And both drugs will always be resistant. Next slide.

557
01:06:20,017 --> 01:06:27,727
So here is photos of erythritol and Glinda, the retro drug is always on the list.

558
01:06:27,727 --> 01:06:34,207
The Clinton drug is always on the rise, right? And here we have two large zones no resistance.

559
01:06:34,207 --> 01:06:43,957
OK, here we have an efflux mechanism and you can see that this is resistant, this drug, it cannot be used here.

560
01:06:43,957 --> 01:06:50,957
We have inducible erm, and you can see the erm that came out of this organism.

561
01:06:50,957 --> 01:06:57,557
The organism stimulated by this drug is affecting the zone on on the on the right,

562
01:06:57,557 --> 01:07:02,507
at the Clinton, on the right hand side and then constitutive, erm, is here, it's in.

563
01:07:02,507 --> 01:07:10,307
It's affecting both erythromycin and clindamycin. Next slide.

564
01:07:10,307 --> 01:07:22,247
So here we have an exam type question, which result is a positive test sensitive to a and kunda resistant to a throw resistant to

565
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:32,797
erythromycin Sibley resistant to Linda or constituent tively resistant to clindamycin.

566
01:07:32,797 --> 01:07:37,657
And so I can't ask you that. I'm going to let you figure that out.

567
01:07:37,657 --> 01:07:45,997
Well, I'll tell you right now it's resistant to erythromycin and intrusively resistant to calendar.

568
01:07:45,997 --> 01:07:48,997
OK. Going on laboratory strategies for testing,

569
01:07:48,997 --> 01:07:59,437
so we want the goal of effective strategies include these drugs that are relevant for the organism and the site of the organism in the body.

570
01:07:59,437 --> 01:08:09,547
We want accurate testing results, good quality control and we need to effectively communicate the results to the health care team.

571
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:13,867
Next slide. So how do we assess relevance?

572
01:08:13,867 --> 01:08:20,347
What is the clinical significance of the Iceland? Is it an tissue?

573
01:08:20,347 --> 01:08:24,847
Is it in urine? Was it from an infection on somebody's arm?

574
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:34,467
What's the clinical significance of the isolate? What's the predictability of susceptibility against drugs of choice?

575
01:08:34,467 --> 01:08:43,227
How available do we have reliable, standardized methods available, and the answer to that is almost always yes, but for some new drugs, we don't.

576
01:08:43,227 --> 01:08:47,847
And selection of appropriate agents.

577
01:08:47,847 --> 01:08:56,947
We want the physician to be able to check a select appropriate agents for therapy of a patient based on susceptibility testing results.

578
01:08:56,947 --> 01:09:03,187
Next slide. So clinical significance of the organism. Is it abundant in the directory if we do a direct smear?

579
01:09:03,187 --> 01:09:08,047
Do we see it all over some specimens? We don't do direct smears, so that would not work.

580
01:09:08,047 --> 01:09:11,917
What is the ability of that organism to cause disease in that body site?

581
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:16,387
That's critical because if it can't cause disease in that body side, it's not. It's not important.

582
01:09:16,387 --> 01:09:20,907
For the most part it might be, but for the most part it's not. Is it a colonizer, a pathogen?

583
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:26,467
If it's a colonizer, we would expect to see it in the body all the time. And what is the body site of isolation?

584
01:09:26,467 --> 01:09:31,357
So all of these go together for clinical significance. Next slide.

585
01:09:31,357 --> 01:09:38,407
What's the predictability of susceptibility? So testing you don't have to do testing on susceptibility is predictable.

586
01:09:38,407 --> 01:09:43,787
So we know that all beta hemolytic strep are susceptible to penicillin.

587
01:09:43,787 --> 01:09:52,087
You don't need to test it. However, if the patient is allergic to penicillin and other battle actives, yes, you would need a susceptibility.

588
01:09:52,087 --> 01:10:03,337
And are there clinical requirements for the patient that can result in exceptions for predictability of susceptibility?

589
01:10:03,337 --> 01:10:12,877
Going on. What is on the next flight availability of standardized methods so testing cannot be performed?

590
01:10:12,877 --> 01:10:15,757
You have a standardized method, does not exist.

591
01:10:15,757 --> 01:10:25,667
So just because we can drop a disc and get a zone if we don't have a standardized method of doing it or interpreting the result, we can't do it.

592
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:29,447
So we have to have the method standard and miss standardized method.

593
01:10:29,447 --> 01:10:38,447
And we have to have the interpretive guidelines, this is absolutely required and information and methods are available for most pathogenic bacteria.

594
01:10:38,447 --> 01:10:50,627
But when we come to fungi, no CARDIA and acid fast bacilli, we need different methods, we need different guidance, we need different media and so on.

595
01:10:50,627 --> 01:10:56,537
And so many at most labs do not test do susceptibility testing on these organisms.

596
01:10:56,537 --> 01:11:04,157
If they need susceptibility, it will be sent out to a laboratory that specializes in that type of of test.

597
01:11:04,157 --> 01:11:10,457
So if you're talking about acid fast bacilli needing assistance, if it's a tuberculosis state,

598
01:11:10,457 --> 01:11:17,657
the Michigan State lab is one of the five centers of excellence in Michael Bacteriology, and they could do the susceptibility.

599
01:11:17,657 --> 01:11:22,707
However, it's a really rare organism and most likely will get sent acid fast bacillus

600
01:11:22,707 --> 01:11:27,887
Mycobacterium that we rarely see it will get sent probably to National Jewish in Denver,

601
01:11:27,887 --> 01:11:33,737
which is a specialized laboratory for that kind of testing.

602
01:11:33,737 --> 01:11:39,677
And so on. OK, selection of agents, we've already discussed the criteria,

603
01:11:39,677 --> 01:11:47,777
all agents to test what is the organism identification or group of organisms are there acquired resistance patterns?

604
01:11:47,777 --> 01:11:52,697
If there's acquired resistance patterns, we may need to test a ditch additional drugs.

605
01:11:52,697 --> 01:11:59,267
What is the testing method uses? This diffusion is at a minimum inhibitory concentration or is it something else?

606
01:11:59,267 --> 01:12:07,517
What is the site of infection? Because if the site, if at the site of infection, maybe penicillin doesn't get in,

607
01:12:07,517 --> 01:12:15,547
there's no use reporting that and that is the drug on the formulary of the institution.

608
01:12:15,547 --> 01:12:21,427
Next slide. So we also once we've done susceptibility testing, we need to communicate our results.

609
01:12:21,427 --> 01:12:27,967
And before we can communicate the results, we need do a prompt and thorough review of the results.

610
01:12:27,967 --> 01:12:33,667
We need to resolve any unusual results. Are the unusual results true or are they false?

611
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:40,087
Do we need to retest something and we can add messages to the susceptibility reports

612
01:12:40,087 --> 01:12:45,187
that can explain potential therapeutic problems that can help clarify issues?

613
01:12:45,187 --> 01:12:53,047
And if and also physicians are always welcome to call the microbiology laboratory

614
01:12:53,047 --> 01:13:00,097
at any institution if they have a question about a susceptibility test result.

615
01:13:00,097 --> 01:13:11,377
Next slide. And that is it, I would ask you if you have any questions, but it is a recorded lecture, so ask me in class if you have any questions.

616
01:13:11,377 --> 01:13:14,286
Thank you so much. Hey, I'm done with the first lecture.
