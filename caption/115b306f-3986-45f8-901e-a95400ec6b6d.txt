1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,096
>> Stand up.

2
00:00:02,096 --> 00:00:05,990
>> All right, you does it feel good to stand up?

3
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,627
>> Yes, god I hate sitting.

4
00:00:07,627 --> 00:00:09,410
>> It's good for your health.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:14,255
So yeah I would appreciate it if you would all stand up because I

6
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:16,315
just want to make a point.

7
00:00:16,315 --> 00:00:17,390
Thank you.

8
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:23,578
So, how many of you, if you took an antibiotic

9
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:30,255
in the last month would you please sit down today?

10
00:00:30,255 --> 00:00:35,272
If you took an antibiotic in the last

11
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:39,796
year would you please sit down?

12
00:00:39,796 --> 00:00:47,664
If you took an antibiotic in the last two years would you sit down?

13
00:00:47,664 --> 00:00:52,968
And if you can't remember, if you know you took an antibiotic

14
00:00:52,968 --> 00:00:58,476
in the last five years when you sit down, and it's it's the best

15
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:04,598
you remember you never took an antibiotic in the last five years, wow.

16
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:09,857
So, healthcare infection prevention control, one of the major pillars of this

17
00:01:09,857 --> 00:01:15,450
is about preventing things like antibiotic resistance and antibiotic resistance.

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,737
And antibiotic resistance it means that the bacterial treating drugs or

19
00:01:20,737 --> 00:01:26,390
virus treating drugs that we have resistance means, that they won't work.

20
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,780
And the biggest thing that makes them get not work, is having people take them.

21
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:37,323
And we are all guilty in this room, and we're probably really glad that we

22
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:41,718
took them that what we wanna do is we wanna protect our drugs that we use so

23
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,540
that they are effective.

24
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,960
And so that's one of the key components of healthcare, infection prevention and

25
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,550
control.

26
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,677
And so that's what this certificate is about, and

27
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:56,188
particularly this certificate was designed for people who want to work in

28
00:01:56,188 --> 00:02:01,440
infection as infection preventionists in any kind of health care setting.

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,906
So you may or may not have heard of an infection preventionist but

30
00:02:05,906 --> 00:02:11,282
it's basically like a public health worker on the front lines in hospital and

31
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:16,740
large health care systems, and they do everything public health people do and

32
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,420
which makes it a really exciting job.

33
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:26,063
They create policies so that we use, for example antibiotics effectively,

34
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:31,683
but they also create policies about how rooms should be cleaned,

35
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:35,054
about what people can and cannot wear,

36
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:40,574
about whether we take people's temperatures when they visit,

37
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:44,560
they do health education about hand washing or

38
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,731
about transmission of infections, and they do a lot of surveillance.

39
00:02:50,731 --> 00:02:54,358
They do a lot of data analysis, outbreak investigation,

40
00:02:54,358 --> 00:02:59,465
they inspect every piece of equipment that comes that's ordered for the hospital

41
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:04,294
that's a new piece of equipment, to make sure that it can be properly clean.

42
00:03:04,294 --> 00:03:09,054
If you ever been has anybody been in the basement of a hospital where

43
00:03:09,054 --> 00:03:11,015
they clean the equipment?

44
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:13,870
Yeah, it's a little scary.

45
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,480
They have to take every piece of surgical equipment apart and

46
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,797
make sure it's properly cleaned, so that we don't get transmission of

47
00:03:21,797 --> 00:03:25,940
an infectious agent when they use that instrument on someone else.

48
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:30,112
We've had several outbreaks that have been associated with instruments and

49
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:33,062
that's why when George Bush had to be in the hospital,

50
00:03:33,062 --> 00:03:36,740
he bought all new instruments for himself.

51
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:41,390
So infection prevention really includes all kinds of things that you

52
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,220
are gonna be learning about as you're here in your master's program.

53
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:50,638
What is surveillance, how you analyze surveillance data,

54
00:03:50,638 --> 00:03:54,364
how you write reports, how you detect outbreaks,

55
00:03:54,364 --> 00:03:58,436
how you intervene on outbreaks, how you assess risks,

56
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:04,530
how you complying with regulations, how you just basically prevent infections.

57
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,559
You use microbiology, you'll interact with laboratory health education,

58
00:04:09,559 --> 00:04:13,065
environmental exposures, cleaning disinfection,

59
00:04:13,065 --> 00:04:17,789
evaluating new projects, preventing infection during construction,

60
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:22,620
renovation which is a real problem, waste management and also research.

61
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,989
So, the other thing that we have is we have a specific

62
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:36,440
internship program associated with this certificate that's competitive.

63
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,965
That's these little pictures are of our our students, they were with

64
00:04:40,965 --> 00:04:45,890
the work sometimes in different settings, we like to wear the bunny suits.

65
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,030
You can see for example the picture,

66
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:54,398
can you see that picture of the bottom we can't really anyway,

67
00:04:54,398 --> 00:04:58,349
it's showing how they dispense materials for

68
00:04:58,349 --> 00:05:02,417
cleaning instruments in one of the hospitals.

69
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:08,227
And on the left, no you're right they're standing in front of a rodeo clave which

70
00:05:08,227 --> 00:05:14,150
is where they take all the waste that can be kid autoclave safely from the hospital.

71
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,730
And it's a giant autoclave steam everything where it chops

72
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:24,340
everything up and steams and disinfect it smells really horrible.

73
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:30,417
So we went out of visiting that, so what the particular focus into the range and

74
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:35,484
what someone has an infection prevention is does is specifically

75
00:05:35,484 --> 00:05:40,030
to to avoid you getting sick when you come into a hospital.

76
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:43,897
And that's one of the really horrible things is that a lot of infections

77
00:05:43,897 --> 00:05:46,640
are acquired while you're in the hospital.

78
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:51,162
And we know that unfortunately a lot of the bacteria that are circulating in

79
00:05:51,162 --> 00:05:53,748
the hospital are antibiotic resistance,

80
00:05:53,748 --> 00:05:58,860
because if you're in the hospital you much more likely to get an antibiotic.

81
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:06,040
So, I'm not doing this same as everything else, right?

82
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,412
This is that one of the nice things we do on the,

83
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:14,343
internship program is not only do you get to visit, if your intern,

84
00:06:14,343 --> 00:06:18,090
you get to visit every place that we have an intern.

85
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,847
So you get to see compare different health care settings which is really a lot

86
00:06:22,847 --> 00:06:23,377
of fun.

87
00:06:23,377 --> 00:06:27,659
And this last summer this is a we put on the bunny suits at four different

88
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:32,236
hospitals and saw the differences in how different hospitals handle their

89
00:06:32,236 --> 00:06:36,026
cleaning and disinfection, which is of their instruments.

90
00:06:36,026 --> 00:06:39,224
And I tell you every hospital is different, so

91
00:06:39,224 --> 00:06:42,190
it's it's really an interesting event.

92
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:46,660
And the students some of the policies, they're all involved in

93
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,791
different research type things which you can see if you go to our website,

94
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:57,880
you'll be able to see the type of things that students have been doing since 2011.

95
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:02,842
And the last thing I like to always say is, as you all know where

96
00:07:02,842 --> 00:07:08,194
the school of public health is, and this is where the hospital is.

97
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,818
and the only thing between the hospital and the and

98
00:07:11,818 --> 00:07:15,103
the cemetery is the school of public health.

99
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:20,724
[LAUGH] So, I hope so if you would like to visit our website and

100
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:25,448
we will have an in depth orientation session, and

101
00:07:25,448 --> 00:07:38,773
this is some of the interns so if you have any questions happy to take them.

102
00:07:38,773 --> 00:07:41,695
Been a long day.

103
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:46,641
Well I hope to see some of you at the did I missed it, sorry.

104
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:48,241
>> Is visitation required?

105
00:07:48,241 --> 00:07:48,850
>> I'm sorry.

106
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,841
>> Is visitation required?

107
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,770
>> No it is not required.

108
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:56,139
And in fact if you take the certificate, the second level of course and

109
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:01,177
there's the three required courses, two of them are hospital epidemiology and

110
00:08:01,177 --> 00:08:03,940
the second level hospital epidemiology.

111
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,860
You actually will do hand hygiene surveys in a hospital setting, so

112
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:11,260
you will get some of that handle on practical experience.

113
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,906
I have to say that this, all the students that have done the internship

114
00:08:15,906 --> 00:08:19,924
program who have applied for IP positions have gotten them,

115
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:23,840
which is a really big deal to get straight out of school.

116
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,141
And a lot of the students with the certificate alone have been successful.

117
00:08:29,141 --> 00:08:35,908
So, it gives you a big leg up for working and infection prevention.

118
00:08:35,908 --> 00:08:39,337
And infection prevention is a lot of fun.

119
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:46,312
So that's and it is possible to go up very quickly up the management ladder that way,

120
00:08:46,312 --> 00:08:51,718
two of the students so we've only been running since 2011 and

121
00:08:51,718 --> 00:08:57,140
one of the students is already a VP, so you can go fast.

122
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,240
[LAUGH] Alright, anything else?

123
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:00,808
Yes.

124
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:03,051
>> What information is required?

125
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:08,834
>> The informational session, there's all the informational sessions,

126
00:09:08,834 --> 00:09:13,589
it's going to be Monday September 10th and 12 to 1, but

127
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:16,410
all of them are listed here, sure.

128
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,126
Anything else?

129
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:23,138
Happy to chat with you, and welcome to our program I know is a,

130
00:09:23,138 --> 00:09:26,997
orientation is always overwhelming so I hope you go home and

131
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:34,889
sleep on it some of them come back, nice meeting you [APPLAUSE]
