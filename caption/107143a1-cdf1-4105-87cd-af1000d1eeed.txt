1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:08,220
Okay. So today what we're discussing, we talk about source codes.

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:13,200
We talk about bacteria. We talk about monkeypox.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,980
We talk about the. The the E coli.

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:25,540
How often would you take them? How can we save more of these very key chemicals that we need to find a way to monitor them?

5
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,030
So one thing we can do is really say indicators.

6
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:36,989
Several qualified the major source of microbial contaminants from fecal material in human or animal.

7
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:47,580
Fecal. Human right. So. So we can't use indicator to say if there's absence of the physical contamination we are pretty comfortable with no positive.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:54,750
Oh there's there's a the peasant president has a very low level of that's pose no risk to public health.

9
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:01,680
Okay. I hope that this information some time is not enough.

10
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:06,960
For example, we just colleagues and we want to know the specific causes.

11
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,910
How widespread they are, what concentration on it.

12
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:24,730
Okay. So like a chemical detection, we need to develop a protocol, ways to monitor, to detect the microcosms, microbial patterns.

13
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:31,770
Have any of you involved in this? In the in the protocol department?

14
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:40,520
And you want me to talk about the weapons? Okay. So if not kind of okay.

15
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:48,700
Part of what the moment has been like creating a procedure protocol to detect what methods you are using and how to do it.

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:57,200
And and I just mentioned any method that you have, for example, regulations, if you've tried to comply,

17
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:06,580
how to use a standard like the standard method from we did everything in the business, the customers as it would be.

18
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,260
So as you speak of our sample collection, how do you create the samples?

19
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,860
Okay. How to protect yourself, how to trust, for example, how the process, your sample,

20
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,540
how the analysis on and what reagents you are using, who will do their work.

21
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:33,200
And then even for the sample collection, because comes of them and talk about what do you do with samples?

22
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:43,690
How much was it temperature sometimes in weather and one for so that's dope you have to have all this could be added to

23
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:54,220
the hundred piece and on top of that you have to have the quality control and quality assurance if you see it's capable.

24
00:02:54,260 --> 00:03:03,110
I mean, you have to understand that how safe how do you make sure that every time you process your samples, but then it creates the reliable.

25
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:09,140
So it's not only just for microbial analysis, but also for the same way.

26
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:15,380
So so when they when you are required of them, you work with the health department.

27
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:24,440
Okay, good. The local health department, is it. Yes. Can you report from as well to monitor this say you collect in the.

28
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,570
We see the beach on the beach.

29
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:40,220
Okay then when you got some caucuses, people typically this division of all these states and then you also need to follow that steps.

30
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,870
Follow those steps. And also, you need to do quality control.

31
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,610
Every time you do that kind of political, you speak.

32
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:57,410
It's not only just for I mean, if you work in industry center, you have public support.

33
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,560
If you working in the. It uses.

34
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:07,340
You have to use a soap. You to sleep.

35
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:12,940
So what we discussed, you were talking about metaphor to analysis.

36
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,650
How do you characterize them? But it affects the detention on a monthly.

37
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,300
Is a process is a process political?

38
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:29,020
One very important, if you need to consider, is how do you collect samples, whether you collect samples.

39
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:38,600
How do you withdraw that to yourself? Is a very sensitive. But what is feasible the closer you assemble?

40
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,640
What is feasible to cripple this summit?

41
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:57,590
I mean, just to give you one of the reasons why, one of the chances we are doing that now, we go to now to switch funds from the doors of an office.

42
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,020
There's a lot of issues. One is whether you can get access to the map.

43
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,810
Some of the memo is really embedded that use some of that route area.

44
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:21,770
And if we do we we went through that. I have a few pictures I didn't for the if you have a gold leaf in the woods, you ought to find.

45
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,980
I think that's that's amenable to the central.

46
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:40,200
Sometimes you also need to. Make sure that the men who got the sewage that really have input from one beauty, not from others.

47
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:48,450
If you want the information just to the the and the some of the metal hoses in the middle of the street.

48
00:05:49,570 --> 00:06:00,020
In the middle of the street. Okay. If you go there now early in the morning, it's high traffic is a rush hour.

49
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:07,709
What can you do? What can you do? So that's all these you need to consider in order to correct the repeated examples.

50
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,800
And then we do this. So here is again, this is a.

51
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,590
Will you get a job? Any job? A water. I just saw you before.

52
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,690
This is a drawing of what we can observe under the microscope.

53
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,540
And then different types of morphology of organisms,

54
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:33,730
how they came to what will be some of the trained technicians which we can use in the way they put on the microscope.

55
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,900
Okay. Just by the shape of this morphology, they may be able to tell you what kind of the.

56
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:48,110
Let's need to be very experienced. I mean, we can feel it, but it's not some of the dolls here.

57
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:53,060
Probably not a lot of weight. So that but some of these are very similar.

58
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,780
You know, we'd be able to hear that. But forget what? This is a distinct morphology.

59
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,300
Yeah, they can do it. They can do.

60
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:12,710
But still, we need to find a ways now to differentiate, to detect, to tell what kind of organism are they and or with virus?

61
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,940
With the virus. Why is it very tiny, right? Less than one microns is probably less nanometers.

62
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:26,100
So it's very come out really by letter, I hope every with a microscope.

63
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,690
It's very rare kind of camera once a day.

64
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:36,580
So you really need to develop methods for that analysis. Again EPA list of these contaminants.

65
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,209
This is relatively easy to detect, but EPA developed the standard measures.

66
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:51,470
So again, if you are required or asked to develop the methods for these regulation organisms, then you can go to the EPA to find the standard method.

67
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,430
Okay. The fact is that a lot of times.

68
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:04,990
They don't have to stand on. Then you need to develop your own measures for the for the analysis.

69
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,260
For them to assess forward to when this outbreak occurred.

70
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:17,560
There's this dynamic of the four that. It took CDC a long time to develop such a massive.

71
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:25,450
And then they make mistakes. And that W.H.O. also has the means to measure developing measures.

72
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,610
The U.S. alone, people using CDC said we want we need to have our own measures.

73
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:40,880
But it took the CDC quite a long time. To deliver that message, to validate her measures, and then we could try to disprove the fund as a mistake.

74
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:46,480
You may make a mistake. So they have to do it again.

75
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:56,210
So you try to detect the missing measures as take time and time consuming, and then you need to find it as well.

76
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,990
Okay. So so now you've been tasked to do this.

77
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:07,700
What can you do with that? So there are some things you need to consider. There's no one misses, like a suitable for all passive.

78
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:16,190
Okay. You may have a similar way to collect the samples, but there's no single method for all kinds of methods for this.

79
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:28,250
Sometimes it's sporadically. Some of it's not really like survival for these occasions.

80
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:36,740
Two techniques technically say the coliforms still are the best way we can monitor.

81
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Okay. And that is relatively easy.

82
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:46,490
Easy. The other thing is really the amount of presence present is a very low amount.

83
00:09:49,210 --> 00:10:00,670
So when we talk about the current form, sometimes they tend to five sales per year, but from that we're talking about ten or one copies per vehicle.

84
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:13,480
What can you do? So, for example, here night. Crypto, you may need to click back for the water of Southern need of some of them you to consider.

85
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:21,010
So what do you need to do? In fact, you need to do experiments, develop methods, develop a protocol to see how much assembly you need to collect.

86
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,430
You also to take them just to detect them.

87
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,940
Thousand feet of water. I mean, think about it. So how can you get all these water collected and then processed?

88
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:39,820
Recover organism from samples is difficult. Sometimes damage.

89
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:47,900
Sometimes they cannot grow. So. Become someone who cannot really culturally look.

90
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,120
They cannot really even though they are there, I cannot go to them.

91
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:55,600
The dye or the chemicals, and everybody is still infectious.

92
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,220
There's a lot of guys in that state. It's called vibe and culture.

93
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:07,520
What do you think? Okay, so it's been missteps, recovery, communication, purification, separation.

94
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,250
I say any kind of Ivy League resembles.

95
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:21,520
You need to do this recovery [INAUDIBLE] interest and then you need to do the purification separation from the matrix and then do the analysis.

96
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,390
So think about water, right? So you take the river water or sewage.

97
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,770
I have water. There are different metrics.

98
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,750
Okay. So what do you do? You separate them.

99
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:42,870
From these images, especially for the river water, for the sewage, you find good ways to separate them to the kind of that.

100
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:54,320
It's like if you go to football games. Anyway, anyway, I found the football games to go there every time.

101
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:05,090
No. Yes. Okay. So if you go to smoking now, you go there and everyone will wear these Michigan gear and then you find out, okay, how can I find it?

102
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,110
And you stay there.

103
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,980
So how can my friend is like that?

104
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,360
I mean, even more difficult like that is the most difficult I could, but.

105
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,480
And even more difficult like that because there's so many different type of.

106
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,200
You can see old people of the air. And there is.

107
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:37,010
You could. People annual or whatever that means to do that and mix together.

108
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:43,030
So. So that's reason why it's quite a challenging effect to just to find these microfilms.

109
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:51,340
But in the form of homework to do. Sometimes it could.

110
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:56,930
We lost legs and then this is the grab samples and grab samples.

111
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,590
And then this is called sampler sampler.

112
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:09,170
You can cook like practically every else you set up every hour, click sample and then mix them together if you do that.

113
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:13,880
Or you can click just grab samples, go there, for example.

114
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:21,920
And we'll see the problem with this picture and we'll notice that is she could easily trip and fall over.

115
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:31,189
Okay. That's a house. Yes. She is putting her hand in the water next to the sampling,

116
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:40,360
and that could contaminate the water itself from whatever's on her handiwork and contaminate the sample that she collected.

117
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,360
Okay. So so through the bare hands.

118
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,200
No. You have to wear gloves.

119
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,170
Where the coat. Lab coat for this. Okay. And.

120
00:13:54,350 --> 00:14:02,520
And here. So just just figured when you take a picture sometime like this.

121
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:08,370
Be careful, you know, because that's not the right way, professional way.

122
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:14,899
We feel fine. Okay. But. Well, you know what? There's a lot of news agencies,

123
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:23,360
media there continue to talk about the multiples it and when they come to my to somehow we come

124
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,419
to the lab to take a photo and be very careful to what I what I'm doing because you know,

125
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,479
they're like the Detroit News, for example, or whatever.

126
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,460
I just go off. So this is another way he can see it.

127
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:41,360
Right. You know, is it. That's not the right way. It's not a professional way to do it.

128
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:45,740
I mean, come on. Really is the appeal has to grab the sample from the people from the law.

129
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:52,069
Okay. My mission. I mean, it could be. You said they could contaminate the lake and the river.

130
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:56,360
Right? But also could you could get exposed facilities.

131
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:02,340
Looks like a drinking water model. Something like a century MITCHELL of.

132
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,700
If one of your own bottles and accidentally drink from it. Sorry.

133
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:16,330
The bottle she's using looks like an actual drinking bottle, so they might accidentally open it up and drink it with samples of.

134
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,140
That's. That's probably what this is. This is the water bottle.

135
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:25,180
This is for the water sampling. So that's full of samples and.

136
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,380
But there's different ways you can do. Like sometimes you have.

137
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:35,630
And then this is like ultrasound you can use to continuous click the samples and mix them.

138
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:49,930
So that's a lot of the kind of information available from the US, EPA or USGS that talk about example coaching,

139
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:55,450
fieldwork, how to be cautious about the full, what steps I just mentioned.

140
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,760
There's still not a protocol as OP how we developed took up all of those steps.

141
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:04,300
How do you assemble, what material use, what point do you use this?

142
00:16:05,410 --> 00:16:10,430
And this is one of the these are one more professional. Okay.

143
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:16,690
This one is more professional. And this isn't to do that, Nancy.

144
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,850
The for the Kobe. Okay. For the Kobe.

145
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,670
And then you can see here lab coats, shields, masks.

146
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:33,050
And Scrubs. Okay. So that's the the right way we are doing.

147
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:36,910
You also need to protect yourself. Protect yourself.

148
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,860
So one of the concerns when we start with this kind of analysis, for example, when we go to the memo,

149
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:52,630
this the people were asked, you know, do we have the coronavirus in the air when they go the example there get exposed to.

150
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:57,150
Okay. To get exposed to. So you want to protect them?

151
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:05,880
That's the the PPE, the personal protection equipment has to be used and all these cases.

152
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,070
And the fact we also have the. City worker city staff to block the streets.

153
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:19,240
Could they have come with us to probe the street before we can do the sample collection and.

154
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:30,060
They are going out every step before synagogue, every day in the morning to record these to the samples.

155
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,380
We have about. Criticize.

156
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:43,500
On campus. Okay because of that campus that's the the where we get to summer vacation so in effect it's pretty close to.

157
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:49,329
Just regret to say. The suits, the suits, Thai food tech.

158
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,940
It had always been obvious that the cost twist took one sample.

159
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,460
One. 100 500 minutes of the sample.

160
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,760
How much would it cost? A few thousand. Okay.

161
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,710
About 500. Okay. But five is even more expensive than the perfumes you're using.

162
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,750
If we buy this and it's even more expensive than that.

163
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,470
Okay. So we are. I mean, this is very precious.

164
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:22,330
So we would try to take advantage of we we stole some of them for the allowed for houses.

165
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:31,120
But this is how we do it. Okay. How would we. But you need to take that into consideration.

166
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:39,850
Okay. It's not like like when the when we do this Coates analysis people from your way through all the buildings.

167
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,410
Okay. Why would do everywhere. Right.

168
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:50,690
What was your question like, Evan? It's always good to see.

169
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,070
Resources. If you have manpower, you have an understanding.

170
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:02,710
So it's more like simple. Just go there to collect the samples and then make meaningful.

171
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:05,860
That's right. So that's all the cost associated with this.

172
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,040
And for the virus samples. Sometimes you need to connect to work, continuous flow, sound need of the water.

173
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:21,690
So what you can see here, they have these connected to the to the to the to the tap and then they have the filtered the water

174
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:26,160
continuous flow through that when they clean the samples or the or they continue to the virus.

175
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:33,989
This is another way if you can move the fields to the water samples, if you have a stroke and then you have water,

176
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,860
food, then you have this different way that you need to because either.

177
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:47,020
And the other thing is really just mentions this, the nutrition is very low.

178
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:54,490
Right. The consumers know, especially for virus at this time is small and they have a lot of metrics.

179
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:01,540
What do you do? You need to concentrate them. Okay. To separate them, covering them from the water metrics.

180
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,670
And this is another approach they're using for the filters out your filters.

181
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,340
And then somehow we do the presentation.

182
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:17,740
And then the issue with micro contamination is the different methods, the different microphone, how they use different message.

183
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,760
Can we use one method for all for one category?

184
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:26,920
Yes, you can use a similar message. So how could you then separate the countries?

185
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,790
Questions. Krieger samples current results separate them.

186
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:39,330
And then now you can say. How do you do that analysis?

187
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:50,420
Okay. How do we do that? So that's the ultimate example.

188
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:57,230
I just they use the stadium, right? So if you take a photo of the stadium now, you see all the people there.

189
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,130
So at first you need to separate people from the penguin.

190
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:10,850
Okay. They do that by the facial recognition, for example, and they can see through facial recognition.

191
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:16,400
So that's a similar way for doing this. I mean, they'll probably worry about this facial recognition.

192
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:19,970
But that's one of the ways you can think about it.

193
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,840
How can we detect fight some specific physical virus?

194
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:33,200
Okay. Based on this was just based on the characteristics of this special type of.

195
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:41,400
It's basically targeted. So this is a virus entirely and this is bacteria and it's a proposal.

196
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:45,780
And based on these characteristics of biochemistry, cellular components,

197
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:50,100
anything we can think of, we can use for the characterization, for the detection.

198
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:57,150
Again, if you think about it, this is different bacterial pathogens mold to the virus.

199
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,340
EPA provides a standard method for this. Okay, this is some measures how they're being developed already.

200
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:11,360
And then the idea we can use. So what are the methods we can use to to to detect and to quantify them?

201
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:19,240
One of the measures is culture, business deals, a stand that you feel to me and you want to go to the to agreement.

202
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:26,450
You begin to see. They said samples of all the samples it will capture.

203
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:31,910
And then a couple of days until you only swab samples back into the culture and then they'll tell you what kind of testing.

204
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:39,139
I think they're good at it. Then they steal some of the gold standard methods based on the college.

205
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:44,780
You just call them. Okay, that's gruesome. And then the different ways to do them and then the course.

206
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:54,170
But much more to this is the historically how to estimate to from a patient and the uses that if you have this conforms.

207
00:22:56,130 --> 00:23:02,500
Here. And then you'll see the quality is green because the bacteria goes there and then you have the metabolites,

208
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:09,210
the change, the green and all they can produce death bubbles in the media.

209
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,720
And then you can detect, confirm that they are there.

210
00:23:13,130 --> 00:23:17,310
They are there. And they're based on this. The company people are kind of lazy.

211
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:28,080
And so for these industrial products, you know, you take the samples different of the effects and make a lot of money from this test.

212
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:28,650
Basically,

213
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:37,110
they probably select grades and they preassembled you by changing the comment and then they can tell you what's the number of the conference,

214
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:49,800
for example, in the College of Business. And then there's another very common use methods is memory filtration, memory filtration, basically.

215
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:58,240
This we use also quite often in the lab right now, you take the samples, you have them, you use the filters.

216
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,950
This is kind of filter 0.4, four, four or five or 0.2 microns.

217
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:08,540
The water pustules of all the bacteria, all the microgram seals is retained on the membrane.

218
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:12,020
And then you throw on the culture and the media so they can select.

219
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:21,680
You really can start grow. For example, with chloroform, you have the broth or with fecal coliform, you have this fecal specific media.

220
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:32,210
And then you go through them, you catch them 24 hours and then you see the color of the the colony because colony forming units so anew.

221
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:38,000
And why we committee forming units, we see how many fields we see.

222
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,850
Colony for me, Eunice. So one colony.

223
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,870
They could come from multiple fields. Okay.

224
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,390
Could come from across the ocean. So we'll call colony form units.

225
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,660
Okay. See if you. And then you can buy the morphology and the shape color.

226
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:05,020
You can see. Yeah, this is really. And cuneiform or this is a total coliform and.

227
00:25:07,610 --> 00:25:15,760
We're quite a selective media. Basically to me that means that you can select the forms.

228
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,290
But it's not 100% selective. Okay.

229
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:31,010
Sometimes I'm alone. Can also go right. So you need to based on the morphology of the ship, the color the the the.

230
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:40,610
The other characteristic of this colleague to tell you this is confirmed and again, some experienced technician can tell right away.

231
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:45,650
Yes, there is this. So that's the the the.

232
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:53,960
Some of the magical methods. Again, it's people use differential power, chemistry,

233
00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:00,440
metabolism and then to steal the color to see out of them, add the substrate and then they change the color.

234
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:03,890
They can tell whether it is bacteria or other.

235
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,790
The have you back back to the quote from to the models and then you have these sculptures.

236
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:16,130
It's full of frozen substance object and then you can see if you use it, you'll realize you'll probably see the colonies.

237
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:25,130
That's another way to confirm that. Again, EPA has all the standard emissions you can use and also suppliers.

238
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:32,749
So we can see here that different company supply these products and you do produce

239
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:38,240
some of these these products for these specific methods for specific micro-organisms.

240
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:46,260
What's the issue with culture method? It takes time for the old production form.

241
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:54,090
Okay. So let's assume that. Assume now you go to the beach, you swim there.

242
00:26:56,150 --> 00:27:01,250
Okay. And then maybe some spills.

243
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,850
From. Sewage system upstream.

244
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,580
And then the health department. There goes the effort to take a look.

245
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,990
So the clean water samples bring them back to the lab and they capture them.

246
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:26,280
It took about 24 hours. Was at the start from collaboration to the to the results.

247
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:30,510
That's probably 48 hours at least. Okay. We're having.

248
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,820
Though it's just one more down stream, like those in which there was originally, there could have been more concentrated upstream.

249
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:46,070
And then as that time went on, you now have all doubt, right?

250
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:54,560
And I think the whole track system kind of changed that. But since then people have also been swimming in the water in the primary.

251
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,400
The results back then, the not so water quality change was kind of rapidly.

252
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:03,379
So by the time you do get the results back, it might be irrelevant, right?

253
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:03,640
Right.

254
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:15,260
So as all of this is, it's better to have back real time with customers as anything kick out of 24 hours is a minimum time for them to gather results.

255
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:22,810
And then at top of that, you get the samples, you bring them to the lab and into that adjusted data.

256
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,600
That's probably 48 hours, but in reality, it could be a week.

257
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:30,500
Okay. In reality, it could be a week.

258
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:39,240
During that period of time. Instead it no more contamination and more people already get exposed.

259
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:48,460
Do they have models that they can predict how much it would spread if they have a different concentration?

260
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:56,559
Do you have some mathematical models to predict the spread? But that's that's for the research lab we are using.

261
00:28:56,560 --> 00:29:01,570
These are for the health department, local health departments to draw from people to treat.

262
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,610
There's no. I'm really surprised.

263
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:12,819
I'm really surprised. I mean, it would be great if we developed this model like every local health department

264
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,710
had people just simply Peggy and then they see that see to that would be great.

265
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,320
But that's not really the case. For example,

266
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:28,100
I would talk about my personal checking the Washoe County Health Department that come to my lab to ask for help to do this much business strictly.

267
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:34,990
Because they don't really have the capacity of doing that. Even with culture businesses that they contract.

268
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:41,780
When someone else does to the culture for their company, culture for them, but then they don't have the capacity.

269
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:46,580
But this was tricky. So now my lab basically is helping them get to the Mac.

270
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:55,820
This was. Okay. So so extremism is spread in schools then that is still used and required by law.

271
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,210
Okay. We know this limitation. So what do we need to do?

272
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,410
We need to develop some some fast methods, Brecker, Pace, the methods,

273
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:13,150
some of the immunological methods, some really execute based on basis for that detection.

274
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:19,550
So this is, for example, the. 60 f i g bacteria.

275
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:24,370
Awesome. We all have the DNA, you know, body, any, any micro in the life.

276
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:31,360
We have the DNA of our body and then you can find is Evan only is eighth in G the

277
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:39,190
array real G but the sequence because it can have some specific signature embedded.

278
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:42,430
In this on the Orleans's DNA.

279
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:53,320
We can't we can't fight with bacterial with ZOA, with this we can't find is this target, for example, the problem idea or some other phone challenges.

280
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:59,140
You can find these. Chris Evans ACG, for example. Here you can find a sequence of sequences that clip.

281
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,530
Let's make the fingerprints. Right, everyone has a different fingerprint.

282
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:09,670
Okay, but here in the DNA, you can find the the the fingerprint of the DNA sequence.

283
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:14,439
So, again, I just mentioned this is like a stadium. All these people are together.

284
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,770
How can you find them? Okay. So what do you need to do?

285
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:24,070
This is how we do it. Did a bit of a DNA extension.

286
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,560
So a community that these are samples.

287
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:34,300
We don't go with the idea or not think about this, meaning the different particles there and then we need to find one from them.

288
00:31:34,870 --> 00:31:43,299
So what are you to do now? We get all of them together. We have DNA from them, from these samples and all DNA from all the samples.

289
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:48,730
And then we do the allowances for the PCR with the DVD or with the DNA sequencing.

290
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,450
And then we find we can with we can find the signature sequence.

291
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:56,980
Then if the figure is there, then yes, their presence.

292
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:03,900
Okay. They also can tell you is not only just sticking to the sequence,

293
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:11,750
but also how many of that copy of that second sequence in this example they can punch.

294
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:23,970
Okay. 25. How many copies there. So this is commonly used methods for the for for the detective of.

295
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:39,000
Detention of the the the being execution sequence so that for the physical monitor of the virus bacteria it's very common use method because what.

296
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:45,460
Before the amplification called PCR. Any of you do the PCR before?

297
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:50,320
The GP said before. What? Like actually run the PCR?

298
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:59,040
I heard about PCR run, which is being done for COVID, but not okay for like testing tests about like actually.

299
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,550
Right. So it's a bit like a biology class.

300
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:08,459
Okay. So that's great. I mean, this is PCR is really a great message in that biology in America,

301
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:18,840
biology and the people who made the PCR to win the Nobel Prize is because the DNA is obviously by all the time that big cells everything together.

302
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:25,110
How can you differentiate by like, okay, so you need to amplify the specific fragments so that you can do that unnoticed.

303
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:30,360
And this is a continuous reaction I just give you.

304
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:50,920
Sure. Probably has a video for that. Okay.

305
00:33:51,340 --> 00:34:03,629
So this is how you get this. Here is one copy and then next cycle through the cycle.

306
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:06,810
Copy. Copy. Copy. Appropriate copy. Exposure. Growth.

307
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,660
So after up to make. So disciples.

308
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:23,470
This is how many copies you can have. That's exponentially amplified.

309
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,730
I think about times twice. Double, double, double, double.

310
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:31,210
That's how you can get the. The the title club. Columbus.

311
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:35,590
I'm sorry. Can you explain again the purpose of why it needs to copy?

312
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:46,980
The DNA and the target WHITE And so what is the objective when it when they copy does that narrow the matching of the.

313
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:56,870
No, it's not matches because when you have this one copy, one copy that you have one copy in the mixture.

314
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:00,990
Right. You cannot really depict it with one copy.

315
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:05,370
So what you need to do, you need to amplify.

316
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:10,190
To amplify that so that you can see them, you can detect them, you can monitor them.

317
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:16,929
Always just going back to the same logic that you had with like the filters on my building in concentration.

318
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:23,810
Yeah. Yeah. I kind of take the fact that we tend to tell you that that's basically all the others.

319
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:30,260
If all your targets are still the same, but if your target they just empty, find your target.

320
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:36,030
Okay. That's how you give them. Like to the. To the. Various copies.

321
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:40,860
I mean, you can't. You can't. You can't you. Could there be any mutations within the PCR test?

322
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:44,510
Yeah, but. But that's. That's not us doing that.

323
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:51,870
Is there some error that you could use to them but normally with that and does its job to consider that.

324
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,989
So basically you have one copy and then you have I mean,

325
00:35:54,990 --> 00:36:03,560
this is the primer or the parameter of this is very important because the primer is specific because that's the signature sequence you can decide.

326
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:10,820
And this is a PCR machine. Okay. This is a one of a kind PCR machine.

327
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,360
What do you have here? You have this amplified.

328
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:18,920
Then you can use the geo electrophoresis to separate them. And this stain that we can see is.

329
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,480
The PCR is so commonly used now, so important for my apology and for the depiction on the web.

330
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:32,100
So. So basically if you have the bends before, you can say yes, they are present if.

331
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:37,810
No beds. That means they are located. The opposite.

332
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:44,770
They say this is all samples. You wanted to pick the color, you designed the priming, the for the ecology, and then you create them to amplification.

333
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,930
Now, sample 12. This no. There's no precedent.

334
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,380
But all the examples you have. President. Okay.

335
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,670
This provisional PCI is just kill you, whether the presence or absence.

336
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:07,070
And then what he can have is cause real time PCR, quantitative PCR,

337
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:15,320
not only to tell you whether they are present on Mars, but also to tell you how much, how many copies?

338
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:22,460
How many copies. This is the old model. This is all about the model we have.

339
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:27,020
My lab has two very new model now in the lab.

340
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:33,800
So we're running microseconds on daily basis. Basically, we use that to detect and quantify.

341
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:42,510
Different targets than we detect South Korea to detect monkeypox now working on the polio.

342
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:51,030
But he also knows just to stay with the president, but also quantify how much because he uses PCR, he can also quantify how many copies of the.

343
00:37:52,760 --> 00:38:03,410
Okay. PCR made a new version because jump rate the digital PCR is ever more accurate.

344
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,870
Okay. Even more accurate.

345
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:18,290
This is the protocol we are using to detect the corvids or any other type of individual, and especially for the real, for example.

346
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:25,910
You assembled and the owner won't cope with you. How can you quantify the high point?

347
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:31,100
Because everything we do is like arithmetic. I will have a detecting you probably like a decay.

348
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,760
It could be ten copies per annum. You. And that's good.

349
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:39,940
You know, educating them is. As if we can go to one coffee.

350
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:48,200
Point you. With this chocolate dystopia. My lab.

351
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:53,629
We just. Just get these instruments and we all that.

352
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,720
It's cost me $150,000.

353
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:08,720
Okay. Because the $150,000 to do this. Now the real time PCR with the new variant is about 50000 to $50000 get that way

354
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:16,130
and we have to now in my lab and with this with is still pretty good design.

355
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:21,770
It's pretty complicated. See they have the. The.

356
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:26,720
Other topics and then amplify it and then you can give them.

357
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:33,080
So basically what they do, you have all this education I see doing with jockeys or that kind of dilution.

358
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:40,400
And in each job race, hopefully they have all one copy of amplification meetings of jockeys.

359
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:45,470
They do the same time. And then they could take.

360
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:51,490
Rum one by one. Take them. So here you can see the sequel.

361
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:59,470
Great. I mean, the are private and then you call them how many signals you have out of millions of leads.

362
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,880
And they can use absolute quantification.

363
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:14,540
So this is the way can it detect multiple things at the same time or is it just specifying is or is it just always looking for one thing?

364
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:18,170
That's that's that's a good that's a really good question. Yes.

365
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:26,360
Yes or no? So it depend on the reads. Right. So here you have to to color here.

366
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:30,650
Yeah. So based on the color, yes. We can give it to our simpler.

367
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:39,570
Okay. Because now we only have to call it take. So what is that, like an upper limit of only two at a time?

368
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:44,940
Yeah. Two at a time. So. But with the new variant I have in my lab and I would have six channel.

369
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:52,040
So basically we tend to take six pages at the same time from the one reaction.

370
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,240
Ideally. Okay, you need to optimize this. The idea of an absolute program is very sensitive.

371
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:04,930
I mean, it's just incredible. I mean, with this new history, it's not a one copy per.

372
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:15,460
What people won't copy and imagine that is my go to the swimming pools have one job of the sort can soon play they can find it.

373
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:29,400
Okay. So now with with the with the the stadium with Michigan Stadium, we have 111,610, 111,000 seats.

374
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,150
If I want people from there, it's even more difficult at that.

375
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:39,900
Okay. So with this, you we can do it. But we can do that.

376
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:48,210
Okay. Let's take a break and then. You can discuss some other methods for this for the data.

377
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:53,320
So the PCR now is so critical. The PCR is so critical that this is not.

378
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,140
And in fact, if you go to see now see the to the to the clinic,

379
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:06,830
they could do a sample they made to the PCR on that also just able to the PCR rhythm PCR for that.

380
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:31,710
Okay. Next, take a short break. I think.

381
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:15,350
It's. Okay.

382
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:25,759
So another method is used quite a common and often is flow cytometry and the southern hemisphere or sometime in the world but the flow.

383
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:33,530
So tell me that the basic idea is the same. So you have a signature sequence, every organism of the signature sequence.

384
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:37,190
Okay. Especially to space between them patterns.

385
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,020
So what do we need to do when either design a probe? I can label this specific.

386
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:47,090
Always with time they can shine the light.

387
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:50,810
Okay. It's a different color for the major events.

388
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:59,060
And then then what we can do based on those you can pass through these channel, like with the job is the same thing.

389
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:05,000
You did it over the Japanese. Bursting with chocolate solids 10,000 per second.

390
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,590
You can pass through this channel and think rhythm is then read by your eyes.

391
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:14,649
This is what can read it for you. Okay. We can radio for you so we can see here.

392
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:17,860
They they come with all this. One, two, three, four.

393
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,980
Different colors can show different patterns and then quantify them.

394
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:26,710
Okay. So that's really a great way to do this, to quantify them.

395
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:32,770
And this is the issue I have my in my lap is it's $300,000.

396
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,760
Okay. And then?

397
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,940
Now this is developed by a faculty from our university.

398
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:49,010
This one right now, it's a small, small one.

399
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:53,040
So you can bring them to the river, to the lakes.

400
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:57,480
You can get a sample. You can run the samples another time to do the county.

401
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:07,650
Due to the country. So unfortunately, we cannot really I mean, they have been really used like on a daily basis and the research wise.

402
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:15,680
Yes, on a daily basis now. Yes. But this new instrument, this is probably closer than $50,000 to do this.

403
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,890
Some of this work. This is a failed product.

404
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:24,330
This is a field project supposed to be.

405
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:32,220
What they do is that you you do the membrane filtration actually before they do the memory filtration instead of goes on for 24 hours.

406
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,650
So they said we do the depiction right away up to the filtration.

407
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:42,090
So they basically what they do, they use this. Here.

408
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:49,440
And then that incubated with with the dye with a special probe and they use a laser scanning

409
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,840
and then we generate this image and they tell you what according to how many of the.

410
00:48:56,930 --> 00:49:00,860
So this instrument the one that released on the market.

411
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:05,450
Called also 700. $80,000.

412
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,760
That's that. It's very expensive. No bias. No bias.

413
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:14,160
Why would you do this and this? What? What departments have found?

414
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:19,420
It is so dumb. And because it's not required by this.

415
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:23,970
And they start really giving much more information than the controversy matters.

416
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:28,600
So this is what I feel right now. We all have the DNA chips.

417
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:33,850
So the demand for our chips, basically what happens, you can see these dots here.

418
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:43,690
Let's design the probe to detect presence simultaneously, multiple pages simultaneously, so we can detect like thousands and thousands of this.

419
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:46,959
So put on the chip and then you can create the DNA.

420
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:50,110
And then you have like, for example, Ray, one is positive, okay?

421
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:55,190
If you know this assurance is, you know, this is for Romano's, this is semolina.

422
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,110
So you can have all these probes on one chip, small chip.

423
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:06,430
We take the samples, you can take them right away and put a won't like the the centimeter size of course.

424
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:12,830
Size of the. One centimeter by one centimeter.

425
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:23,540
Of the size and they put like a thousand of these problems and then you can detect it simultaneously.

426
00:50:24,110 --> 00:50:30,530
Different projects. And this for them was Germany European countries that developed these so-called approach it.

427
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:39,710
Okay so for the water bomb packages, we kind of know like common border voltages.

428
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:49,010
So basically they detect the the develop the chip to include all these packages and the probes and the chip.

429
00:50:49,430 --> 00:50:54,320
And then when you take the sample, you can do a study and then you can detect a magical pageant at the same time.

430
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,210
And that's called aperture.

431
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:06,010
And the other thing is really because Integral Ball says how much possible have a DNA collection sample crazy DNA expression of this.

432
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:16,070
And so the the the. Within the industry try to do is to develop these two global sensors that integrate all these that you see.

433
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:28,030
So now we have to map, right? So like for my lab, I have several stuff now in my lab through the DNA extraction and into the results.

434
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:33,880
So what they do this instrument is it for this edition of how people do the work.

435
00:51:34,870 --> 00:51:38,620
You just plug your sample and then you have the readout as I do.

436
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:44,800
Okay. It's not as simple as possible, but some people try to do to develop these methods effects,

437
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:49,989
to try to come out with these instruments, to really see that on the market.

438
00:51:49,990 --> 00:51:54,190
Yes. Some of the pretty big some some of they use employ.

439
00:51:54,370 --> 00:52:01,350
Think about if you could do that. We have the walk. Some people may use biological agents.

440
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:06,520
In that area. And so what he can do.

441
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:14,170
It's not ideal to send people to go to the sample and come back out of this.

442
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:24,040
So sometimes they deploy these and you put all sensors there and they take the samples and then sent to the embassy and they send the data to you.

443
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:33,720
By the way, this. Communication. And so that's the Army, for example, we are trying to develop these methods for the minds of these patients,

444
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:40,530
for biological agents in the in the in the war fields, for that for that purpose.

445
00:52:45,390 --> 00:52:52,710
We also have some other imaging techniques like to look at the protein profile,

446
00:52:52,980 --> 00:53:00,000
peptide profile on the cells so that you can tell what kind of pattern are they and use the light,

447
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:05,420
the technology and the science characteristics of these microbes.

448
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:16,290
So it was basically what you can do. You grow the bacteria on the of the alcohol from the membrane and they use this for them to remix copy.

449
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:21,030
Just click this random profile from the cells and can tell you if we're happy.

450
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:28,490
Okay. What is it? So all this new mess that has been developed for the detector and again, this is a lot of fun.

451
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:32,240
That's for this purpose is not really used on a daily.

452
00:53:34,190 --> 00:53:41,860
A routine in the industry. For example, if you go to the Apple Watch in the plants, they have the microbiome that there was a duty to the culture.

453
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:47,180
Okay. That as required by the law. And that's most simple methods.

454
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:55,320
And that's to be used. But if they if you ask them, did you take the code, we cannot do it, that's good enough.

455
00:53:55,470 --> 00:54:01,230
And that's the reason we have these have to use the minelab. We give up all these methods, then we can do it.

456
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:05,760
Okay? We have this expertize. We have all these to do this kind of work.

457
00:54:12,410 --> 00:54:17,860
Any other method you can think of. Okay.

458
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:28,390
So this this paper, this summarizes pretty aware about the things you need to think of.

459
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:35,320
Okay. You can think of. We developed a protocol for this, for example, what kind of opening did you try to detect?

460
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:44,730
That's again, depend on the methods dependent on this. Obviously, the missiles as a result of the vacuum and then the sample processing.

461
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:52,260
Think about the mattress and what is air and water and all of this concentration and regional amplification.

462
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:55,970
And then you've designed the probes. I'm just talk about a sequence.

463
00:54:56,190 --> 00:55:00,570
We need to identify these signature secrets first. By then, if you designed it.

464
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:09,780
I need you to validate. Okay. Quantify this as a quick U.S. qualitative and quantitative assessment.

465
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:20,810
And then you use different ways. Every use a PCR or being a microarray and then you can also think about whether these.

466
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:27,180
And pretty five or usable feasible for people to use how difficult it is to use.

467
00:55:28,410 --> 00:55:32,820
Okay. So that's all the process we have to think of to develop a protocol for that.

468
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:43,350
That's the reason why. One of the reason why when the outbreak of the COVID is the CDC cannot release the methods right away,

469
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:47,670
it took time for them to reduce them as ever, with polio detection, for example.

470
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:54,550
They haven't released that protocol. We tried to give the standard protocol from CDC, but they have come up with one year.

471
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,800
So we have to that's the reason I have to do that with my own political opinions.

472
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:07,620
Okay. So follow kind of follow these steps. But if you if you already do validate all this work, then we don't really do that.

473
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:20,370
But since the CDC hasn't really released and then we have to do them, and then we have to also follow all these steps to get your data values.

474
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:34,060
Okay. Here your data is. So it was helpful to me to talk about that resource record.

475
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:37,340
So what I mean why we do this. So Mr.

476
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:43,589
I now what's the major source of the contamination?

477
00:56:43,590 --> 00:56:48,090
Of the contamination of what? Was a major setback for the majors.

478
00:56:48,090 --> 00:57:05,880
So far from the many simple matters from human or from animals like this to now, if you go to the beach and be a lot of beach,

479
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:12,750
you try to swim with, you come back to U.S. and then the CDC, our health department, will investigate.

480
00:57:14,370 --> 00:57:22,870
They face a high concentration of fecal matter. They. So what they do is allow you to address that immediate.

481
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:30,980
But just with high concentration, that's a simple matter of conformity.

482
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:35,320
If they don't know what the source of these contamination, it is very difficult for them to control what.

483
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:44,980
You may come from animals come from the the the humanitarian with your septic tanks, for example.

484
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:49,210
Okay. So the mafiosos check in effect.

485
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:54,540
It's kind of to help you to identify the source of the information.

486
00:57:57,310 --> 00:58:01,960
Okay. Well, these are from human weddings, from Jews from that.

487
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:11,110
Of them cows. In fact, that can be can be done.

488
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:16,820
Okay. That can be done if you have the fabric. I mean, you conform.

489
00:58:16,850 --> 00:58:20,540
You can try to understand whether this is from.

490
00:58:23,030 --> 00:58:28,520
Which host. Okay. So for dumbo, he has a stem source diffusion movement of microscope population.

491
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:32,560
The worship slots will also be featured. That's already okay.

492
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:40,340
So some of the I just mentioned to the Washtenaw County Health Department contact my lab rat rhythm.

493
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:49,190
My purpose was checking them for them now so they can identify whether he's from the septic tanks or whether he's from just the animals there.

494
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:55,820
And then they can propose because now it's in the in the real world.

495
00:58:56,450 --> 00:59:01,010
So you need to convince people to help you.

496
00:59:01,550 --> 00:59:10,300
Okay. So now that's a. The Health Department farms this high concentration contamination of the beach on the beach.

497
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:16,360
So they have the beach cota notice. And then people want to use it again.

498
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:21,670
People want to use it, but they know there's health risks.

499
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:26,170
So they cannot really do that. So they have to cut it, but they have to go to work on it.

500
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:33,370
So they say if they if it could be, yeah, there could be some that it could be some other sources or septic tanks there.

501
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:37,610
And they. Then. Did you fix it?

502
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:42,680
Okay, but we can't just so happens that stuff, right?

503
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:49,820
But if you ask the other, forgive the city staff to say, can you fix your symptoms?

504
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,610
Because we have this contamination here and then what the response from the.

505
00:59:58,260 --> 01:00:01,880
What could be the response from them? How do you know that?

506
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:09,540
Right. How do you move the content from us? So the background check, you can tell that.

507
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:20,240
Provide the keys. Provide some evidence for that. That the the the what are we to use the Microsoft chicken for?

508
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:25,190
And then you can define that. You could use those control programs for that.

509
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:28,850
So that's why we do this. Also check, you know, how to do it.

510
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:33,740
There's a lot of methods you can use to do much research. Tracking equals drug use.

511
01:00:34,010 --> 01:00:37,450
So different ways you can do it. I will agree to the details for the Mac.

512
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:44,420
This was in fact. Now what we can also do, you can look at how the macOS we can create a water sample.

513
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,680
We can have the macOS like from human origin.

514
01:00:50,150 --> 01:00:53,390
And we can also use the markers or the goods for the tax.

515
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,120
I it for the Cubs. Good for the council.

516
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:03,909
So what that means that if we detect the coliform high country of coliforms and then

517
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:10,150
we detected the human market there and then we like the source come from human cells,

518
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:20,200
I mean, sewage, septic tanks. Now, the city, the health department stuff can bring that data to the U.S.

519
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,250
The manager says, you guys need to do this. You guys.

520
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:32,060
Which identify the source of contamination as from human forms, could be familiar from septic tanks.

521
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:36,720
So please fix that. Okay. We fixed it.

522
01:01:38,750 --> 01:01:42,410
So that's how we can use this method for this purpose.

523
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:49,460
Microsoft is checking, as in fact, and has been also used for for this purpose.

524
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:53,810
But effects can also be used for the forensic examination of the crime.

525
01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:02,710
If the crime scene you can click the sample zero took up my column and then you see

526
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:13,000
that the the attacker's count compared is this profile and then to see this where you.

527
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:18,120
Okay some of them can be used for that purpose.

528
01:02:18,130 --> 01:02:24,520
Okay so Microsoft tracking you take them and you can use this Microsoft check it to identify,

529
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:31,870
to predict or to as to to to have the clue what could be the source of the contamination in the river, in the lakes.

530
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:36,650
And you limit the. So.

531
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:46,360
I hope this will be helpful. In fact, when you start to work, for example, in the health department or whatever any, any places and.

532
01:02:47,790 --> 01:02:52,530
Were you asked to identify any outbreaks of accidents?

533
01:02:53,580 --> 01:03:03,090
And then you can think of all these measures. You may not to know exactly how to do it now by use of this ideal, this method of credit.

534
01:03:03,510 --> 01:03:08,080
So when you develop these, you can get these help because it is a program.

535
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:12,460
And they can help families to do the work that. It says.

536
01:03:13,910 --> 01:03:19,200
Okay. Thanks. We'll see you next week.

537
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:21,390
Thank you.
