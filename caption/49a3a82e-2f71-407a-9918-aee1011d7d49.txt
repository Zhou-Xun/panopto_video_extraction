1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,915
many sources of market failure and
healthcare, such as barriers to entry,

2
00:00:12,915 --> 00:00:17,340
contribute to making markets
concentrated rather than competitive.

3
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,193
Therefore, an important area of
federal state policy is preserving and

4
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:22,590
promoting competition.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,159
Our learning objectives for this video are
to assess the relative merits of private

6
00:00:27,159 --> 00:00:29,707
market-oriented and public legislative and

7
00:00:29,707 --> 00:00:34,161
regulatory approaches to improving
the performance of the healthcare system.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:39,940
Why do we care about preserving and
promoting competition?

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,118
In the words of gainer and colleagues
quote, the virtue of competition is that

10
00:00:44,118 --> 00:00:47,663
organizations are constantly
pushed to do better if they don't,

11
00:00:47,663 --> 00:00:50,661
another firm can and
will take their place, end quote.

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:56,057
We've discussed the overwhelming evidence
that consolidation increases private

13
00:00:56,057 --> 00:00:58,740
prices, but the impact doesn't end there.

14
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,175
Higher prices spill over to public
budgets by raising the cost of employer

15
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:07,765
sponsored insurance tax exemptions in
the size of ACA exchange subsidies.

16
00:01:07,765 --> 00:01:11,757
Not only that, but lack of competition
can even harm the publicly insured.

17
00:01:11,757 --> 00:01:16,662
Medicare beneficiaries suffering a heart
attack were found to be 1.5% more

18
00:01:16,662 --> 00:01:19,961
likely to die if their
hospital had few competitors.

19
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,240
Competition can be promoted
preserved using several approaches.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,006
These include maintaining
the competitiveness of healthcare markets,

21
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:32,131
encouraging entry by new competitors and

22
00:01:32,131 --> 00:01:35,361
preventing anticompetitive
practices by dominant players.

23
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:41,950
There are multiple ways that regulatory
decisions within public programs like

24
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,229
medicare raise the incentive for
providers to consolidate.

25
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:48,609
Changes in these programs could
neutralize such incentives and

26
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,561
help maintain whatever degree
of competition exists.

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,040
One of these helpful changes would be
shifting to site-neutral payments.

28
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,644
Medicare pays extra facility
fees to hospitals and

29
00:01:59,644 --> 00:02:01,521
enables hospital drug discounts for

30
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:06,640
services that could have been provided
in a freestanding physician's office.

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,349
These policies artificially make hospitals
employing physicians more profitable.

32
00:02:11,349 --> 00:02:15,987
Small organizations or practices may not
have the infrastructure to efficiently

33
00:02:15,987 --> 00:02:19,684
deal with the many payer and
regulatory requirements they face,

34
00:02:19,684 --> 00:02:23,061
including those associated
with value based purchasing.

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,133
Therefore, administrative simplification
may help smaller organizations stay

36
00:02:28,133 --> 00:02:29,840
independent.

37
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,964
Finally, the most advanced forms of
alternative payment models require

38
00:02:33,964 --> 00:02:38,353
providers to bear substantial downside
risk, which is inherently easier for

39
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:39,763
larger organizations.

40
00:02:39,763 --> 00:02:43,767
Efforts to facilitate smaller
organizations ability to bear risk or

41
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:46,261
limit the risk they face could be helpful.

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,175
An important component of the pressure
created by competition is the threat of

43
00:02:52,175 --> 00:02:54,240
facing new competitors.

44
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:58,827
Unfortunately, multiple policies intended
to achieve objectives like quality

45
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:01,752
assurance, cost control or
consumer protection,

46
00:03:01,752 --> 00:03:06,440
create regulatory barriers to entry and
protect incumbent firms.

47
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,211
Policymakers and regulators should
be cognizant of that and ensure that

48
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:14,561
the barriers created are the minimal ones
needed to achieve the policy objective.

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,759
About 35 states have certificate of
need regulation under which a state

50
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:24,928
appointed board must approve plans for
health facilities to enter a market and

51
00:03:24,928 --> 00:03:28,840
for existing facilities to
expand their operations.

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,369
These regulations were intended to prevent
excessive utilization and costs, but

53
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:35,967
have generally not been
shown to be effective.

54
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:40,254
Further, as the payment system
transitions away from fee for service,

55
00:03:40,254 --> 00:03:44,400
the one where providers are at risk for
the costs of over utilization,

56
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,338
the justification for CON disappears even
if it had been effective historically.

57
00:03:49,338 --> 00:03:54,041
About half of states have some form of
any willing provider law, which require

58
00:03:54,041 --> 00:04:00,040
insurers to grant in network status to any
provider who accepts their standard terms.

59
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,042
This eliminates the largest source of
price competition providers competing for

60
00:04:04,042 --> 00:04:07,140
preferred status in an insurer's network.

61
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,101
Without the leverage of being
able to the dye network status,

62
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:14,922
insurers will be less able to
negotiate favorable prices.

63
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:20,640
Scope of practice laws are another
important regulatory barriers to entry.

64
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,031
They are intended to protect consumers
from non physician providers going beyond

65
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:26,567
their skills and training.

66
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:31,174
In practice, they often prevent NPPs from
practicing to the full extent of their

67
00:04:31,174 --> 00:04:34,640
skills, raising cost and reducing access.

68
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,685
Finally, professional licensor is also
intended to protect consumers from

69
00:04:38,685 --> 00:04:40,640
unqualified providers.

70
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,680
However, licensure requirements can be
influenced by provider organizations to

71
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,361
limit the number of competitors.

72
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,901
Preventing anticompetitive practices
is the primary domain of anti-trust

73
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:53,640
enforcement.

74
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,640
Four key actors are involved
in enforcement.

75
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,841
At the federal level, the Federal Trade
Commission has a healthcare division.

76
00:05:00,841 --> 00:05:03,654
And the Department of Justice
can bring criminal actions,

77
00:05:03,654 --> 00:05:05,404
though they are rare in healthcare.

78
00:05:05,404 --> 00:05:09,562
At the state level, attorneys general
enforced state antitrust laws and

79
00:05:09,562 --> 00:05:12,240
often collaborate with the FTC.

80
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,851
Finally, injured parties
can bring law suits.

81
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,866
The objective of anti-trust law is to
improve consumer welfare by protecting

82
00:05:20,866 --> 00:05:22,440
competition.

83
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,632
It is important to note that
protecting competition is not the same

84
00:05:25,632 --> 00:05:27,740
as protecting a competitor.

85
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,539
Competitors can certainly be
harmed by competition, but

86
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,661
it is consumers who
should benefit from it.

87
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,594
The federal legislative basis for

88
00:05:36,594 --> 00:05:39,993
Anti-trust Regulation is
the Sherman Act of 1890,

89
00:05:39,993 --> 00:05:45,251
amended by the Clayton Act of 1914,
and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976.

90
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,466
Anti-trust laws prohibit every contract
combination or conspiracy in restraint

91
00:05:51,466 --> 00:05:56,443
of trade, and any monopolization,
attempted monopolization or conspiracy or

92
00:05:56,443 --> 00:06:00,851
combination to monopolize,
including behaviors like price fixing.

93
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,872
However, the Supreme Court
decided that the Sherman Act

94
00:06:04,872 --> 00:06:09,344
does not prevent every restraint of trade,
only those that are deemed unreasonable.

95
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:12,260
At the federal level, merger analysis and

96
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:16,140
enforcement is a primary
domain of the FTC.

97
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,156
The procedure begins with mandatory
reporting of proposed mergers exceeding

98
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:22,340
a threshold dollar value.

99
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,255
FTC review requires
determinations of the product and

100
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:27,861
geographic markets in
which the firms compete.

101
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:33,472
These pre merger reviews are prospective
based on the presumed conduct of

102
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:35,674
the firms should the merger occur.

103
00:06:35,674 --> 00:06:38,377
The FTC has a limited
enforcement budget and

104
00:06:38,377 --> 00:06:42,140
allows many mergers to
proceed as proposed.

105
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:45,598
It allows some to proceed with
modifications like divestiture

106
00:06:45,598 --> 00:06:48,465
of specified assets and
attempts to black others and

107
00:06:48,465 --> 00:06:51,351
create precedents that can
be used in future cases.

108
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,345
Even if the merger is allowed, the FTC can
take actions later with a retrospective

109
00:06:57,345 --> 00:06:59,349
review based on actual conduct.

110
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:01,387
The FTC can seek penalties up to and

111
00:07:01,387 --> 00:07:04,561
including breaking up
previously allowed mergers.

112
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,708
However, due to the high cost
of firms of such actions,

113
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,351
this is a seldom used remedy.

114
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,840
Recent federal actions in healthcare
have involved insurers and providers.

115
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,834
The FTC blocked several proposed mergers
between large national insurers and

116
00:07:20,834 --> 00:07:23,751
blocked the hospital acquisition
of a physician group.

117
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,131
The agency also challenged several
proposed hospital mergers,

118
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:32,740
some of which were eventually abandoned
while another was allowed to proceed.

119
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,945
Finally, a Chicago area post-merger
challenge has been ongoing for

120
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:39,099
over a decade.

121
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:44,040
High profile state action involved
Sutter health in northern California.

122
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,516
The case was started by a suit
filed by grocer's union and

123
00:07:47,516 --> 00:07:52,950
was eventually settled for $575 million
by state Attorney General Xavier Becerra,

124
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,749
who later became president Biden's
Secretary of Health and Human Services.

125
00:07:57,749 --> 00:08:02,310
An enormously complex case,
the discovery process generated 16.9

126
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,461
million pages of documents
from 160 parties.

127
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,340
The settlement also included an agreement
and certain anti-competitive practices.

128
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:15,895
The most significant was ceasing contracts
requiring providers to include all Sutter

129
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,961
facilities or none in their networks.

130
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,040
If you look up the hospitals that
we've named an anti-trust cases,

131
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,040
you might be surprised to see
that most of them are nonprofits.

132
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,940
Anti-trust law treats for profit and
nonprofit hospitals equally.

133
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:33,844
Prices are the main concern, and

134
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:37,799
both types seem to raise them
similarly after gaining market power.

135
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,571
Nonprofits also don't seem to use gains in
market power to increase charity care or

136
00:08:42,571 --> 00:08:45,651
other community benefits anymore than for
profits.

137
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,540
To summarize, lack of competition can harm
the performance of healthcare markets.

138
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,638
We saw that several policies
with other stated intents,

139
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:59,834
such as consumer protection have a side
effect of promoting consolidation or

140
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:01,461
creating barriers to entry.

141
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,583
Alternative policies may be able
to achieve those stated aims

142
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:08,940
without impairing
the competitiveness of the market.

143
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:13,149
Finally, anti-trust enforcement as
a primary policy lever aimed directly at

144
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,361
promoting and preserving competition.
