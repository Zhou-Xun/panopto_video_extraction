1
00:00:05,945 --> 00:00:10,506
Our immune system works through
coordinated efforts including innate and

2
00:00:10,506 --> 00:00:14,270
specific immune responses
to keep us healthy.

3
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:19,740
But how does our immune system know to
activate in response to a pathogen?

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,290
Why do some individuals have a better
immune response than others?

5
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:27,830
Why does immune function change with age?

6
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:32,520
All of these questions can be answered by
understanding the ways in which our body

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,740
acquires and maintains immune function.

8
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,810
In this module, we will review active and
passive immunity.

9
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:47,326
Two ways that our body learns to
have a functioning immune system.

10
00:00:47,326 --> 00:00:52,850
Active immunity is protection produced
by an individual's own system.

11
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:59,090
Something within the individual is able
to respond to invaders or pathogens.

12
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,450
When someone is exposed to
foreign organisms their

13
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:08,400
own immune cells respond by producing
antibodies and memory cells.

14
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,380
This trigger for our active immune
function can be naturally acquired

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,750
through natural exposure to a given
pathogen in their own environment.

16
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,490
And in doing so, they're specific, or they
adaptive immune response will be triggered

17
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,520
and immunologic memory will be created.

18
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,780
However, we can also trigger active
immunity by artificial responses.

19
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,190
We can artificially be exposed to a
pathogen or something that stimulates our

20
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:39,770
body to acquire immunologic memory
against that specific antigen.

21
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,880
And in fact,
this is the way in which vaccines work.

22
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,180
Active immunity is so

23
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,410
important to our overall well-being
because it provides long-term protection.

24
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:55,700
And this long-term protection is really
key because we develop immunologic memory.

25
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:00,310
And so we are able to respond not
just in a given scenario but over and

26
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:05,000
over when we encounter that
pathogen in the future.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,970
On the other hand, passive immunity
only provides protection when we

28
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:15,190
get it from another living organism,
which is then transferred to ourselves.

29
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:20,360
So passive immunity is the transfer
of preformed antibodies, antibodies

30
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,150
that we don't ourselves produce but are
produced in someone else and given to us.

31
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:32,410
And these antibodies then are used to our
benefit to protect us against a challenge.

32
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:37,530
However, passive immunity does not confirm
immunologic memory because our own immune

33
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:43,400
system is not responding, we are only
using antibodies that are given to us.

34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,150
In doing so,

35
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,950
this type of immunity provides only
short-term protection against the antigen.

36
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:52,960
When we've used up all of those
pre-formed antibodies that we were given,

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:57,260
we are unable to continue to
mount an immune response.

38
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:02,310
With passive immunity then, protection
disappears within weeks or months.

39
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,660
And it is important to know that passive
immunity does not really initiate our

40
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,810
own immune response but rather uses those
transferred immune products to respond.

41
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:17,180
Some examples of passive immunity
are when maternal transfer occurs

42
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,170
across the placenta.

43
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:24,460
Maternal transfer of antibodies in utero
helps with the baby's own immune function

44
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:29,160
until their own system develops,
with sometimes will take weeks or months.

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,430
So having this ability of
maternal transfer of antibodies

46
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,820
to a developing baby will
protect them in and after birth.

47
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,740
Another example of passive immunity is for
individuals who have low immune functions

48
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,204
that can receive injections
of immunoglobulin products.

49
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:50,520
Immunoglobulins is another word for
antibodies.

50
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,195
And so if they have low immune
function and their body can't or

51
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:58,448
does not respond in ways that
are necessary for their immune function.

52
00:03:58,448 --> 00:04:01,780
We can give injections
of immunoglobulins so

53
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:08,910
that they can have an ability to respond
against a given invader or pathogen.

54
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,860
Active immunity can be artificially
acquired and induced by vaccines.

55
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:20,270
Vaccines contain antigens which trigger
our body to respond, so they mimic

56
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:26,028
a natural infection and this natural mimic
then stimulates our body to respond.

57
00:04:26,028 --> 00:04:31,051
By responding, our body is triggered to
create immunological memory so that it can

58
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:37,831
respond and provide immunity when it is
exposed to that pathogen in the future.

59
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:41,990
Vaccines can either be live or
inactivated.

60
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,430
Live vaccines are created
using an attenuated or

61
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,250
weakened version of the pathogen.

62
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,490
This weakened version is less
likely to actually make you ill but

63
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,400
will still elicit an immune
response in immunologic memory

64
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,290
because it is in an active pathogen.

65
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:02,250
Other vaccines are inactivated,

66
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,260
meaning that the infectious
pathogen has been killed.

67
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,290
However, it can still initiate an immune
response because the antigens are still

68
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,950
present on those cells.

69
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:18,310
There are benefits and tradeoffs to
live versus inactivated vaccines.

70
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,770
Live vaccines illicit a very
strong immune response and

71
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:25,080
thus result in longer-term protection.

72
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:29,830
However, there is a slight chance that the
organism in that vaccine can mutate back

73
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,380
to be virulent,
meaning it can cause disease if mutated.

74
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,330
And thus we are concerned about severe
reactions that are possible with live

75
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,320
vaccines.

76
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,640
Another downside of live vaccines is that
they must be refrigerated because that

77
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,160
pathogen is still alive and

78
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:52,420
must continue to replicate to be
able to produce immune responses.

79
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,080
Live vaccines, however, elicit an immune
response that is very similar to natural

80
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:03,260
infection, and so provide a more robust
immune response and immunologic memory.

81
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:07,385
Examples of live vaccines include measles,
mumps, rubella,

82
00:06:07,385 --> 00:06:14,790
rotavirus, oral polio viruses and
the intranasal virus for influenza.

83
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:18,300
Inactivated vaccines are more
stable than live vaccines and

84
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,370
thus do not require refrigeration.

85
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:25,110
Inactivated vaccines are safer
than live vaccines as well,

86
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:28,310
because the pathogen in that
vaccine has been killed there

87
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:32,470
is no possibility of it
mutating back to be virulent.

88
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,380
However, because the pathogen
has been killed,

89
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:41,060
it stimulates a weaker immune response,
and so immunity may diminish with time.

90
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:44,110
We see that in cases with
inactive vaccines then,

91
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,540
we must require multiple doses of that
vaccine to get an immune response.

92
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:54,240
And we may require boosters of that
vaccine over time to maintain levels

93
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,810
of immune response in that individual.

94
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,350
Examples of inactivated
vaccines include rabies,

95
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,693
polio, hepatitis B,
human papillomavirus, and tetanus.
