1
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:07,950
All right. Well, welcome to Public Health 383 Data Driven Methods and Public Health.

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:15,900
My name is Matt Zara Statsky. So in this first session today, hopefully we won't take up the whole time.

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,820
I just want to give you an overview of what the course will be like, logistics kind of things,

4
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,050
and give you the opportunity to to ask questions that you might have.

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:31,020
Because, again, I imagine that so many courses have like different policies, different rules,

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,070
different set ups and, you know, give you a chance to ask and make sure you get those straight.

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,610
I also I hate having to teach the first lecture. I think it's crazy that they make us come back right away.

8
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:44,639
We need another week, right? So I don't want to teach. I don't know.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,110
You guys are not you know, you're so still getting over break, so we'll make this one easy today.

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,820
All right. So the way we're going to get started is I want to introduce to you the teaching team.

11
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,630
So we have Rachel Davis, we have Morgan Bird, and then we have me doing the teaching.

12
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,559
So if you want to take a second, so I just want to let you meet.

13
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,960
So two guesses if you have lab on Friday.

14
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:20,399
So that would be sections two, three, four, five, six and seven.

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,230
I believe if you have lab sections five, six and seven, you would have Rachel as a GSI.

16
00:01:26,610 --> 00:01:31,200
Hi, everyone. I'm Rachel. I'm a second year master's student in biostatistics.

17
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,370
This is my last semester.

18
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:39,870
I'm from Atlanta, Georgia, and I graduated from Georgia State University with my bachelor's degree in math and a concentration in statistics.

19
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:46,320
I'm broadly interested in applied bio statistics, and I'm planning on applying for jobs and working after this.

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,010
And in my free time, I like spending time with my friends and family. I love to work out, go to concerts, and I also love to watch reality TV.

21
00:01:54,250 --> 00:02:00,430
All right. Thank you, Rachel. So this is Rachel's fourth semester being a GSI in a classified.

22
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,140
So so we have to our heart goes out to Rachel for dealing with me four times.

23
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,370
All right. Next. Morgan. Hi. I'm Morgan Bird.

24
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,520
I'm a second year Ph.D. student in the AP department.

25
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,190
I have my bachelor's in biomedical engineering from Georgia Tech and my MPH from GW.

26
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:23,800
I also did Teach for America and worked for about eight years in the medical device orthopedic industry.

27
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,900
My research is focused. It focuses on infectious diseases and the microbiome.

28
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:35,890
And in my free time, I really like staying active, doing fine races, reading, and then hanging out with my nieces and my nephew.

29
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,510
Who do you work with? When I would not work with you.

30
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:44,209
I work with Betsy Fox here so I can say she does microbiome. All right.

31
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,930
So if you have a Thursday lab, so that would be two, three or four.

32
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,920
Morgan is going to be your GSI leading those lab sessions.

33
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:56,150
We'll get to this in a minute. But both sides are going to have office hours.

34
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,730
You know, if you connect better or if one of the GSA schedules works better with you,

35
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,409
you know, you're not you're not locked into whoever is your GSI for for the lab session.

36
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:11,550
So. So. Very excited with my group.

37
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,400
So we've got Rachel's done this class before. Morgan's got lots of teaching experience.

38
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:20,720
I think we've got a good team here. So there's me, you a little bit about myself.

39
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:26,990
So I'm originally from Staten Island, New York. I was a big math person in college.

40
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:34,280
I went to college in Philadelphia at St Joseph's University, and I sort of stayed on that like very like math dork trajectory.

41
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:41,120
I was doing like pure math. I was in a Ph.D. program at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

42
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:47,990
And at some point, I just realized, like, I think I want to do something that has a little bit more application than just doing pure math.

43
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:54,200
Sort of stumbled upon bio statistics and specifically how math and statistics get used in genetics.

44
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,920
By chance, I'd never heard of bias statistics when I was an undergraduate.

45
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,770
I never heard of it. When I was a student in the math department at Lehigh, I found it.

46
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,929
I found the University of Michigan came out here. I got my Ph.D. from the University of Michigan.

47
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,740
Never thought I would stay. But but here we are many years later and I'm still here.

48
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,110
So I am a clinical associate professor. The clinical has nothing to do with doctor, like real doctor.

49
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:26,090
I don't have a stethoscope or anything. It's just the track that I'm on. It's the weighting of the teaching and research that I do.

50
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,590
I'll tell you a little bit more about my research focus on the next couple of slides.

51
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:36,680
But I do. I am. I work with human genetics problems and have more recently picked up electronic health records.

52
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:43,670
So I'm a big sports fan. So, so on the on the left side, they're all sort of the universities are picked up along the way that I cheer for.

53
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,299
I was really hoping that next Tuesday class would get canceled because we'd be celebrating a national championship.

54
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,140
I think the new president would have canceled classes. Wasn't to be, wasn't to be.

55
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,920
But so it also I am a huge Buffalo Bills fan.

56
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,910
So even though I grew up in Staten Island, most of my family's from Buffalo, so I still go out there.

57
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,470
So that picture on the top is is my younger daughter. She's ten years old.

58
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,730
If you heard about the storm that hit Buffalo right around Christmas,

59
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:18,510
my grandmother was locked in the house for three straight days and then we finally were able to make it out there and snow was over little kids heads.

60
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:22,339
It was that that high also is a picture of my family.

61
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,770
We went to the Thanksgiving Day game on Thanksgiving in Detroit.

62
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:32,090
And so if you're a Lions fan, I'm sorry, but you know, there's a nice outcome for the Bills.

63
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:35,240
Yeah. If you if you're a sports fan or if you watch the news, of course,

64
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,660
the Bills have been in the news because of DeMar Hamlin, who basically had cardiac arrest on the football fields.

65
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,350
Right. And although I guess the most recent things I've read is that he's improving quite a bit.

66
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,690
So that's very good news and it's pretty incredible to see, like his charity that he started,

67
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,090
you know, was looking for like 20 $500 in donations last night. So it's like a over like 6 million or something.

68
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:03,109
But anyway, you know, the bills have sort of a loser reputation, which if you're a Lawrence fan and you're here, you're used to, to as well.

69
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,170
But to be in the news here like this was something.

70
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:12,880
I also love the fish. I love to say that's the smallest fish I've ever caught, but that would be a lie.

71
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:17,470
So as we get closer to warmer weather, that's what I'll be thinking about.

72
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:24,669
And I'm also a huge Grateful Dead fan. So when I'm making slides, when I'm working on homework and stuff to a first class to do my own research,

73
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:29,740
that's usually what I'm going to be listening to. So anything that I just mention sort of intersects with you.

74
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,700
Feel free to talk about those kind of things. Oh.

75
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,210
And what? What are you supposed to call me? Right. What?

76
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:42,140
You certainly don't need to call me. Is that right? Zawistowski I don't think it's too bad, right?

77
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,840
But, you know, you don't have to call me that. Feel free to call me Dr. Z.

78
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,320
I'll call. Feel free to call me. That doesn't matter to me. Okay.

79
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:55,570
I can usually tell when I get an email. You know, if I'm going to get some, he's going to ask me for a favor or something.

80
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:00,340
Usually, dear professors, I was STARSKY. Right. You know, let's make it formal if I'm going to ask for a favor.

81
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:10,379
Feel for Dr. Z, Matt. Totally fine. I just want take a minute to tell you about what I do, because I know that when I was as I just said,

82
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,560
when I was sitting in your shoes as an undergrad, I had no idea what biostatistics was.

83
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:18,830
I had no idea how I would work on genetics.

84
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,140
In fact, when I came to the University of Michigan, I took a genetics class.

85
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:28,140
I hadn't taken a biology class since I was a freshman in high school and the football coach taught it.

86
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,159
So it was like a big jump, right. You know, a little bit different, I think, for you guys.

87
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,620
I think you have a much broader sort of experience with what you get to take.

88
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,980
I was sort of pushed into physics as a math major. Even though I hated physics, I have no interest in it, you know?

89
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:48,360
And I wish I could have went back and taken like, biology or something, but so so what do I do now?

90
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:53,370
So I'm in the Department of Biostatistics. I'm also at something called the Center for Statistical Genetics.

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,010
And sort of like broadly speaking, what I do is,

92
00:07:56,010 --> 00:08:03,480
is I create study designs and then work on analyzing data that comes from those study designs for all sorts of molecular biology data.

93
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:11,460
So specifically DNA, which is what I did a lot of my Ph.D. work in and then a lot of stuff that I did still continue to do.

94
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,610
Also gene expression. And then more recently, I've moved into methylation.

95
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,829
What's kind of what's interesting in these fields is, as you know, they don't stay static.

96
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:27,360
They're always changing. Right. And so even though the concept of measuring DNA or measuring expression stays the same,

97
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:31,709
the accuracy and the scale at which we can do it is always changing, right?

98
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,630
So initially when I worked on DNA studies, it was, you know, you know,

99
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:42,360
tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of sites, you know, and then my professors were like, This is crazy.

100
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:48,900
We have 20 sites now. We got tens of thousands. Right now we can measure 50 million sites right pretty accurately.

101
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,229
And then if you want to do sequencing, you can measure the entire genome, right.

102
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:59,969
So that the questions are always changing. You know, an expression used to have to take just like a big clump of cells and average across,

103
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,850
you know, what kind of gene expression was going on in there everywhere.

104
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:07,829
Now people have the ability to measure gene expression at an individual cell resolution.

105
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:15,180
Right. And so there's a lot of statistics in there. You're basically undoing some of the chemistry that was done in order to do that.

106
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,270
So a lot of statistics shows up in this. You know, but the idea is like, you know, what?

107
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:25,709
What what do you do? Like, how does a person who is really into math and statistics get involved in genetics?

108
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:28,920
But like, you know, here's here's the idea of like, how do you approach an analysis of,

109
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,620
you know, 70,000 or 100,000 people and they're genotyped at over 50 million markers?

110
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,509
That's a ginormous data set, right? Just getting the computer to do something with it is difficult.

111
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,979
Right. Being able to parallel process on it. And then how do you analyze this?

112
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,620
Like how do you make sense of of what comes out of this? That's sort of what I do and that's what I trained in when I did my Ph.D. here.

113
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,860
After that excuse me, I went over to the Ann Arbor VA for a couple of years,

114
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:01,769
and I worked in something called the Center for Clinical Management Research. So the goal there was very different than what I was doing.

115
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:06,719
The goal there was to to basically research that was trying to understand the quality,

116
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,690
effectiveness and safety of the care that was given to veterans in the in the VA health system.

117
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:19,320
And so it was again, that the scope was very different, but the actual data that I was using was very different to.

118
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:24,510
And so I want to highlight here that I gained a lot of experience working with electronic health records.

119
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:27,659
So I mentioned electronic health records a little bit during the course.

120
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:33,350
You know, it's examples because it's things I work with. But, you know, roughly speaking, every time you go to the doctor,

121
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:38,879
have an interaction with the health system that somebody is typing and typing away, they're, you know, keeping records.

122
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,430
You know, that's a digitized record, right? Of of of your of your health, your interaction with the health system.

123
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,590
And while that's useful, you know, so that the next time the doctor comes in and sees you, they can quickly look it up.

124
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,330
That data actually gets used on the back end, right? It gets sort of combined across everybody.

125
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,170
And now you can study large groups of people and have very detailed health information.

126
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,120
So again, I would just point out that when I was a graduate student,

127
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,129
I had never really heard about electronic health records and certainly never heard of electronic health records.

128
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:14,250
Okay. So I would, again, just sort of encourage you to remember as you take this class,

129
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,879
as you finish up undergrad, you don't need to learn everything, right?

130
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,650
You don't need to you don't need you're not going to learn everything you'll ever know as an undergraduate student.

131
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,950
Okay? You're constantly going to be learning and constantly be picking things up.

132
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:32,100
And I just give these couple examples of places where I've just sort of, you know, changed the focus of what you do.

133
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,510
So I came back to U of M to be a part of precision health here.

134
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:44,690
And so specifically I'm involved in something called the Michigan Genomics Initiative, and nobody ever heard of Michigan Genomics Initiative.

135
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:49,190
But it ain't it. Well.

136
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:53,360
So it's the Michigan Genomics Initiative. So it's a biobank here at the University of Michigan.

137
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:58,100
And what it does is it combines a biological sample.

138
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,100
So it's a blood sample or a spit sample from that.

139
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:07,340
Things like DNA are extracted from it. And then we link with that patient electronic health records.

140
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:15,910
And so now that you've got this large data set of people for which you have some bio sample and then you've got some health history, right?

141
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:21,020
You can just imagine how much research can be done with this. It's currently about 90,000 patients consented.

142
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,250
And I do research on this dataset myself,

143
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,989
but I'm also work on a team that does quality control and making sure the data is good

144
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,090
for others to be able to use how you how you disseminate large datasets like this,

145
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:39,170
and then consulting for people who want to use the genetic data but maybe are new to that, that specific area.

146
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,330
That's enough about me. So what is this course about?

147
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:52,410
So. So you guys took stats to 50, right? So that was last year or two years ago.

148
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:58,480
Two years ago. And you've done nothing statistics wise since I'm imagining, right?

149
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,230
Okay, I get it. So what is this class about?

150
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:11,350
Well, first, let me tell you that I recognize that very few, if any of you want to do exactly what I do.

151
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,629
Okay. It's a shame, but I get it. Right. So I know, like, you want to be.

152
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:22,060
How many? Probably lots of aspiring doctors. And here MDs, probably lots of spying, public health professionals in here.

153
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:27,520
But the thing is, is that you live in 2023 now.

154
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:34,630
Right. And data is everywhere and data is used by everyone. And so you have to have some understanding, some appreciation for data.

155
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:40,810
And so this course is really about understanding the importance of data in public health.

156
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:46,950
You know, things like how you collect data, how you analyze data, how you interpret data, and even how you might disseminate data.

157
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:51,280
Right. But again, it's for this specific audience of this public health audience.

158
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:59,970
So if that was the the the course description, which was not written by me, what would I say this course is about?

159
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,980
Well, it's about gaining an understanding and an appreciation for data and biostatistics.

160
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,040
Even if you don't want to be a biostatistician. Right. Because you're going to encounter it in your careers.

161
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:17,310
My hope is that you leave here armed with tools for for critical evaluation of public health and medical studies.

162
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,660
What we're going to do next Tuesday is start with this looking at a primary

163
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:25,790
research article and then looking at a media article and understanding like, what's the difference there?

164
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,220
What's the value of each? What are the shortcomings potentially of each?

165
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:37,770
We will have we are going to do statistics in this class, but it's going to be different than the statistics that you did in Stats.

166
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:42,030
250. We're going to go very broad, but very shallow.

167
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:49,170
Okay. So you're going to learn about lots of statistical techniques in this class, but only like maybe one lecture at a time on it.

168
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:54,420
And so the goal is that it's enough that you understand why it exists when it's used and

169
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:59,040
what are the key things you need to know about it if you encounter it in your career,

170
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:03,300
the expectation is not that you could sit down and do all of these things.

171
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:08,490
If you're interested in that and you catch it, you know there are other classes and I encourage you and I can help you find those.

172
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,100
So again, we're going to see how how data, both big and small, can be accessed and evaluated and contribute to public health knowledge.

173
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,299
We want to think about understanding and evaluating other's work because that's

174
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:26,610
a lot of what you'll do your lead papers write and be able to understand, you know, did this person do the right thing?

175
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:33,030
Right. If you're watching a research topic or you're reading a paper, one of the things we'll see with papers is that they are not foolproof, right?

176
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:38,440
There are mistakes in them. I try to give examples of theoretical concepts.

177
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:42,020
One of the things I struggled with with as a student is when, you know,

178
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:48,479
like a professor throws up some slides and it's just some like black and white bullet pointed text and they try to give some concept.

179
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,440
You're like, What? That that does it. I don't get that right. I will try to give you examples.

180
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,829
Right. And if I don't, you're welcome to ask and I'll try to help you come up with examples.

181
00:15:55,830 --> 00:16:02,580
Right. I want to get things that go in your head so that when you when you say, oh, now I've got something that helps make that click for me,

182
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,790
we're also going to get some hands on experience working directly with data, but it's going to be at a very small level.

183
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,170
It's not it's not a programing class, but that's what the labs are going to be about.

184
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,409
And it's going to be they're very targeted. They're trying to get you to see something.

185
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:19,620
Again, goes back to this idea of it's maybe something I talked about in class.

186
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,160
Now I want you to see it in data and maybe get an appreciation for it.

187
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:29,430
And then finally, this big thing is understand why researchers do the things they do.

188
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:35,370
And so that when you read a paper or you attend a seminar, you can follow along.

189
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:41,640
Right. That's a it's a big challenge, right? When you go to listen to research to be able to follow along.

190
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,799
And what you'll learn is that you don't need to understand every little thing the person's doing right.

191
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,310
But as you pick up enough, you know, you can hang with them and get the big points.

192
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:57,209
You might get lost in the minutia. I do all the time. Right. But what I hope is with this class, you'll be able to just hang longer with those papers.

193
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:02,100
They'll make more sense. Or when you go to a seminar, it'll make sense for a little bit longer to be able to get more out of it.

194
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:12,610
So I think that when I when I I've been involved with this class since its inception when the undergraduate program started.

195
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,420
I've taught it all but one and a half years.

196
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:20,800
I split it one year with an instructor that I didn't teach at one year. So the first year I co-taught it.

197
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:30,370
Really, I think the thing that I want to do is to move away from this idea of research as this very black and white formula matic thing,

198
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:38,200
especially statistics. Right. I feel like that's where statistics gets really a bad rap when it's just talk like this is the way.

199
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,690
Right? But that's not how research works at all.

200
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:48,370
And my hope is that again, in this class, you're going to walk away having a little more understanding of the nuance that goes into research,

201
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:52,959
understanding that when people do something in a study and you look at it and your initial thought is,

202
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,710
Oh, that was a bad idea, why would they do that? And then think a little bit and say, Wow, yeah, I could see why they, you know,

203
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,170
this is maybe not what they wanted to do, but this is what they had to do, right? They had to compromise a little bit, you know,

204
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:08,920
because it would have cost too much to do the other thing or would have taken too long to run that study.

205
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,249
Okay. Because that's not you know, that's what research is really like.

206
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,979
It's it's it's a it's colorful and it's nuanced. All right.

207
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:21,690
So about the course now in terms of like logistics, that's what we're talking about now.

208
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,610
So, you know, this is a slot I show in all the classes I teach.

209
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:31,960
You know, there really is this like synergy that exists between me and the teaching team, you, the students, and then the course material.

210
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,700
And so to do a course, well, you know, many things have to happen.

211
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:44,230
So one of the things that's already happened is that is this piece, right, this this relationship between the teaching team and the course material.

212
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:47,739
So I can tell you there's many things that could have worked in this course.

213
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:53,080
But, you know, I've thought a lot about it and other people have contributed and I've also taught it like five times.

214
00:18:53,080 --> 00:19:01,629
Right. And so we've really narrowed in and what we think are interesting and relevant topics for you, for this audience, right?

215
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:07,540
Not for not for math majors, not for statistics majors, for public health audience and people that want to maybe be pre-med.

216
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,340
AUDIENCE Okay, so know that we really have tried to target this class for you.

217
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,409
What about this relationship between me and all of you?

218
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:21,590
So I can tell you. You know, I stand here, I look at your faces.

219
00:19:21,590 --> 00:19:28,850
I'm happy to be back in person. That's nice, right? But I can't you know, I can use little visual cues, but I don't know when you're confused.

220
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:33,889
You know, I teach something for the 10th time and I'm like, Oh, I went great again because I killed it.

221
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:39,680
Right? But if it doesn't make sense, you've got to tell me, right? So you can't be shy about telling me if there's a problem.

222
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,250
That problem could be I screwed up something on the canvass site.

223
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,850
I forgot to post the slides. I you know, because I do.

224
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:52,339
I make mistakes, right? You should see what canvas is like on the back end. It's crazy to try to see this as best you're trying to control.

225
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,489
And the links are all over the place, right? And anything.

226
00:19:55,490 --> 00:20:00,770
Right. It could be something like the GSA has missed something, right? Just know that you can tell us, right.

227
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:04,370
In a respectful way. We're not going to be offended by. Okay, I grew up in New York.

228
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,820
I'm used to people yelling at me and saying nasty things. You're not going to be offended.

229
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:16,610
Right. And I would just tell you, don't be shy. Right. You know, communication is really important and it doesn't need to be during class.

230
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,999
Right. I'm always going to stick around the client if there's another class in this room afterwards.

231
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,629
But I usually stick around up here and I got to get Panopto shut down.

232
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:27,140
I got to grab all my stuff, you know, come up and talk to me, right?

233
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,129
And if you've got an issue, come up to my office and talk me, shoot me an email.

234
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:33,050
I'm usually pretty quick about responding to emails.

235
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:38,030
I hate unread emails just floating at the top of my inbox, so I'd rather just answer it and be on my way.

236
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:47,190
Okay, so if you have an issue, please talk to us. And then finally, what what can you do as it relates to the course material?

237
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:56,219
So for one, and this is I'm going to be honest, this is a touchy topic here, you know, in academia.

238
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,860
And right now, there's a lot of debates about what we need to do about attendance.

239
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,360
Right. Post-Pandemic. Okay. Some people mandate attendance.

240
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,999
You know, figure out ways to make sure your butt is in the seat. I don't I'm not going to do that.

241
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,870
Okay. I think that you benefit from it. I can tell you that, you know, you're here.

242
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,870
You got to take advantage of being at a place like the University of Michigan and all it has to offer.

243
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:28,890
Right. And it's not my class specific, but just getting in the habit of going to things and taking advantage of what's there.

244
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,129
So I would ask you to attend a lecture. The labs are going to be more mandatory.

245
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:40,680
I'll talk about that in a minute. And then office hours, right? I mean, fine times to come to office hours.

246
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:46,710
And if you have a question, don't be shy about it. There's lots of eye posts.

247
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,440
There's no textbook per se for this class. There's like a stats textbook that is a reference, you know, if you want later on.

248
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:59,940
But I post lots of reading assignments and I, again, I, I, I try to avoid these like long,

249
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,050
dense, dry reading assignments, especially when it comes to statistics.

250
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:07,920
I found a lot of papers that are sort of short to the point very much on this level.

251
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,790
Got to read those, right? I mean, that's that's that's what I'm expecting that you're doing.

252
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,870
There's also sometimes there are readings that you have to do to be prepared for class.

253
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:21,000
Like most of the time you read it, you don't have to read it before class.

254
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,150
You don't to look at slides before class. Every now and then, there are some things that you have to read just so that you're prepared for it,

255
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,210
for example, and I try to tell you about those in advance,

256
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:35,250
but you can always click and just say, Hey, look, is there anything where he's saying this has to be read in advance?

257
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:40,140
And again, usually nothing too long. Another thing is start your homework early.

258
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:43,639
Okay. So we are going to have near weekly homework assignments in this class.

259
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:49,640
That's really the only way you stay on top of this kind of a course, very different than like a class where you just look at slides,

260
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:53,090
look at slides, look at slides, and then it's all on the line when you take a test.

261
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,690
Right. This is going to be, hey, I taught you something. Now I want you to try to to to work on it right in homework.

262
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,920
And then those kinds of things builds up for when you take the test, start them early.

263
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,670
It's better to know if you're having trouble early and then you can find one of us for help.

264
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:13,960
And then the last thing is, you know, again, I was a student.

265
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,440
I know that sometimes there's a deadline and you just got you got to get in.

266
00:23:17,470 --> 00:23:20,709
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know if this is right, but I'm just submitting it to try to get some points here.

267
00:23:20,710 --> 00:23:24,460
Right. You know, try to understand what your homework responses are.

268
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,290
Don't just guess.

269
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:31,480
And if you do guess, right, which happens sometimes you run out of time, you know, get the homework in, but make sure you take the time to go back.

270
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,379
We're going to post the answer keys. Make sure you take the time to go back and look and be like that.

271
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:41,080
I really get this. Or did I just did I walk into the answer? Could I answer this again if I had to on a test?

272
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,290
Any questions so far? Joan. All right.

273
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,600
So of course material. So.

274
00:23:55,430 --> 00:24:01,010
The class can feel like a little bit of a hodgepodge, especially in the beginning, because we're going to bounce around in different topics.

275
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:06,800
Fair enough. You know, it can you know, I try to I try to make some connections between them.

276
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:11,210
But we're going to start with research methods up here doing things like reading research.

277
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:15,530
We'll talk about scientific ethics and then replication, reproducibility.

278
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:19,490
It's just some important things to to understand about the whole research process.

279
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:26,580
Okay. So those lectures we have, we have a lab that deals with replication and reproducibility.

280
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:32,579
Many of you probably are familiar with replication and reproducibility potentially in a wet lab setting, right?

281
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,770
With like, you know, working with test tubes and stuff,

282
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:40,020
reproducibility and replication also very important in a dry lab setting when you're working with data.

283
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:45,239
Right. So try to give you an appreciation for what that means. We'll talk a lot about study designs.

284
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:50,610
And this is a place where, you know, I am not an expert in all the studies that we've got some people who are experts that are going

285
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:56,159
to come in specifically to talk about qualitative study designs and experimental study designs.

286
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:02,040
People will give examples from their own work and then sources of biased ways that that,

287
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:08,190
you know, things can creep into your collection of data that you hadn't anticipated.

288
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:12,059
Right. How it can affect your results. Then we'll switch around.

289
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,190
We'll come back to basics, statistical analysis.

290
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:21,660
So this piece right here is going to be probably the review of stats to 50 and not going to assume that you remember everything from stats to 50.

291
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,680
I'll do sort of a gentle review of what you need to know here and then the jump off is going to be that advanced modeling, right?

292
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:38,640
And those are going to be where you will learn shallow dives again on statistical methods that you're very likely to encounter as you read papers,

293
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:46,350
as you go to seminars, and you're just going to again, the goal is to get an appreciation for why would this person be doing this,

294
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:52,680
what kind of study designs are usually used with this? Right. And and how do I interpret the results that are coming out of it?

295
00:25:53,490 --> 00:26:00,510
And then at the end of the semester, we're going to be doing article critique assignments is like sort of like a final project sort of thing.

296
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,000
Not a lot, not not a big final project,

297
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:11,250
but it's going to try to ask you to use all these different things that that we've talked about this semester in one final assignment.

298
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:20,540
So lectures. So Tuesday, Thursday, 1130 to 1 in this room, for better or worse.

299
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:28,759
I have mixed feelings about this room. It's not always the best. Although I took my first class sitting back there in Michigan.

300
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,340
So high pressure on you. You're sitting right where I was sitting.

301
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,740
But, you know, I understand, you know, this room can be a little bit not the best sometimes, but to get everybody in here, this is the room we're in.

302
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:44,920
So, again, attendance and actively participating or strongly encouraged.

303
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:49,790
Nobody's going to check to see if you're here, you know? No, no, I'm not keeping track of attendance.

304
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,100
I will always post PDF slides on the canvas site in advance of the lecture.

305
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:02,030
I apologize. I meant to get them up sooner today. The busses were a disaster this morning, so I got in much later than I had thought.

306
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:07,129
I will often try to get them up the night before so that if you want to print them out or something,

307
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:11,870
or at least download them before you start your your day, you don't need to look at them before class.

308
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,020
No expectation of that. There will be some classes that require, as I said, reading in advance.

309
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:24,290
I will be very explicit. I'll be like, Hey, look, we're going to talk about this tomorrow, so you should read it just so that,

310
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,580
you know, you're prepared to to understand what I'm going to talk about.

311
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:33,700
But most of the readings are sort of like, hey, you can read this afterwards. This is like something extra to fill you in later.

312
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:40,120
Okay. I will be Panopto recording lectures just like I'm doing right now will get posted up to the website.

313
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:44,230
If you can't make a lecture, you obviously watch it.

314
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:52,090
Panopto recorded. And I know lots of students have said that, you know, they like to re listen to lectures except that double speed.

315
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,060
Okay, so here I will sit through the full hour and a half.

316
00:27:55,070 --> 00:28:03,600
In fact, I once had a student tell me that they talked to me in person and all they ever did was watch my videos at double speed.

317
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:09,010
So to hear me talk in regular speed was like, very like, wow, it's so weird to hear you talk like normal speed.

318
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:14,680
But again, you know, glitches do happen, right? I could forget to start it.

319
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,110
You know, computer technology has happened, you know, so I can't promise they'll always be there.

320
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,880
That's all I can say. So to encourage you to come.

321
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,510
And also to encourage you to stay on track.

322
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:32,670
Because here's the other thing that I worry about, is if you fall into this like, well, I'm not going to go, I'll just watch the video.

323
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:36,540
I didn't go Tuesday. I didn't watch the video. I'll just watch it Thursday. Oh, [INAUDIBLE].

324
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,080
Now, now, Thursday's video came out. I didn't watch that one. And now you're a week behind already, right?

325
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:43,500
You know how that goes, right? And you get yourself in a trap.

326
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:50,610
So I want to use these minute papers to try to motivate class topics and also keep you on track.

327
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:56,940
All right. So what we're going to do is some time during classes and it's mostly for the like the first several weeks of the course.

328
00:28:57,870 --> 00:29:04,470
I'll have a question that I want you to think about. It will often be on these, like sort of assigned readings.

329
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:10,889
Okay. And I'll sort of prime you with a question and there'll be a link and you can go to the link on canvas.

330
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,900
It's going to be opened up right when class starts.

331
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:18,899
And, you know, I'll give you some time to answer it, you know, and I'm not looking for a thesis, right?

332
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:24,360
It's just some thoughts write, you know, put down some thoughts on there. They'll be graded out of three points.

333
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:27,400
I think twos and threes like two is like, you know.

334
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:33,000
Yeah, you knew what you were talking about. Here is this was good. Three is like, well, I put a lot of thought into this excellent job.

335
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,409
One was you were just fishing for points.

336
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:41,220
You didn't really know what you're saying. Okay. And obviously zero if you don't complete it.

337
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:46,020
The big key here, though, these things can be completed up to 24 hours after class.

338
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:51,240
So if you can't make it to class, you can't make the lecture, you can't complete the minute paper during lecture.

339
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:54,749
You have 24 hours to get it done right. So get it done that evening or something.

340
00:29:54,750 --> 00:30:02,840
And this is my way of saying, even if you don't come to lecture, watch the video and do that minute paper sometime that day to keep you on track.

341
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:08,160
And finally, I'll say, you know, this course will be so much better if you participate, so don't be shy.

342
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:13,830
I could stand up here and talk all day, but, you know, I'd rather you ask questions when you have.

343
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:22,620
Labs. So labs happen on Thursdays and Fridays, and they're 50 minute sessions and they're near weekly.

344
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:30,959
They'll be some weeks. We don't actually have labs. Attended attendance for these is mandatory and will be checked on going to air quote checks

345
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,190
here like jazzercise are going to make sure that that it looks like a full room okay.

346
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:41,040
And it looks like everybody should be there and they'll be looking to see if there's common patterns of missing this.

347
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:47,250
But we're going to wind up doing is we're going to break you off into little groups, little teams, and that'll be your team for the semester.

348
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,450
How old are you guys know each other. Still you still cannot because you live like public consciousness here.

349
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:58,180
So, you know, what's going to happen is you'll go to your lab session and you're going to do

350
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,920
a meet and greet with your GSI and then we're going to break into a lab room.

351
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,560
So, you know, if you've got some obvious friends there, feel free to gravitate towards each other.

352
00:31:06,070 --> 00:31:15,100
Otherwise, you know, you're going to make some new friends. There's no labs today or I'm sorry, labs today or tomorrow.

353
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:18,759
Right to start next week and even next week is very light. It's going to be this meet and greet.

354
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:24,040
We're going to create project groups. And then the GSI is going to give you more of an overview on this article critique.

355
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:29,140
But that's way down the pike. So it's just like telling you, like, here's what that is, but it's the best time to talk about it.

356
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,209
The following week you'll start up for real and you're going to have activities, right?

357
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:38,560
So there'll be seven of them trying to give you hands on concepts covered in class.

358
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:43,180
And then the last three lab sessions will be when you do these article critiques.

359
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:52,430
So what are the lab activities? So they're going to be usually like we give you a small data set either in Excel format or in R.

360
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:55,790
And ask you to do some basic things and answer questions.

361
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:59,689
Right. But they're going to be very much tied in to what we talked about earlier in the week and try

362
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,350
to give you like sort of like concrete examples so that these things kind of make sense.

363
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:09,260
The goal is that these things can be almost entirely completed within a 50 minute lab session.

364
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,130
You might need to like type it up a little bit nicer afterwards or something.

365
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:18,410
But the goal is, you know, these are not you're not carrying this work on into the rest of the week.

366
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:25,450
It should be get mostly done, especially when you've got a team. Then do the following lab sessions you've got again, you should be mostly done,

367
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:30,970
but you got a week to get it submitted there, completed and submitted as a team.

368
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:38,829
So every student gets in the team gets the same grade so that when you know and when we when you do submissions we'll we can show this more if you

369
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:44,500
have questions you guys probably are used to this but you know you'll just have to choose your team that you're submitting for in the pull down.

370
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:49,060
And it's going to be one person's responsibility to get this up posted for the team.

371
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:55,440
So I would encourage you to to sort of think about, you know, how do you want to delegate the weekly responsibilities, okay.

372
00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:01,510
Because, you know, when you've got five people, sometimes five people can't equally contribute to every lab.

373
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:08,230
Right. And so, you know, this is sort of being a grown up and being able to work with other people and say, hey, look, I'll take the lead on this one.

374
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,540
You know, I'll do the coding on this one. Can somebody else, you know, make sure it's written up and submitted?

375
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,660
Okay. Excellent. What about the next one? Who wants to take the lead on that? Right.

376
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:23,260
What's also nice about this is if somebody is sick and misses a week and they just can't be at lab, you know,

377
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:28,900
if that happens to you, just email your your group mates, say, hey, look, I'm sorry I can't make it this week.

378
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:34,330
I will take the lead next week. I'll make sure you know that that that the lab gets submitted next week.

379
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:39,910
Okay. So it's, you know, being responsible. How will we keep track of this?

380
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,010
You know, for one, if you're having problems with a student not contributing, not carrying their weight,

381
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,900
if they go radio silent, you email them and they don't contact the contact you back.

382
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:53,410
Follow up with you, GSI, follow up with me. We can reach out to them.

383
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:00,280
We also we'll do like a citizenship score at the end where you grade other people in your group and just say,

384
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,559
you know, this person contributed or this person didn't contribute.

385
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:09,280
And that's our way of understanding, you know, what happened in the group dynamic, you know, and again, I'd encourage you to work as a team, right?

386
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:13,690
You will make this better for yourself if you can delegate that those weekly responsibilities.

387
00:34:16,290 --> 00:34:21,180
So in terms of dealing with sickness, I do not want you to come to stuff if you are feeling unwell.

388
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:26,460
So as I said, these lectures are recorded. So you are welcome to to watch them later.

389
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,059
The minute papers can be completed remotely within 24 hours.

390
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:34,820
If you miss a lecture, if you miss one minute paper, it's not going to have much of an impact on your grade.

391
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,640
Okay, so don't worry about it. You can miss a minute paper. It's not going to matter that much.

392
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,080
If you when you are well, go to lab and contribute to lab.

393
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:50,940
If you're not well, you know, do the responsible thing, email your crewmates, say, hey, look, I'm not well, I can't come to this lab.

394
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,880
Let me know if there's something I can do remotely. Otherwise, let me take the lead for next week.

395
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:07,510
And then finally, if an instructor is sick because it can happen, we'll figure out contingency plans so we can either hold the lectures or labs over.

396
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:13,030
Zoom will send out a link and we can do it like that. In some cases, we do have backup instructors.

397
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:19,420
I will tell you that after like two and a half years of dodging everything, my December sucked.

398
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:24,270
I was sick the whole time. I finally got COVID and my like one lingering symptoms.

399
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:29,169
I get these, like, bouts of dizziness and if anybody has had to deal with this, but like, I'll just be fine.

400
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:34,960
And then all of a sudden it's like, Oh boy. So there's a possibility I might just have to pull up a chair and stop lecture.

401
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:39,730
I hope that doesn't happen. But, you know, that's what I'm dealing with right now.

402
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:46,399
We'll have office hours. We're still working on when exactly they'll be.

403
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,540
But will each one of us will have a weekly office hour or two?

404
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,250
This is your opportunity to come ask questions about the homeworks in the labs.

405
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:01,880
Specifically homeworks. I'm a softie. If you come to office hours and you ask a question, I'll just give you the answer.

406
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,530
I'm not. I'm not you know, I'm not trying to make it difficult.

407
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:11,120
It's up to you to write it up properly. Right. But, you know, I will give you answers.

408
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:16,520
You know, I think this is an important thing the way I do office hours,

409
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,730
they're just like, I'm going to get a room and it's just going to be like, open. I'll show up there.

410
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:23,149
Right? It's not in my actual office, which stinks. Right.

411
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:28,550
So it's in a room, a fine room, and you're welcome to just like, come in and be like, Hey, I just want to hang out in the back.

412
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:32,719
I might not have a question. Maybe something will catch my attention, and I'll ask that totally.

413
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,080
Fine. Gives you an opportunity to introduce yourself, right?

414
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:41,839
It makes it very you know, you can earn brownie points coming alive and introducing your office hours and introducing yourself.

415
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:48,440
That's you know, it's all I could say. It's it's nice to meet people because I can't do it here and sort of jokingly with free advice.

416
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,669
But I you know, I do understand that that many of you are sort of at a very critical points in your life,

417
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:58,999
in your career, trying to understand what you want to do next. And so while I can't offer you perfect advice, my advice certainly is free.

418
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,230
And I can tell you from my perspective, you know, help you think things through that you might be thinking.

419
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:08,330
And importantly, I think that I can also point you towards directions that could be helpful,

420
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:15,290
be it resources or specific people who maybe have been there before and might be able to help you think about what's going on.

421
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,020
So as I said, I'm still working on specific times. I often like to do Wednesday 1 to 3.

422
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:26,870
Does that work for this class broadly? Who who could make Wednesday 1 to 3?

423
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:37,010
So lots of hands, it looks like. Okay, because I know there's like some other class that's going on, right?

424
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:45,970
It ends at 1230. Okay. I think public health 512 or something.

425
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:53,060
Somebody's taking that. What? I was up.

426
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:58,890
What was it? Five. Okay.

427
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,819
So let's not forget. Is that that that's.

428
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:05,000
How are you in that class? You are.

429
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:12,980
Okay, so what we're going to do is I think we're going to set up like a poll or what do they call a when is good time?

430
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,350
Come back. I'm losing you. Come back.

431
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:23,600
We're going to set up something, GSI, so send it out and we'll just try to get some, like, ideas about when the majority of people can make it.

432
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:30,410
Another option that that we've done is, you know, now that, you know, everybody's comfortable and familiar with zooming.

433
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:38,629
Rachel, especially in classes, I've done these like sort of late afternoon evening remote options so that she just gets on Zoom.

434
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:45,860
And if you have a question like a homework question the day before, it's do you can just pop in to zoom for like 5 minutes,

435
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,880
get your question answered rather than having to, like, walk over to SDH If you weren't going to be here anyway.

436
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,690
So I think we'll we'll stick with that again. Does that that's unreasonable?

437
00:38:53,690 --> 00:39:00,510
Would people use that? Okay. Good. Oh.

438
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:04,410
All right, here we go. It's my least favorite part of the class, but we got to talk about it, right?

439
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:09,330
I got to give you a grade, so let the size that I know.

440
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,520
So what are you graded on? So. First thing I want to show you is right up at the top.

441
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:19,259
Homeworks. Homeworks have the highest percentage in this class.

442
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,950
Right? Because that's the time when you can go think about things.

443
00:39:23,250 --> 00:39:27,000
You can look up what you need to know what you don't know to answer the question.

444
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:31,470
You're not under pressure, right? You know, you have time. So that's 25% of the class.

445
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,660
You're going to do these homeworks individually.

446
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:40,020
I encourage you to work together on them, but whatever you hand in has to be what you've written or typed up yourself.

447
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:45,689
I will tell you, Rachel has an eagle eye. She can catch copying a mile away.

448
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:50,249
She did it last semester. Do not copy, write for one.

449
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:56,720
She'll catch you because she's good for two You know, the way you learn is by sitting there and processing the information, right?

450
00:39:56,730 --> 00:40:00,150
You actually learn by writing things or typing things, right? Forcing it to go through your head.

451
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:05,460
So again, work together. But when it comes time to submit something, do it yourself.

452
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,929
We're going to have these lab activities. Those are going to be as part of a group, right?

453
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:14,999
So everybody in the group is going to get the same grade. That's 20% of the course the article critiques.

454
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:21,300
Those are going to be done in pairs of students. Okay. Well, I'll give you more details on what that actually is in a minute, but that'll be 10%.

455
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:30,510
You'll have two exams in this class. The first one covers sort of the like reading research through study designs that'll be 20%.

456
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,690
And then the second exam is going to be the statistics part.

457
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:38,129
So basic stats review through the end of the course and then the participation grade, right?

458
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:42,090
So these these are minute papers and then that citizenship score.

459
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,050
Right. And I think here's my my break down to the grading scale I think is pretty standard.

460
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:52,580
Okay. And in terms of homeworks, again, they'll be assigned nearly weekly.

461
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:59,040
They'll be start due at the start of the day indicated. So it's if it's a Tuesday or Thursday, I'll be doing 1130 before you show up here.

462
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,600
You'll see these things start to show up on the assignments tab on canvas.

463
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:10,500
Okay. You submit them electronically through canvas as anybody has already used grade scope here.

464
00:41:10,950 --> 00:41:15,480
Yeah. Okay. So you're good with that. Will you use and grade scope again work together.

465
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:19,830
But you know when I say this all submitted work must be your own.

466
00:41:20,130 --> 00:41:25,470
Imagine at this, if I were to take your homework and bring it over you and say,

467
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,710
Tell me why you wrote this, you need to be able to answer that question, right?

468
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:34,320
The only way you can answer that question is if you wrote it yourself, right? That that's what I mean by work together.

469
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,870
But you should be able to defend any responses you give.

470
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:43,530
And again, like we said, labs, you know, there's going to be one submitted per group and they'll be due one week later.

471
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:51,540
Late assignments. I am very flexible with extensions.

472
00:41:52,230 --> 00:42:00,030
If you come talk to me first. Okay. What I don't want is two weeks after the assignment do you're like, hey, remember the homework three.

473
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:04,680
You got to do that one. You come talk to me in advance and we can work something out.

474
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:08,240
My first question is always going to be, okay, when can you get it in?

475
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:11,700
Right. So think about that before you approach me for for an extension.

476
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:16,130
If you just. Don't do it and turn your homework in late.

477
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:23,060
We're going to have to take some deductions off. And again, these are easily avoidable if you just come talk to me in advance.

478
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:27,980
If you do submit a homework late. Even if I gave you an okay on it.

479
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:31,340
Right? I say, hey, yeah. You know, you need three more days. That's totally fine.

480
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,839
You got to notify your GSA, you got to email your GSA and say, Hey, Rachel, hey, Morgan.

481
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:40,129
I submitted this homework late because they don't know like they don't know if you submitted it late, right?

482
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:45,830
So it won't get graded. So, you know, it's fine. You can say, hey, Dr. Z approved this, just letting you know what's in there.

483
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:50,000
But again, what you don't want to have happen is you submit it and then it just nobody knows.

484
00:42:50,000 --> 00:43:00,780
Nobody knows it got submitted, right? Briefly on example, I'm still thinking through some of the finer points of how exams will work this year,

485
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,730
but they do cover lecture content, the readings, the homeworks, the lab activities.

486
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,110
I'll show you in a second.

487
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:13,530
I gave you exams from last year that you can use both to see what the format will look like and also sort of a bit of a practice session.

488
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:19,950
They're going to be in-person, but I also like the option of capturing it through canvas.

489
00:43:20,370 --> 00:43:27,509
So I'm sort of toying here with how I'm going to do this. I think it's going to be I will have paper exams that I will give you.

490
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:34,499
When you show up here, you'll take the exam here, you will have your laptop so that you can enter into canvas.

491
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:39,270
So it captures it, right? And then they'll also be like some open responses where you can type in your answers.

492
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,340
We'll get you more details closer to the date. And I might have to just bounce some ideas off of you.

493
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:57,330
Questions on that or something else, I think I was going to say. Oh, and again, because you have your laptop, there's going to be their open book.

494
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,330
Open book exams because you've got your laptop.

495
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:09,960
I don't I don't I don't you know, I don't want to, you know, put people on the spot where, you know, you've got the Internet just sitting right there.

496
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:17,040
You know, you're welcome to use it. So these are the dates for the exams that Tuesday, February 21st is a regular lecture time.

497
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:20,880
And then this is the, you know, the school time that they gave us.

498
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,480
Yep. We are? No, absolutely not.

499
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:31,740
No. Yeah.

500
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:34,780
And again, go. You're welcome. The exams are up there. I'll show you in a second.

501
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:37,840
You're welcome to go look at them right away and see what they see, what they look like.

502
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:44,350
So let me let me briefly talk about this article, critique presentation that you are going to do.

503
00:44:44,830 --> 00:44:49,570
You're going to get more details on this next Thursday or Friday. And lab big picture,

504
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:56,620
what is this article critique about what I want you to do while you're doing

505
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:59,980
this critique is to convince yourself that you learned something this semester.

506
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,080
That's really it. I want you to convince yourself that if you had to read a paper,

507
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:12,670
the things we talked about in this course help you to unlock new ideas, understand things better.

508
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:19,450
And that's all this article critique is about. So you'll create two team, two person teams.

509
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:23,410
You got to be in the same lab section just because that's when we do the presentations.

510
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:27,790
You'll choose a research article that describes a public health or medical study.

511
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:33,640
What you can't use is an opinion or commentary piece. It has to be actual like study.

512
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:37,150
Must be a research paper that's got data, some experimental design in it.

513
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:44,620
And what you do is it's quite brief. Your deliverable is quite brief on one of those three weeks at the end of the semester,

514
00:45:45,190 --> 00:45:50,829
you and your partner will give a short presentation, so you'll make some PowerPoint slides about 7 to 8 minutes.

515
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:55,630
And actually the guys I'll show you were very clear, like what the slides should be and what they should cover.

516
00:45:56,530 --> 00:46:02,829
But you'll talk about what the what the, what the study is, provide some critical evaluation of it,

517
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:07,240
both the study design, how data was collected, how the analysis was done.

518
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:13,690
And then sort of the the key piece is that we want you to pick one piece of

519
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:18,309
information from the paper that you understand better because of this course.

520
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:22,720
Right. And it might be some issue with ethics of how the study was performed.

521
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:25,540
It might be some like nuance of the study design.

522
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:30,340
It might be, hey, I would have had no idea what this statistical method was, but now I understand that better.

523
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:36,969
Okay. And then each team, you know, there'll be a couple of minutes for question and answer and the guys will pick one team to,

524
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:40,390
to ask questions of another writer to motivate the questions.

525
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:44,500
There you'll get more info. But again, you don't need to pick this paper now.

526
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:47,110
You've got plenty of time, but have it in the back of your head. Right.

527
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:53,019
If there's a topic that's that's sort of catching your interest, you know, if a paper comes up, you know, that's the one you might want to grab.

528
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:58,780
Okay? So just and you need to grab it imminently, but just as you go about your your day for the next few few months,

529
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:02,500
you know, if there's a paper, we were like, you know what? This is one I'd like to look more closely at.

530
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:03,460
There you go.

531
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:10,970
You know there'll be a sign up sheet in the size will help you to make sure that what you've got is a paper that I'm going to say acceptable here.

532
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:12,350
But don't think about it like that.

533
00:47:12,590 --> 00:47:18,070
What the jigsaw is are going to do is they're going to take a look at it and they're going to be more like, oh, this is pretty tough.

534
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:23,809
I don't know if you want to dig into this. Right. You know, you know, what we don't want to do is, you know, the week before your presentation,

535
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:26,870
you start working on a paper and it's like over my head, right?

536
00:47:26,870 --> 00:47:29,390
You know? And it's like you're like, Oh, why did I pick this paper? Right?

537
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:35,090
So the guys can take a look at a paper and be like, Yeah, I think this is a good this paper set a good level for you to be able to do.

538
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:42,270
Any quick questions on that? I know that was brief, but, you know, you'll you got you'll hear more about it this time.

539
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:51,840
All right. So Homestretch, your last couple of things so academic integrity so you know this is this is important, right?

540
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,920
You are in in college, you are embarking on your career.

541
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,870
It is no longer okay to cheat.

542
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:10,650
We had Rachel and I had a very unfortunate situation last semester in my graduate class that has made me rethink canvas tests on canvas and stuff.

543
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:17,549
But what I would say is, you know, there's there's a lot of information that you can get from each other, right?

544
00:48:17,550 --> 00:48:24,390
By talking by working through problems together. I highly, highly encourage you to do that on the homeworks in the labs.

545
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:31,709
As I said, you just have to you have to submit the solutions that are written by you when it comes time to the exams.

546
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:36,630
You cannot collaborate with others, either people in this class or people outside this class.

547
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,559
And I would finally, you know, I would remind you that, you know, you're here to learn, right?

548
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:45,330
You're here to to become this public health practitioner. You're here to become a an M.D., right.

549
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:51,930
You do not get to that goal and be able to help people the way you want to by cheating.

550
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:57,810
It's just not going to work. You got to learn things. Okay. So so please keep that in mind.

551
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:06,230
Student accommodations. I've already gotten several SSD forms from students, so just know that I do get those.

552
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:14,530
I keep track of them. The big one is going to be extra time and then a room that is distraction free for taking the test because it's in person.

553
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,170
I'm going to work on getting that room very shortly,

554
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:22,030
trying to find a room that if that is the accommodation you need, you'll just go off to that room.

555
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:26,440
Extra time is easy to do because I just give you extra time in campus.

556
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:35,969
In terms of, you know, if you have planned absences for things like religious observances, sports, a conference or something, not a problem, right?

557
00:49:35,970 --> 00:49:37,830
Just come talk to me and tell me in advance.

558
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:42,750
You know, we'll just figure out like, oh, you're going to be gone when this homework is due or, you know, when can you get it in afterwards?

559
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:46,840
Okay. Okay.

560
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:55,000
Another thing I want to talk here is about student well-being. So I am here to try to teach you about public health and biostatistics.

561
00:49:55,540 --> 00:50:04,060
But I want you to also know that I do care about you individually. And so specifically, one thing that I'm very big on is mental health.

562
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:09,100
So I will tell you, as a graduate student, I had a lot of problems with anxiety and depression.

563
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:15,370
I still have problems with anxiety and depression. Get up in front of 100 people who don't really want to be in this class.

564
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:24,010
And you can find out what anxiety is like. Right. But, you know, I want to tell you that, you know, I I'm not I don't have the answers for it.

565
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:29,180
But what I do know is that I've been there. I understand what it feels like to be overwhelmed.

566
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:32,920
I understand what it feels like to not have an answer.

567
00:50:33,670 --> 00:50:41,470
I am always happy to talk through that with you. Help you see that often you know things aren't as bad as you perceive them to be.

568
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:48,240
And. The thing that I've really learned is you can't do nothing and expect it to change.

569
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,580
Right. It's not going to go away. I hate to say.

570
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:57,570
You know, I don't I don't know of anybody who's had, like, anxiety or depression and it just stopped like it just went away.

571
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:01,920
I don't know, like, you have to learn to manage it. And by doing nothing, that's not going to fix it.

572
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:05,790
And so if I can do nothing else for you this semester, you know,

573
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:09,360
if I could help you get on that road to managing it, I'd be more than happy to do that for you.

574
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:15,570
So there's lots of resources here, you know, in terms of, you know, of course, caps, which you might be familiar with.

575
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,840
There's the stress resources. That's just another list of links.

576
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:22,799
There's another one that I forget that maybe one of you know, there's that there's the undergrad.

577
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,990
What is it called? Michigan. Somebody now it's like.

578
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:32,290
It's like a peer to peer or something like. Wolverine Support Network.

579
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:36,459
So you guys are familiar with that. So I get more information on that. But I know,

580
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:42,970
I know I had I've had students in this class that have been like sort of in the lead of that Wolverine support network and heard good things about it.

581
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:47,080
Another one that's very important here is the Center for Education of Women.

582
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:50,950
And there's actually a plus sign after it is plus sign means anybody can go.

583
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:55,870
Has anybody heard of the Center for Educational Women? They do lots of things to try to help.

584
00:51:56,830 --> 00:52:01,809
If you go there and you don't get the help you need. Tell me. My wife works there and I will make sure you get the help you need.

585
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:07,780
Okay. But but again, it's it's another place where if you're having again,

586
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,399
if it's mental health, if it's if it's like a rent problem, if it's a food problem.

587
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,870
Right. They can try to give you help on anything you might need there.

588
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:23,590
And there's also a lot of like emergency services that speech to, you know, you're new to space, but there's a lot of like, you know, like, again,

589
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:32,079
if you're having if you have, like, temporary financial problems, there is there's money that that can get can get you over the hump or something.

590
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:37,600
Right. Again, I don't have all the answers, but I will I will always try to help you find answers if you need them.

591
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:43,600
So I want to just do a quick tour of canvas. I take pride in my canvas sites.

592
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,440
I feel like they're pretty good compared to some of the other canvas sites I see for other classes.

593
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:54,249
So syllabus is going to be available here rather than like have it all, you know, written out.

594
00:52:54,250 --> 00:53:00,520
I just have it as a link because then I can easily just put if I have to make a change, it's like, boom, the most recent copy is right there.

595
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:10,879
If you really want to learn a little bit more about us, here's your teaching team.

596
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,180
But most importantly, our email addresses on this teaching team page.

597
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,700
Office hours is kind of useless page right now because we have picked office hours, but that's where they'll be.

598
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:25,220
Once Rachel picks a time for that Zoom evening office hours, that Zoom link will go up here.

599
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,589
On resources. Now, I just I just I just spent a little bit of time making this nice.

600
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,639
I'm quite proud of these tabs on here right now. But here's the statistics tax.

601
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,640
You don't need this until, you know, a month and a half from now.

602
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,050
But this is you know, I'll say, hey, like, you know, chapter three might be something useful for read.

603
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:52,260
I love this book because most intro statistics hasn't changed in like 50 years or something, so why pay 90 bucks for a textbook?

604
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:59,759
This open intro is like an open source book. They just put it on the internet for free made by some people, mostly at Duke.

605
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:06,510
I believe the one woman that does it is sort of like a real leader in statistical education and pushes for open source material.

606
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:11,280
So it's right there. And they've got actually some other open source books that you might be interested in.

607
00:54:12,060 --> 00:54:19,290
Passed exams, excuse me right here. So I give you both an exam, you know, as it appeared, without the answers and also solutions.

608
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,500
So it gives you a chance to sort of take it for practice if you want.

609
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,059
On the first exam,

610
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:30,120
I assign some kind of reading assignment in advance that you have to read and then you'll have to answer questions about it on the exam.

611
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,580
Okay. So you don't have to like read a full paper during the exam.

612
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:39,870
So again, look at these not only as a as a as a study guide, but a way to be like, all right, what am I walking into here?

613
00:54:39,870 --> 00:54:48,270
What do I need to be prepared for? Homework Answer Quiz will be put up here when they're went after you, after they've been submitted and graded.

614
00:54:48,570 --> 00:54:55,460
Same thing with the lab answer quiz. So labs are right here.

615
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:57,650
I think these are going to be locked for the moment, right.

616
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:03,200
They'll be opened up once you get to either the day of or the week of labs, depending on what you need.

617
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:06,920
But these are the links, right? So this is just going to be locked. Right.

618
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:14,680
But it will tell you when that once open. But here's here's all the labs that you need to know about and the information.

619
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:20,090
So in terms of like a week to week basis or lecture to lecture basis,

620
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:25,720
if you click on any one of these right, it'll take you to a page that looks like this know.

621
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,339
And this is where I post my slides. So these are the slides I showed you today or right here in the future.

622
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:37,280
What it will look like is something more like this where I try to give you a little bit of an understanding of what we're going to do.

623
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:43,790
I have required readings, so notice that, you know, in bold here, I tell you, read these before class.

624
00:55:44,030 --> 00:55:49,879
So I said, I'll try to be very explicit. Like if it's a you need to know this for the minute paper to understand what we're going to do.

625
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:55,040
I will tell you that. But otherwise it's not, you know, it's like, well, you can come back and read these later.

626
00:55:56,090 --> 00:56:02,180
I will post my slides here. As I said, I'll try to get this done the day before so that so that you have them.

627
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:10,099
And then this would be the link to the minute paper which during class or if you do it after class, when you click on this,

628
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,680
it will take you to a page here that will just be like a one question canvas quiz that will prompt you with that question,

629
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,020
you'll type in your response. Again, couple of sentences just to show that you're thinking about the problem.

630
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:26,000
You know, hit enter and you're done then with the minute paper. Um.

631
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:33,860
Yes. Well, you know, I killed off some of these links below because to be honest, we're going to be juggling around.

632
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,960
We've got a bunch of guest lecturers. Their schedules are changing.

633
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:44,160
Uh, one is I think the 23rd and the.

634
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:48,920
No, the 28th and the 30th. Right. That's ah. So I will, I'll be honest I ah.

635
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,489
Two years ago we also go to Disney with my family. You three years ago now, right.

636
00:56:53,490 --> 00:56:57,719
It was 2020. We were supposed to go take my kids to Disney when they were like little, little.

637
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:03,160
And now my older daughter is 13. So I've like one last chance to get her to Disney before she was gonna hang out with me any more.

638
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:08,129
Right. So I. I am taking off the 28th and the 30th.

639
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:14,010
I'm going to take my family at Disney for some reason, like the Ann Arbor Public Schools.

640
00:57:14,010 --> 00:57:17,370
And U of them cannot get their spring breaks to be the same week.

641
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:20,250
It's ridiculous. Right. People who went to school here, it's crazy.

642
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:25,259
So you've got all these people who work at U of M and have little kids, and yet their spring breaks are different weeks.

643
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:29,520
So I'm just telling you, that's the reason why I'm not doing that over spring break.

644
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:34,050
But so we've got some plants here to to fill in for me. I think Morgan's going to going to lead a lecture.

645
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:42,610
Any questions on the canvass site? Okay. So there's there's no announced no no assignments up yet or these you know,

646
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:47,160
you can't do this yet, but these will be come available for the labs in the minute papers.

647
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:51,180
But this is where your homework assignments will pop up. Obviously, announcements.

648
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:57,600
I'm a big announcement person through campus. So, you know, if I send an announcement, usually something pretty important.

649
00:57:57,600 --> 00:58:03,959
So please do pay attention and read it. And then the Panopto recordings are going to show up right here once we have some.

650
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:09,590
So this sort of recording right now. All right.

651
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:14,030
Last thing I want to do is how many people are familiar with poll everywhere?

652
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:22,550
Almost everybody at this point. Okay. So I like to use poll everywhere because it gives me a chance to ask questions.

653
00:58:23,690 --> 00:58:26,530
I can get some interaction going.

654
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:34,849
It allows me to get especially when we get into the statistics part, but it allows me to like say, hey, can you do this?

655
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:39,650
Can you do this like pencil and paper right at your seat right now and then answer back or do I need to go back over this?

656
00:58:40,730 --> 00:58:44,990
I will use it in the beginning of the course. So like motivates my thought provoking question.

657
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:52,280
I think they're thought provoking. And, and also there will be times when I can just at the beginning of class, I'll just post it.

658
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:55,399
If anybody has a question and they're too shy to ask it, it'll be anonymous.

659
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,580
You could just send it up here, right, and get your question answered.

660
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:04,919
So let's start. With a pole everywhere.

661
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:08,910
QUESTION So if you're not familiar with what you have to do, you can either.

662
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:14,370
The one way you can do it is you can text it.

663
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:17,939
Sorry, I didn't choose this. I was just given this, but you could text this.

664
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:26,309
Matthew's hours 813 to this number right here. Once you're once you're connected there, you can choose A or B as your response.

665
00:59:26,310 --> 00:59:31,710
And then that sort of text chain is what you can use the rest of the semester.

666
00:59:31,850 --> 00:59:38,339
Right, if you want to continue to use it. I know a lot of people like to download the app for poll everywhere and then that gives you

667
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:42,360
a little bit more information because it actually shows you the question on your phone,

668
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:50,799
you know, and then you can like click it rather than having the type of response. So we definitely have more than 60 people here.

669
00:59:50,800 --> 01:00:07,530
So I'm going to give you another second. Okay.

670
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:12,480
Wants to talk and picks up. I assume that we're we're good. Okay.

671
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:17,700
So we've got data here. We've got some data. This is going to be our first lesson in data.

672
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:24,960
Right. Just because you have collected data doesn't necessarily mean it's good or true.

673
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:32,580
Right. One person, it looks like put no in that they couldn't respond to this poll.

674
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,330
Right. So this would be an example of incorrect data.

675
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:42,870
Right. You know, clearly, this person did not give a correct or a true response to this survey.

676
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:50,980
Okay. What else is wrong with this question? Am I to believe that that.

677
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:59,280
Clearly 99% of people think. Not everybody.

678
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:03,290
What? Okay.

679
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:09,780
So what would be the problem there? Yeah.

680
01:01:09,810 --> 01:01:14,560
Somebody else. That's a great that's a great question.

681
01:01:14,560 --> 01:01:18,040
Right. We do this all the time, though, right?

682
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:21,100
This happens all the time. And collection of public health data. Right.

683
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:24,680
We have these instruments that are set up to collect data.

684
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:31,959
Here, this instrument is poll everywhere. Right. But not everybody is able to access the tool for the instrument and use it.

685
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:34,990
Right. And yet then this data is meaningless. Right.

686
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:42,850
If there's a large fraction of people who can't respond to this poll because they forgot their phone, they can't get it to work.

687
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:46,809
Right. They can't get it to connect. Right. I'm not seeing the response here.

688
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:50,350
Right. So they're being ignored. Okay. So that's our first lesson in data.

689
01:01:50,350 --> 01:01:56,710
Right. And we've seen two examples here. Right. We've got a data point that is collected that's clearly wrong.

690
01:01:57,190 --> 01:02:03,610
Right. But then we've also got missing data. Right? So people that couldn't actually respond to this potentially because of the instrument.

691
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:09,610
Good. And now we're just getting crazy because now we're getting to 2% of people saying no, but.

692
01:02:11,610 --> 01:02:15,510
All right. So that was a multiple choice.

693
01:02:15,570 --> 01:02:21,450
You know, here's I think this is a word cloud, right? Business, first person, first major.

694
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:27,600
So lots of public health. So anybody who's not a public health teacher.

695
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:34,680
So biology. What's M.I.A.

696
01:02:38,090 --> 01:02:41,330
What's M.I.A. I don't. Are you?

697
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,540
Totally fine. So.

698
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:50,690
MKB A molecular cellular developed by pottery.

699
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:56,870
Several pottery. There was going to fess up to it, but.

700
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:01,500
Okay. Spanish.

701
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:07,499
Very good. All right.

702
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:11,850
So you see how these workouts work. You know, we don't have to dwell on it. And then here's the final thing.

703
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:19,020
And this is your chance to be honest. And this is how I get it. I get a feel for where you are entering the class.

704
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:24,480
What do you think when you hear data and statistics?

705
01:03:25,290 --> 01:03:29,220
What is your initial reaction? Boring. Okay.

706
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,370
Be honest. Be honest. Scary. Oh, look at that.

707
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:40,150
Look at. We can put an emoji in there. Nervous.

708
01:03:40,180 --> 01:03:51,810
Eek. Hard. Somebody put blue in the last 250 stats to 50.

709
01:03:56,350 --> 01:04:08,800
Poop shows up. Okay. All right.

710
01:04:08,830 --> 01:04:11,970
But we're separate. They're separate. So.

711
01:04:12,130 --> 01:04:14,550
So we've got, you know, we've got a range of emotions here.

712
01:04:14,620 --> 01:04:20,470
You know, one thing I want to do is I want to acknowledge, right, that this statistics and data are not everybody's wheelhouse.

713
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:31,059
I get that. And I just want to leave this class and you off knowing that, yeah, you know, you become a better, well-rounded individual, right?

714
01:04:31,060 --> 01:04:35,500
When you push yourself in areas that are not necessarily your strength or even your interest point,

715
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:45,850
but that careers you want to go into in the time in which you exist require you to have some ability to work with data and understand data.

716
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:51,429
And so that's what I want you to take from this. Right. Nobody's saying you have to love statistics after this class.

717
01:04:51,430 --> 01:04:56,920
Lammy says you have to be an expert with statistics after this class. Right. I hope it's just that there's a little bit more of an appreciation.

718
01:04:57,250 --> 01:05:03,520
And also another thing is, you know, the areas you're going into public health is a highly, highly interdisciplinary area.

719
01:05:03,850 --> 01:05:06,850
Right. Nobody works on these projects by themselves. Right.

720
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:11,379
You work on teams where people have overlapping interests and overlapping skill sets.

721
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:17,650
Okay. There are always going to be people like me who, you know, biostatistics is their jam and that's what they like to do.

722
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:23,389
Right. But you and I need to be able to meet together and have some overlapping skills.

723
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:28,180
Or do I need to know enough about epidemiology or environmental health or genetics?

724
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:35,980
Right. And you need to know enough about data and biostatistics and study design so that we can get together and we can work efficiently together.

725
01:05:36,490 --> 01:05:41,890
And so even if you're not a statistics nut, that's what that's what the value, I hope of this class can be.

726
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:48,680
For next lecture. You do have a reading assignment, so you've got the weekend to work on this.

727
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:56,660
So what I've got for you is a paper that sources are not.

728
01:05:56,660 --> 01:06:03,800
Nothing special about these. It's just a nice example. It's this is a CNN article that was you know, it's a couple of years old at this point,

729
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:09,980
but it's called just one dose of the HPV vaccine may protect against infection, new study suggests.

730
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:19,879
So this is a media article. And then this right here is the actual primary research article upon which this media article is based.

731
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:27,200
Okay, so I want you to read both of them and just sort of think about what kind of things show up in one versus the other.

732
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:31,790
Okay. And your minute paper that we're going to do on Tuesday is going to be based on that.

733
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:32,930
It's not a test.

734
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:40,909
You don't have to know like specific facts, but you just have to be roughly aware of like, you know, what was the focus of the CNN health article?

735
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:43,520
What was the focus of the JAMA Network Open article?

736
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:49,219
And then what we're going to do on Tuesday is we're going to talk more about research papers and also

737
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:54,020
the publication process and might surprise you with some of the things about the publication process.

738
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:58,550
I will stop there. Thank you for coming today. Welcome to the class.

739
01:06:59,360 --> 01:07:03,560
I will stick around for a bit if you have questions. Otherwise, I will see you next Tuesday.
