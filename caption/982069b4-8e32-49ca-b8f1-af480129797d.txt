1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:05,880
Okay. I'm trying to get started. So this is the last class in the lipids unit.

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:10,950
A reminder one day will be another review session. We just like the last one with full everywhere.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:20,180
And next question. And right now, if you have questions for the exam, unfortunately,

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:27,599
I'm going to town in like an hour and a half and I'll be back like not until Saturday, but I'll be on Zoom and I have plenty of free time.

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,410
So if you need to chat,

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:35,510
you know me or text me about and if you need to get on zoom or I'll make myself available to you if you feel that you will have Monday,

7
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:50,880
Tuesday and little bit of exam format, size, length on top of the book, the number of questions, same type of short answer, then we'll make sure.

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,710
Okay. All right. So we're going to do it. She's going to start with today's meeting.

9
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:03,100
Yeah. So here is your plan all you want.

10
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:06,840
But the these little. Yeah. So exactly.

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,140
So you've got to be able to do something different.

12
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,980
Yeah. Yeah. Principal I.

13
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:28,020
I'm talking about nut butters today, which makes sense for the lipid unit because as you'll see in most nuts and in numbers are most fats.

14
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:34,469
But I thought would be interesting to what I think when most people think of nut butters,

15
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,370
they think about peanut butter first, even though I'm going to talk about a few different types.

16
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:46,350
So a comparison. But this is George Washington Carver and you can probably remember from algae school that he invented,

17
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:54,680
like all of these things to do with peanuts, but he did not invent peanut butter, which was like the one thing that he was not able to encompass.

18
00:01:55,080 --> 00:02:01,080
So the first peanut butter was made by the Incas and really civilizations,

19
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:07,170
because humans are often grown in South and Central America and then in the United States.

20
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:13,050
Now, I would say that Dr. Kellogg, who is like the guy behind Kellogg's Cereal and all of those products,

21
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:18,060
supposedly invented peanut butter in the United States, even though it was probably even before that.

22
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,880
And then it kind of became a the market after a doctor in Saint Louis, Missouri,

23
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,790
used peanut butter as a protein source for older patients who were not able to like true meat and things like that.

24
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:36,540
And so then at the C Louis World Fair in 1904, it became a market that was a big machine to make peanut butter.

25
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,750
It became a whole thing. And then in World Wars, the U.S. Army used it to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to feed the soldiers.

26
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,770
And now half the peanuts in the United States are consumed as peanut butter.

27
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:51,120
And with almost 500,000 metric tons of peanuts a year.

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,909
So that's 250,000 metric tons going towards peanut butter in the United States is not the biggest producer of peanuts in the world,

29
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:04,410
and they're used for other purposes in other countries. So peanut butter was the first nut butter, if you want to say that.

30
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:08,790
But now there's almost an iconic brands that are not that you can think of.

31
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,450
And so these are a few examples, just ones that you would recognize on the shelves.

32
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:19,680
But if you are allergic to nuts, which a lot of people are, there are a few different options by the two or maybe most famous,

33
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,030
I would say are some butter and which is made out of sunflower seeds.

34
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,400
And while butter, which is a store based product and both have some more interesting facts, but I'll talk about that in a second.

35
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,080
And so these are the nutrition facts from the USDA.

36
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:39,090
I chose branded data because I think when most people think about peanut butter,

37
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:46,080
you're buying the one on the shelf that you recognize the name or another. And so these are the facts from Jif peanut butter, Justin's almond butter,

38
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,129
which there's a few almond butter brands, but I think people would recognize that one.

39
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,460
And then to kind of choose something that maybe not everyone has tried or has really heard of on this show,

40
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:59,880
but there wasn't really reasoning for that. So it's just interesting to compare them.

41
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:07,680
Let's start with protein, which a lot of people view nuts and nut butter as a protein source, and they are good sources of protein.

42
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:17,040
But you can see it's only 68 grams, which is according to is nutrition, 34% of your daily value and you convert them to fats.

43
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,360
That is really not that much.

44
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:26,370
So nut butter is actually serve as a fat source and then you protein and all three of these are upwards of ten grams of fat.

45
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,620
What's most of that is healthy fats, but some of it is something about two.

46
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:37,290
Then at the bottom now you're looking at the total fat content of all of these.

47
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:48,000
And what's interesting is on the branded information of like, you know, butter and all the butter does not include pollens, defense or one Â£100.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,070
They only do the difference in saturated fat or like how much fat there is total and then the saturated fat.

49
00:04:53,310 --> 00:05:00,990
So you have to figure it out for yourself. But in both brands, there's not much entry to fat, so you can assume that the rest comes from rules.

50
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,910
And then in terms of branded foods, they don't talk too much about macronutrients.

51
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:12,450
But one interesting one is that there is a lot of niacin in peanuts and 6% makes them four.

52
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:18,330
Six milligrams is 35% of your daily value. So that is something that's not present in almonds or pistachios.

53
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:23,729
And that is because peanuts are legumes, which are not actually tree nuts and almonds, pistachios, cashews.

54
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:28,260
All those nuts that you can think of are truly nuts. And niacin is important for metabolism.

55
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:35,520
But also some studies have linked niacin supplementation to reduce cardiovascular risk and increased cognitive health,

56
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,579
although supplementation with B vitamins and all other vitamins is really kind

57
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,700
of messy in terms of what the research suggests is helpful and what's not.

58
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:54,570
And so interesting, this is a comparison of all tree nuts and their nutrition facts and I've highlighted just a few interesting ones so fully.

59
00:05:54,570 --> 00:06:01,020
And Vitamin E and manganese are different most among the tree nuts, almonds in particular have a lot of filling,

60
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,110
which is interesting because folate is often not where there's not enough in people's diets.

61
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,990
So if you are interested in trying a new type of nut butter, you could use this comparison chart to kind of see which.

62
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,670
What is the message in terms of minorities?

63
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:28,420
And then I think in the slides there's a sheet on the Google slides, I did a comparison of some of the sheets that like not boards.

64
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:31,840
I made that show you all the different micronutrients in each one and you can find those.

65
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:35,890
If you Google like Almond Board, it will tell you everything you need to know about almonds and on the letter.

66
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,659
But this is a comparison with some butter. So this is a nut free alternative.

67
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:45,580
And especially now when school said that there's almost no nuts present in a lot of like children's environments.

68
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,110
Some butter is a similar alternative.

69
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,659
But the interesting thing about that is there's not very many micronutrients

70
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:57,940
and provide a little bit content is unclear because they listed at the bottom.

71
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,569
It's in the fatty acid section, but it doesn't equal this after it focused on saturated fat does not equal the

72
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:08,049
total fat content in the dietary fonts and that's from the branded content.

73
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,610
So there's no USDA tested version of some other.

74
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:19,230
So it's just kind of an interesting discrepancy in the data, but they're pretty comparison comparable in terms of other U.S. products.

75
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:27,460
So then this is the research. And if you put into combat like nuts and health or nuts and risk, you'll get tens of thousands of results.

76
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:35,979
And one complete systematic review said these are some of the potential health benefits and nuts.

77
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:42,070
And you could say that we're just hypertension for people with type two diabetes, risk of obesity, all these things,

78
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:48,990
and then this specific systematic review recording all of these things for the different types of events.

79
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:57,880
So the big one, which covered just nuts and cardiovascular disease risk, did six huge studies, and that's like pre-med,

80
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:04,750
the nurses health study, the physician study, like big famous ones that people know and they combine all the data.

81
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,659
And so that there was an 8.3% reduction in CVD risk with each week trigger consumption.

82
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:14,350
So if you like almonds for another reason, you would reduce your risk by this.

83
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:20,920
But they did make a multiple of consensus on other relationships between like diabetes and those things.

84
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,689
Okay. So this is a randomized controlled trial and my thesis research is focused on type one diabetes.

85
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:36,589
So I tried to find something that was diabetes related because it's interesting to me, but there's only really small type two diabetes.

86
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:44,420
So this is a study and they basically split people who had diabetes, type two diabetes between an arm and group and peanut group.

87
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:52,250
There's no control without Johnson Johnson. Interesting. So they didn't really care about like another diet and all these people were exercisers,

88
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:56,120
so they did not have any change over time in the exercise group.

89
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,990
And then they did a perspective which incidentally went back in time and they had a pretty good study term,

90
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,219
so were measuring a few different things and they used intent to treat analysis and they were able to keep that analysis up because the way that they

91
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:18,110
assessed compliance was through bringing back to back allotments that they had given to each person so they could really see like how many peanuts it.

92
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,920
Here are some of the results. So this is fasting blood glucose in both groups.

93
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,930
And the only significant time difference was between week three and ten.

94
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,440
And there were significant differences between fasting.

95
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:43,940
But because in both groups, which is small but there's a general downward trend and then this is a regular statistical analysis.

96
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:50,450
And if you're going like horizontal, they're comparing between groups, but downwards is within each group.

97
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:57,170
So the peanut group in our group will have statistical differences or significant

98
00:09:57,410 --> 00:10:00,770
differences between the baseline and third month fasting blood glucose,

99
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:08,179
which indicates and maybe nuts are helpful in type two diabetes, glucose homeostasis or glycemic control.

100
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:15,620
And this one has similar results for postprandial local groups, which both groups are significant, but not between groups.

101
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:23,870
And then this is quite possibly the most interesting part of it is that none of these other indicators were significant between or within groups.

102
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:31,549
So they really only have significant results on blood glucose, which in terms of type two diabetes management is obviously important.

103
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:35,450
But so are some of these other indicators for health like triglycerides and LDL.

104
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,739
So nothing in those groups was significant. And that and conclusion nuts are definitely good for you.

105
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:47,209
They have a lot of good things and they are definitely satiating, but they're not magic.

106
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,880
And all these studies report things that are in concordance with things that we already know, like who doesn't move.

107
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,340
Those are good for you. B Vitamins are good for you.

108
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:02,210
The protein and fat content is satiating and the research is moving towards long term effects, which is good.

109
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:08,420
But some of these smaller studies are need to be taken into consideration about like how long term those effects might last.

110
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:14,540
And there's something that's interesting is that peanuts in general are high caloric content,

111
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,979
but that's not really a worry in studies where they're studying type two diabetes

112
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:25,610
and things because people tend to eat less because they're satiated by the nuts. So in general, the studies show that they're not only good for you,

113
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:30,350
but it's nothing too crazy in comparison to what you already know about basic nutrition.

114
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:46,450
Yes. So for either one of the studies, did they say how many nuts the participants were eating or no one serving?

115
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:50,940
And they were vacuum packed, so or not, it didn't have to be like an actual, like, sweats.

116
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,890
Oh, my gosh. So out into bags for them. And then they had to return the empty bags to prove that they were eating the right serving size.

117
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:07,910
We're like, that's good, but not entirely foolproof. They did say that they they kept the intend to tree instead of switching because

118
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:14,360
the compliance was good and it was three months we had to beat them every day. So I think that's kind of impressive for three months.

119
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:23,720
But still they had some other problems. But. So.

120
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:41,550
Okay. So so today we're going to talk about two, two and a half different lipid transport mechanisms.

121
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:51,030
So as I've been sort of saying throughout this unit, the lipids always pose a specific biophysical problem of transport, especially neutrally.

122
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:58,080
So this is different from Lipolysis, which we talk about last class, because fatty acids, when they're bound to albumin, are already somewhat safe.

123
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,690
So they kind of avoid a lot of the other issues.

124
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:06,780
But if you're trying to transport a triglyceride or a cholesterol ester, you need to do it within an apolipoprotein.

125
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,130
So we talk about one of these in detail already, which is which is column microns.

126
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,250
So very small. Okay.

127
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,440
So Kyla MICrONS are are generated in the intestinal cells, as I said,

128
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:27,660
like 4000 to go through lymphatic system goes through the blood as kind of microns become complete and other triglycerides,

129
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:32,700
they become kind of micron remnants and then they're recycled within generally within the liver.

130
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:36,750
I've got one type of trafficking here. I'm not gonna spend too much time on that.

131
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:47,220
The other three times track we're going to focus on today are the LDL, HDL, LDL, which was shown over here, and then HDL, which which is in focus.

132
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:55,980
So it turns out getting lipids out of your liver is sort of more difficult than we maybe originally thought.

133
00:13:56,190 --> 00:14:00,599
So in the case of kind of microns here, it's livers are more like column microns.

134
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,540
So kind of microns don't export free fatty acids often.

135
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,690
You know, we could have evolved such that they did during the digestion of converting a lot of the triglycerides into free fatty acids.

136
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:14,430
But we don't we as there buy them in triglycerides and then we have to export them as triglycerides.

137
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:22,520
The same is true of the liver. So one of the challenges for fatty liver disease is that there's really not that much lipolysis in the liver, right?

138
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:27,690
There's not that much triglyceride break down in the liver, which means that any triglycerides that make it into the liver,

139
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:35,370
so fatty acids from adipocytes or triglycerides from your diet or lipids that are synthesized in novo in your liver,

140
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,590
they all have to be exported by of the LDL particles.

141
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:41,940
And so you remember back to right at the beginning, we were talking about choline.

142
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:49,370
That's why coaling deficiency is so important for liver fat accumulation, but not that important for adipocyte or muscle evacuation.

143
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,740
Right? Because you need the choline to make the veal gill particles.

144
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:59,760
And that's the primary, if not only way to get rid of triglycerides in the liver, those triglycerides, like I said,

145
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:05,640
they can come from a bunch of different places, but they have been supported by a generation of these de LDL particles here.

146
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,049
Ideally,

147
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:13,110
what's going to happen with the B LDL is they're generated in the liver and then they're parts of the talked to you about adipocytes of the muscle,

148
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:19,350
and then those tissues either have an excess storage capacity or the energy requirements that they can get rid of for good.

149
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:24,059
Right. And so then what you would end up with is a depleted the LDL and not very many of them.

150
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:29,340
Right. You would run out very little. But unfortunately, what ends up happening, especially with with obesity,

151
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:33,980
is that you are producing a lot of LDL, but the adipose and the muscle cells don't need them.

152
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:37,960
They don't either have the storage capacity or they don't have the energy needed.

153
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,240
Right. So then those particles that the LDL articles are semi depleted, they stay in your blood.

154
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:51,870
And that's effectively what the primary source of LDL is as LDL healthy had genic cardiovascular disease causing people.

155
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,810
Okay. So again, just a bit of an overview here. So this is what the particles look like.

156
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,819
All the cholesterol, esters and triglycerides are going to be on this interior core, right?

157
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:10,620
The phospholipids are all going in the exterior core. And the APR lipoproteins which serve as sort of the address signals are on are young side.

158
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:14,670
And then again, this is the same flexible portion compared to the different particles.

159
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,930
There's a variety of different apolipoprotein. So we talked about one here already, which is the one on column microns.

160
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:30,450
You can see they're named A, B, C, D and E and then they have different numbers associated with them.

161
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:34,500
So I'm going to start with with that equal, that will be protein.

162
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:41,520
And then we'll talk about some of the other ones. But as a general rule, these sort of the these are structural components.

163
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,530
So these you think of the B's as they form like a basket, which all the lipid goes in, right?

164
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:47,339
So that's the main thing.

165
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:57,240
So every particle has that has a B and you'll see not all of them have a B, but all the particles that have a B on it have exactly one B protein.

166
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:05,850
Right. Which means that if you know the number of people B molecules in the blood, you also know the number of particles that have equal B 100.

167
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:12,730
Similarly, if you want to know how many chiral microns are circulating around, you can just figure out how many people B 48 are.

168
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,470
Bill Right. So B B And so that's what that is.

169
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:25,139
That's that structural component for that. The A and the C's, they serve as activators and receptor ligands, right?

170
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:30,060
So C, C comes in into form C two and C3, I don't know what happened.

171
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:36,170
C one, c c to act. It's like a protein like base, whereas C three inhibitor.

172
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,809
And we'll talk about what that means and how that's going to progress in a minute.

173
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:46,410
So seeds do that, whereas keep away one which is primarily only on HDL is going to activate L cat,

174
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:53,130
which is I knew I should have started saying this like so lessen cholesterol, these will transfers.

175
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:56,699
So each of these particles have different things again.

176
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:05,310
But the particle that apolipoprotein served three roles one basketball, two activating of LPL role, and then three ligand binding.

177
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:10,410
And that dictates how the particle is taken back up in the in the peripheral tissues.

178
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,380
So we'll go through this for each of these and this is just sort of a review a reduced or studies.

179
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:20,190
Okay. So start with would be 148.

180
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:29,610
So kind of like microns always have B 48 that is the basket is made in the in parasite, whereas B LDL always have B 100.

181
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,820
That is the basket that is made in the limit. Okay.

182
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:44,480
Because the LDL, IDL and LDL are all from the same source as a B, LDL gets its lipids extracted, it becomes a IDL and an LDL.

183
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:51,510
These are supposed to be arrows that got screwed up here. Whenever you start with an LDL, you keep that B 100 particle throughout the whole process.

184
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:57,020
And so this is what a, b, 100 looks like at a molecular level. You can see it's this whole big red thing, right?

185
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,280
So it really is structurally like a basket,

186
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:05,819
whereas the the yellow things are the phospholipids again primarily through a colleague here that are bound to it.

187
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,930
And again it will be 100 is a lot against the LDL receptor which will be wasted.

188
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,760
And so all those particles have a B lot.

189
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:20,210
So they have different baskets. And and 48 100 is just the names of the three different groups.

190
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:23,850
Right. So again, you want it to know kind of micron production effectiveness.

191
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,360
You would maybe trying to diagnose somebody if they had kind of micron retention disease.

192
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,120
You look 5048. If you were trying to figure out if somebody had higher LDL particles, you might start to do.

193
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:48,530
What is the C stand for again? Could you see like in the on the last slide like equal like C two and this ABC it's like equal there's no

194
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:55,250
there's equal is and then the equal views and equals is a separate and there's going to be but there isn't.

195
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:04,250
So because that is like this is like the C two.

196
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:12,350
Yeah. Yeah. The C the most it is just a particle, a particle being currency or people that are aliens.

197
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:19,519
And so B does not stand for basket. I don't want you I don't want that is a mnemonic that I'm using to try to get you to

198
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,690
remember that B is the that the just stands for B as in the letter after and of course.

199
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:30,950
Okay. So this is what this looks like. So again, the production of the audio, we actually don't know a lot about exactly what happens.

200
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:38,180
We know that it is generally proportional, the amount of fat in the liver and it's sensitive to the amount of upholding.

201
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:45,680
Right. There's some evidence that insulin may promote the release of this, but it's a little hard to tell because insulin will promote more fat.

202
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,319
So it's unclear if there is more release with insulin because of triglyceride synthesis,

203
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,780
which then causes there to be more fat, which is then released.

204
00:20:53,930 --> 00:21:00,770
Or if there's some unique effect of it's well, what is known is that the possible protein is is essential for that.

205
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,310
Once that gets released, it's going to go on into the other tissues.

206
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:09,919
Now, the key question of like whether a tissue has the ability to acquire the triglycerides

207
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:15,710
out of the building or the kind of micron is really this one enzyme here,

208
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:25,220
which is called lipoproteins, which very annoyingly for the purposes of this unit is called l p l l l d.

209
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:28,819
And again, I will try as keenly as I can to enunciate.

210
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:33,290
So LPL is an enzyme. It's the most important enzyme for the transport.

211
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,520
LDL is a transfer, right?

212
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,510
Just like the LDL and HDL.

213
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:46,340
So I'm going to move on to LDL because whether or not these particles stay in the blood or not is effectively entirely dependent on the activity of,

214
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:53,170
like a protein, like. Okay. So like approaching protein life is, as you might expect, is highly expressed in heart muscle fat.

215
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:56,910
These are all tissues that are going to want to use these triglyceride rich lipoproteins.

216
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:04,500
They have kind of an interesting function. So the way they are made is you can imagine this as as part of, say, like a liver cell.

217
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,460
The LPL is shown here in in red.

218
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:16,590
So they're made inside the cell, but then they're actually secreted outside of the cell and they're bound to these heparin molecules.

219
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:22,020
On the outside, these glycoproteins on the outside. Right. So they're secreted out of the cell.

220
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:27,660
And the goal here is because they should be on the surface of the cell. So this would be the blood vessel where the particles are coming through.

221
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,120
These are the endothelial cells of the blood vessel.

222
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:36,420
And this is where the cell that is potentially interested in taking that lipid up is is right here.

223
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:46,530
So they're secreted out of the cell to the LCA. Once they are secreted out, they are the particles are anchored by this PD one protein.

224
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,420
And that's the thing that is the kind of keeps it tethered.

225
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,880
So you can imagine this is sort of a magnet. A particle floats by and comes in contact with this magnet.

226
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:59,010
It sits there. All of these LPL particles are around.

227
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:02,730
They're able to digest the triglycerides and then turn them into the fatty acids.

228
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:10,560
And then the fatty acids are able to get into the cell in this cell changes its mind and decides, actually, I'm good, I don't want any more fat.

229
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:16,060
Then it will stop secreting LPL and these particles will just kind of continue on in their dream.

230
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:26,610
So that's why LPL is so important. And again, LPL is specifically activated by EPO, C2, and it's reduced in activity by able to see to it.

231
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:32,600
Okay. Now, you may argue, well, why would you ever not want to have a policy three or four?

232
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:39,060
Why would you not want to have people see to it terms of have diabetes causes a switch where people see two goes down and people see three goes up.

233
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:48,110
And again, type two diabetes. The argument there is that might be part of the pathology of the adipocytes are already having too much fat.

234
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,900
So just like with insulin resistance, it's kind of impairing the storage of excess fat.

235
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:55,980
Right. But C two will activate LPL C three, what reduces activity?

236
00:23:56,220 --> 00:24:01,740
So that's one layer of regulation of LPL. So you could kind of think of this as the external.

237
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,220
The particle is trying to tell the cells what to do.

238
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,459
Right. Physical C is on the part of the right. So that's sort of like, you know, you make a particle in your liver and you're like,

239
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,850
I really need this to get degraded somewhere, so I'm going to put ac2 on it.

240
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,850
And so that's from the particles perspective. Of course, the cell has a say in this as well.

241
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:26,790
One aspect of this is the production of LIPOPROTEIN, which is, as I mentioned here,

242
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:32,670
it is largely transfer fully activated by insulin and then cortisol.

243
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,459
And there's kind of an interesting difference in here, too.

244
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:40,650
And so this can be a little hard to get your head around, but I'll start with that with the fat tissue.

245
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:47,760
So insulin is going to want to activate LPL fat. And the reason for that is there's probably enough carbohydrates that are variable.

246
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:53,160
That's why insulin is there. And therefore the muscle is going to want to use the carbohydrates.

247
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:57,540
So then you pull the fat into the adipose tissue, right? Because you have plenty of carbohydrates.

248
00:24:57,810 --> 00:25:02,900
So that's why you're activating in fat and in activating and sorry, that should be activates.

249
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,810
These are back with the sugar activates in fat and in energy.

250
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,900
On the contrary, if you're fasting,

251
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:15,870
you want to inactivated in fat because you're trying to get the nutrients out of fat and you're trying to get it to the muscle, right?

252
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,830
So that's why you'd activate in muscle, but inactivate in fat.

253
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:26,070
And so the idea is when you're fasting, you're trying to divert nutrients out of your fat and of your liver into your muscle.

254
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:31,770
Right? So it's not direct like most of the things we talk about. Insulin does the same things in all these different cells here.

255
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:37,650
They have opposite rules. So that's one whole level of control. And again, that's largely thought to be transcriptional.

256
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,770
It's just the making of the LPL, which then gets secreted outside of the cell.

257
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,640
The other way of regulation is through this protein here called AMG, PTL four.

258
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:54,329
It's got such an annoying abbreviation. I'm not even going to tell you what it is, but it is downstream by another transcription factor.

259
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:59,040
We talked about last class, which is P part alpha. So I'm going to walk through this in a minute.

260
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,709
So people are Alpha in last class.

261
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:07,950
What I was telling you is when there is excessive fatty acids, people are alpha centers that and promotes lipid oxidation.

262
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:13,680
Right. So a pump created transcription of a bunch of beta oxidation genes promoted more by hundred five cases.

263
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:20,540
Right. So one way you could deal if you're a cell with having excessive fatty acids is by burning off those fatty acids, right?

264
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:25,920
So you're just like, there's a lot of fatty acids here. I use those for energy. I mean, operate with upregulate, you're big oxidation.

265
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:31,740
But the other way you would deal with having too many fatty acids in a cell is you would block the transport, right?

266
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,070
You would block bringing in any new fatty acids. Right.

267
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:42,120
Because again, the cell already has plenty and sweat and you PTL for does is it now inhibits lipoprotein lipids.

268
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,860
Okay. So this is blocking more transport. Normally the panel might be broken down.

269
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,640
You'd be getting more fatty acids. Transport into the cell.

270
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:55,489
But if there's already plenty of fatty acids there, then you do not want to do that that affect that.

271
00:26:55,490 --> 00:27:03,100
You sort of want to block the transport. So that was you said it inhibits the fatty acids, actually this fatty acid transport by inhibiting LPA,

272
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:06,860
by starting this sense, I'll be able to live with our lipoprotein levels.

273
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:13,940
And again, going back to last class, this activation of P part alpha tends to be a little bit better with Pufas,

274
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:21,890
a little bit worse with saturated fats, right? So the sensing mechanism is a little more effective for Pufas than it is for for saturated fats,

275
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:31,460
which if you sort of follow like the quadruple negative, I'm going to say here, that means saturated fats are going to have less suppression of LPM.

276
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:36,979
So saturated fats are going to allow for more transport out of LPL.

277
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:42,110
And so LPL super important. This is important for both post absorptive.

278
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:46,640
So within the kind of micron and also dealing with the LDL that are produced by the liver,

279
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,220
certain veal meals that are produced by the liver to to make them.

280
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:53,750
And so that's like the most important enzyme for all of time.

281
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,450
And again, that's all the work. Okay.

282
00:27:56,630 --> 00:28:06,350
So it comes up quite often the question of like why do people vary in their level, protein level, and we'll talk later how we are having too much LDL,

283
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:13,450
which is a remnant of having so much too much beyond the shell and not enough glycoprotein like phase activity is quite pathogenic, right?

284
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:17,900
Having too many triglycerides in your blood is bad. Having too much cholesterol in your blood is not as well.

285
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:23,800
And so we learned a lot about how these systems work by doing genetic studies, right?

286
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:28,490
So people have been identified that they have very, very high triglycerides or very, very high cholesterol.

287
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:30,580
And then that has told us what some of these are.

288
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:36,800
That's why, for example, injectable is not felt like a given, right, because we thought it did something entirely different.

289
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:41,450
And then it turned out there were people who had mutations in this that affected their cardiovascular disease risk.

290
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:46,790
Right. Kind of like big five, eight, empty 1 to 1 stories to digest.

291
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,610
So here's just some examples.

292
00:28:49,790 --> 00:29:00,430
It actually turns out the vast majority of the mutations that affect cardiovascular disease risk are in this LDL, LDL regulatory category.

293
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:08,330
Right. So for example, if you just do not have ltpo, right, if you do not have like a pretty wide base,

294
00:29:08,630 --> 00:29:14,000
you will not be able to take fatty acids out of the blood. Right. That means you will have a lot more fatty acids in the blood.

295
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:14,670
Right.

296
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:21,319
And that will result in having a high risk of cardiovascular disease because the lipids will get kicked out into the blood from whatever mechanism,

297
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,310
either from kind of microns or the others. But you cannot get them back into a tissue.

298
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:30,530
So they sort of stay in the blood. And that would be that would be bad, just like having a lot less fat.

299
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:35,180
And then here's a bunch of other mutations. Some of these are gain of function mutations.

300
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:41,450
Some of these are less function mutations. Some cause more cardiovascular disease, some cause little bit less.

301
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:48,170
And so what we're going to do now is we're going to take a break and we're going to go to if you go to this link here,

302
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,710
hopefully there should be a table that you can create.

303
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:59,300
It's got a bunch of genes that we know are associated with both lipoprotein lipids, activity and cardiovascular disease risk.

304
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:08,329
All right. So what we're going to do is I want you to spend ten or 15 minutes in your Brooks laptop and go through some of these.

305
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:11,960
Right. Try to predict, like, all right, what would this what does this thing normally do?

306
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,920
What would happen if it worked better or worse? Would that make me more or less likely to have cardiovascular disease or.

307
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:23,120
Right, avoid that urgently. Google it. Because the whole point is I want you be able to kind of intuit this on your own.

308
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:29,120
You'll have to create a group, but I will not be able to approve any of the groups until I get back to my office where I have my laptop.

309
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:34,700
So it's creator groups. I'll approve them when I get back to my office before I get on the airport shuttle,

310
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,960
and then you'll be able to submit them after encrypted access and somebody verify that there's a table here.

311
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,750
This one, I can't find this, but it's this.

312
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:52,310
There is a to you if you manually take this and it might not be know it's not as vibrant

313
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:58,820
luckily for sure like and make sure when you type like as me capital hygiene capital C CBD.

314
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:05,480
Right, exactly, exactly. Exactly. And I'll circulate around and I'll try to give you a hand.

315
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:15,900
Others there, you guys.

316
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:27,650
When I'm having coffee, the two men would take it as something else.

317
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,210
Well, you know, it's probably a great question.

318
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,110
I guess we all do it.

319
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:52,630
Oh, look, I told you, I came over here tonight.

320
00:31:53,820 --> 00:32:06,070
Oh, but I don't know. I mean, I don't know what you're telling me.

321
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:16,920
And so it looks like it's going to take a second.

322
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,590
You guys, the band is, you know.

323
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:31,740
Yeah. And I thought you guys did.

324
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:36,270
You just saw something like that.

325
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:46,460
I can't even imagine what it feels.

326
00:32:51,240 --> 00:33:02,510
You. What matters is.

327
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:28,290
And he was like. And he was like, you know, just like is like, what is the difference between 5050?

328
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:49,830
So, you know, if you're so beautiful the way I thought you was just that time for saying

329
00:33:49,880 --> 00:34:06,010
that he's going to give you a reason to feel like you are starting to think,

330
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:14,400
how did you just need to stop now?

331
00:34:15,390 --> 00:34:44,900
Don't need and make you feel that, you know, knowing that really is interesting because I think that's what is so true about like I say,

332
00:34:45,180 --> 00:35:16,620
I felt like I was trying to do that because I think that was my guy and I was like,

333
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:35,480
I think you have a duty to show that you are good at what you believe.

334
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:43,650
That's the best place to start is like if you're moving on,

335
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:57,420
you're not sure about the role that it's one of the most important things, like what do you want all at once?

336
00:35:57,460 --> 00:36:05,880
And How are you guys about people and tables not stopping breath?

337
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:12,000
I presume you've been talking. Other people are like, I know.

338
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:17,220
Okay, I get a lot of.

339
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:49,220
Oh. Oh, no, I wasn't concerned about the fact that he could also be responsible for the auto worker.

340
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:56,230
Yeah, it turns out it lives inside this universe.

341
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:20,480
But in all honesty, I don't think that each of these stories works out right now, because, like I said, I think it is true that it's going to happen.

342
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:24,410
I not know. I don't like it.

343
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:34,370
How do you know it doesn't start getting switched on?

344
00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:37,970
I don't know.

345
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,380
Maybe there has to be more trust. Trust me.

346
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:52,690
Yeah. We're both like, you know, you guys think you can really it, right?

347
00:37:52,740 --> 00:38:00,590
I know. I know certain things about Sabrina, and I'm not sure.

348
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:10,140
Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, it doesn't interfere to be know.

349
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:14,940
Oh, yeah.

350
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:28,730
Yeah. Some things you have to look at depends on what you want.

351
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,270
I'll take. That is the best.

352
00:38:35,450 --> 00:38:40,970
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So we'll spend about five more minutes on this crisis.

353
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:53,750
You know, I still have hope that we feel pretty good about it.

354
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:01,870
Oh, yeah.

355
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,230
Yeah. Is great to participate on 140.

356
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:30,240
And those are just given to want to see the ability to be able to do that.

357
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:40,130
So, I mean, I think everybody should be allowed to be able to do that.

358
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:56,960
So I hope you're starting to become like a construction market.

359
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:05,000
I think so.

360
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:10,010
That's right. So if it's so, I think it's an incentive for New York City.

361
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:16,790
So that actually that's now if you understand what he thinks that would see would probably you.

362
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:19,720
So it's going to cause a bunch of different problems. So like you're right.

363
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:29,530
Like it would regulate what's coming up at times like, but it's going to like that's going to have to sign.

364
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,639
I don't think it is to please, please, please don't normally deliver.

365
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:44,840
So we don't think, you know, you can say with any reason.

366
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:58,280
I think the other thing is that there's lots of things that I could be about.

367
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:12,070
Increase the person in a context where they want to work out like new possibilities, like, oh, okay.

368
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:15,530
With all the muscle commutes that promote.

369
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:36,500
What's more important is to the to great work of the 1960s.

370
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:42,250
I know it sounds like this just for I am very busy.

371
00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:53,050
I want to be like, oh, yeah, I don't know.

372
00:41:55,850 --> 00:42:02,989
Okay, so I'm going to move on. So again, when your group submits this activity some time after, I think it's fine.

373
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:07,160
If it's not complete, you'll still get the point physiologically. But if you're confused about something,

374
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:11,780
just make sure you give a little circle so it tells me where I can like highlight and or correct if you're confused.

375
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:14,540
So we don't know that you just left it like that. You were like, I don't know.

376
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:22,430
Okay, so I've already touched on this a little bit in terms of the heritability party house quiz.

377
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:28,700
So it turns out cardiovascular diseases are almost exactly 50% heritable, right?

378
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:33,740
So the risk of cardiovascular disease is 50% lifestyle and 50% genetic.

379
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:40,100
So if you talk about the genetic heritability of it, what that is, is based on we know about 100 genes,

380
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,660
including the five or six that are on that table that modify cardiovascular disease risk.

381
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:51,020
And so we know a lot of those. So we can kind of look at everybody's activity of all those different genes or even we're

382
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:55,840
doing and we can assign sort of an overall risk score for overall cardiovascular risk.

383
00:42:56,010 --> 00:43:03,310
So that's where it ends up, about 50%. So the other 50% has something to do with lifestyle, which I'll talk about today.

384
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:06,590
So there's a simplified version of this.

385
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:12,200
I think it was in one of the videos, but I kind of want to read because I think it actually does show that sort of 5050 nature.

386
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:19,190
So what you're looking at here is three groups of three. So these three are loaded at low genetic risk based on this polygenic risk score,

387
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:23,510
distributed risk, these three are high genetic risk within each triad.

388
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:30,020
This is best possible lifestyle choice, average possible lifestyle, worst possible lifestyle, again, sort of tertiles.

389
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:37,670
So what I want to sort of highlight here is what you can see is that if you have the best possible genetics zero and these three here,

390
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:43,009
would you have like the worst possible lifestyle you're at almost the exact same genetic

391
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:48,410
risk or the exact same overall risk as somebody with the worst possible genetics,

392
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:52,220
but the best possible lifestyle. So I'll say that again.

393
00:43:52,340 --> 00:44:00,300
So worst possible lifestyle, the best possible genetics is about the same as worst possible genetics, best possible lifestyle act.

394
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:05,150
And so that's how we know it's right, because they both contribute about if it was mostly genetic,

395
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,420
you would expect the difference between these groups would be much bigger.

396
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:12,310
It was mostly lifestyle, despite the difference between these groups would be one group.

397
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:20,270
So in this particular study design, like I said, this unapologetic score based on the 100 and something leads we have,

398
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:23,629
and then they assign lifestyle as the aggregate of these things.

399
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:33,230
And so because it was a epidemiology study that used to predict what was so favorable lifestyle was you had to be three of the four of these here.

400
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:36,530
Right. And so that's that's sort of how they define it.

401
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:40,130
And of course, you might be interested in like what what is a healthy diet.

402
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,280
And so this is what their definition of a healthy diet,

403
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:54,230
but it not through the questionnaires on these participants and you had to have at least five of the following ten things.

404
00:44:54,470 --> 00:45:00,410
And so again, it's a bit of a blunt instrument. I'm sure you could find the unhealthy diet, but still met five of ten of these criteria.

405
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:06,200
But that's how they that's how they work. And so it's about 50% diet, 50% lifestyle.

406
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:10,850
And that poses sort of a treatment challenge, right? There are some people, for example,

407
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:16,729
these people in this group here that may be doing all of the right lifestyle choices or they might be physically active,

408
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,460
keeping their weight under control, eating the best possible diet.

409
00:45:19,610 --> 00:45:24,650
And their risk is still just as bad as this person here who's making all of the worst lifestyle choices.

410
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:29,270
Right. And so it's not just that somebody comes in and they have high cholesterol and you're like,

411
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:32,510
oh, well, there's obviously a lifestyle for these people here.

412
00:45:32,660 --> 00:45:36,500
There's almost nothing you can do because it's genetics other than pharmacology.

413
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:41,510
For these people here, you can still have some effect based on lifestyle, right?

414
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:48,980
Is it common practice to do a genetic test to see whether you should pursue scruples or not?

415
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,689
So it's getting more common.

416
00:45:50,690 --> 00:45:56,120
The historical part would be like, Has anybody in your family died of a heart disease, which in a way is also kind of a genetic test?

417
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:59,689
So we already had an approximation that was about 5050 from stuff like that, right?

418
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:06,319
You would have families that were watching their diet, not overweight, not smoking, but still had lots of cardiovascular disease risk.

419
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,930
Right. And those people those people turn out to be now the same people that would sign my genetics.

420
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:18,290
I can speak to that because I went to see my primary care physician probably like back and like it was like earlier in the year.

421
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,999
And she asked me like because she said. I like lost weight.

422
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:27,360
And she was like she she told me to lower my cholesterol at one point and she said that I lost weight like I was doing all the right things to,

423
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:31,470
like, try to manage my health better myself. Like it was really no change in my cholesterol.

424
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:37,320
So she started asking me like family history of like high cholesterol, heart disease.

425
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:42,090
And I was like, well, yeah, there actually is some of that. Yeah, no, that's a good example.

426
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,569
Same with my family too. Like my family, I think I have like my aunt.

427
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:54,180
And finally I was like five Uncle Bob's, but I would say uncles and cousins.

428
00:46:55,470 --> 00:47:02,490
But, um, yeah, but like at 1.5 of my mom's eight siblings had heart attacks all within like a three year span,

429
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,319
all when they were like in their early 43 time.

430
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:11,070
That thing that's I don't know that I necessarily that all of these people were lifestyles, but there's only so much I can do to sort of lower it.

431
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:11,940
Right. So it's good.

432
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:18,360
It's important sort of as nutritionist, dietitians to think about this and think about like somebody might be doing all the right things, right?

433
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:21,360
They might be. Follow your advice. Exactly. Perfectly. And they're still no change. Right.

434
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,849
Because the problem, just like with obesity, is not always lifestyle.

435
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:28,520
It could also be genetic or and yet because of that, it's not that somebody comes back and you're like, oh,

436
00:47:28,530 --> 00:47:32,309
you're just you know, you're just not listening to me and I'm just you to, like, treat you poorly things.

437
00:47:32,310 --> 00:47:35,879
You're you're somebody. Your interests could be that they were not long for.

438
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:41,650
They were already in this movement. All right, so that's genetics.

439
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:49,389
So I'm going to move on to sort of the pathogenesis, I think luckily, Lewis Hudson, hopefully looking forward to Lewis Hudson's talk last week in 68.

440
00:47:49,390 --> 00:47:54,100
You two really, Joe, talking about some of the pathogenesis of fatty acid streets and club formation.

441
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:56,470
So I'm not going to spend too much time on stuff like that.

442
00:47:56,650 --> 00:48:03,430
So again, we've known for a long time that there's this association broadly between blood cholesterol and cardiovascular disease risk.

443
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:07,210
We know that cholesterol rises in proportion to saturated fat.

444
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:13,420
Okay. I'm not going to walk through exactly all the different ways that I've talked about how saturated fat can increase cholesterol levels.

445
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:19,600
But I think at least in this class said at least three or four different ways by which saturated fats through humans are us

446
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:25,080
can increase the amount of either synthesis of cholesterol or lack of uptake of cholesterol or more transport of cholesterol.

447
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:30,130
There's lots of different examples of that, but we've known for a long time that cholesterol is a pretty good file.

448
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,290
So originally this was an ecological study.

449
00:48:32,950 --> 00:48:41,349
Sort of the example here is that cardiovascular disease was much higher in British foresters who had much higher cholesterol than Japanese fishermen.

450
00:48:41,350 --> 00:48:47,040
And at the time we thought maybe it was more about blood cholesterol. Now we think it's probably more about what dying from that.

451
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:51,760
We think it's more about saturated fat. And there have been many, many, many, many, many, many, many studies since.

452
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,140
And so quizzes broadly supported the hypothesis that high blood cholesterol results.

453
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,880
And if you try that now the reason this happens or the reason we think that this happens

454
00:49:01,120 --> 00:49:06,549
is the problem is you have ldl-c and then LDL C is hanging around in your blood for a

455
00:49:06,550 --> 00:49:11,350
long time and you might have a particular type of LDL C which is able to now get through

456
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:15,790
the epithelial cell layer from the blood and kind of get in underneath the cell layer.

457
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:20,589
Right. So as you get the LDL C in there, now you've got a bunch of fat in there that creates an immune reaction.

458
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:25,299
These are monocytes, eventually becoming macrophages and then form cells that creates more inflammation,

459
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,390
potentially some oxidation of the cholesterols and triglycerides.

460
00:49:28,390 --> 00:49:34,629
And then over time, you have this immune response that builds up to a clot as that clot builds up and it's going to include your arteries.

461
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:38,920
So now you're going to an increase in blood pressure, right? Because you're fitting the same lipid, three smaller form.

462
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:44,139
And then over time, what can happen is this clot can disengage and eventually go somewhere where you don't want it,

463
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:53,200
such as coronary artery disease or heart disease, obviously, or your brain stroke or your lungs, which would cause a pulmonary embolism.

464
00:49:53,200 --> 00:50:01,509
Right. So all of those are bad. So what we know is this is largely driven primarily by whether or not your ldl-c can kind of get through here.

465
00:50:01,510 --> 00:50:04,990
And that's driven by two things. How much LDL C is there?

466
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:10,110
How much opportunity is there? And then what is the kind of LDL C that lets it get across this membrane?

467
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:15,060
So we'll talk about both of those towards the end of. All right.

468
00:50:15,070 --> 00:50:21,969
So the other transport system I'm sorry, I didn't say it explicitly, all of these are dependent on this B LDL transport system, right?

469
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:25,630
So all of the little particles are primarily driven by the LDL.

470
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:32,109
So this is one of the reasons why fatty liver disease, for example, getting a lot fat,

471
00:50:32,110 --> 00:50:40,510
they're increasing a lot of the LS is associated with cardiovascular disease risk like cooling deficiency which causes an apple is not as encouraging.

472
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,000
Okay, so the other transport pathway is what happens if you're in a cell that is not a liver and you've got excess cholesterol, right?

473
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:54,870
So maybe that extra biogenesis of cholesterol, you had a surfeit of at some point activation of HMG,

474
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:58,060
coi reductase in literally any tissue in the body.

475
00:50:58,570 --> 00:51:06,850
Now those cells cannot use cholesterol or energy that no cells can use cholesterol and most cells can even use cholesterol to turn it into bile.

476
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,370
So that only happens up here in the right.

477
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:15,160
So if you're any other cells in the body and you've got excess cholesterol and you have to do something to get rid of that cholesterol.

478
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,550
And so that system is the HDL transport system.

479
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:24,850
And so HDL, which is now 8.1, is kind of like the sort of basket thing for HDL.

480
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:27,940
It'll go round. This will be a native particle, which means it's empty.

481
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:34,600
It'll kind of go around and act somewhat like a sponge, and it'll kind of go round and pull up extra cholesterol from the cell.

482
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:38,890
It'll sterilized so that it can go into the middle of the particle using Al-Tanf,

483
00:51:38,890 --> 00:51:46,290
which is the strip of anything that's activated by equal weight one in this first light, and then those cholesterols eventually will build up.

484
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:50,320
Those particles get bigger and bigger and bigger, and they'll have more and more cholesterol.

485
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:56,740
Now, ideally, the initial particle will now go back to the liver and dump all its cholesterol and cholesterol esters in the liver.

486
00:51:56,980 --> 00:52:02,610
Right. And there's a scavenger receptor B one, which is specific to the HDL part.

487
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:06,249
So that would uptake that particle in the liver dump off its cholesterol.

488
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:11,410
And then if the things are working well, you turn that cholesterol into a bio salt and then that cluster will be excreted out of your body.

489
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:16,120
And again, because exercise plays a role here, because there's no energy demand for cholesterol,

490
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,730
because you get no energy from a catabolism or cholesterol,

491
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,310
because we cannot metabolize cholesterol, we could only drink to allow salt and excrete it into the small.

492
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:30,740
So that's sort of the main takeaway is HDL. So HDL goes around SpongeBob movie Sponge wrings itself out.

493
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:36,110
There's another process that exists where you can actually transfer some

494
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:40,250
cholesterol as these particles are building up too much to HDL deal or no deal.

495
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:45,260
And so that's an enzyme here called cholesterol ester transport protein.

496
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:48,590
So that's zoomed in on here.

497
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:53,360
So what that does is when you have a step of what cholesterol through that on

498
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:57,670
your HDL particle being your particle can swap a cholesterol for triglycerides.

499
00:52:57,890 --> 00:53:07,430
So it'll say the triglyceride trying to take a triglyceride from a high LDL or an ideal or an LDL and it'll go off some of its extra cholesterol.

500
00:53:07,430 --> 00:53:11,660
So this system starts to max out. This is sort of the relief valve for that system.

501
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:19,969
So Cetp is the way that the HDL particles we like look, I am only so many sponges and therefore now there is no more sponges available.

502
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,129
So here, take some of my extra water.

503
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:29,540
So I guess in my analogy, that would be maybe the thing that you put the sponge in where you bring it up, maybe with the bucket you.

504
00:53:32,670 --> 00:53:37,530
So that's what CTP, that's what the ATP does. Now, because of this, people said, Oh, well, that sounds good.

505
00:53:38,130 --> 00:53:41,340
People who have high HDL actually turn out to not have very good cardiovascular disease.

506
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:44,400
So what we should do is we should just like prevent that from happening.

507
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:50,430
We should just keep all the cholesterol in the HDL, not ever let it get into the LDL particle.

508
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:56,130
And therefore, that'll be good because we'll get more ratios and less LDL and and molecular tests and stuff.

509
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,389
And so that was the bar. So HDL is very well known as a biomarker.

510
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:03,570
Having high HDL is generally protective of cardiovascular disease.

511
00:54:03,750 --> 00:54:07,740
And for many, many, many years we thought it was causal of cardiovascular protection.

512
00:54:07,980 --> 00:54:11,900
Right. So we thought just having high LDL sorry, having high HDL is good.

513
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:17,230
And that's what we used to call it, the good cholesterol, a good type of good cholesterol able to present.

514
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:23,040
I think what's turned out, though, as we've done more genetic and pharmacological studies,

515
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:30,930
there are people who have mutations in Cetp and there are a ton of drugs that companies developed that inhibit Cetp.

516
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,510
Now, in both those cases, they have skyrocketing HDL, those very, very, very high HDL level.

517
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:40,320
So that that was great. And those people will definitely not get heart disease.

518
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:45,960
And it turns out they definitely get heart disease. It actually turns out it had no effect on their cardiovascular risk at all.

519
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:50,430
Drug companies spent billions with a B of dollars developing these T inhibitors,

520
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:57,390
none of which had any effect on cardiovascular disease risk, even though they increased the HDL really, really, really dramatically.

521
00:54:57,580 --> 00:55:01,110
Right. So that suggests that having HDL might generally be good for most people.

522
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:04,319
It might be a marker of something, but it's actually not a intervenir.

523
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,540
All right. LDL is attributable.

524
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:13,140
We know having LDL high LDL is always bad and having lower LDL, as we'll talk about in a minute, is almost always good.

525
00:55:13,890 --> 00:55:16,170
So why is our picture of SpongeBob on him?

526
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:24,510
So the rationale of this is when you measure HDL cholesterol, what you're actually measuring is the amount of cholesterol in the HDL particles.

527
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,280
So what you're measuring is the number of wet sponges, right?

528
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:33,300
That's what you're measuring. We used to think you're measuring the number of sponges, but you're not.

529
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,659
Because if those numbers were empty, they would have no cholesterol in them. Right.

530
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,270
And as you could imagine, if you're looking around a bunch of place and be like,

531
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:43,770
what would be the most useful cleaning implement to my house, it would not be the pile of wet sponges.

532
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:47,129
It would be the dry sponges. Right. That's what you would want. Right.

533
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,320
So we had this sort of like mistaken thinking about this.

534
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:53,910
We thought just having a lot of wet sponges must mean that things are good, must mean things are clean.

535
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:57,389
Well, it could mean things are clean or could mean things are out of control and flooding.

536
00:55:57,390 --> 00:56:01,080
And you just ran out of sponges, right? It doesn't necessarily mean that things are cleaner.

537
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:03,959
In some cases. It might mean you just finish cleaning. That would be good.

538
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:08,780
But not all this sort of depends on knowing more information about the source of your sponges.

539
00:56:09,310 --> 00:56:16,110
So I might have missed this in translation to the analogy, but if you're looking at HDL levels, like in a blood test.

540
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:20,650
Like, Are they wet or not? Like, how do you know?

541
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:28,460
So we'll talk about this towards the end. But like when you measure HDL or LDL cholesterol, what you do is you fractionated blood into the pipe,

542
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:34,090
the sort of floating fraction of blood that has the LDL particles right here.

543
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:38,440
Like here's the chunk here where the LDL particles and then you measure how much cholesterol

544
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:44,679
is in that chunk of particles level HDL C is or LDL C or orbital DLC or whatever.

545
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:52,300
Right? It's how much cholesterol is in the fraction of particles that are high or low or very low density.

546
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:57,640
If you're doing some of that, these are what those would all be, which is right.

547
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:02,799
Because if you were measuring particles which are something different, that would be measuring the numbers.

548
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:08,470
But but in this case, we're not measuring particles. Remember the amount of water in the sponge fraction.

549
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,270
These analogies sometimes work.

550
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:21,670
I don't know if I may say, but then are you saying that currently we do not measure the amount of cholesterol in these transporters?

551
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:25,059
That's not what we're looking at. We're looking at something different. Exactly.

552
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,660
You might think what you're looking at is how much cholesterol is in a particle, but you're not.

553
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:32,830
What you're actually looking at is in the fraction that contains those particles. How much cholesterol is there?

554
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:37,100
Right. That's important. That sounds kind of like the same thing, but it's actually different enough that,

555
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:41,620
as I'll talk about in a couple slides, is different pathologically and prognostic for sure.

556
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:43,329
Okay.

557
00:57:43,330 --> 00:57:52,059
So LDL, so going back from HDL to LDL, LDL gets taken up in the liver and the main transporter for the LDL pickup in the liver is the LDL receptor,

558
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:58,850
which is one of the one of the examples that we have. Right. So you get LDL from both the pleated building up.

559
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:04,120
So you can think of LDL is like a B LDL remnant also from this CETP based transfer.

560
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:11,020
Right. So you can imagine this system where HDL prices by news are going out, pulling up a bunch of cholesterol,

561
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:16,360
passing it over to the LDL, and then that LDL can be taken up into into the liver.

562
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:22,000
LDL receptors are really, really specific to the liver and annoyingly some immune cells.

563
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:26,230
And therefore, they are the primary place where these particles get taken away.

564
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:29,650
And again, evolutionarily, that makes sense. That's where we can get rid of them, right?

565
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,570
That's the place, the liver where we can get rid of.

566
00:58:32,110 --> 00:58:40,300
So the mechanism by which LDL receptor is regulated is actually a mechanism we've already talked about before.

567
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,200
I think it's repeated down here, but it's the same as already BP too.

568
00:58:44,470 --> 00:58:52,330
Right. So if you have very, very high hepatic like cholesterol, that's going to sequester SRP, BP, too, in its inactive form.

569
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:57,760
Right. This is the same thing for when we talk about cholesterol, biogenesis and the regulation of GCR.

570
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:01,870
And the same thing when we talked about dietary cholesterol absorption, which is also observed.

571
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:08,860
So in all three of those cases, when you have high cholesterol in the cell, what you have is an inactivation of SRB two,

572
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:14,200
the cell that responds and says, Well, I have lots of cholesterol in here, so I actually don't need any of this cholesterol.

573
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:18,760
No. Things stay in the blood. Right. Stay in the blood because there's plenty of cholesterol in the liver.

574
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,260
Right. So that's the liver making the decision to say, I have enough cholesterol right now.

575
00:59:23,350 --> 00:59:31,089
I don't need any more from the blood. Right. So that might be good from a livers perspective, but that's actually quite bad from a lot of breakfast.

576
00:59:31,090 --> 00:59:38,650
You don't take it and deliver it. It doesn't have anything else to go up. It stays in your blood and it's also associated with reduced HMG.

577
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,799
Okay, so what I want you guys to do then is a bit of a complicated so I tried to stage this out here,

578
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,910
so I spent a couple of minutes talking to the person around here and I want you to kind of walk through all these steps.

579
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:55,450
You have a mutation in LDL receptor is one of the lines on your table from what would have an LDL,

580
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:59,950
what do you think and LDL receptor mutation would do to cholesterol in the hepatocyte?

581
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,480
How would that activate? How would that sort not activate? How would that affect SRB, P2?

582
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:10,809
How would that affect cholesterol, biogenesis, and would that make things better or worse as you spent a couple of minutes trying to talk

583
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:18,820
through this with the people around you and then we'll kind of go through these one by one those.

584
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:30,280
I think so, yes.

585
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:54,810
Yes. And that's I think it would remain in the blood.

586
01:00:55,950 --> 01:01:10,060
It would get. So I guess I think it's like if you feel like you.

587
01:01:11,670 --> 01:01:20,730
Yeah, I, I feel like.

588
01:01:22,110 --> 01:01:31,860
Oh, it's. It's my liver.

589
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:36,950
That's true. Yeah.

590
01:01:39,840 --> 01:02:00,600
Yeah. And now, you know, that's what makes sense because they just like, you know what I'm saying?

591
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:26,830
Like, I mean, I don't know, that would be right out of my life.

592
01:02:27,830 --> 01:02:41,270
So that's that's good to know, you know, and now you know, like,

593
01:02:41,310 --> 01:03:06,080
this is why you're wondering why people are really nice to me that he has all the same words, I guess.

594
01:03:11,070 --> 01:03:16,950
Yeah. What are you guys?

595
01:03:21,470 --> 01:03:29,680
And so it's like a base to go find, and it's not.

596
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:35,120
It's not the same thing.

597
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:48,270
That's true, because I don't know what happens.

598
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,950
Yeah, I know myself.

599
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:13,020
So. So I think this is high in the bio, so I don't know whether that makes sense.

600
01:04:15,650 --> 01:04:23,430
I don't. I don't mean. You had to try new things.

601
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:28,700
I don't like turning here in the morning.

602
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:41,959
And I said to myself, okay, let's let's try to go through this.

603
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:46,730
Maybe we'll do nominate one person in your group to be the thumbs up or thumbs down person.

604
01:04:47,030 --> 01:04:52,280
Let's spend a second and let's start with each of these questions.

605
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:56,100
Have you mutation and LDL receptors? What's going to happen to LDL in the blood?

606
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:00,620
Is it going to be up or down? A lot of good plots.

607
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:04,940
A lot of us. Exactly, yeah. You're not able to take it out of the blood.

608
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:08,360
It stays in the blood. So what is the cholesterol levels in the a parasite?

609
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:20,909
Good, good, good consensus. Yes, it will decrease. Right. So what would happen now to sorry, BP to you know, I see a bit.

610
01:05:20,910 --> 01:05:25,709
So I see some thumbs up, thumbs some down. It would be within your group.

611
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:29,610
You have two thumbs up. No, this is not a very just a group.

612
01:05:29,610 --> 01:05:34,049
So you're like you guys are not. I sorry.

613
01:05:34,050 --> 01:05:39,060
BP activity will be up, right? SRB activity is inhibited by intracellular cholesterol.

614
01:05:39,240 --> 01:05:42,510
We already said intracellular cholesterol is relatively low.

615
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:51,670
Okay, so now what's that going to do to synthesis? I see some very like not super duper confident thumbs up.

616
01:05:51,730 --> 01:05:56,030
But yes, it will increase cholesterol synthesis and then that will exacerbate the problem.

617
01:05:56,050 --> 01:06:02,800
Right. So the problem here is that it literally thinks it is starved of cholesterol because the LDL receptor is not working.

618
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:05,410
So therefore, it says, hey, man, there's not enough cholesterol here.

619
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:10,950
It starts making a bunch more cholesterol, which the blood is like, whoa, this is like super unhelpful, right?

620
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:17,200
RDA had too much cluster on the blood. Now I can even get rid of it. So that's why people who are LDL receptor mutations have super, super,

621
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,250
super high cholesterol, both because it can't take it up and they make too much.

622
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:23,200
Right. So they sort of have a double problem.

623
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:29,020
And this was the original use case for statins were identified for people who were dying very early in familial

624
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:35,740
hypercholesterolemia due to LDL receptor mutations and because of the synthesis which is affected by the statins,

625
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:40,460
that became very, very helpful for those people and in fact, life saving for for the vast majority.

626
01:06:41,890 --> 01:06:45,549
Okay. So we're going to finish off on to sort of partly type thing.

627
01:06:45,550 --> 01:06:51,370
So like biophysical type thing. So I'm showing you sort of a complicated bit of a figure here.

628
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:56,020
But what I'm trying to show you, first of all, because on this slide here, this potluck.

629
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:04,450
So all the dots or hotspots or whatever on this line are various mutations that affect cholesterol levels.

630
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:11,140
And so what they're showing is that and it's a bit annoying because it's like lower cholesterol versus risk reduction.

631
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:18,790
So sorry about that. So what they're saying, though, is do permutations have different effects on cholesterol?

632
01:07:18,790 --> 01:07:21,880
So this mutation here has a very minor effect on the cholesterol.

633
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:27,310
You'll notice that and PC 1.1, which, you know, you'll be very familiar with, even though it doesn't remember extensively,

634
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:32,860
it has a small effect on cholesterol and it relatively small effect on cardiovascular risk.

635
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:37,480
And if you kind of follow up here, here's a different mutation in and pick one out one.

636
01:07:37,630 --> 01:07:42,790
It has a very big effect on LDL cholesterol and a very big effect on cardiovascular disease.

637
01:07:42,970 --> 01:07:46,480
Right. So most of these fly on this like very, very nice lot.

638
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,930
Right. Where to the effect that a mutation affects the LDL levels.

639
01:07:50,050 --> 01:07:55,420
It also affects the cardiovascular disease risk. And this is not true, for example, for HDL, right.

640
01:07:55,420 --> 01:08:00,340
Where it has no effect on cardiovascular disease risk. So that's all of these studies are all genetic studies.

641
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:07,700
The reasons are individual variants that are in LDL receptor HBSAG five AIDS or PCSK9, which is a negative right glutamate.

642
01:08:08,290 --> 01:08:13,810
Okay. Over here now are a bunch of studies where they pharmacologically lowered LDL.

643
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:20,229
So there's still kind of a linear relationship here. My guess is r R-squared for the bottom line would be a little bit low, but it's the same thing.

644
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:28,600
So generally the idea is that studies or interventions that do a better job of lowering cholesterol are also doing a better job at reducing risk.

645
01:08:29,470 --> 01:08:33,640
The question I have for you is why are the slopes of these lines so different?

646
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:40,990
Right. So if we take this guy here, this one, both of this and this reduced cholesterol by 14 milligrams per deciliter.

647
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:46,120
But in this case, there was a huge risk reduction. But in this case, it was like a pretty modest risk reduction.

648
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:49,940
But again, this is pharmacological studies. This is genetics.

649
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:59,860
You're not somebody else, per se. Okay.

650
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:09,670
I make your offer. What does it have to do at all with the duration of exposure to high HDL levels?

651
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:16,730
So when you intervene, you're intervening, let's say for a year, you have lower, but you had higher for X years before that.

652
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:23,810
That's exactly right. So if you had this mutation, you probably had high cholesterol for your entire life to of a lifetime risk,

653
01:09:24,050 --> 01:09:28,370
a lifetime of those LDL particles sort of attacking your blood vessels.

654
01:09:28,610 --> 01:09:32,540
Whereas in these groups here, the intervention might be a year or two years, three years, five years, whatever it is.

655
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:39,230
But it's definitely not life. Right? So that's why in this case, the pharmacology, it looks like it's less effective because it's affecting that.

656
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:42,380
And so one other way I've heard this framing and this is a little bit discouraging,

657
01:09:42,380 --> 01:09:47,000
is that everybody is at some level of cardiovascular disease risk, and that is always increased.

658
01:09:47,240 --> 01:09:50,480
I'm 43. I've had 43 years of cardiovascular disease risk.

659
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:54,680
I am more likely now to have a heart attack than I was 25 because I just had more time to have that.

660
01:09:55,250 --> 01:09:58,520
It's constant increasing risk over time. Right. And that's the difference between.

661
01:09:58,670 --> 01:10:01,370
Exactly between genetic risk and intervention risk.

662
01:10:01,370 --> 01:10:07,160
And you can imagine this is pharmacology here, but you could also imagine dietary interventions would be in the same the same ballpark here.

663
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:10,100
It's a dietary intervention that was this effective at reducing cholesterol,

664
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:14,329
but it was only you started it when you were 41 and you sort of only are 44.

665
01:10:14,330 --> 01:10:18,950
Now you have a much lower effect than if over your entire lifetime cholesterol levels were

666
01:10:18,950 --> 01:10:23,650
level is also one of the reasons why we worry about metabolic syndrome in teenagers.

667
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:27,650
Right. It used to be hypercholesterolemia in children and adolescents is very rare.

668
01:10:27,680 --> 01:10:30,410
But that's not the case anymore because this is associated with obesity.

669
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:36,469
And that now suggests, well, these people are not going to have this very pronounced lifelong risk of cardiovascular disease.

670
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:40,730
Right. Because they might not be the same as somebody who didn't have high cholesterol until they were 40.

671
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:48,500
Right now, if you start with high cholesterol, when you're 12, 13, 14, you've got maybe 60 years of high cholesterol ahead of you.

672
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:54,490
Right. And again, that's why people intervene with children with things like statins pretty aggressively about.

673
01:10:55,400 --> 01:11:03,410
Okay. So the last piece of data I want to show you about this is this question of the physics, the actual biochemistry of some of these particles.

674
01:11:03,770 --> 01:11:07,880
And so what I'm showing you is two studies. Again, they look like they're inverted, but they're the same.

675
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:12,860
Just be the same. It's just this is this is incidence and this is survival, which is the opposite.

676
01:11:13,220 --> 01:11:17,420
So what I'm showing you up here is now there's two ways you can measure your cholesterol.

677
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:22,100
And we alluded to this already a couple of times. One way is you take the fraction of blood.

678
01:11:22,460 --> 01:11:28,580
So let's go to here. The fraction of blood. You spin it down. This is the fraction here that has LDL.

679
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:31,790
And you see how much cholesterol is in that fraction. Okay.

680
01:11:32,120 --> 01:11:37,010
You spin all around and you say this part here, which is the LDL part, has this much cholesterol.

681
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:41,450
And so that's LDL C, that's what LDL cholesterol is.

682
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:50,420
That is not part of the number. Okay. Because we've learned that every single LDL particle has one, exactly one and never any different than one.

683
01:11:50,420 --> 01:11:56,120
Equal B 100 particle. You can count how many particles you have by measuring either the apple B

684
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:59,990
concentration or using some sort of spectrometry that measures particle numbers.

685
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:07,220
Okay, so that's what the two numbers are here. So C, is the concentration in that fraction, P is the concentration of the number of particles.

686
01:12:08,330 --> 01:12:16,070
Okay. So if you look at the end here, what you can see here is not is not my favorite terminology, what you call that like pi.

687
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:23,209
The vast majority of people who have high ldl-c also have high LDL particle, right?

688
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:30,090
So that's the plurality. It's like 3500 people in this group and high highs of 1200 year.

689
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:39,770
And so most people these things are important, right? Similarly, if you have low LDL P, you probably also have low LDL, that's another 1100 people.

690
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:48,140
So the majority of people these things track the same particle number is the same as Ldl-c fraction, but there's a few people that are discordant.

691
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:55,520
And so this person, this line here, the blue line, has high levels of cholesterol, but low levels of particles.

692
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:03,260
And and what you can see is their cardiovascular disease risk is actually really low, even though they have high ldl-c.

693
01:13:03,950 --> 01:13:09,320
Okay. And the same thing is true here. This group has high particles, but low cholesterol.

694
01:13:09,830 --> 01:13:14,300
And it's this group is at highest risk, most cardiovascular events.

695
01:13:14,570 --> 01:13:20,990
Okay. So what does that tell us? That tells us? Well, usually LDL C is a pretty good proxy for LDL particle number.

696
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:25,070
But the thing that actually matters is the LDL particle number.

697
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:28,580
Right. And usually they're the same like this.

698
01:13:28,610 --> 01:13:36,080
These two groups, it's like 75% of them are high, high, but 25% ish is discordant.

699
01:13:36,200 --> 01:13:39,500
Right. But when it's discordant, the particle number is the problem.

700
01:13:39,560 --> 01:13:49,220
The particle number is the correlate of the risk. Okay. So if I go back to here, why might that be?

701
01:13:49,610 --> 01:13:54,410
So why might the particle number be the problem as opposed to the amount of cholesterol in that fraction?

702
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:10,870
Does it have anything to do with how much of the cholesterol is actually being transported by boats?

703
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:13,930
Yes, that is yeah, that's definitely part of it.

704
01:14:21,050 --> 01:14:26,750
Regardless of how much cholesterol is in the particles, more particles, there are more space, like the more volume.

705
01:14:28,150 --> 01:14:31,880
In terms of picture. You mean the picture of the tattoo?

706
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:41,710
So which story? Which one you're saying more by? Iris name or volume of the night.

707
01:14:42,580 --> 01:14:45,220
Okay. No, you were right. I just wasn't sure how I would play it.

708
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:50,200
So the answer is, as I said, the problem is these particles are able to get through here.

709
01:14:50,510 --> 01:14:59,170
Right. So you can imagine a scenario where let's say I'm let's have this chair and I'm trying to get stuff through this chair.

710
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:03,520
Right. There's two strategies to get stuff through that mesh of the chair.

711
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,910
And one strategy is I throw a lot of marbles. All right.

712
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:13,340
Keep throwing marbles all time. That's having lots of problems. The other possibility is I throw small marbles, right?

713
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:17,190
My small marbles are going to get through that chair better than like a beach.

714
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:24,729
A beach ball is never going to get through that chair. Right. So what the problem is, is when you have small and many particles, right.

715
01:15:24,730 --> 01:15:32,470
As you're doing both things, you're sort of pelting the cell wall or the the end of the little cell barriers with lots and lots and lots of particles.

716
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:37,210
And it's especially bad particles are actually small, not if they're big,

717
01:15:37,390 --> 01:15:41,170
because small particles can kind of fit through these gaps, whereas big particles can't.

718
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:47,739
Okay. And the problem is that the particles get into this some and that's what causes atherosclerosis.

719
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:52,930
That's what causes the shortening of the arteries. That's what causes the eventually thrombosis that happens.

720
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:58,150
And so it's a little counterintuitive, but the problem is having really small particles.

721
01:15:58,810 --> 01:16:02,800
Okay. And so the last slide I have is here.

722
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,980
So this is a group thing. If you want to do this group, you can.

723
01:16:06,250 --> 01:16:14,320
But what you should do real to do then is I should have been able to arm you with an idea of like what a particle that was anthropogenic looks like.

724
01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:18,910
And then maybe what might distinguish that kind of particle from a big part.

725
01:16:19,030 --> 01:16:22,780
So what is the difference between the marble and the beach? Right.

726
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:26,860
Knowing that the marbles are the problem and there could be a bunch of different answers to that.

727
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:29,710
But that's sort of what I'll leave you guys to kind of work on on your own.

728
01:16:29,770 --> 01:16:34,280
And again, if you want to just try and submit it and I'll be right in to say I'm confused, that's fine.

729
01:16:34,280 --> 01:16:38,320
We'll try to give you feedback on that. Okay. That's all I have.

730
01:16:38,530 --> 01:16:40,590
That's all you need to know about it.

731
01:16:40,780 --> 01:16:48,710
And if all the lipids I have for you, we are on two proteins in like a week, two weeks after we finish this time.

732
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:56,470
The only thing I would like.
