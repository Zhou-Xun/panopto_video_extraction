[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:11,130
In this segment, we're gonna talk about
the five main objectives of epidemiology.

3
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,690
First is to identify the causes
of disease and its risk factors.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,920
Second is determine the extent
of diseases in communities.

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,250
Third is to study the natural history and
prognosis of disease.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,320
Fourth is to evaluate the new and
preventative intervention methods.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,770
And then, fifth is to provide a foundation
for developing public policy.

8
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:37,100
To give this sort of wide view of
epidemiology a bigger context,

9
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,140
we're gonna start with
some of the history.

10
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:41,980
So starting with history of
the public health service,

11
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:44,270
this goes all the way back to John Adams.

12
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,430
And in 1798, the signing of a law,
the act for the relief of sick and

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,740
disabled seamen, which started
from an epidemiological principle

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:56,310
that if we knew individuals were
carrying infectious diseases,

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,580
we didn't want them to go out into
communities to spread that disease.

16
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:05,120
And that just even having a pause in
their transition from their tour of duty

17
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,590
back into their communities could
save hundreds of thousands of lives.

18
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,380
So to talk about the first
objective of epidemiology,

19
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,610
this identifying of
the causes of disease and

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:20,965
its risk factors, a lot of epidemiology
starts by going into the actual fields.

21
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:22,955
And we have a nice
example of Henry Carter,

22
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:26,915
who was one of the very first people
who understood how yellow fever

23
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:31,570
was actually transmitted by mosquitoes
by going out into the actual marshes,

24
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:35,310
identifying the mosquitoes,
identifying the yellow fever.

25
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,100
And then allowing that
information to come back for

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:42,740
larger use to actually prevent
yellow fever from spreading.

27
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,790
Another good example of the history of
this sort of key concept of identifying

28
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:51,570
causes of disease and risk factors is
work that was done over a century ago,

29
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,650
looking at where people lived and
where they worked.

30
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:58,690
So for instance, the early investigations
of the garment industry back

31
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:02,800
in 1910 found the conditions for
work were unsanitary,

32
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,650
there was lots of tuberculous hotspots,
and that the child labor itself was

33
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:13,050
influencing the health of children and
their ability to be healthy adults.

34
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:17,570
Nowaday example is the epidemiological
intelligence service,

35
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,560
which the CDC has, where these are very
specialized individuals trained to go

36
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,520
out into dangerous and
difficult situations.

37
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:32,180
To do everything from understand where
an Ebola outbreak is coming from or

38
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,800
where a toxic spill may be
causing cancer in a community.

39
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,110
The second main objective,

40
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,620
to determine the extent of disease found
in communities, also has a long history.

41
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,080
So back in the early
part of the last century,

42
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,680
rural sanitary surveys looking at privies,
basically outhouses,

43
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,780
actually established the first local
health departments as people tried to

44
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,490
understand what was spreading
disease within their communities.

45
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,490
The third main objective of
epidemiology is to study the natural

46
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:04,110
history of disease to better
understand its prognosis.

47
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:09,160
So this really starts with understanding
the biology underlying the disease.

48
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,600
And then being able to figure out what
diseases are actually quite severe,

49
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,780
very fatal, versus those
diseases that have, let's say,

50
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:22,810
more silent onsets but
then give rise to more chronic outcomes.

51
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:28,050
So, here's an example where public health
made a huge impact on the world's health

52
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,490
by understanding, for instance,
the biology of smallpox,

53
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,840
how it was actually transmitted
from human to human.

54
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,980
The prognosis was terrible
if you got smallpox.

55
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,620
And so that knowledge actually
translated into one of the best

56
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,260
examples of public health in action,
where it was eradicated in the 70's

57
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,980
by people being able to apply
this knowledge across the world.

58
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,720
There are many of these diseases that
we now know that are very severe, and

59
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,870
actually so severe that our Center for
Disease Control, the CDC,

60
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:08,110
has a list of notifiable diseases that if
a physician, or a clinic, or a hospital,

61
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:13,620
or a public health department sees them,
they are to notify the CDC right away.

62
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,590
There are things that you all would want

63
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,750
your community local public
health person to know.

64
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,580
Things like the bubonic plague, you would
wanna know if that was in your community.

65
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,270
So there are systems in public
health that are there to do that.

66
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,190
Another aspect of the studying
of the natural history and

67
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:35,720
prognosis of disease is to get
a better understanding of, for

68
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,770
instance, whether or not somebody can
develop an immunity to a disease.

69
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:43,010
Whether or not they harbor it
throughout their lifetime, whether or

70
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,450
not they can even share it.

71
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,550
Is it contagious?

72
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:51,900
And/or is it something that is just
a natural part of the aging process?

73
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,960
Being able to know that kind of discrete
information allows health behavior and

74
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,290
health communication to actually

75
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:03,340
keep people from getting those
sort of susceptible moments.

76
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,310
For instance, there was a large
push within World War II to

77
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:13,140
educate soldiers about how to keep away
from sexually transmitted infections.

78
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,220
The fourth main objective,
which is to evaluate new preventative and

79
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,090
therapeutic measures, most of you
probably know from knowing about

80
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,590
the Federal Food and Drug Administration.

81
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:28,750
So the FDA is responsible for
actually looking at the evaluation of

82
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:33,440
every drug in the country and evaluating
whether or not it's safe for practice.

83
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,230
But there are many other preventative and
intervention measures

84
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,200
that need the epidemiological
lens to evaluate whether or

85
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,947
not they actually improve health.

86
00:05:42,947 --> 00:05:46,330
And whether or not when they're in use,

87
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:51,270
they continuously are working to
improve the population health.

88
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:56,390
Another example from the history books
that really was a part of the 20th

89
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,380
century, I'll call if gift to the 21st
century, is the whole area of vaccines and

90
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,040
vaccinations.

91
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:08,320
We, right now, actually benefit from
longer life, less diseases, children,

92
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,880
because of the whole vaccination movement
that started back in the 40s and 50s.

93
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,240
And some of the earliest were back in
the 30s, when there were vaccinations for

94
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,830
typhoid fever that were being
evaluated across the nation.

95
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,870
The last main objective is to
provide the foundation for

96
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:28,660
developing public policy
in regulatory decisions.

97
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,850
If we even look for

98
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:34,950
a moment at the policy cycle, it starts
with an assessment of population health.

99
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,870
That's epidemiology.

100
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,250
It moves then to the assessment
of potential interventions,

101
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,670
that's also epidemiology.

102
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:46,530
And from that,
then the key policy choices are made, and

103
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,620
then moving to the actual implementation.

104
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:55,090
Policy implementation, then evaluated,
should actually give us the evidence

105
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:00,211
that the policy is working to improve
people's health and reduce their disease.
