1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,137
Okay, so last but not least, I'll talk about equitable care, so

2
00:00:04,137 --> 00:00:09,272
the first point that was brought up was really about introducing a digital divide.

3
00:00:09,272 --> 00:00:13,608
We make sure that hospitals that are treating underserved populations

4
00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:17,664
are keeping up in hell 90 adoption compared to other hospitals.

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:22,936
And here's just some data that shows that the answers that largely has been yes.

6
00:00:22,936 --> 00:00:25,541
And that we didn't we're not gonna spend a lot of times they talked about

7
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:26,232
the high tech act.

8
00:00:26,232 --> 00:00:30,837
But they were very qualitative we're very focused on making sure that this didn't

9
00:00:30,837 --> 00:00:35,111
happen until they made a lot of sorta accommodations in the legislation to try

10
00:00:35,111 --> 00:00:38,293
to be more generous and helpful to safety net providers.

11
00:00:38,293 --> 00:00:41,095
So what we see in the data is that more or less they kept up.

12
00:00:41,095 --> 00:00:44,713
But it's not perfect they still are critical access hospital,

13
00:00:44,713 --> 00:00:46,522
smaller hospitals are behind.

14
00:00:46,522 --> 00:00:50,606
But on the whole there's actually other reasonable job.

15
00:00:50,606 --> 00:00:54,180
That's just what adoption, we don't know whether they're actually able to sorta use

16
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,269
their electronic health records as effectively.

17
00:00:56,269 --> 00:00:59,024
And I think there's still a lot of work that needs to be done to understand

18
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:00,571
the extent to which that's happening.

19
00:01:00,571 --> 00:01:05,782
But from the data that we have, it seems like they've actually not created

20
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:11,090
the basic by with the past year because we had a lot more fun than HR adoption.

21
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,829
So this is just that but

22
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:18,150
then there was sorta the second thing is not just the digital divide.

23
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,744
Could these symptoms actually help make sure that some of the implicit biases that

24
00:01:22,744 --> 00:01:26,225
humans may have that would say over that patient population.

25
00:01:26,225 --> 00:01:28,079
We're not gonna give them this treatment,

26
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:30,546
even though it may actually be just as effective for them.

27
00:01:30,546 --> 00:01:35,676
We don't have a lot of evidence but we have one study that basically we

28
00:01:35,676 --> 00:01:40,894
found that amongst hospital that had in the degree to which they are not,

29
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:45,598
they were a safety net hospital in addition, that spot or not.

30
00:01:45,598 --> 00:01:48,308
But it's sorta a border or whether or

31
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:54,353
not your safety net hospital we found no association between basically quality.

32
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:57,702
And this is that we didn't see relationships whether or

33
00:01:57,702 --> 00:02:01,408
not they were taking that possible quality performance, but

34
00:02:01,408 --> 00:02:05,626
amongst those that did not have an HR safety net hospitals affirmative.

35
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:09,611
Hard to know right like that cause and effect or is that just an association?

36
00:02:09,611 --> 00:02:15,041
But they're at least brings up the possibility that it really was using

37
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:20,395
any HR that helped ensure that the safety net hospitals performance.

38
00:02:20,395 --> 00:02:24,725
Yeah, okay let me just summarise what I went through it again there was a lot

39
00:02:24,725 --> 00:02:25,481
of studies,

40
00:02:25,481 --> 00:02:29,904
a lot of evidence I don't expect you to remember any individual one of them.

41
00:02:29,904 --> 00:02:31,589
But I wanna give you a feeling for

42
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:35,524
sorta where is the weird evidence good where we actually have evidence that

43
00:02:35,524 --> 00:02:39,729
the evidence is mixed where do we just really still not dealt with the evidence.

44
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:43,613
So if you're in an elevator and someone says like, do we know that health I T

45
00:02:43,613 --> 00:02:47,575
improved safety, I think it's reasonable to say yes we do have this point.

46
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:52,249
And hundreds of hundreds of studies where we see that we have CPOE with

47
00:02:52,249 --> 00:02:55,971
clinical decision support and it does need to reduce.

48
00:02:55,971 --> 00:03:00,396
So that's only one solid thing that we can say all this money

49
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:04,836
has been one thing that probably has the medication super.

50
00:03:04,836 --> 00:03:07,970
Patient centred care still sorta big question like we just have a limited

51
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,090
evidence we don't know.

52
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,868
It should be the one study that I've been able to find my gut feeling is that we

53
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:18,723
haven't done a lot here because we have thought that how did you held the key to

54
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:20,982
improving patient centeredness?

55
00:03:20,982 --> 00:03:27,709
And I think wait a minute discussion potential there.

56
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,229
Timely care again we just don't know that much we don't have a ton of studies.

57
00:03:33,229 --> 00:03:37,952
But it seems like a few of them suggested there might be a little ways in

58
00:03:37,952 --> 00:03:40,069
which using called antique and

59
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:44,724
sorta speed up which is the information and react and respond to it.

60
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:48,234
Effectiveness is another sorta we actually have a reasonable amount of

61
00:03:48,234 --> 00:03:49,117
evidence there.

62
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:52,035
It's been a little bit of a mixed bag as we talked about earlier

63
00:03:52,035 --> 00:03:55,697
today early studies did suggest that there was real benefits to be had there.

64
00:03:55,697 --> 00:03:59,913
But we've seen a bunch of studies since then that have not found a stronger

65
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:02,573
between you are an option and effectiveness.

66
00:04:02,573 --> 00:04:05,463
So I think that continues to be a bit of a question

67
00:04:05,463 --> 00:04:09,801
mark efficient care they said two studies the book said there's $80

68
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:13,868
billion in waste that can be taken out of the system with health IT.

69
00:04:13,868 --> 00:04:18,499
But that's easier said than done and I think Andy's intuition is right that will

70
00:04:18,499 --> 00:04:21,292
really start to see that potential as we better so

71
00:04:21,292 --> 00:04:24,853
that providers actually want to take waste out of the system.

72
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:29,656
And then hopefully we'll have these tools will allow that's why we

73
00:04:29,656 --> 00:04:32,528
haven't seen a lot of strong evidence.

74
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:37,255
And finally inequitable again I just think they're limited

75
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:39,673
that he is helping or hurting.

76
00:04:39,673 --> 00:04:44,254
We do I think have pretty good evidence we haven't created amount of digital

77
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:48,778
divide in this but that's different from actually using the technology.

78
00:04:48,778 --> 00:04:56,705
Please note that adopted PHRS you have to make sure that they actually trying to.

79
00:04:56,705 --> 00:05:00,065
So again that was a little bit of a firehose approach to getting a sense of

80
00:05:00,065 --> 00:05:02,529
where the evidence is that have these refer back to.

81
00:05:02,529 --> 00:05:06,047
And I think most importantly you don't have a sense for

82
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:11,265
sort of where is the potential they can be different when we actually we're not.

83
00:05:11,265 --> 00:05:11,998
All right so

84
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:16,838
I'm gonna spend the last few minutes here I'm thinking a little bit more about

85
00:05:16,838 --> 00:05:21,844
this sort of puzzle around like why are we not consistently seeing the benefits.

86
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:23,137
And as we talked about right,

87
00:05:23,137 --> 00:05:26,292
there are a lot of early studies from the leading institutions that led us

88
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:29,775
to believe that like there's really this is going to change everything right?

89
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:32,886
All these quality problems we've had in our country, right?

90
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:37,067
We had like a rescue but crossing the quality has them like you did those things

91
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:39,007
really silver bullet in LIT right?

92
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:42,453
We've just got to help my team and we're not going to have these problems

93
00:05:42,453 --> 00:05:45,008
needless to say that's not really happening right?

94
00:05:45,008 --> 00:05:51,296
We have more and more studies that don't find relationship between adopting and

95
00:05:51,296 --> 00:05:56,757
one that I can't and then there's one exception medication safety.

96
00:05:56,757 --> 00:06:01,253
I think that is an area where we do some pretty consistent evidence but for

97
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:04,642
almost all of the other domains where we have a reason,

98
00:06:04,642 --> 00:06:06,944
I don't see a really strong signal.

99
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:13,364
So why are we not seeing this sort of magical relationship that you called?

100
00:06:13,364 --> 00:06:18,571
>> Earlier doctors were like have

101
00:06:18,571 --> 00:06:23,980
the resources to experiment and

102
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:29,396
art population [INAUDIBLE] now.

103
00:06:29,396 --> 00:06:35,476
So maybe the people that are doing it first where is the ideal?

104
00:06:35,476 --> 00:06:38,514
>> Okay so I think that's so they're ideal and

105
00:06:38,514 --> 00:06:41,479
gave us two reasons why they get the ideal.

106
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:44,519
So one reason they could be ideal because they have the resources,

107
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,267
it's not just putting in the system.

108
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:49,729
But then there's sort of a bunch of additional investments that you might make

109
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:52,098
that you're saying really what makes a difference?

110
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:55,285
So thoughts like what what else would you want to invest in that could really make

111
00:06:55,285 --> 00:06:56,247
a difference, right?

112
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:59,947
Assume the HR has been paid for what would you use those extra resources for

113
00:06:59,947 --> 00:07:01,030
that could be value.

114
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:11,086
Are you thinking about this investigation and

115
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:14,061
other places that have any HR not population, okay.

116
00:07:14,061 --> 00:07:16,759
So what is that obligation they're working?

117
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,745
No parents should be with 10 patients learn how

118
00:07:21,745 --> 00:07:25,158
to take care of the south school.

119
00:07:25,158 --> 00:07:34,498
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> I think one of the things you're

120
00:07:34,498 --> 00:07:39,056
saying that intermountain might do well is actually use the data that's in the right.

121
00:07:39,056 --> 00:07:42,878
So two places can have HR but one of them could actually look at their data and

122
00:07:42,878 --> 00:07:46,276
try to understand like what is this telling us about whether we're

123
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:48,231
delivering high quality care or not.

124
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:50,142
And other people can use the HR every day but

125
00:07:50,142 --> 00:07:53,285
never actually look at the data that's what this is telling, right?

126
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:55,733
So one of the things you could use extra resources for

127
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:59,345
is actually just looking at the data that you have at your fingertips trying to

128
00:07:59,345 --> 00:08:02,806
understand this is actually telling us about how we need to change right.

129
00:08:02,806 --> 00:08:04,903
So I think that's sort of what I want to make this concrete right?

130
00:08:04,903 --> 00:08:05,975
We can take resources but

131
00:08:05,975 --> 00:08:09,096
like what are you spending those resources on that could actually help.

132
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:11,259
So one of them is is using the data what else?

133
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:16,916
>> And also that if they could understand

134
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:22,940
it better it's much easier [INAUDIBLE].

135
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,285
>> Sure, so one of the things that some of the leading citizens have is

136
00:08:26,285 --> 00:08:30,291
very strong incense financial incentives to used to deliver good care to sort of

137
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,651
figure out how to use the HR more effectively.

138
00:08:32,651 --> 00:08:37,831
But I want to get this colonel, what does it mean to use any HR.

139
00:08:37,831 --> 00:08:40,722
And hopefully what I've convinced you is like you don't just turn on the system and

140
00:08:40,722 --> 00:08:41,973
then the next day care gets better.

141
00:08:41,973 --> 00:08:48,775
What else do you need to do to really realise about?

142
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:53,485
>> I think you need a pretty large

143
00:08:53,485 --> 00:08:58,009
in people yeah evaluating or

144
00:08:58,009 --> 00:09:03,098
you I know it [INAUDIBLE] months or

145
00:09:03,098 --> 00:09:08,562
years a lot research and then it can

146
00:09:08,562 --> 00:09:13,479
take time for some of the yeah.

147
00:09:13,479 --> 00:09:15,552
>> Okay, so sort of two different and important points, right?

148
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:20,034
So one is that you actually need people who can pay attention to the systems

149
00:09:20,034 --> 00:09:21,777
are they functioning well?

150
00:09:21,777 --> 00:09:24,920
The changes that you need to write like a certain functionality is broken.

151
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,464
How quickly does it get resolved, right.

152
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:31,383
And the resource for institution, it may take months before something gets fixed

153
00:09:31,383 --> 00:09:34,074
whereas in well resourced institutions United Big IT.

154
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,760
And they're constantly able [INAUDIBLE].

155
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,360
Okay so there's really all these reasons why you might having this extra reason and

156
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,723
then your second point is that it may just take time, right?

157
00:09:44,723 --> 00:09:49,176
But this is a learning process you put in a tool it's complex and that does a lot of

158
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:52,915
different things and it just takes time to figure out how to use it.

159
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:54,340
So that's sort of a second these years.

160
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,342
Well, maybe the answer here is just you haven't given this enough time.

161
00:09:57,342 --> 00:10:01,625
We shouldn't be worried and say, my God, like we just made this $30 billion dollar

162
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,804
investment in HR it is always because it takes five or ten years.

163
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:09,692
And the evidence from other industries suggests that it does take about

164
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:14,753
a decade to see that really big improvements in productivity after that.

165
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:16,282
I think in the healthcare world,

166
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,775
you sort of assume that it's not like you think it's gonna work over and that

167
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,456
problem is not the right assumption that there is this process that takes time.

168
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,184
But it may just not the only time, right?

169
00:10:25,184 --> 00:10:26,030
It may be time and

170
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:29,484
resources that health organisations figure out how to use it well.

171
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:35,029
And that's I think that's maybe it should be are all provider organisations really

172
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:39,802
investing in all these complementary areas that you need to really use?

173
00:10:39,802 --> 00:10:44,166
So that's I think that's the puzzle that I want to leave you with is that's really

174
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,454
the key that I think we need to understand.

175
00:10:46,454 --> 00:10:49,568
It's like it's EHRS plus something else that exists in

176
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:54,149
the organisation that's going to give us these improved performance benefits.

177
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:57,383
And we're still really fuzzy on, like what is that second piece, right?

178
00:10:57,383 --> 00:11:00,749
It has something to do with resources that like if I were to give every hospital to

179
00:11:00,749 --> 00:11:04,337
resources, we still need to tell them like how should you improve those resources?

180
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:09,272
Well we don't really have a solid experience.

181
00:11:09,272 --> 00:11:13,637
So any other thoughts or questions for photographs?

182
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:17,780
>> I was gonna say the nebulous term of cultures [INAUDIBLE].

183
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,922
Absolutely, so I agree.

184
00:11:18,922 --> 00:11:23,015
Right, there's something that happened with culture, but at the end of the day,

185
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,933
like if you went into an organisation that you felt like I had the right culture,

186
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:28,415
what would you see that look?

187
00:11:28,415 --> 00:11:32,953
>> Probably work better basically he'll be happy and stuff with results.

188
00:11:32,953 --> 00:11:34,423
>> Okay, so something would be happy.

189
00:11:34,423 --> 00:11:38,618
So maybe they've implemented the system in a way that positions like better and

190
00:11:38,618 --> 00:11:41,822
they're actually more likely to pay attention to, right?

191
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:44,554
I mean, what do you guys think specifically about whether the mechanisms

192
00:11:44,554 --> 00:11:47,639
here because that's what's gonna help us improve the system to make sure that they

193
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,112
actually translate to about, right.

194
00:11:49,112 --> 00:11:52,812
So, I think all these things cultural resources like yes,

195
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:57,410
they matter like what is the specific mechanism they actually help in HR.

196
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:01,005
So hopefully that has stimulated some thoughts and

197
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:05,771
as you all get out there in the world, you can help us figure out how to

198
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:09,630
let's deliver on the promise of which is real and big.

199
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:13,960
>> [APPLAUSE]
