1
00:00:01,649 --> 00:00:07,554
After having gone through these very dense definitions of direct and

2
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:12,046
indirect effects for causing mediation analysis.

3
00:00:12,046 --> 00:00:17,130
Under the potential outcome framework, I would like to take a moment now.

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:21,396
Before even thinking how do we estimate these effects?

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,578
How do we learn about them?

6
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:25,929
Well, but why bother?

7
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:30,979
Why do we care about conducting a mediation analysis?

8
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:34,379
Why is it so useful?

9
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:38,987
Here I would like to share a few of the settings where I've

10
00:00:38,987 --> 00:00:42,933
used the mediation analyzes in my own research.

11
00:00:42,933 --> 00:00:48,077
And why I became so interested in applying these methods

12
00:00:48,077 --> 00:00:54,325
as well as develop new approaches for causing mediation analysis.

13
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:57,971
Which is my main area of work.

14
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:04,046
First, additional analysis is key to foster our scientific understanding.

15
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:06,174
And to explain social and

16
00:01:06,174 --> 00:01:12,162
bio medical phenomenon as indeed genetic epidemiological example.

17
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:16,494
We wanna ask, what is the mechanism through which these

18
00:01:16,494 --> 00:01:19,545
genetic variants affect lung cancer?

19
00:01:19,545 --> 00:01:24,183
Is this a mechanism of mediation involving smoking.

20
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:31,128
Or is it is a mechanism of interaction of gene environment interaction?

21
00:01:31,128 --> 00:01:33,211
As we will see later on to.

22
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:39,929
We might use mediation analysis to confirm or refute theories in the social sciences.

23
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:44,565
For example, we might ask, how does SES and

24
00:01:44,565 --> 00:01:51,095
maybe social deprivation in childhood affect adult health?

25
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:55,856
And this is primarily through SES in

26
00:01:55,856 --> 00:02:01,100
adulthood or through other pathways.

27
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,417
Another reason why we might wanna use mediation analysis and

28
00:02:05,417 --> 00:02:09,149
in particular estimating control direct effects.

29
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,770
Is whether we can limit the effects of a certain toxic exposure.

30
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:21,889
By blocking its effects by intervening on an intermediate variable.

31
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:26,254
So one of the questions I've asked in my own research.

32
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:29,658
Is whether we can eliminate adverse effects

33
00:02:29,658 --> 00:02:33,162
of antipsychotic medication on mortality?

34
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:40,448
By preventing the, say side effects that impact cardio metabolic function?

35
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:46,012
So we know unfortunately the antipsychotic medications are important

36
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:50,840
risk factors for heart disease for this patient population.

37
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,732
But we can also use mediation analysis and

38
00:02:53,732 --> 00:02:58,945
I've done this with some of my collaborators in psychiatry or education.

39
00:02:58,945 --> 00:03:06,691
To refine complex interventions that are made of several components.

40
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:11,175
So for example, we could refine an intervention on

41
00:03:11,175 --> 00:03:15,462
education to better target classroom quality.

42
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:21,489
For example, if our intervention is to use and adopt a new book.

43
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:26,280
Well, there are several components of this intervention because

44
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,454
the new book will have a different content.

45
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:33,678
Potentially will potentially lead to different types of

46
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:37,817
interactions during the classroom activity and so on.

47
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,545
Or we could use it to see whether we can

48
00:03:40,545 --> 00:03:45,122
eliminate cost ineffective components of an intervention.

49
00:03:45,122 --> 00:03:50,622
For example, does the CBT cognitive behavioral therapy intervention

50
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:55,763
improved depressive symptoms only through antidepressant use?

51
00:03:55,763 --> 00:04:00,068
So we could understand whether we can just focus on the more cost

52
00:04:00,068 --> 00:04:03,002
effective components of the CBT therapy.

53
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:09,974
And leave behind certain components that are not actually driving the main effect.

54
00:04:09,974 --> 00:04:15,176
And also, as I was mentioning before, when talking about inconsistent mediation.

55
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:19,693
We can use mediation analysis to understand why an intervention failed.

56
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:24,449
Because potentially the intervention did not work either because it

57
00:04:24,449 --> 00:04:28,228
did not effectively change the intermediate target.

58
00:04:28,228 --> 00:04:34,830
Or it had undesired antagonistic effects.

59
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:39,457
So these are some of the examples where I think mediation

60
00:04:39,457 --> 00:04:42,321
analysis is truly very relevant.

61
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:48,213
And it's worth it to continue our course.

62
00:04:48,213 --> 00:04:52,639
But there are several challenges that we have to face in order to actually use

63
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,278
these definitions to estimate the effects.

64
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:59,629
So before we can actually finally go to our or

65
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:04,224
stay to and start really do conduct analysis.

66
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:11,214
So the examples that I gave you before I gave you the exact perfect scenario.

67
00:05:11,214 --> 00:05:17,232
Where we had all the information needed to compute these effects in practice.

68
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:23,200
Unfortunately all this information is not available is actually missing.

69
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,331
So in real life our three individuals of the example

70
00:05:28,331 --> 00:05:33,118
I gave you will either be exposed or unexposed.

71
00:05:33,118 --> 00:05:39,272
So we will have an additional column in our deficit which is gonna be A.

72
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:43,579
And when I say individual A is observed to be unexposed,

73
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:47,164
the same doesn't carry the genetic variant.

74
00:05:47,164 --> 00:05:52,178
Consequently we will only observe one level of the mediator.

75
00:05:52,178 --> 00:05:55,807
Which happens to be the mediator in the absence of the exposure.

76
00:05:55,807 --> 00:06:00,008
But we wanna observe the other potential outcome under

77
00:06:00,008 --> 00:06:03,760
the counterfactual scenario for the exposure.

78
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,080
And since the mediator is zero.

79
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,223
So this person is a non smoker we only see their lung

80
00:06:11,223 --> 00:06:16,167
cancer status under the scenario when both A and M are zero.

81
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:19,703
But we don't observe all the other three potential outcomes, why?

82
00:06:19,703 --> 00:06:24,278
That we would need to know in order to recover the causal effects and

83
00:06:24,278 --> 00:06:27,066
the individual counterfactual level.

84
00:06:27,066 --> 00:06:35,130
So you can see out of the six counterfactual we would need to know.

85
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:41,987
We only observe two of them and you observe the level of the exposure.

86
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:46,552
And we have four data points missing for every person.

87
00:06:46,552 --> 00:06:52,572
So it's a huge missing data problem.

88
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:56,022
So this comes along with the,

89
00:06:56,022 --> 00:07:00,309
criticism for mediation analysis.

90
00:07:00,309 --> 00:07:05,318
So it's criticized because the definitions rely on knowing

91
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:09,942
some information that is missing, severely missing.

92
00:07:09,942 --> 00:07:17,282
And in addition it uses this idea of the nested crossword counterfactual.

93
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:21,741
Where it's really hard to conceive of an experiment where

94
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:25,841
the outcome is observed under two different worlds.

95
00:07:25,841 --> 00:07:28,583
The world where the person is exposed and

96
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:33,348
when the person has immediately level in the absence of the exposure.

97
00:07:33,348 --> 00:07:38,685
So these are big challenges that we cannot recover if we believe

98
00:07:38,685 --> 00:07:44,134
certain non testable, unmeasured confounding assumptions.

99
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:51,836
And that's why the whole field of mediation analysis is still up for debate.

100
00:07:51,836 --> 00:07:55,654
Because several scholars do not believe that we can

101
00:07:55,654 --> 00:07:59,482
actually that these assumptions are reasonable.

102
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:04,909
So always look at what we do with a certain criticism, right?

103
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:07,535
But we shouldn't be completely stopped.

104
00:08:07,535 --> 00:08:15,075
But on the other hand, let's just be aware that there is a debate in the field.

105
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:19,924
So since it's impossible to recover individual causal effects,

106
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:23,397
we were gonna be after average causal effects.

107
00:08:23,397 --> 00:08:28,227
So this light gives you the average version of

108
00:08:28,227 --> 00:08:32,429
the definition of the puzzle effects.

109
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:37,318
And it can be shown that these causal effects can be identified

110
00:08:37,318 --> 00:08:39,016
from observed data.

111
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:44,975
So we can go from these definitions where each term is a counterfactual.

112
00:08:44,975 --> 00:08:49,903
Two as we will see shortly formula for these effects.

113
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:55,736
There is only a function of observed data and we will call that formula,

114
00:08:55,736 --> 00:09:00,223
non parametric estimators for these causal effects.

115
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:02,958
So what are the identify ability assumptions?

116
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:08,102
The first one is that there should be no unmeasured exposure outcome,

117
00:09:08,102 --> 00:09:10,467
confounding given coverage C.

118
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:14,530
The second one that we have already discussed a lot.

119
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:20,572
Is the non measure confounding of the mediator outcome relationship [INAUDIBLE].

120
00:09:20,572 --> 00:09:25,475
And the third one is that there is non measure exposure mediator confounding

121
00:09:25,475 --> 00:09:27,013
[INAUDIBLE] Why is that?

122
00:09:27,013 --> 00:09:29,630
Because in the indirect effect we see,

123
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:34,797
we need to establish that M subscript one is different than M subscript zero.

124
00:09:34,797 --> 00:09:38,296
So in order we need to establish the effect of ANN.

125
00:09:38,296 --> 00:09:42,447
So that's why we also need to block all back your paths from

126
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:44,660
the mediator to the exposure.

127
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,628
And finally, which is the toughest definition to

128
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,675
understand in the context of mediation analysis.

129
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:56,421
The fourth assumption, there should be no effect of the exposure

130
00:09:56,421 --> 00:10:01,133
that confounds the mediator outcome relationship.

131
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:06,398
Said in another way, there should be no mediator outcome

132
00:10:06,398 --> 00:10:10,908
confounders that are affected by the exposure.

133
00:10:10,908 --> 00:10:15,233
Said in another way, there should be no mediator

134
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:19,461
outcome confounder, that is also a mediator.

135
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:24,237
Note that assumptions one in three, that pertain confounding of exposure

136
00:10:24,237 --> 00:10:27,282
outcome and exposure mediator relationship.

137
00:10:27,282 --> 00:10:31,263
Can be satisfied in the context of randomized controlled trials.

138
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:35,893
But the second and fourth assumption,

139
00:10:35,893 --> 00:10:42,071
might be violated even if this study is randomized.

140
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:49,271
Another important thing is that to identify control direct effects,

141
00:10:49,271 --> 00:10:53,307
you only need assumptions one and two.

142
00:10:53,307 --> 00:10:57,986
To identify natural direct and natural indirect effects.

143
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:01,751
We need all the four assumptions, here,

144
00:11:01,751 --> 00:11:06,602
I'm rewriting using the counterfactual notation.

145
00:11:06,602 --> 00:11:11,327
The direct and the identify ability assumptions for

146
00:11:11,327 --> 00:11:14,447
the direct and indirect effects.

147
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:20,063
And I'm here facing the master complex doug

148
00:11:20,063 --> 00:11:26,147
under which these assumptions are satisfied.

149
00:11:26,147 --> 00:11:28,569
So the first assumption says,

150
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:34,353
that there is exchange ability in the effect of A and Y conditionally on C.

151
00:11:34,353 --> 00:11:40,396
That is there are no backdoor paths from Y to C conditionally from Y to A,

152
00:11:40,396 --> 00:11:42,936
sorry, conditionally on C.

153
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:46,714
The second assumption says,

154
00:11:46,714 --> 00:11:52,304
that there are no backdoor paths from Y to M,

155
00:11:52,304 --> 00:11:55,184
adjusting for C and A.

156
00:11:55,184 --> 00:11:59,864
So in this case, look at this doug,

157
00:11:59,864 --> 00:12:05,168
what are the confounders of the mediator

158
00:12:05,168 --> 00:12:10,011
outcome relationship, C two and A?

159
00:12:10,011 --> 00:12:17,243
The third assumption says there are no backdoor paths from M to A.

160
00:12:17,243 --> 00:12:19,627
So we need to adjust for the C trade.

161
00:12:19,627 --> 00:12:24,094
And the fourth assumption says, that the world where

162
00:12:24,094 --> 00:12:28,968
the person is exposed to level literally and little lamb.

163
00:12:28,968 --> 00:12:33,961
Is independent of the world where the individual is exposed to another level of

164
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,332
the exposure A star.

165
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:43,634
So this is this assumption of no interference between the two worlds.

166
00:12:43,634 --> 00:12:46,583
In this a nested counterfactual,

167
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:51,372
how we actually represent this assumption in the doug.

168
00:12:51,372 --> 00:12:56,345
This assumption is actually is masked.

169
00:12:56,345 --> 00:13:02,934
This assumption requires that there are no arrows from A to C two.

170
00:13:02,934 --> 00:13:09,299
In fact, we see that C two is independent of A in this graph.

171
00:13:09,299 --> 00:13:17,158
Here, instead is a graph where the fourth identify ability assumption is violated.

172
00:13:17,158 --> 00:13:23,919
So what happens when the fourth identify ability assumption is violated.

173
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:29,443
Happens that the exposure influences L.

174
00:13:29,443 --> 00:13:33,315
L is a mediator outcome confounder but

175
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:37,192
by nature of being a consequence of A.

176
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:40,952
L is a mediator as well.

177
00:13:40,952 --> 00:13:44,642
So why this is problematic?

178
00:13:44,642 --> 00:13:50,687
This is problematic because now this becomes a problem of multiple mediators.

179
00:13:50,687 --> 00:13:54,381
It's not anymore a problem of single mediators.

180
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:57,748
So we will consider at the end of the course,

181
00:13:57,748 --> 00:14:02,029
how do we deal when this is the structure of our problem?

182
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:07,230
How do we define effects in this context?

183
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:12,381
How can we proceed still when our main interest is only

184
00:14:12,381 --> 00:14:17,887
about the mediator M and not the mediator L is a nuisance?

185
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:21,739
We need to adjust for it because it's a confounder but

186
00:14:21,739 --> 00:14:24,744
it is not a primary mediator of interest.

187
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:29,491
So this we will see in an example in a social epidemiology.

188
00:14:29,491 --> 00:14:32,813
Where we will wanna understand,

189
00:14:32,813 --> 00:14:38,756
how child SES influences adult health through adults SES?

190
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:44,236
The problem here is that adult risk factors such as the substance abuse.

191
00:14:44,236 --> 00:14:49,567
If are influenced by childhood deprivation and

192
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:56,772
in turn they cause adult SES and the final outcome adult health.

193
00:14:56,772 --> 00:15:01,678
So in this case the problem is that L

194
00:15:01,678 --> 00:15:07,269
belongs simultaneously to two paths.

195
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:12,430
One is a direct path ALY.

196
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:18,017
And the other one is an indirect path AL and Y.

197
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:22,304
That's why in the literature this is the paper I site that talks about it.

198
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:26,453
L is also called the a recounting witness.

199
00:15:26,453 --> 00:15:33,044
When the witness, first says the story and then comes back and

200
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:38,380
says a different story opposite of the first one.

201
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,338
How is this LA recounting our story?

202
00:15:42,338 --> 00:15:48,256
L on the one hand, tells us something about the direct effect.

203
00:15:48,256 --> 00:15:51,669
But at the same time, L can come back and

204
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:55,927
tells us something about the indirect pathway.

205
00:15:55,927 --> 00:16:00,328
And this is particularly challenging to tease apart.

206
00:16:00,328 --> 00:16:04,898
And we will see better at the end of the course why it's actually impossible to

207
00:16:04,898 --> 00:16:07,795
tease apart the direct pathway that involves L.

208
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:14,724
And the indirect pathway that does involve L as well.

209
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,225
So under the assumptions, one and

210
00:16:17,225 --> 00:16:21,459
two as I said the controlled direct effect is identified.

211
00:16:21,459 --> 00:16:26,985
And we see that we can go from its definition.

212
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:31,109
In terms of counterfactual conditional on the confounders that

213
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:33,486
satisfy the first two assumptions.

214
00:16:33,486 --> 00:16:38,227
And can be done rewritten as a simple conditional statements.

215
00:16:38,227 --> 00:16:42,372
Where Y is conditioned on the observed exposure,

216
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:45,737
observed the mediator and co variance.

217
00:16:45,737 --> 00:16:49,673
Note that here in giving the conditional effects but

218
00:16:49,673 --> 00:16:52,809
we could also obtain a marginal effects.

219
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:57,557
That is, say we have that our own confounders gender.

220
00:16:57,557 --> 00:17:03,095
Here we could say we wanna find the control direct effect for females.

221
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:06,283
And then we can estimate the controlled direct effect for males.

222
00:17:06,283 --> 00:17:11,209
But we could also obtain the marginal effect by computing the causal effect for

223
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:13,676
male, the causal effect for females.

224
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:20,201
And summing them up and waiting for each of the effects for female and male.

225
00:17:20,201 --> 00:17:24,759
By the probability of being a male or a female in the study.

226
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:32,058
So this is the standardization to obtain marginal effects.

227
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:35,779
The non parametric estimators for natural direct and

228
00:17:35,779 --> 00:17:39,838
natural indirect effects are a little more complicated.

229
00:17:39,838 --> 00:17:44,117
And they are beyond the scope of the course being a more applied course to

230
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:45,481
mediation analysis.

231
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,602
However, I would be happy to explain them further if you wanna come to

232
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:52,240
office hours if you are interested in that.

233
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,963
Or you can also review the proofs in the papers

234
00:17:56,963 --> 00:18:00,573
that I site at the end of the notes.

235
00:18:00,573 --> 00:18:02,094
But intuitively,

236
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:08,182
what does the non parametric estimator of the natural direct effect means?

237
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:12,324
Effectively, the natural direct effect estimator is a function of

238
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,293
the controlled direct effect.

239
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:19,135
This is what we see inside the curly brackets is

240
00:18:19,135 --> 00:18:23,990
the control direct effect where any.

241
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:29,380
And then we sum over all the possible control direct effects for

242
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,830
all levels of the mediator.

243
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:37,417
Weighting them by the probability of the mediator

244
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:42,212
conditionally on the group of no exposed.

245
00:18:42,212 --> 00:18:46,099
So effectively the natural direct effect estimator is

246
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:49,400
the standardized controlled direct effect.

247
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:54,023
Which is standardized over the density of the mediator.

248
00:18:54,023 --> 00:19:00,080
Or the probability mass function of the mediator among the unexposed.

249
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,402
The natural indirect effect instead, compares the distribution

250
00:19:04,402 --> 00:19:08,269
of the mediator in the presence or absence of the exposure.

251
00:19:08,269 --> 00:19:14,369
Weighting it by the mean of the outcome in the presence of the exposure.

252
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:19,820
So in order to derive this formula that are only functions of observed data,

253
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,555
there are proofs with several lines.

254
00:19:22,555 --> 00:19:29,776
And you can go to the appendices of the papers that show these proofs.

255
00:19:29,776 --> 00:19:34,310
We can also rewrite these effects that here I have for

256
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,030
a binary exposure for a general exposure.

257
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,492
Where now we replace A, with A.

258
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:47,189
That means one in our previous formula any star is our level zero.

259
00:19:51,269 --> 00:19:55,576
When we consider parametric regression approaches for mediation analysis.

260
00:19:55,576 --> 00:20:01,014
We will see how these estimators become function of the regression coefficient,

261
00:20:01,014 --> 00:20:03,705
so it will be much easier to understand.

262
00:20:07,778 --> 00:20:12,538
So also throughout the course, I will often use

263
00:20:12,538 --> 00:20:17,537
these small synthetic version of the of the doug.

264
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:20,378
Where I combine all the possible confounders of

265
00:20:20,378 --> 00:20:22,871
the exposure outcome mediator outcome.

266
00:20:22,871 --> 00:20:27,734
Exposure mediator relationship in one BBC.

267
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:28,857
Here it is.

268
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:38,526
So in conclusion, we reviewed here standard approaches to mediation analysis.

269
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:41,212
The difference in the product method and

270
00:20:41,212 --> 00:20:45,087
I also reviewed some of the limitations of these methods.

271
00:20:45,087 --> 00:20:49,885
In particular that their lack of rigor in discussing

272
00:20:49,885 --> 00:20:53,271
the identify ability assumptions.

273
00:20:53,271 --> 00:20:58,507
And also their limit in sense of allowing

274
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:04,975
only linear regressions with only linear terms.

275
00:21:04,975 --> 00:21:08,162
Okay, either of these problems that is not accounting for confounding.

276
00:21:08,162 --> 00:21:13,190
And not accounting for interactions can lead to very paradoxical results.

277
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:16,565
The causal inference literature has provided alternative

278
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:20,152
counterfactual definitions of direct and indirect effects.

279
00:21:20,152 --> 00:21:26,496
That can generalize those that we saw in the social sciences.

280
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:29,384
Also, the causal inference literature has made clear.

281
00:21:29,384 --> 00:21:33,827
And more precise than non measure confounding assumption for

282
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:35,712
causal interpretation.

283
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,429
Thank you for listening.

284
00:21:37,429 --> 00:21:41,127
And I look forward to have a discussion together and

285
00:21:41,127 --> 00:21:45,602
practice together concepts of causing mediation analysis.
