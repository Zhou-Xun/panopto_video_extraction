1
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:25,050
So this recording provides guidance for locating nutrition and food statistics for your community assessment report.

2
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:36,540
And this is a screenshot of the instructions on canvas for your community assessment report that is specific to locating nutrition data or statistics.

3
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:43,250
I want to call your attention to the first bullet.

4
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:53,240
It says, identify one dietary intake indicator and it gives you some examples of what a dietary intake indicator might be.

5
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:59,120
Fruit and vegetable intake, beverage consumption, diet quality, restaurant use.

6
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:11,779
There's a lot of different data that you could access resources for finding this one dietary intake indicator may come from.

7
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:20,330
It could be the Behavioral Risk Factor surveillance survey that you used for locating health data for adults.

8
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,870
If your population is adolescents, there's the use.

9
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:34,520
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey. There's another resource and Heinz, it's called What We Eat in America.

10
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,590
And I'm going to show you that website.

11
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:48,730
And then lastly, another resource for locating your dietary intake indicator could be using Washtenaw County hip data.

12
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:52,820
So if your community is located in Washtenaw County,

13
00:01:53,060 --> 00:02:00,710
you can use the Washtenaw County Health Improvement Program data for your dietary health indicator.

14
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:07,630
There are. Dietary related indicators for both adults and children.

15
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:16,750
So just depending on your target population, you can find indicators for both adults and children at the county level in Washtenaw.

16
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:23,020
I do want to just highlight that the data for Washtenaw County is older.

17
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,340
I think 2015 was is the most recent.

18
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,740
That's fine. If that's the most recent at county level, then that's four to present.

19
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,090
There's some other indicators here.

20
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:48,430
I'm going to actually leave this page so that I can actually show you what it looks like to access a dietary intake indicator through NHANES.

21
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,960
And I'll come back to these slides in a little bit, but.

22
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:09,340
That's the plan. So the link for NHANES is in your slides.

23
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:16,090
And when you use that link, you'll land at this Food Survey Research Group website.

24
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:26,490
So again, this is through the USDA. Specifically the RS, which is agriculture research.

25
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,790
I think it's agriculture research service. And the bottom line is.

26
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:38,770
Scroll down here. Now it does not spell it out very well, I think its agriculture research service.

27
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,670
Anyway, you'll note here we have what we eat.

28
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:50,200
This website represents descriptive data from our enhanced surveillance survey.

29
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,820
So I want to call your attention to data briefs, and that's what you'll select.

30
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:09,810
And there are a host of different dietary and nutrition related topics that is descriptive data from NHANES.

31
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,670
And so depending on your target population, depending on your interest,

32
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:22,020
you can take, you know, select one of these two as your dietary intake indicator.

33
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:25,050
So I'm going to go to an example here.

34
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,849
Beverage choices among children. So if you target population as children, this is a this is a nice indicator.

35
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:37,920
So I'm going to just select it. And each of these data briefs is a brief document.

36
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,610
But what's nice about it is that it provides the data in a very nicely formatted figure.

37
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:49,110
And so this is the percentage of children who consumed beverages.

38
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,210
And then we have here on the Y axis the different types of beverages.

39
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,780
Of course, what we're interested in are the sweetened beverages, because this is concerning.

40
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,680
We also have it stratified by ages.

41
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:12,180
And so you can see here very clearly what the proportion of children in the United States are consuming sweetened beverages now,

42
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,290
because this is through this is through a government website.

43
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,370
You can just do a screenshot of this figure.

44
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:25,080
I want you to create a new title for the figure,

45
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:37,950
but you would just screenshot this figure and insert it in your report and provide a source citation and provide a new title.

46
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,760
But it's very nice.

47
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:54,530
There's another one here that's broken down by race, ethnicity and you know, it's important when you can to present your data by race,

48
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,519
ethnicity so that we can determine if there's any disparities and so forth.

49
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,740
So. This is a very nice resource.

50
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:09,970
Just going to hop out. There's another one here. If your target population is older adults.

51
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,830
This is one called meeting the dietary guideline recommendations, older adults.

52
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:21,940
And if I select this and it also tells you which and Haines survey the data is from.

53
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:30,190
And this one very nicely has a figure that shows the proportion or percentage of older adults

54
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:35,560
in the U.S. that are achieving the dietary guideline food group intake recommendations.

55
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,520
So you can see here that we have some improvement.

56
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:47,740
Only 8% and only 15% are achieving the food group intake recommendations.

57
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,610
It's here. It's stratified by gender males and females and so forth.

58
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:06,540
So again, just take a screenshot of this figure and you can insert it in your report and use this as your dietary intake indicator.

59
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:16,320
Okay. So that's an option from NHANES.

60
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:33,880
I'm just going to revisit the slides very quickly. You can see here, this is the NHANES link.

61
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:43,090
This is a slide, just as a reminder to use the behavioral risk factor surveillance survey or system for adults.

62
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:53,910
You may. They were able to find some food intake indicators that you can include in your report.

63
00:07:54,450 --> 00:08:02,220
Likewise, there's the youth risk behavioral surveillance that might also have some food indicators, food intake indicators.

64
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:11,370
And so the link for getting either of those is at the bottom of the slide, very similar to what you use for the health data.

65
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:21,460
And here's also a slide referencing the Washtenaw County Health Improvement Plan survey data.

66
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:28,790
So this is county level data. For those of you who have a community that resides in Washtenaw County.

67
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:39,440
The next resource that I want to show you is the Food Environment Atlas.

68
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:49,900
This is a really. Great resource for those of you interested in food access, food systems and so forth.

69
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,790
So I'm going to walk you through this one.

70
00:08:52,090 --> 00:09:00,010
I'm going to hop out of the slides and actually bring it up on the website and show you because it's a clunky.

71
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:10,680
Atlas. And so I want to show you what steps to take so that you don't so that you have success in finding the indicators.

72
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:25,260
Okay. So this is through the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

73
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:33,750
And again, this is a great resource for information regarding food systems, food access and so forth.

74
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:38,340
So you want to scroll down and select the Enter the map button.

75
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,569
And you'll see a map. You don't want to select anything on the map yet.

76
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:57,320
You want to select your indicator first. So over here on the left, you'll want to select.

77
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,310
This map to display.

78
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:14,200
And when you just click that first button, it brings up a list of indicators access and proximity to grocery stores, store availability, restaurants.

79
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:19,450
If you go to the right here and use your bar on the right, you can scroll down.

80
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:25,290
There's food assistance, health and physical activity, local taxes and so forth.

81
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:31,600
There's quite a bit here. So for this example, I'm going to use access and proximity to grocery store.

82
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:41,460
So you want to select this. And within that is a quite a bit of this data.

83
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:49,310
Right. So there is access, low access to to the stores in 2010.

84
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,610
Well, I want the most recent the most recent is 2015.

85
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,700
And what I would like to know is the percent change.

86
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:05,340
Did we see an improvement going from 2010 to 2015?

87
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,540
So that's what this indicator is here. Low access to the store.

88
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:16,170
The percent change from when data was collected in 2010 to 2015.

89
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:28,070
So I'm going to select that. And when I select it, you can see that the top indicator is now populated by what I selected.

90
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:33,320
Low access to the store. Percent change from these two years.

91
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:37,790
So the next step is now to find my community.

92
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:43,040
So I'm going to select State.

93
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:50,570
Scroll down and select Michigan and it will zero in on the state.

94
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:58,580
And then you're going to select the county. So for the most part, you're going to only have county data.

95
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:04,610
I don't know if maybe there's some city data, but I don't think so.

96
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,190
I think mostly this is county. So I'm going to select I think this is Wayne County.

97
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:20,500
Yep. Here's Wayne County. And so now this is giving me information about access to a grocery store.

98
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:29,950
So you see here the first data point is low access to the store in 2010, and it's an actual population count.

99
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:36,460
That number doesn't mean a whole lot to me. I have no reference to it.

100
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,570
On the other hand, I have another data point low access to the store in 2015.

101
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:57,790
Again, population count. Well, I could manually determine if there has been an improvement in access to a store going from year 10 to 2010 2015.

102
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:04,840
But they do it for you. And this is where the percent change has been calculated.

103
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:16,930
And so you can see that there was a reduction in going from year ten to year 2015.

104
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:30,480
And that's good, right? So that means that the number the population that reported that they have low access to a grocery store declined in 2015.

105
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:40,150
So we see a a, you know, an 8% drop in those reporting that they had low access to a store.

106
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:51,170
So you can take this data and some students, you're only required to look at one indicator and this is a extra credit.

107
00:13:53,050 --> 00:13:57,870
But if you're in here gathering, you could even look up another indicator if you wanted to.

108
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:05,590
And so students will often create a small table that may just have two rows with two different indicators from the food outlets.

109
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:11,170
You don't have to. But again, this is a extra credit.

110
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:16,900
But it's important that all of you are aware that we have this food environment atlas.

111
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:24,400
And in that table, you would just present this information that in Wayne County.

112
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:29,380
And some students don't even bother with the table. They just present the information in the text.

113
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:36,610
I personally think even a small table, the data jumps out if it's in a table versus in the text.

114
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,800
Okay. If you wanted another or a different indicator, you would just.

115
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:48,760
I'm going to hit. Go back. Let's take you right out of the map.

116
00:14:52,000 --> 00:15:00,219
You want to select again and you might be interested in those that needed food assistance and so select that.

117
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:06,970
And then under this food assistance, there may be a number of sub indicators.

118
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:23,620
So maybe I'm interested in the number of participants in 2012 versus 2017 and the percent change in SNAP participants.

119
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:31,570
And so I might select this. And so you can see at the top now my new indicator is SNAP participants.

120
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:40,680
I go to Michigan. And I select my county.

121
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:56,160
And it tells us that there was a 16% drop in the number of individuals that utilized SNAP going from 2012 to 2017.

122
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:10,020
So again, this is a nice resource in terms of food access and food assistance and so forth.

123
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:32,450
So I'm going to this. There are slides that walk you through the process included in this slide deck.

124
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:39,480
And I'm going to scroll through those. I'm not going to take you to the Feeding America website.

125
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:46,320
It's pretty self-explanatory. Students don't usually have too much difficulty locating the data.

126
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:52,590
But if you go to Feeding America using the link, a map will come up a little bit lower in the page.

127
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:59,520
And then you with your mouse, you go over your state and then you hover over the.

128
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:11,410
County of interest, and it will provide county food insecurity data as well as some other indicators that are related to food insecurity.

129
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:17,890
So this is very useful for your food insecurity indicator.

130
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:28,760
That's required in your instructions. I did want to highlight this as a reminder you won't be using it for this assessment.

131
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:33,180
You don't need to because of Feeding America provides both county and state.

132
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,430
I think the most recent four feet from Feeding America is 2020.

133
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,170
If in your professional practice, you need up to date.

134
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:48,160
Food insecurity data. By state level.

135
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:56,080
Just a reminder that the Economic Research Service through the USDA provides this on a yearly basis.

136
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:02,560
Unfortunately, they don't post county level data.

137
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:11,950
On the Economic Research Service website. It's only state, but at least you would have up to date state data.

138
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:17,290
Again, if you need this in your professional practice, I just wanted to remind you about this resource.

139
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:37,250
And then lastly, in terms of data, those of you who are have breastfeeding as a topic or maybe your target population is women and so forth,

140
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:44,750
you'll want to access breastfeeding rates and include that in your nutrition section.

141
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:47,719
And I'm not going to walk you through it.

142
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:54,560
But again, this is usually straight forward for students that need to find breastfeeding rates and they now have a map by county.

143
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,709
I haven't gotten into this, but I assume you just highlight the state.

144
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:04,700
Although it looks like Michigan might be hatched out if they don't have breastfeeding rates at the county level,

145
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,750
then just present at the state level, you just present what you have.

146
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:15,620
If you can only present at the state level, see if they have national data so that you can make a comparison.

147
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:27,630
Okay. And then the last segment of your report is the Priorities recommendation section.

148
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:33,340
So I just want to go over this briefly. In this section.

149
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:41,860
Initially, the first part of the section, you're going to review key findings from your data section.

150
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:51,910
So from your demographic, economic, from the health and from the nutrition, you want to report any key findings that.

151
00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:06,090
You observed in the data from those sections, you might identify trends, you might identify subpopulations in which there is evidence of disparity.

152
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:20,070
Maybe there's a population that has a higher percentage of or higher rate of mortality due to chronic disease relative to another subpopulation.

153
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,840
Maybe there's evidence of higher unemployment in a subpopulation.

154
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:32,309
So the important point here is that you want to review key findings from each of the three data sections.

155
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:40,180
And the reason why you do this is because many community assessment reports are very long.

156
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:48,090
Oftentimes anywhere from 80 to over a hundred pages, maybe even 200 pages, depending on all the data that they collect.

157
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,470
These reports are all accessible to the public.

158
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:59,370
And oftentimes individuals may not read the report cover to cover.

159
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:12,500
Instead, they might go to the oftentimes they have a review at the very end of all the data to just review the key findings, the noteworthy findings.

160
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,250
And so if this is all they're going to read,

161
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:23,030
this is an opportunity for you to just highlight those key findings in your case from the three data sections.

162
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:32,820
So the first part of your priorities section is going to be a paragraph or two where you review the key findings.

163
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:44,160
The last segment of this section will be a paragraph in which you have a brief discussion of the priorities that you identified

164
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:54,210
in the data that the community will want to consider addressing to improve the nutrition and health of community members.

165
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,490
So the priorities may be that.

166
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:12,540
Maybe in this population there's very high mortality, you know, relative to the state level in respect to chronic disease.

167
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,740
Maybe your priority is that there is very low.

168
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:22,810
Fruit and vegetable consumption. In the population.

169
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:27,430
And maybe that population also happens to have a high chronic disease burden.

170
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:39,940
Maybe a priority might be that you've noticed that there's disparities in race, ethnic groups in terms of.

171
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:53,430
Health or nutrition. So you are highlighting in this section where you think the community might want to focus their attention.

172
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:02,030
Okay. So I want to stress that priorities should not be a discussion of potential interventions or programs.

173
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,610
This is not what this is about.

174
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:16,580
This section is simply addressing what you think, the way you're recommending the community review and consider in terms of.

175
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:28,420
A program or an intervention that they will want to address with a program or intervention.

176
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,450
So the next slide has examples of priorities.

177
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:39,320
Maybe you identify that there's based on the trends in the data, that there's poor food access in the community.

178
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:45,650
Maybe you, but the data that you have, you found that there is dietary concerns.

179
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:51,230
There's evidence of chronic disease. Maybe there's data gaps.

180
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:57,950
Maybe there is not sufficient information about other subpopulations.

181
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:09,830
So an example might be with the morbidity data, the fact that it's not stratified by race and ethnicity and so forth.

182
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,260
So you can highlight that as a priority that they might want to consider.

183
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:21,350
Doing a county level or city level survey to get more information.

184
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:25,160
Again, there might be evidences of evidence, of disparities.

185
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:33,200
Maybe that there is a particular subgroup that has a high unemployment, low income, social determining concern,

186
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:39,170
and you want to highlight that as a potential priority that the community may want to focus on.

187
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:45,020
Maybe there's low breastfeeding rates in the community relative to national data.

188
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:49,490
So again, the priority section is where you.

189
00:24:50,620 --> 00:25:03,850
Provide them with recommendations of concerns in the community that the community might want to address with an intervention or program.

190
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:12,580
But I just want to stress again that the priority section should not be a discussion about actual interventions or programs.

191
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:18,380
Okay. And that's all I have for the nutrition.

192
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,540
Guidance as well as the priorities section of your report.

193
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,370
So be sure to reach out to me or Liz. Should you have any questions?
