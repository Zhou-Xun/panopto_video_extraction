1
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:16,679
As a brief outline, we will talk about the traditional data driven approaches to identifying confounding

2
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:22,679
as opposed to a structural approach, which uses directed a cyclic graphs or DAGs.

3
00:00:22,679 --> 00:00:27,679
We will talk through the three structural criteria that we use for identifying confounders.

4
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:35,679
DAG rules for identifying confounding, and I will give a quick definition and introduction to identifying confounding as the

5
00:00:35,679 --> 00:00:41,679
non-collapsibility of effect estimates across strata of the confounding variable.

6
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:52,679
And we will get into this with a worked example in the live lecture. So identifying, confounding, using data driven approaches.

7
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:53,679
Traditionally,

8
00:00:53,679 --> 00:01:02,679
there are data driven approaches that have been used to identify confounding where we use statistics to examine associations in the study data.

9
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,679
These are these include, primarily, stepwise regression and the change in estimate approach.

10
00:01:07,679 --> 00:01:16,679
I'm not going to teach you the details of how to conduct these approaches. You can read about them in the textbooks or in other readings.

11
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:18,679
Essentially, though, in a stepwise regression,

12
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:27,679
you would throw all of your suspected confounding variables into a regression model and remove those not associated with the outcome,

13
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:36,679
usually based on some threshold for statistical significance, such as p being greater than zero point zero five, according to a stepwise fashion.

14
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:44,679
In the change in estimate approach, same thing, you would throw all of your suspected confounding variables into a model and then retain

15
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:50,679
those whose removal changes the exposure outcome affect estimate by more than 10 percent.

16
00:01:50,679 --> 00:01:53,679
And so this approach uses the change

17
00:01:53,679 --> 00:02:02,679
in estimate of more than 10 percent of the exposure outcome relationship by the confounding variable as the rule to identifying confounding.

18
00:02:02,679 --> 00:02:08,679
However, these are not the ideal ways to identify confounding,

19
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:13,679
because confounding is about causal relationships and thus it is best to identify confounding

20
00:02:13,679 --> 00:02:19,679
by using causal relationships instead of arbitrary rules based on statistical significance,

21
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:24,679
which is what stepwise regression and the change in estimate approach use.

22
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:31,679
So a structural approach to confounding would use the observed data structure combined with a priori

23
00:02:31,679 --> 00:02:40,679
theory or knowledge from previous research about the suspected data structure to identify confounding.

24
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:51,679
And often we do this using DAGs to help us draw out our assumptions about the structure of the underlying data.

25
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:57,679
So the three structural criteria for identifying confounding, are that a confounding factor,

26
00:02:57,679 --> 00:03:03,679
must: one, be a cause of the outcome under study; two, be associated with the exposure

27
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:07,679
under study in the source population that we are studying.

28
00:03:07,679 --> 00:03:12,679
And three, it must not be caused by the exposure or the disease.

29
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:20,679
So let's get into each of these in a little bit more depth, so for criteria, one, the confounding factor must be a cause of the outcome.

30
00:03:20,679 --> 00:03:25,679
It may also be a surrogate or proxy or indirect cause of the disease outcome.

31
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:33,679
So as an example here, we might use household income as a surrogate for a range of social factors that might be correlated with income.

32
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:38,679
So we think income represents a lot of other things than just income on its own.

33
00:03:38,679 --> 00:03:44,679
Another good example is using level of education as a proxy for literacy.

34
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:50,679
And so here we use prior theory or previous observed evidence and not necessarily the data

35
00:03:50,679 --> 00:03:56,679
itself to determine the relationship of the suspected confounding factor to the outcome.

36
00:03:56,679 --> 00:04:03,679
Here is where reading and conducting literature reviews is extremely important.

37
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:08,679
Two, the confounding factor must be associated with the exposure in the source population.

38
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:12,679
And this one, we can actually generally identify directly from our data.

39
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:17,679
But it varies according to whether you are doing a cohort study or a case control study.

40
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:25,679
So in a cohort study, the cohort itself is the source population. And therefore, this relationship can be determined from the observed study data.

41
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:29,679
In a case control study, the controls are selected from the source population.

42
00:04:29,679 --> 00:04:37,679
However, the control group needs to be very large and have no selection, bias or measurement error in the outcome or exposure.

43
00:04:37,679 --> 00:04:43,679
In order to accurately reflect the true association in the source population.

44
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:54,679
And I would also say that external information here can be used when it's available or prior knowledge about the exposure and outcome relationship.

45
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:59,679
And finally, number three, the factor cannot be caused by the exposure or the disease.

46
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:05,679
And I think this is really straightforward and intuitive. If we get this wrong, we can get it wrong in two common ways.

47
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:13,679
So one, being the factor that we think is a confounder is actually an intermediate on the causal pathway between the exposure and the outcome.

48
00:05:13,679 --> 00:05:20,679
And we call this a mediator. The second way in which we can get this one wrong is where the factor that we think is

49
00:05:20,679 --> 00:05:26,679
a confounder is actually a common outcome of both the exposure and outcome of interest.

50
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:32,679
And we call this a collider. So let's talk through each of these scenarios.

51
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:39,679
So here we're using an example of our research question being about the effects of maternal smoking on infant mortality.

52
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:47,679
And we have low birth weight as a covariate that has been measured in our study population.

53
00:05:47,679 --> 00:05:55,679
This dag depicts low birth weight being on the causal pathway from maternal smoking to infant mortality.

54
00:05:55,679 --> 00:06:02,679
In this case, low birth weight is what we call a mediator, and you can see that this is clear if you look at the directions of the black arrows.

55
00:06:02,679 --> 00:06:09,679
So maternal smoking flows into low birth weight and then low birth weight flows into infant mortality.

56
00:06:09,679 --> 00:06:16,679
This is what a DAG for mediation looks like. If we were to run a regression model for the effect of

57
00:06:16,679 --> 00:06:21,679
maternal smoking on infant mortality and we statistically adjust for low birth weight,

58
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:28,679
then what we've done is in fact referred to as over-adjustment because we are basically removing

59
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:34,679
the effects of maternal smoking on infant mortality that operate through low birth weight.

60
00:06:34,679 --> 00:06:42,679
So, we are, in this case, we would not be estimating the total effect of maternal smoking on infant mortality.

61
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:51,679
We would be estimating the direct effect of maternal smoking on infant mortality while excluding its indirect effects through low birth weight.

62
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:55,679
And if we are trying to estimate the total effect, then we've underestimated it.

63
00:06:55,679 --> 00:06:59,218
And that is why adjusting for a mediator is referred to as over adjustment.

64
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:10,215
And this would be the other way in which we can get appropriate confounder control wrong.

65
00:07:10,215 --> 00:07:17,215
So in this example, the research question is about the effects of dietary sugar on fluoridation.

66
00:07:17,215 --> 00:07:21,215
And if we were to condition on tooth decay,

67
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:26,215
we could actually induce a spurious association between dietary sugar and fluoridation

68
00:07:26,215 --> 00:07:31,215
because we have opened up a backdoor path between dietary sugar and fluoridation,

69
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:34,215
which operates through tooth decay.

70
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:42,215
This example is really straightforward because it is obvious that dietary sugar leads to tooth decay and fluoridation prevents tooth decay.

71
00:07:42,215 --> 00:07:45,215
And so these are common outcomes of the exposure and outcome.

72
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:54,215
And here we call tooth decay a collider because the arrows coming out from dietary sugar and fluoridation collide at tooth decay.

73
00:07:54,215 --> 00:07:59,215
What we would want to do is actually just not adjust our model for tooth decay at all.

74
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:04,215
And we would want to leave it alone.

75
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:11,215
So confounding arises because of how structurally the variables that we have measured in our study population are related to each other.

76
00:08:11,215 --> 00:08:17,215
So either they are naturally related to each other or in terms of how they become

77
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:22,215
related to each other after an investigator has manipulated these relationships either

78
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:27,215
through statistical adjustment or matching and whether matching occurs at the design

79
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:33,215
stage or analysis phase or conditioning or restricting our sample on a specific variable.

80
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:36,215
So, for example, in the previous example that we looked at,

81
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:42,215
the investigator could have restricted the sample to include only people who have tooth decay.

82
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:45,215
And that restriction would be a form of conditioning on the collider,

83
00:08:45,215 --> 00:08:53,215
which would induce that spurious association between dietary sugar and fluoridation.

84
00:08:53,215 --> 00:08:58,215
So a big question here is how do we know what the proper structural relationships are?

85
00:08:58,215 --> 00:09:06,215
Well, to be honest, we often can't and we have to make assumptions that are based on theory and previous knowledge.

86
00:09:06,215 --> 00:09:10,215
And we use DAGS to do this. DAGS are not a method of data analysis.

87
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:15,215
They are used to help us identify confounders based on the assumptions we are willing to make.

88
00:09:15,215 --> 00:09:21,215
A lot of people think that DAGs represent the truth, and they it's important to note they do not represent the truth.

89
00:09:21,215 --> 00:09:27,215
They represent our assumptions based on the best available knowledge that we have.

90
00:09:27,215 --> 00:09:34,215
And one thing that's useful here is that DAGs help us to detect the assumed temporal structure of the relationships between our factors.

91
00:09:34,215 --> 00:09:38,215
So they help us map out the timing in which these variables occur.

92
00:09:38,215 --> 00:09:44,215
And we know that temporality is a very important criteria for causality from Bradford Hill.

93
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:50,215
And so understanding the temporality can help us think through whether or not a factor is a confounder,

94
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:59,215
a mediator or a collider of a given exposure outcome relationship.

95
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:08,215
So here's an example. Let's say that our research question is the effects of low income on diabetes and ideally we want to achieve

96
00:10:08,215 --> 00:10:14,215
exchangeability of people who have low income versus non low income conditional on having a mother with diabetes.

97
00:10:14,215 --> 00:10:23,215
And we can see here that this is, again, the basic DAG for confounding where the variable W, mother has diabetes,

98
00:10:23,215 --> 00:10:29,215
has arrows going into low income and diabetes. So we think that

99
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:36,215
having a mother who has diabetes is a confounder of the income-diabetes relationship when we adjust for a confounder,

100
00:10:36,215 --> 00:10:42,215
whether that is through restriction, standardization or a statistical adjustment.

101
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:49,215
And we will talk about these methods in the live lecture. We say that we have achieved conditional exchangeability.

102
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:53,215
And so we use DAGs to help us achieve conditional exchange ability,

103
00:10:53,215 --> 00:10:58,215
because the DAG helps us map out which backdoor path from the exposure to the

104
00:10:58,215 --> 00:11:03,215
outcome need to be blocked in order to achieve conditional exchangeability.

105
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:05,215
If this is confusing, please don't worry,

106
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:11,215
because we will go over a DAGs again in the live lecture and there will be a whole session dedicated to causal inference

107
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:19,215
and DAGs coming up very soon. So really briefly, I want to go through the DAG rules for identifying confounding.

108
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:22,215
OK. So what we're trying to do here is block backdoor paths,

109
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:31,215
which are any path that can arise between the exposure and the outcome that are not the causal path, which is indicated by the question mark here.

110
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:34,215
And the backdoor path can have arrows going in any direction.

111
00:11:34,215 --> 00:11:44,215
It actually doesn't matter which directions the arrows go in with respect to opening up a backdoor path.

112
00:11:44,215 --> 00:11:53,215
So this figure here shows the standard DAG for confounding, wher conditioning on a common cause of the exposure and outcome,

113
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,215
which of course is the confounder, closes the backdoor path.

114
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:04,215
This DAG a little bit more complicated because it shows us a mediator of the effect of mother having diabetes on diabetes,

115
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:11,215
which is unhealthy nutrition. So it doesn't matter if there is a mediator of the effect of the confounder on the outcome.

116
00:12:11,215 --> 00:12:18,215
If we adjust for the confounder, we close the backdoor path and the effect of A on Y is identified.

117
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:24,215
However, there still might be unmeasured confounders that can open up about another backdoor path,

118
00:12:24,215 --> 00:12:29,215
even if we close a backdoor path through the measured confounders.

119
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:33,215
So here we have an unmeasured variable indicated by the letter U.

120
00:12:33,215 --> 00:12:38,215
Which is socioeconomic status. So we've closed one backdoor path, through

121
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:44,215
mother has diabetes, but the backdoor path through socioeconomic status is still open.

122
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:52,215
And the purpose of showing this here is just to indicate that it is so important not to forget about unmeasured confounding.

123
00:12:52,215 --> 00:12:57,215
The existence of a collider will block the backdoor path, and that's actually a good thing.

124
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:07,215
So we never want to condition on a collider. And so here the arrows between W2, unhealthy nutrition, and W1, mother has

125
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:16,215
diabetes have reversed. And we can see now that mother has diabetes has gone from being a confounder of the A Y relationship to a collider

126
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:22,215
of the A Y relationship. In this case, we actually just want to leave that variable alone.

127
00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:29,215
We don't want to touch it. We just want to leave it. And the effect of A on Y here is identified.

128
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:34,215
But conditioning on mother has diabetes, if it is a collider, will open the backdoor path.

129
00:13:34,215 --> 00:13:39,215
And that's bad. And so that's why the directions of the arrows are actually very important

130
00:13:39,215 --> 00:13:47,215
with respect to distinguishing a collider versus distinguishing a confounder.

131
00:13:47,215 --> 00:13:56,215
Another tricky thing here that can happen is that conditioning on a descendent or an outcome of a collider will open the back door or path.

132
00:13:56,215 --> 00:14:03,215
So this is a tricky one to watch out for. So in this example, we have a new variable called W3, which is medical care.

133
00:14:03,215 --> 00:14:11,215
And here we can see that W1, mother has diabetes, is related to Y, diabetes, through its effects on medical care.

134
00:14:11,215 --> 00:14:16,215
So here a medical care is a mediator of the effect of W1 on Y.

135
00:14:16,215 --> 00:14:25,215
And so if we adjust for medical care and maybe we've done this because we think medical care is a confounder of the A Y relationship,

136
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:31,215
but it's in fact not, it ultimately is a descendant of this collider, which is W1.

137
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:39,215
Then we have opened up the collider pathway and the effect of A on Y is not identified.

138
00:14:39,215 --> 00:14:44,215
And finally, I want to introduce this definition of non-collapsibility

139
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:48,215
before we get into it in more depth in the live lecture.

140
00:14:48,215 --> 00:14:58,215
So when we have confounding, we should see that the association of the exposure and outcome is different across strata of the confounder,

141
00:14:58,215 --> 00:15:08,215
and these stratum-specific associations between the exposure and the outcome should differ from the crude or non-stratified association.

142
00:15:08,215 --> 00:15:13,215
When this happens, we say that the data are not collapsible and confounding is present.

143
00:15:13,215 --> 00:15:19,215
So, for example, if we have if a confounding variable of a given exposure outcome relationship which is,

144
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:22,215
let's say, smoking, which takes on values of zero and one,

145
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:27,215
we would want to stratify out our study population according to their smoking status,

146
00:15:27,215 --> 00:15:32,215
and then we would estimate the exposure outcome relationship across levels of smoking status.

147
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:37,215
So for all people where smoking status equals zero and then for all people where smoking status equals one.

148
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:41,215
And we would compare those the magnitudes of those exposure outcome relationship to

149
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:48,215
see if they differ from the crude association across all levels of smoking status.

150
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:52,215
And we will go over this and work through examples in the live lecture.

151
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:53,215
And that's the end of Part Two.

152
00:15:53,215 --> 00:16:00,215
The next is methods to control for confounding, which we will go over in the lives Zoom session on Thursday, October 8th.

153
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:02,206
From ten thirty to twelve o'clock Eastern Time.
