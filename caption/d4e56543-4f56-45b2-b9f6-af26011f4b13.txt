1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:03,900
Well. So, I mean, here's a way, doctor voter made a point about that.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:10,740
I remember what it was about, you know, about Facebook and it brings us together.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:21,850
Right. But as you can add to that, the assumption is what could potentially work for Facebook, could also work for other social media platforms.

4
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:33,640
So the idea would be, are there principles about the engagement in the content, the videos that people post, the use of a discussion or chat function?

5
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,510
So even if you look across Tic TAC, Snapchat, Facebook, etc., there's enough of a similarity.

6
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:45,150
Or at least this was what the Amazon was talking about to suggest that if it's going to work for Facebook,

7
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:52,170
we can probably figure out a way to make it work for Instagram or for whatever else kind of comes up on the horizon.

8
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:56,370
But I think it's actually pretty important because of all things, you know,

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,950
classroom setting has stayed constant for, geez, what, 60 years, 70 years, a hundred years, who knows?

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,299
But social media just seems like it's it's on to the next.

11
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,120
I don't know how many folks in this room have a Facebook account or use it regularly, but I bet you know your point.

12
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:18,419
Adolescents are using it. They're using something very different. And so you start to see the age difference innovation skew.

13
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,660
But then if you're depending on which population, that's the most interest to you,

14
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,720
maybe Facebook does make sense, but if you are looking for adolescents.

15
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:35,250
So yeah, I think I see one very open and receptive Carolines question about getting involved in the research.

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,640
I was there reach out to and if if you don't have it on there I think it's EA Boehner

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,170
I'll send it I'll put it in the announcement but feel free to reach out to her.

18
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,520
Also reach out with questions. She'll respond to you. I bet you within an hour or two, just very,

19
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,710
always very willing to to work with folks and talk a little bit about their work and that group in general,

20
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:03,360
the addiction center Marine Wolf and some of the other folks that you're she mentioned very productive, lots of different kind of work going on.

21
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,649
There's other folks in psychiatry that are doing sort of a range of different interventions,

22
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:19,140
some following like let's see here what there's one terrible Bill Lewis is doing, one on how people respond after a sports injury.

23
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:28,380
So you have all these athletes that get hurt, get prescription opioids, and then there's this potential for dependance to develop or whatever.

24
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,110
So how do you engage with youth who are experiencing this necessary level of treatment?

25
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:40,379
But then you have unused medication or you have the possibility for abuse or selling or whatever else it might be.

26
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:46,110
So just a couple of examples of a very robust area over in medicine.

27
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:54,870
So so I see here we have a few different things that we can do within our last 45 minutes or so here.

28
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,960
We can debrief some of Erin's presentation.

29
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:04,290
We can go back to our head in the Matrix example here.

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:14,219
She took some so some of the onus off of me because I saw in her presentation like some of these statistics and stuff, she had the 2020 version.

31
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:20,040
So I apologize for not being up to date on it's the same data source so it's good to have.

32
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:27,029
But we can we can look a little bit at the data. But how about just first blush reactions to Aaron's presentation?

33
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:30,390
What was going through your mind? What were you thinking about this year?

34
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,500
I thought about the relationship to like like sex education.

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:42,390
Like so like it can be taught like abstinence only. That's not even about trying to teach like youth about like sex.

36
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:48,150
And like, I'm wondering, like, I did want to ask if I felt like it might have been too much of a question,

37
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,290
like it's her focus is her work with no more on like prevention,

38
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,600
like stopping the use of substances or is it more on making it safer and less people

39
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,870
using them to dangerous amounts because like those are very different things.

40
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,109
But like, yeah, right. So I mean, I think you saw the population and what she's most interested in.

41
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,930
There's a kind of selected individuals that are kind of at higher risk.

42
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:22,350
And so there's that piece that are now the messaging that that you might provide to those individuals could be.

43
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,850
And I think you're right in that it's not an abstinence only, but I think it's the goal.

44
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:35,910
Most of it is trying to just escalate from consistent use, you know, relapse or other kind of indicators that there's a disorder versus.

45
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:44,330
I guess, mortgage holders. So tell me a little bit more about that.

46
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:52,849
Yeah. So I was I was thinking like because like I think a lot of people are told, don't do this, don't do that, don't use drugs.

47
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:56,450
All drugs are bad for you. Don't have sex, sex, sex is bad for you.

48
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:05,180
And both of those things are not they don't allow the person to know more about why it's dangerous or what's going on with it.

49
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,750
What can they do when it comes to those things?

50
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,920
Is it really that bad? Even like I know.

51
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:19,800
Like, that's a question. I got to go. It can't be that bad. And then they could try something and figure out for themselves.

52
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:26,599
Yeah. Like for them. And it's just like, I think what is the environment around those conversations?

53
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,299
Like, it's such a big problem and like how users of substances work for it.

54
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm wondering if that's played in the fact because people like from place,

55
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,030
like people who are told like abstinence only, do you tend to engage in like riskier behavior?

56
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:48,709
Is that what I was like? I remember like being like reading about an undergrad in the UK is just like interesting.

57
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:55,760
Like what's the difference for kids like for like high schoolers were taught like drugs like drugs are

58
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:04,370
dangerous for candid interviews you like I am not an educator so I don't know how do you teach about drugs?

59
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:10,820
How do you teach like safe drug use? Because like other countries do have a way different discussion.

60
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:17,630
And like, I think like there has to be like a fear tactic when teaching like these like hotter topics in American life.

61
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:25,219
I guess that's what I'm just like, okay, so how do you when one of the things that's kind of nice about Aaron's work,

62
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,379
so to take your example and you're like,

63
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:37,280
Yeah, this was now gosh, about ten, 15 years ago, there is a was an article about an abstinence prevention program that was I think it's in Minnesota.

64
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,990
And it was kind of interesting. They just did it was just going to be abstinence first.

65
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:48,620
No offense. And then kind of try to examine the facts, then ask the people how they didn't ask the adolescents,

66
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:51,620
how are you feeling about this material and whether that's the appropriate message?

67
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:59,040
Part of what we're hearing was talking about it is doing some of the acceptability, feasibility answer, asking some of those questions first,

68
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:05,510
then engaging people who might receive the content in terms of what this how they respond to it, how they communicate, communicated.

69
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:12,470
So they're starting to get to some of your questions in terms of here, we're going to invest all this time and energy to provide an intervention.

70
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,560
But if at the very kind of foundational London level, people are not going to listen to this because you're telling me that it's going to be,

71
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:28,189
you know, drugs and end of question and story that would probably have lower visibility that would probably lead to this engagement.

72
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:34,220
So some of those numbers that she's talking about suggest that, however, that they're approaching, they're a kind of motivator.

73
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,389
Motivational interview, the interview script and the messaging that they're providing seems like it's something that's scalable.

74
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:49,060
Seems like it's something that's resonating with their population and. That's a big deal.

75
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:55,830
These things are not easy to pull off. You need to try to make a case for why you should be funded.

76
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,550
It's just an idea, and it's not even to get to a result.

77
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:06,020
We're going to invest hundreds of thousands and maybe even millions of dollars into an idea that might not even work.

78
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:09,320
But we're just going to try to figure out if it could work.

79
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,120
And I think it's a it's a leap of faith on your funders side.

80
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,229
But at the same time,

81
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:21,890
I think that's where that theory that we talked about might lead to some of the behavioral change ideas that we could probably propose.

82
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:30,660
You need to have that stuff in place to inform your intervention, to inform your approach to anything, employing a good methodological design RCD.

83
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:36,200
All that stuff is in place to suggest that even though this is a big leap of faith for you,

84
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:41,330
even though this is a huge investment for something that we're not even worth, this is why we think it could.

85
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,170
This is why we think it should give us a chance to give us the opportunity.

86
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,690
So, yes, I mean, we we like to jump to the quantitative results.

87
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:56,630
And, I mean, whatever we like to do, jump to the asked results. We like to go down to the question of what's the outcome variable.

88
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,660
But there are spaces for art here.

89
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,229
There are spaces for learning from what has worked in other fields or other areas of substance abuse even, or substance use.

90
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:10,250
That could suggest why this could be a useful intervention.

91
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,570
Well, what else to reveal here or respond to?

92
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:22,280
Yeah, I was just thinking about what might be the benefits and barriers of the intervention approach itself.

93
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:28,760
Mm hmm. So, like she was saying that social media, like the use of social media for your mentoring,

94
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,900
gives you a higher reach and it can be implemented into daily life.

95
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,150
But I was thinking of what are the limitations of like representation?

96
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:42,380
Like what happens if people don't have access to the way, you know, internet or whatever?

97
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:49,010
Like, wouldn't there be a disadvantage of like telemedicine or like social media based motivational interviewing?

98
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:54,230
Yeah. Yeah, we got responses to that kind of.

99
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,969
Yeah, sure. Similarly, I was thinking about my or my experience with my usually in person.

100
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:10,820
So the fact that I go over chat and I'm like, you're missing body language in that, and how does that affect the intervention itself?

101
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:17,030
Like, what did we use, face time or something like that? If you're training for things like that.

102
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,400
So. Yeah.

103
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,790
And a couple of comments about the modality that they're choosing to use.

104
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,909
What is it going to mean? What population do you potentially miss if you move there?

105
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,370
And she did. She provided a graph of what percentage of people have cell phones and Internet access.

106
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,660
And then you have this drop down to the people who are using different forms of social media.

107
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,319
But you're absolutely right in that there probably are populations or sub populations

108
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,170
that are not going to be represented within your sample or your population. So when we talk about generalizing any sort of findings here,

109
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:53,700
this applies to a fairly specific peer set of individuals who are actively using Facebook or who meet some of the other criteria.

110
00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:01,620
So the population and the external validity gets smaller and smaller and smaller when we really think about who is exposed to this.

111
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,930
And then they told us how they felt. And then to the.

112
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,570
Ever get to the point. Sit in the chair for a year and then in actual.

113
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:19,890
Yeah. The engagement, the interaction of the mind and that goes down.

114
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:23,760
So when you talk to cameras in a guy like you, when you talk to other folks who do this for a living,

115
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:29,700
can you have the same sort of quality interactions via a chat that you would get if we're both in the same room?

116
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:37,130
And is that something that needs to be tested, or is that an assumption that you can make and assume that some method variance is not going to mean

117
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:43,200
it's not going to have a huge results or a huge impact on what we might ultimately observe and say.

118
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,929
This is this could be working because if a trial does fail, it might be just as easy to fall back and say,

119
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,940
well, if we did this in person, we would have had this issue. But then back to the external point,

120
00:11:54,060 --> 00:12:00,240
what's more likely are you going to have people who are going to engage increasingly with telemedicine, with some form of online approach?

121
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:06,940
And so we do need to have adaptable interventions as a medicine, or we can meet you wherever you are in the world and.

122
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:19,820
I forget. Sorry. Okay I should going to said he ended up falling during COVID and how that impacts not necessarily from like the mental

123
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:26,450
health impacts of Pokemon but like the general like ability to use the internet as you see there in your own home,

124
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:30,380
during work from home and then having access to this chat a lot more.

125
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:34,790
I think it's been great to we have our phones, but like when you're in the office or something like that,

126
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:40,400
like would you be able to just like and be with this chat as freely as with like during different orders?

127
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,930
Gretchen. What do you think? I'm all ears and will be really interesting to see and do it now.

128
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:54,130
Now I think the world will go back to normal, but like, I don't know.

129
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:58,180
I didn't really have that experience during filming because I work from home.

130
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:02,920
So I don't know. I don't really know that experience. Yeah.

131
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:10,959
Yeah. I mean, I think just also building up your point like some I think in some cases work from home means

132
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:15,580
that there are people in your house that you might not want to know that you're on too.

133
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:23,290
And so like there's that, you know, there's the variable of like, did you if you do this, if you're at work and then there's also the variable,

134
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:30,129
could you usually do this when you're at home and your family members are around constantly and you don't want you know,

135
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,400
this is not something that you are ready to talk to people about as well.

136
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:41,440
You know, there's a hint. Yeah, I'm trying to sort through because it's kind of interesting how much of this was in relation

137
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,020
to privacy and kind of thinking back to like this doctor came to talk to us about it,

138
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,710
you know, using social media, creating online spaces.

139
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,420
Would that maybe encourage individuals who don't feel comfortable necessarily?

140
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:06,280
I mean, either in-person or doing engaging in this type of research, whether it be intervention or just purely depression?

141
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:16,290
Would this create a more private. You feel more at risk because you are assuring them that their participation is secure online.

142
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,710
Right. Yeah. These are good questions you're saying about how you're going to do this work.

143
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,700
What are some of the barriers and opportunities that either one of these modalities might have to offer?

144
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,730
Anything I mentioned in the slides before. When we work with like violence interventions in Haiti,

145
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:39,930
it's very different to talk to a 16 year old when their parents sitting in a room versus when they say when they're human, a child is not.

146
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,630
That's very observable and very tangible when we're in person.

147
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,960
It's less so. Very much less so. If we are engaging well via zoom when they can be at their house.

148
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:52,170
Somebody could do same. There's just general privacy concern.

149
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,459
There is still a fair amount of stigma associated with substance use.

150
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:03,690
And so what that means and whether you folks are comfortable disclosing that in front of family, friends or in a public space, whatever that might be.

151
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:12,629
But, you know, those studies are all part of the things that you hope to start to tease out and understand as this intervention and why,

152
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:16,110
even though we so often jump right to the the efficacy trial,

153
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,810
is my intervention effective having a little bit this pre-work when you had the time, the resources is great.

154
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:26,090
So it's almost like, hey, other sorts of injury spaces.

155
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,040
This is how it should be done. This is really how it should be done.

156
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:34,140
Starting with a needs assessment, starting with a theory building, starting with the pro and the implementation fidelity trials,

157
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:42,030
then jumping to the efficacy trials, but then thinking about how much work had to come before Arron's interventions even for these to happen.

158
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,460
Right. And how much did that mean that they were able to convince their funders to say, let's do some of this first?

159
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:52,430
I mean, go with the confounder for sure. It confounded everything for the last three years.

160
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:57,269
There's just no way you're going to be able to say, well, holding over the side, this is what's happening.

161
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:04,170
But, you know, are there still is there still something to learn within those results that could still be valid,

162
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:08,730
you know, in the future, other things.

163
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:16,610
Yeah. I, I felt reading this study that it was innovative.

164
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:25,309
Um, it seemed like it's kind of filling the gap for people who don't feel like they have clinically significant substance abuse problems,

165
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:30,860
or, like, maybe they're not even abusing it. I guess that's where the prevention side of this comes in.

166
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,890
And with her being a psychologist, it makes sense that she'd be interested in trying to.

167
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:45,440
Catch them before it's a full fledged right. It's like especially the study.

168
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:50,380
Right. So and it's relatively cheap to do.

169
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:54,520
Also, like their advertising costs were pretty low. Yeah. Facebook.

170
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,800
So I think it's really awesome. Actually, I'd love to get more.

171
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:04,990
But. Yeah.

172
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:11,470
So do reach out to her, but. So a couple of things in there.

173
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,920
One, you heard you heard the cost benefit analysis. Did you hear that?

174
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,730
You hear that? Did you get it? I think that's great. That's so good.

175
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:25,480
Right. We need to understand of all the ways that we can directory sources, you kind of said it wouldn't do exactly what was stated at the end.

176
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,920
There are lots of different ways that we can direct resources towards injury, which is a huge field.

177
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,950
Lots of different types of injury. How are you going to try to do this in 20?

178
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:37,780
We design interventions that have low implementation costs or lower implementation costs.

179
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,610
Scalability costs in ways that can affect the most people possible.

180
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,040
We've seen some time, again, that prevention saves money.

181
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:49,600
Right. Right. So more emphasis is definitely.

182
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:56,600
On that area of substance abuse. Sure. But I want each of you to think about this, too.

183
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:01,070
You can choose to engage in these spaces in many different ways.

184
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:09,710
Aaron is talking about focusing their efforts on those who have higher risk for substance use disorder before they hit.

185
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,160
So, you know, kind of a clinical definition of substance use disorder.

186
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:16,970
That might not be your space. Your space might be.

187
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,300
I want to work with people who have a substance use disorder.

188
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,569
I want to work very far upstream on the prevention side.

189
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:29,420
And that's where my focus is going to be. Rarely in our professional world can we try to accomplish everything.

190
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:37,219
So trying to identify those populations that are most of the cases that are most critical in our eyes are

191
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:43,340
going to be most receptive to our interventions are the way that we're engaging with them is is important.

192
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,910
And then also thinking about this injury area. Period.

193
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:56,150
Opioids, alcohol, cannabis, to a certain certain extent, all have these kind of defined substance use disorder designations.

194
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:03,020
If you have somebody who is messing around with fentanyl or Carfentanil or some of these other synthetic opioid,

195
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:08,270
you might not get to that selected stage. It might be trying it out a little bit.

196
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,719
Now, near fatalities. We're looking for naloxone interventions.

197
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,120
We're looking for ways because it's so potent, there's so many ways that somebody can unintentionally overdose.

198
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:23,420
Right. So there might not be this space for let's try to catch it before we turn it to a disorder or a consistent use.

199
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:30,020
It's we need to stop the use before it happens because it is so likely to lead to a fatality.

200
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,500
And how do we have those kind of conversations or what do those interventions look like

201
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:39,340
that might be different from a marijuana intervention or whatever that can emerge.

202
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:46,270
So it's not two to wait one more than the other, but the types of ways that you're engaging the populations for whom this is most applicable.

203
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,890
All those kind of questions, all those kind of questions.

204
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:54,710
And I know I said every single class, but you have to ask yourself that whole litany of questions each time you say,

205
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:02,960
this is what I want to devote my attention to my times. How am I going to reduce injury in a very specific way with a very specific population?

206
00:20:03,230 --> 00:20:07,920
It doesn't have to be myopic. At the same time, probably has to be somewhat tailored.

207
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,090
If you're going to be as effective as possible. Other thoughts last night, closing thoughts about Dr. Boner.

208
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:21,070
That's good stuff. I promise you. That's reading stuff.

209
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:29,470
And, you know, kind of a cross across the country this that teens are not only, again, had a lot of productivity,

210
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:35,260
but they are helping to craft the science around how NIH is focusing on these problems.

211
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:40,809
There were kind of informed other interventions. I even think when I when I hear them talking, all right.

212
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:48,760
So if I know that people and adolescents using social media will post things about guns and violence and stuff like that,

213
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,049
how can I engage with them in a way that talks to me,

214
00:20:53,050 --> 00:21:00,100
that utilizes my principles that might get to have to start a conversation about why are we fascinated with firearms?

215
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:04,140
Why do we want to? Why are you posting things about shooting over school?

216
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:09,760
Like, how can we begin to tend to identify those individuals before we go from ideation to a behavior?

217
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,990
Right. Is there something I can learn from over here, even though it's a completely different space?

218
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:20,560
How about this? You guys want to do this area? I know you spent some time doing it.

219
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:25,020
All right, I you're in my graphic here. I think you guys have one.

220
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:30,130
So the point was that the idea was we're living in an intersection of freedom.

221
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:40,030
We seen as heads matrix. And what you'd hope is if you can start to fill in some of these cells, like what is what is leading to the injury,

222
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:48,309
what's happening at the time of and after the injury that would allow us to potentially identified intervention, you know, for added points.

223
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:53,860
Can we think about anything that we learn from Aaron that could apply to some of these cases?

224
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,630
So how are you certain and populate this matrix? I don't really care what you know.

225
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:03,970
If you start top left and go down to the bottom right or you take the column, take a row with me.

226
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,670
All right. Everybody wants me to with that.

227
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:19,780
So for the boys, we were talking about all people working all the time, such as, you know, like all residents.

228
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,720
So, yeah. So give me a little bit more info. So what is the injury context that we're talking about here?

229
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:33,880
This is when you when we were talking about an a traffic accident that's that's involving impaired driving.

230
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:40,760
Right. Okay. Then one of the things that we talked about was someone who took medication that could cause drowsiness.

231
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,250
Okay. Yep. Okay. Now, this is then the host.

232
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:48,800
Okay. The medication that might be causing drowsiness.

233
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,610
Well. I have a confounded question.

234
00:22:53,640 --> 00:23:01,980
Yeah. So what about people who are using substances, driving cars, but are also used like texting or using their phone while driving?

235
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:08,280
Okay, that could be something that is affecting your driving abilities on top of them being under the influence.

236
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:12,810
Okay. That is. So is that environment like.

237
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:20,580
Oh, that's a good question. So I would say that I mean, it's still feels like a little bit of a specific characteristic of the host,

238
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,980
whether we call this impaired driving or distracted driving,

239
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:37,020
if there is maybe kind of a like norms around texting that as fast as possible or trying to stay online for wherever,

240
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:45,390
whatever you want to call it, you might be able to kind of pull that into a factor that's influencing this this event.

241
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:55,200
Right. And so, again, picturing what it is in your head and I think this is where it is kind of important excuse me to to have that in your mind,

242
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:03,330
because this example is all about at least in my mind, it's somebody who slid off the road in a snowy evening or whatever and it hits a tree.

243
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:08,100
Right. We might be thinking in this context, it's a Friday night.

244
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:12,480
It's about 1130. Someone's driving home from the bar and they hit a pedestrian on a bike.

245
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:18,360
Right. So then some of these different boxes are going to be more or less applicable or the types of things that we might put into them.

246
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:25,470
So kind of having that vision of your mind like what is the what are some of the injury events that we think could be happening here?

247
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:32,549
But for 4.0, I think there is probably a combination of there's an individual level thing,

248
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:40,590
the host thing that we need to worry about there, as well as potentially a cultural aspect of it, maybe a few relationship aspects of it.

249
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:51,750
And again, each one of these things that we put in here would hopefully spark an intervention.

250
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:57,060
Right. If it's people feel like they need to respond to a text as soon as possible.

251
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,120
One of the ways that we would engage with that norm. Like, how do we start to shift those conversations, whatever else it could be?

252
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:10,950
If it's you have prescription medication and you're supposed to take it 8:00, 9:00 at night, and then you're having in the car or whatever.

253
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:14,770
And what does that have? What's what sort of implications does that have?

254
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:22,680
How can we maybe adjust our what would we do in terms of our prescribing rules or in terms of our directions for following your medication?

255
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:31,370
What else? The other boxes that you felt were particularly relevant here?

256
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:38,800
Yeah. We didn't talk about it in terms of like prescription medication.

257
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:43,130
We talked about more in terms of like choosing to use substances and then driving.

258
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:50,470
Okay, great. But I think then in the environment category, like availability of alternative transportation.

259
00:25:50,480 --> 00:26:01,309
Sure. I think that would be in the present category because it's whether or not you get in your own car or like

260
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:08,930
other people to drive the car or all sorts of kind of category value is actually in the driver's seat.

261
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:16,020
Mm hmm. In that situation. Mm hmm. So I like that.

262
00:26:16,020 --> 00:26:19,739
And yeah, I mean, you can make a debate about I kind of I mean,

263
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,080
I still tend to think of this as more physical environment versus more like the socio cultural environment.

264
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:28,530
So where something like, uh.

265
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:36,450
You just see alternate transportation lines like is it?

266
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,760
Do we have a defined public transportation system versus over here?

267
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:47,580
I probably would maybe throw that in there. Are you think you could also argue that there's policies around.

268
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:50,750
Yes, for sure. That that go right? Yes.

269
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:58,050
And also, I think it's like a thing that I'm imagining.

270
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:05,190
But I think some are even have kind of like policies around mitigating how much people.

271
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:12,890
Yeah. Kind of watching for how much people are drinking. Like, if you're really not doing well, like a bar will try and do something about it.

272
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:16,800
And so I think that that kind of relates to like, are you going to end up in their car or.

273
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:20,550
Yes, absolutely. Absolutely. Have serving rules.

274
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:27,719
You have in some cases, kind of the key, key requisition rules.

275
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:31,980
You have you have designated driver systems.

276
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:40,830
You can think about the car itself. You can have a Sounders. Are there any sort of technological innovations that keeps the car from starting?

277
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,930
If you have like an alcohol level of a point, whatever, where.

278
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:51,630
Yes. I'll just play off of what you just said in terms of alternatives so that you don't get into your car.

279
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:55,200
This is more related to convention. I would say it's social, cultural.

280
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,849
But I know that during major holidays that people tend to drink more.

281
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:07,259
I know that we lived in guys as long as we would contact them with certain colors and things like that.

282
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:13,169
So that. Okay. Yeah. So I mean, you're in a kind of socio economic kind of they're precursors.

283
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:18,870
There is a major holiday, right? And holidays are a time when people are celebrating, they may be more likely to use or substances.

284
00:28:19,110 --> 00:28:20,850
So knowing that that's going to happen.

285
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:27,660
Do we have, for example, you know, free Uber or Lyft and whatever else kind of at the time that they might be getting their car?

286
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:35,530
Others. Yes.

287
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:39,830
And I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Social.

288
00:28:41,770 --> 00:28:45,700
So that we kind of talked about those who are carrying.

289
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:02,060
Mm hmm. Right?

290
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:08,140
Right. Versus restaurant. Right?

291
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:11,180
Yeah. So the cameras example, you know,

292
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:20,240
do do have policies around it might make it more or less likely that people can do engage with authorities whenever I think like good Samaritan laws.

293
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:25,190
So for folks that are administering naloxone or kind of in good faith, they can't get sued for it.

294
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,219
They can't do if you have like less than what you're supposed to carry or

295
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:32,270
something like that for whatever it is we are opioids or something like that.

296
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,050
For personal use, you can't get charged for it.

297
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:42,080
So it's trying to fight to create or create or reduce barriers that, you know, you know, following accidents.

298
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:49,160
If someone is if someone was struck with somebody who was there or where however they had the accident happened, cedar tree.

299
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:55,399
And you don't want to call the police or even want to call an ambulance because you know that you're carrying opioids,

300
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,510
you're hearing something like that. Now, are there ways that we can reduce that concern and limit that?

301
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:04,940
It's kind of like a tertiary thing, limit the amount of injury that could be happening, but.

302
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:14,630
Yes, sir. I thought it was interesting that Sir her was like a parent child relationship.

303
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:20,110
So whether about the child, because who the person is that's wanting to get in,

304
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:25,940
who is wanting to drive, plays a bit of a role, but like a student or like near the age of 18.

305
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:32,090
Like whether or not that person feels comfortable contacting their parents for a safe ride,

306
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:39,050
or if they feel like they need to hide it, how they decide to go about like choosing what to do when I believe in a party.

307
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:42,950
Yeah, I think that's sort of thing. I'm 17.

308
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:48,200
I wanted to go with my friends. I had a few drinks. I got.

309
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:52,010
I hope my kids do this. Call your parents. Call your caregiver.

310
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:59,900
Don't try to drive home. I would rather you let me pick you up and yell at you and try driving home.

311
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:04,040
And I promise I won't even judges so much if you call me and tell me to bring you home.

312
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:07,760
Right. Can we. I mean, but that needs to be reinforced kind of early.

313
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,450
But your point here, you have an environment where you're worried you're going to get in trouble.

314
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:19,729
And to reduce that, we might be able to have conversations with parents, have conversations with designated drivers.

315
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,379
I've seen programs that you don't have to quite parent others. This is marketing literacy programs.

316
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:31,100
So you get to call another parent who is not going to I'm not going to tell your parents is supposed to be out here.

317
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:35,210
It's kind of like these safe community parks, if you will.

318
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,880
Also homes,

319
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:47,150
groups that might target groups that say like safe houses like you can your kids can come here on a Friday night and there will be no alcohol access.

320
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:51,500
How about this? The agents who've.

321
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,310
I think there's a couple. I don't know if they're really extraneous anymore or not.

322
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:12,100
It's like I've seen a car, you know, when you turn on the car and the seatbelt is you you're impaired.

323
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:18,620
Driver Are there drugs that you see in the future?

324
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:23,930
Maybe not so distant future? Do we have cars that can in some cases either.

325
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:32,120
I mean, if you have a speed modulator, if you have assisted driving, are those going to be options that might make our car safer?

326
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:36,500
Because part of this is the ability for an impaired person to operate a car.

327
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:46,010
What can we do to promote the development of technology that takes perhaps some of that control outside of the the individual?

328
00:32:46,550 --> 00:32:50,360
There are cars that have that auto braking force right now.

329
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:58,460
And once again, it's not Ford Escape from 2015, but maybe the Ford Escape of 2035.

330
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:04,520
And we'll have some of those some of the technology that I come forward.

331
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:09,110
Well, it's cool stuff, man. Come on. So you can see.

332
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:14,809
Right? If you can tell, if you can put the risk in. Chances are you can start to think you are.

333
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:20,870
I will now that I know the risk and now that I know what's happening and what is happening, what am I going to do about it?

334
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:29,360
How can I approach this? And then just to add another layer of excitement, we could then think about like, to whom does this apply right?

335
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:35,000
And in what communities or however else we want to, to start thinking through some of the critical nuance that,

336
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,070
yes, we could direct this, that people who drive Ford escapes. But then what about the folks who drive ships?

337
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:48,800
And what about the people who drive these Jeeps or Harris or Porsches or whatever else they might be out there right on the.

338
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:01,620
Closing thoughts. I would love, love, love.

339
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,110
And I thought, as you point out, that actually, really,

340
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:09,840
this is a good transition to see one of these matrices in your your final prejudice, you know, throw it out there.

341
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:16,379
That's the motivation for doing what you want to do. I'm going to I mean, here's this is the way I'm kind of describing the context.

342
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,670
I'm describing the problem and the sell or sells that I care about are right there.

343
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:27,030
I'm going to talk about how I can engage a host at the time that they're starting to get in their car and drive home.

344
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:34,050
Or I'm going to talk about what it is about our roads or what it is about the physical environment that we need to think about.

345
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:36,170
Do you complete streets in Ann Arbor?

346
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:42,210
Reduce the likelihood that somebody might get hit while they're riding on her bike from if you're if they're coming home from a busy piece of work.

347
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:47,770
Right. What can I do? Or is there is that dividing line? Is there is that really more problem?

348
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,080
And does it create more problems?

349
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:54,360
I've seen some of these some of the reports about accidents because people don't know how to work, you know, the complete streets.

350
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,080
Right.

351
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:00,930
So it's either the cars, the drivers that don't know how to work the streets or it's the the host that doesn't know how to negotiate the streets.

352
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:06,360
And still, you have people who are pedestrians getting hurt. Right. So moving away from substance use, this could just be wrong.

353
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:13,140
Can you describe the problem using this nice, helpful little thing and then say that's why that's my space.

354
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,890
This is where I have some fun right down here. And this is how I think I can resolve this.

355
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,850
And I don't know where you go, but I really don't. I will try to learn.

356
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,000
Now, you said these next few slides.

357
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,600
They're all just talking about the intersection, which I think nice to see.

358
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:41,669
Dr. Berner kind of say the same thing. But the idea that substance use is connected to mental health, it is connected to aggressive behavior,

359
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:49,380
it is connected to let's see what else older adults are doing here that would seem like they're just just taken off the list.

360
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:54,540
Yes, we are in there. We are kind of operating in the right mindset.

361
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,100
And then substance use, like so many other things in our lives, does not operate in a bubble.

362
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:03,150
And what are some of the opportunities or barriers because of that?

363
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:06,810
So these are on your slides. I'm not going to go through them as in mature 2015 data.

364
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:12,780
That's not as good as the 2020 data. But I'm noticing that there is.

365
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,060
I mean, I think this is just a different sort of intersection.

366
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:22,320
Can you utilize your data to utilize those video visualizations to isolate or to highlight the point of the focus of your intervention?

367
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:24,450
I'll just keep on saying that one too.

368
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:31,170
I know it gets redundant, but the idea that if you are going to say this is where we need to invest our time or energy,

369
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:35,880
it's would use this group of people or there's this age group or this environment or whatever.

370
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:40,799
It's this particular substance. How can you make the case?

371
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,180
How can you tell that story?

372
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:48,030
When we talk about policy for use in a few weeks, what are you going to try to say with numbers, with you, with anecdotes,

373
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,189
with your with your perspective that's going to get people's attention and start to focus

374
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:59,880
the problem in a direction where you think it needs to go to move back to measurement.

375
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:06,810
And what this means, whether this is an antiquated or whether this makes sense to folks still,

376
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,470
this is a physiological originally kind of conceptualization.

377
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:20,010
We have different kind of I guess we have different distinctions between how folks identify where they might identify, what they might look to do.

378
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:24,270
We need to be more inclusive in a way that we have we approach and talk about these things.

379
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:32,070
This is from and this is not a couple of years old is from an I triplet. So this is kind of your leading organization, the leading research institute,

380
00:37:32,430 --> 00:37:39,600
focused on alcohol and kind of like the appropriate amounts do we need to take development into account is

381
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:48,419
18 the cut off for everyone is it I mean what is why does it does there need to be more work to talk about?

382
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:57,870
Again, physiologically, what happens at different developmental stages as the drinks increase is so participant sex in this case a binary thing.

383
00:37:58,110 --> 00:38:04,439
But again, is that the right sort of demarcation or do we need be more expansive in the way that we're approaching some of this information?

384
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,450
Are there other factors because this is usually how I see it broken down is drives the way that

385
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:13,650
people say and how many times have you had this many or more drinks than the last two weeks?

386
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,740
Is two weeks the right is that the right timeline?

387
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:25,890
Time frame? Right. What are we just I just saw I'm forgetting the author I was proposing from PNAS.

388
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:36,540
Folks might have seen it. It was it was a it was a conversation started by a scientist.

389
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:44,399
And I'm doing and of course, about social science measures and how we assess things like substance use,

390
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,110
like binge drinking, like inciting depression and how it translates into clinical spaces.

391
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,710
And what do clinicians think about the utility of our measurements?

392
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:56,820
And then when there are some of these discrepancies, what do we do about that type of thing?

393
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,379
I'll see if I can dig up the article. Because it's interesting.

394
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,370
There was a lot, of course, you know, academics, you know, our social science measures are the way to go.

395
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:08,650
But where do these numbers come from? What stock in store do we need to put into them?

396
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,900
Are they going to be applicable to all people? And how do we want to think differently if they're not?

397
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:18,820
Can we go with this? Because this is the best science and this is the authority figures that we have available,

398
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,700
or should we reconsider and address in a different way zero world extremes.

399
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:32,620
Like I like a cocktail. Or like when people, like, make, like, giant chunks of, like, sangria.

400
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,969
Like, how do you I think like cocktails, especially people like mix alcohol.

401
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:41,980
How do you determine, like if somebody is, like, sexy at a party and there's like.

402
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,870
I think, like, I don't know, like undergrad there's a thing called a jungle juice and tons of alcohol.

403
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,089
How do you determine how many times that is? Like,

404
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:56,700
how much is in your cup or how much alcohol is in the whole thing and then dividing it because there's no there's not a great measurement for this.

405
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,909
I don't know if anybody's talking about the uniformity with which alcohol is spread across or with the mixer.

406
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:09,819
But I think you are taking, you know, how many shots of whatever goes into Dominick's or I guess that might be wine.

407
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:13,870
They're sangria right now. You're trying to figure out kind of what's the what's the level?

408
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:23,740
And I mean, yeah, I think in many of our situations, we're not going to understand how, you know, I think people are still making adjustments.

409
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:32,620
Yeah, I think so. Mixed drinks are they are an interesting one because, you know, you have you can dilute,

410
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:41,370
but then you can also you can overcompensate and say this again is very is based on fairly discrete measures of 12 ounces of beer,

411
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:49,540
six ounces of wine, one ounce of hard liquor with ex proof, 30 proof or something like that that constitutes a drink.

412
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:55,090
And so then deviations from that can have, I guess, more implications here.

413
00:40:55,240 --> 00:41:01,000
But then again, your age, your body type, your experience with your with alcohol,

414
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:07,900
with all these other factors that can play into whether you've had meals. So all of these things can factor into how you experience the effects of it,

415
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:13,710
the long to the long term effects on your body as well as your instantaneous behaviors.

416
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:17,950
I liked that about Erin's presentation. She kind of listed out.

417
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:21,460
So I think that was was it just marijuana or just substance use in general?

418
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:24,790
You know, the immediate effects here are some of the physiological effects.

419
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:27,999
Here are some of the long term effects. Here are some of the economic effects. Right.

420
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,080
So, I mean, I think you can break some of the stuff out in a lot of different ways.

421
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:43,720
It is. And I don't have an answer to this.

422
00:41:43,730 --> 00:41:52,640
Does anybody know what happens if we get outside the U.S.? Binge drinking qualifications for our country?

423
00:41:52,910 --> 00:42:02,330
Sure. I can go for it. I can tell you only anecdotally from I've heard from European scholars that I've spoken to and talked to about this,

424
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,590
that their behavior and attitude around alcohol is different.

425
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:14,030
But that said, I don't know if they have ways to categorize drinking in a sense, and how much this drives.

426
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:18,830
I mean, again, back to a serious point about abstinence versus what's acceptable.

427
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:31,430
And this is I mean, I can have three or four and okay, so you often see some of the like the quantity of just drinks per week, binge drinking.

428
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:35,660
There are some motivations. Why are you doing this? Tell us a little bit more about some of those things.

429
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:38,690
But it's going to be here that you do around worse from the consequences.

430
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,250
And it's through all of those constructs together know social science measurement that you get

431
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:51,800
kind of a kind of assessment of folks alcohol behaviors or tendencies or potential misuse.

432
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:57,450
It's actually lower. Yeah, 4 minutes.

433
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,130
Four pints of beer. And then within three months.

434
00:43:02,310 --> 00:43:06,120
So a pint is going to be 16 ounces. Oh. Yeah.

435
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:13,200
There. There. In Imperial. Why are those in the US? Oh, there's an Imperial memorial.

436
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,590
I think. Oh, yeah.

437
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:26,400
And so there, you know, just the idiosyncrasies of the spaces in which we operate, I think, are sometimes kind of fun to to consider.

438
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:34,229
And what this is quite a function of this one, it's an interesting one again to have.

439
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:37,380
Okay. Our entrance of 2017. That's nice.

440
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,690
Um, just so you know, I think to take a look.

441
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,379
What are we looking for? We're looking for trends. We're looking for disparities.

442
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:53,610
We're looking for prevalence. All different things that we can utilize data from this be from our sources like.

443
00:43:53,610 --> 00:43:59,519
So check this out. The National Survey on Drug Abuse and Health that's also adherence to is publicly available.

444
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,300
You can do a little bit of tailoring or what you call it.

445
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:06,270
You can look at some of the specific populations if you want to.

446
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:13,320
So you can get a sense this data is only as good as the people who respond to the survey remembering that.

447
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,620
So if we do have populations that are missing from the data, who are they?

448
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:27,480
Would voices are not getting represented here but noticing to all right, if I'm going to be looking at AIDS, how or who am I focusing on and why?

449
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,920
This would tell us that folks, you know,

450
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:42,239
in LSD or across the campus might be among those at highest risk for AIDS in our particular campus community doesn't mean that we don't

451
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,480
focus on people 26 and over doesn't mean that there are people who are 17 or younger on this campus that we should consider them as well.

452
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,740
But again, um, where are we investing the attention and resources?

453
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,530
How are we reaching out to people? Does the language here look very different from the language here?

454
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:03,570
Are these Gen Zers versus millennials?

455
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:12,839
Don't you use that? Actually, no, no, no annex. Oh I'm ex I don't know the generations and I don't have any idea why I was not represented.

456
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:16,230
I think it's a Z and these folks are millennials.

457
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:24,980
I'm 80. So 82 I think is the millennial kind of cut off forever and that's where.

458
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:36,290
This I think is a problem 2017, because I bet you this looks quite a bit different.

459
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:42,560
Um. Uh, I'm sorry. Uh, which one do you, uh.

460
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:49,340
Yeah. So I think heroin and synthetic opioids and opioids in general, I think, are going to be very serious.

461
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:58,010
This one is. But I think now you're you're isolating this because it has been such a remarkable increase over the last maybe four or five years.

462
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:08,750
There was a I remember reading a statistic like late 2012 or something like that, something like 11 million prescriptions of opioids every year.

463
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:14,720
So there are 10 million people in the state of Michigan, which means there's a lot of opioids out there for every single person in the state.

464
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:19,220
And what that means and how that gets represented seven years later.

465
00:46:19,490 --> 00:46:22,790
And we see this tremendous spike in opioid abuse.

466
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:28,760
And then as it starts to get cut off a little bit, you do see the increases in heroin,

467
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:32,270
you see the increase in cigaret co-payments as well in the state.

468
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:37,310
And then unfortunately these synthetics in the route of administration.

469
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:45,379
So taking a pill is relatively safer than, um, injection and inhaling is the worst.

470
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,700
So I think if you are afraid, it's going to be a.

471
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,790
Wow. Is it hard, though? No. Oh, yeah.

472
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,909
Ah. So you can always make data look really interesting.

473
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:09,100
You can make data of the very seem very, very noteworthy and know not to say this isn't, but paying attention to your scale.

474
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,540
Right. Don't cheat. If you're going to do this for this class, for sure.

475
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,390
But elsewhere don't have like 1%, 2%,

476
00:47:16,690 --> 00:47:21,670
20% in their system as being cut off or jump to make it look like your data mean something that it actually does,

477
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:28,059
or even worse, you know, you enlarge this, you make this like, what would this be like 3 to 5.

478
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,180
You make this be like 3% and this be like 5%.

479
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:34,509
So there's this huge, huge difference. We don't want to deceive people.

480
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:37,750
We want people to take this data at face value because it's bad enough as it is.

481
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:42,820
Right. So we don't have to justify the kind of work and the focus that we want to do,

482
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:46,719
at least not to say that this is a problem that needs everyone of these things.

483
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,780
Is this is that these are people these are not these are not numbers. These are people.

484
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:53,860
So that said, now we can talk about disparities.

485
00:47:53,860 --> 00:48:00,200
Now we can talk about trends. We can talk about different. In 2016.

486
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:08,560
Because like so from 18 to 2503 or 5.15 to 5.2.

487
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:14,060
Yeah. Hard to say. I wonder if like legalization, which is happening more.

488
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:18,700
I would imagine that if you saw this over 15 years, you're going to see natural fluctuations each year.

489
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:22,630
And this is probably within the boundaries of here.

490
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:28,690
Now, what might be interesting is if you look at this in 20 2021, fracking notwithstanding,

491
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:35,830
because it is a confounder but we we adopted the legalization would leave 18 started 19.

492
00:48:36,190 --> 00:48:45,460
So do you start to see any changes in these trends, these longer term trends as as cannabis becomes legalized more available time although.

493
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:55,640
Just different forms of intersection that you might think about, you might not think about.

494
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:02,540
I'm not trying to highlight anything other than there are lots of different ways that we can slice some data

495
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:10,460
to try to look for different levels of need or different forms of intervention that we might approach.

496
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:17,870
So very different population, different day. Brian Now trying to do a Facebook thing with them maybe or I don't know.

497
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:22,070
But to me this also jumps to, you know, if you to go see an obstetrician if you're going to colleges.

498
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,070
Is there a place that we can intervene that way?

499
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,820
Is there a different sorts of education that we might give to expectant mothers that we wouldn't give to other folks for receptivity purposes,

500
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:35,180
for whatever? I have no idea does. This is not my space.

501
00:49:35,870 --> 00:49:40,220
But at the same time, if we recognize that there could be challenges or particular problems,

502
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,450
this is probably a space that we could engage and maybe have them do it.

503
00:49:54,760 --> 00:50:04,080
Marijuana. Opiates, cocaine. I turned three years, probably a little early to talk about trends.

504
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:07,740
We can model them. So to me you can create a slope.

505
00:50:08,010 --> 00:50:14,580
This is just more kind of logistical perspective. You can create a slope of two, two data points to really create kind of a trend.

506
00:50:15,030 --> 00:50:18,480
You start with three, but ideally you're going to have 5 to 7.

507
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:26,160
Well, actually, ideally early 20. But this is the minimum that you would need for like a growth analysis or a time series or something like that.

508
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:31,799
But these can easily I mean, as we saw in the last slide, you can have fluctuations.

509
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:35,280
So whether this is a true trend versus not.

510
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:38,700
My favorite graph and I'll probably show it to you in a couple of weeks because

511
00:50:38,700 --> 00:50:42,210
I get a lot of questions about how mental health has gotten worse during COVID,

512
00:50:42,930 --> 00:50:45,930
and I can show you how mental health has gotten worse during COVID.

513
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:53,370
But what you would miss is that mental health is getting worse for about five years prior to COVID, like substantially worse.

514
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,680
And all we've seen is really just kind of a continuation of a trend that happened before.

515
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:03,900
So not by not taking data in isolation. All right, folks, it is 216.

516
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:08,220
I am going to stop because I want to answer this question about the assignment.

517
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:17,370
But the next four slides there, just to show you that there are many different ways that people are intervening in terms of substance use,

518
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:22,500
individual level, relationship level, state level, community level.

519
00:51:22,830 --> 00:51:29,400
Right. So you can pick different approaches based on, again, the kind of questionnaires that you think are our most critical, most important.

520
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:32,220
So if I give you the citations down at the bottom.

521
00:51:32,910 --> 00:51:40,400
Feel free to take a look at some of the different ways that people are using technology relationship,

522
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:46,140
parent intervention, peer interventions, community level interventions means care is a huge and very popular model.

523
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:51,990
Adaptive interventions we've now heard about twice. We heard about it with Sean Smith here and mentioned it a little bit.

524
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:55,710
And as a matter of fact, smart trials make randomized trials.

525
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:02,820
My good buddy at the School of Social Work, David Cordova, is working to test his intervention.

526
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:06,780
It's a looks at combinations of risky behavior.

527
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:13,319
So are you having risky sex when you are using substances? And with me and a couple of folks at school,

528
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:24,240
public health pitch this smart trial and the idea being you look to see following a control group in a treatment group,

529
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:30,829
you look to see who is responding and not. And based on those responsiveness and I know this is a little backwards, yes or no response.

530
00:52:30,830 --> 00:52:38,700
And in response, you can change your intervention. You can adapt your intervention to give people, for example, your intervention intervention plus.

531
00:52:39,390 --> 00:52:44,550
And you're trying to figure out what is the right combination to reach as many people as possible.

532
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:51,210
Who needs just the standard intervention, who needs the intervention plus a little bit extra, and who is actually just fine with usual care?

533
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:58,380
And that helps to then tailor the way that we might respond to the folks who are poor at the lecture.

534
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:03,390
I'm sorry, it's been a while. He hasn't asked me your question again about the assignment. I can't see it.

535
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:11,220
I like to do thing I can just when I go into the classroom I can see that one is new, but it's not popping up as an overall assignment.

536
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:17,060
Okay, I will try and make it public. I'm not sure why and I will do.

537
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:24,120
That's as a great reminder too that if folks are starting to draft some ideas, I'm happy to look around and provide you over there.

538
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:29,970
Thank you, guys. Okay. I think it's not popping up in the data on the assignment.

539
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:38,420
Yeah. More so that that's the thing that matters to them.

540
00:53:38,430 --> 00:53:41,590
So the assignment doesn't have a due date? No. None of your assignments.

541
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:49,480
Well, that's intentional with the reflection, but I will make sure that the whatever one the the critique has included.

542
00:53:49,850 --> 00:54:00,900
So it does seem to you through the heart. And I think it's, you know, if you're not an extended family.

543
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,910
So I'm again, I'm sure I don't know what that means. I will try to figure out how.

544
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:09,980
Yeah, it's a little how to find.

545
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:13,410
Well, good. I will try to figure out how to make a show up on your couch.

546
00:54:13,570 --> 00:54:17,010
Oh, really? Thank you very. Have a great weekend.

547
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,110
Look out your blue grandma's.
