1
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,989
Joanna Kovacevich: we're gonna go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:08,989 --> 00:00:22,549
Joanna Kovacevich: Just to kick us off and hope that everyone those who registered can still join us a little bit late, this is the digital inclusion and accessible learning design workshop.

3
00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:41,329
Joanna Kovacevich: So thank you for coming webcams are optional feel free to have your lunch, or whatever you need to do during this time we're also recording this, so we can share it out with you in case you missed anything have to drop off early or for those who may join us a little late.

4
00:00:41,329 --> 00:00:43,789
Joanna Kovacevich: we're actually going to start.

5
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:56,719
Joanna Kovacevich: We want to hear from you what questions you have about digital inclusion and accessible learning design or did you come today with any specific questions that you're hoping to have addressed.

6
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:12,499
Joanna Kovacevich: Monica has dropped a link to an idea boards in the chat and if you click on that that will open a page and i'll actually switch over to it briefly, I have it up in my browser.

7
00:01:12,499 --> 00:01:29,269
Joanna Kovacevich: If you're seeing both of our prompts we're going to begin with the one that says what questions do you have do you hope to have a dress today, and when you click on the plus sign next to that prompt you'll be able to add your own sticky.

8
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:38,689
Joanna Kovacevich: Additionally, you can click on the numbers in the lower left corner of each of the sticky notes to sort of up vote that one.

9
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:46,699
Joanna Kovacevich: And we hope to use this to actually guide our time today.

10
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:57,758
Joanna Kovacevich: So feel free to review and respond to those there.

11
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:07,711
Joanna Kovacevich: Some that we have is what does digital inclusion mean sort of high level what does that mean.

12
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:21,091
Joanna Kovacevich: How can I evaluate my course or documents or other items I create for accessibility, how can I make sure items I create are using best practices, so how can I incorporate those.

13
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:27,031
Joanna Kovacevich: isn't ssd responsible for digital inclusion, what exactly.

14
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,611
Joanna Kovacevich: Is my role in that.

15
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:35,551
Joanna Kovacevich: i've never understood the color part red green if you can speak to that.

16
00:02:35,551 --> 00:02:38,791
Joanna Kovacevich: Red green again excellent.

17
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:59,491
Joanna Kovacevich: that's really helpful because I think you know I am someone that does not live with a disability and so understanding the perspective of someone who does and various different types of disabilities is really important to me to sort of learn those perspectives and why those are important.

18
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:11,491
Joanna Kovacevich: And to speak common challenges in the types of courses that I teach bio Stat mm hmm.

19
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:17,341
Joanna Kovacevich: So you can continue adding to that and we can.

20
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:31,411
Joanna Kovacevich: Make sure we'll use that as we jump into our session today we're going to begin with a accessibility exercise and we're going to split us into breakout rooms.

21
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:46,981
Joanna Kovacevich: And Monica and I are actually going to drive this activity, just for the sake of time, but in our follow up we're going to provide a link to this activity in case it's something you want to practice and do on your own.

22
00:03:46,981 --> 00:03:50,985
Joanna Kovacevich: So I am going to divide us up.

23
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:55,262
Joanna Kovacevich: And i'm going to set a time limit.

24
00:03:56,181 --> 00:04:03,081
Joanna Kovacevich: To make sure we don't spend too much time here and then we're going to go ahead and.

25
00:04:03,081 --> 00:04:10,086
Joanna Kovacevich: Open these so Monica you're in Room one and I will jump into room to.

26
00:04:13,928 --> 00:04:16,538
Joanna Kovacevich: So welcome back everyone.

27
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:23,978
Joanna Kovacevich: So again, it was just sort of an exercise to walk in the shoes of the student that is trying to navigate course content.

28
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:27,308
Joanna Kovacevich: Using.

29
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:37,808
Joanna Kovacevich: You know, with their the limitations of disabilities, they might have and again we didn't address all disabilities, there are many that are not as obvious.

30
00:04:37,808 --> 00:04:41,888
Joanna Kovacevich: But what we would like, for you to do is.

31
00:04:41,888 --> 00:04:55,088
Joanna Kovacevich: Sorry, is continue adding to this idea board under the post activity reflection.

32
00:04:55,088 --> 00:05:01,058
Joanna Kovacevich: to share your thoughts and reflection of like what was that, like how did that feel.

33
00:05:01,058 --> 00:05:06,698
Joanna Kovacevich: Did you notice that the quiz was timed.

34
00:05:06,698 --> 00:05:14,648
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, these these feelings of frustration are.

35
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:32,918
Joanna Kovacevich: absolutely valid of i'm stuck I don't know what you want me to do there's no way for me to get the answer to this and it's frustrating and it's unfair and so these are just some of the things we wanted to address and.

36
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:35,704
Joanna Kovacevich: and start off with.

37
00:05:38,211 --> 00:05:43,071
Joanna Kovacevich: For the remainder of the session, some of it will be us presenting.

38
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:47,961
Joanna Kovacevich: But the live transcript should be available for you.

39
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:51,981
Joanna Kovacevich: yep and the bottom, if you want to turn that on.

40
00:05:51,981 --> 00:06:00,561
Joanna Kovacevich: For questions we encourage you to share any questions you might have through the chat or by unmute your microphone.

41
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:20,301
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm going to suggest not using the raise hand under the reactions tab as those that's a little more difficult to see while i'm screen sharing, and so I don't want to miss anyone and think that I can't that i'm just not responding it's I have your videos hidden.

42
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:30,651
Joanna Kovacevich: I want to share so October during the month of October the university hosted a toward an Anti globalist Academy.

43
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:38,871
Joanna Kovacevich: conference and I don't know if any of you were able to attend any of these sessions, but they were really good and.

44
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:48,651
Joanna Kovacevich: There was something that really impacted me from the keynote address that I wanted to share with you all today, and this is by Dr.

45
00:06:48,651 --> 00:07:05,361
Joanna Kovacevich: Lu for AMI open nami, who is the current Director of disability services he's the director of adaptive sports and he's an assistant professor of family medicine physical medicine and rehabilitation and urology.

46
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:10,551
Joanna Kovacevich: He has shared in different venues about his own disability, he is in a wheelchair.

47
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:20,481
Joanna Kovacevich: And, and he has not been in a wheelchair has a whole life, so I would encourage you to listen to the full keynote where he shares some of his story.

48
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:29,691
Joanna Kovacevich: But I want to just share this quick clip with you.

49
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:32,601
here for.

50
00:07:32,601 --> 00:07:38,991
Matthew Zawistowski: Now some will often say how can we prepare for every piece of accessibility, that we need to have.

51
00:07:38,991 --> 00:07:46,671
Matthew Zawistowski: And I tell people that we're not expecting that everything is done, but there are certain baseline things that we could have.

52
00:07:46,671 --> 00:07:57,771
Matthew Zawistowski: That we are starting to put into place, there are certain elements of accessibility and inclusion that when we know that we are going to expect disabled body minds to be there.

53
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:03,291
Matthew Zawistowski: We will have those things in place, but what happens, too often, as we see that we were not anticipating.

54
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:15,831
Matthew Zawistowski: Disabled body mind coming into the space where we're not inviting disabled bonnie minds to that study this work and, in fact, what we do is we discourage people from doing things that we think may be too difficult.

55
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:24,351
Matthew Zawistowski: Because of the amount of work, it may take for individuals to provide that accessibility.

56
00:08:24,351 --> 00:08:28,401
Joanna Kovacevich: And so, one thing that really stood out to me is.

57
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:37,731
Joanna Kovacevich: I think our current environment of if you come to class and you need accommodations you go sorted out with ssd and they'll let me know.

58
00:08:37,731 --> 00:08:49,671
Joanna Kovacevich: And then they'll help me meet these things but that's not an inclusive environment where we're inviting disabled body minds is the term he is is here.

59
00:08:49,671 --> 00:09:11,871
Joanna Kovacevich: To our university to our school and to into your own classroom for those that teach and so that really stood out to me, and so I wanted to use that as part of our framing today now he mentioned there's the baseline things that we're putting in place and that's at a university level.

60
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:27,861
Joanna Kovacevich: You know some of those things are at a university level, some of those things are at a unit school level, but some baseline things I wanted to present today are things that you could be doing, you can reiterate available resources.

61
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:32,631
Joanna Kovacevich: Some feedback on a rack of survey that took place in winter.

62
00:09:32,631 --> 00:09:36,801
Joanna Kovacevich: 2021.

63
00:09:36,801 --> 00:09:57,681
Joanna Kovacevich: Was that the Faculty or staff people students interacted with didn't weren't aware of services and how to get them number two you can continue to develop your own personal awareness coming to workshops like these attending the viewing the toward an Anti globalist Academy.

64
00:09:57,681 --> 00:10:10,041
Joanna Kovacevich: conference recordings and then three learning and implementing best practices in your own work, these things are going to make a huge difference and so i'll expand on these briefly.

65
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:14,211
Joanna Kovacevich: So you know about services for students with disabilities.

66
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:28,101
Joanna Kovacevich: and disability that you missed.edu is a great resource and this website, in particular, is inclusive of staff and faculty that have disabilities, something that the ssd Office does not address.

67
00:10:28,101 --> 00:10:31,251
Joanna Kovacevich: And then I also included caps.

68
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:45,921
Joanna Kovacevich: The Center the counseling and psychological services, as well as well being at student life that you missed out EDU because we know not all disabilities are visible.

69
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:57,861
Joanna Kovacevich: And for those that are faculty beyond having the statement in your syllabus but openly discussing the services and resources helps reduce the stigma.

70
00:10:57,861 --> 00:11:05,151
Joanna Kovacevich: It could be the thing that pushes a student to say you know this instructors seems comfortable with this.

71
00:11:05,151 --> 00:11:19,101
Joanna Kovacevich: This instructor won't see me as a bad student or not dedicated to my academics, if I go to ssd for services, it may be, the thing that pushes them to go ahead and apply for those.

72
00:11:19,101 --> 00:11:27,801
Joanna Kovacevich: And it may alert students to something they didn't know you know we all learn something when we have these conversations.

73
00:11:27,801 --> 00:11:38,391
Joanna Kovacevich: Developing your own personal awareness, there are some really great reports that have come out in the past year couple of years and i've linked to them here which will share out.

74
00:11:38,391 --> 00:12:00,531
Joanna Kovacevich: ssd summary tells of services random survey of graduate students has a feedback from students, the student idea board has recommendations at a university level what I like about these as they often have sort of the capture statements from students about how they feel.

75
00:12:00,531 --> 00:12:05,691
Joanna Kovacevich: How easy or difficult it is to get services.

76
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:19,521
Joanna Kovacevich: barriers that they face, and then they typically have recommendations for improving and I find a lot of value in learning about these things.

77
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:36,441
Joanna Kovacevich: And then participating and training to continue to develop your own personal awareness workshops like this, I have a link to some linkedin learning and then it resources of things you can do small things that make a really big difference.

78
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:51,621
Joanna Kovacevich: And then implement best practices and I really only captured just a few here that came to the top of my head is like think about these things when you're in an in person environment use a microphone if there's one available, not everyone can hear.

79
00:12:51,621 --> 00:13:05,091
Joanna Kovacevich: As well and we often find ourselves, putting those with hearing issues on the spot, when we say things like can everybody hear me I don't need to use the microphone do I.

80
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:16,011
Joanna Kovacevich: And then you're putting that person in a position where they have to be like yeah can you do you mind using the microphone even though it's something you clearly don't want to do.

81
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:18,801
Joanna Kovacevich: Building breaks into your class.

82
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:26,991
Joanna Kovacevich: Physical break mental break these are some things that address some of the non physical disabilities.

83
00:13:26,991 --> 00:13:29,421
Joanna Kovacevich: ADHD.

84
00:13:29,421 --> 00:13:38,031
Joanna Kovacevich: Mental health issues, these are things that register much higher on the ssd services.

85
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:46,551
Joanna Kovacevich: for students who apply for support, then some of the physical things.

86
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:59,241
Joanna Kovacevich: Use captions on all of your videos and make sure there's a transcript for any audio you share if you're showing something in class if you're linking to something from your canvas site.

87
00:13:59,241 --> 00:14:08,421
Joanna Kovacevich: In your zoom sessions right now I have live captions on all I had to do was click something and that could benefit somebody quite a bit it's.

88
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:11,631
Joanna Kovacevich: very easy no work for me, yes.

89
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:22,251
Matthew Zawistowski: Good question can you actually in zoom like a lecture they can you, you can actually set it to automatically caption.

90
00:14:22,251 --> 00:14:25,221
Matthew Zawistowski: You have to do it every time.

91
00:14:25,221 --> 00:14:28,431
Joanna Kovacevich: You have to turn it on every time.

92
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:30,291
Joanna Kovacevich: Okay, yes.

93
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:43,851
Matthew Zawistowski: Because I went looking for that, and because I have you know I get basically you know I told students I can't do it automatically because that's why I couldn't figure out how to do it, and so you know I encourage them to somebody just.

94
00:14:43,851 --> 00:14:50,091
Matthew Zawistowski: You know, send it up and so that's always what happens in my class somebody just puts a pop up and I just hit okay right away.

95
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:51,201
Joanna Kovacevich: that's right.

96
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:56,961
Matthew Zawistowski: And I know it's not I see it's a different person requesting it all the time, so it's kind of.

97
00:14:56,961 --> 00:15:08,121
Matthew Zawistowski: Oh it's not the same person i'm pretty sure it shows me a name so it's nice to know it's not the same person, but that would be nice right, I agree with what you're saying here.

98
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:23,991
Matthew Zawistowski: But when i'm I have like a bunch of things going on all at once, I wish, just like how they let you auto record, it would be nice if they let you auto turn on captions because I do forget, I want to do it, but I I forget.

99
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:27,471
Joanna Kovacevich: Absolutely and it's such one of these baseline things.

100
00:15:27,471 --> 00:15:28,761
Joanna Kovacevich: Of yeah.

101
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,731
Joanna Kovacevich: it's it should be.

102
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:44,601
Joanna Kovacevich: So one thing I do, and I think I may have even shared this with you, before is I put this slide here, because when I say live transcript is available, I always check Oh, did I do that.

103
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:45,351
Matthew Zawistowski: mm hmm.

104
00:15:45,351 --> 00:15:50,421
Joanna Kovacevich: And that is a reminder for me, because I know I may miss that.

105
00:15:50,421 --> 00:16:00,771
Matthew Zawistowski: yeah I mean I you know I think what you said before about just being vocal about stuff like i've i've kind of said that you know just told people like you know hey, thank you for the reminder.

106
00:16:00,771 --> 00:16:17,751
Matthew Zawistowski: You know and and that kind of thing so that i'm just you know I don't know so I just know that everybody people do it all the time, now they maybe hopefully don't feel bad about requesting it because they know it's not a bother to me, I just wish I didn't have to do that step, I wish.

107
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:24,081
Matthew Zawistowski: I wish it was set up in a way that it just automatically do it so.

108
00:16:24,081 --> 00:16:28,491
Joanna Kovacevich: yeah patty or just have captions on all zoom by default absolutely.

109
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:35,091
Joanna Kovacevich: Like just have it on, and it should be an opt out feature instead of an opt in.

110
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:40,641
Joanna Kovacevich: And, and maybe that will be the case, you know this is feedback we can.

111
00:16:40,641 --> 00:16:45,981
We can take back.

112
00:16:45,981 --> 00:16:51,411
Joanna Kovacevich: One thing, so one thing matt spoke about that is very helpful is now.

113
00:16:51,411 --> 00:17:07,521
Joanna Kovacevich: participants can request to have the live captions turned on if they have not been turned on, and so the host gets a little Ping of so and so now, you can actually if i'm a participant requesting I can anonymously request.

114
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:11,511
Joanna Kovacevich: I can check a little box that those who don't tell them my name.

115
00:17:11,511 --> 00:17:26,511
Joanna Kovacevich: But I do I do need them to turn on the live captions and so it's not completely on the shoulders of the presenter to remember to do that, there is now an avenue presenters can request that.

116
00:17:26,511 --> 00:17:27,921
Joanna Kovacevich: um.

117
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,171
Matthew Zawistowski: Do you have the transcripts on now.

118
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:40,311
Joanna Kovacevich: I do so if you click the live caption button in your zoom toolbar at the bottom, you should be able to turn that on.

119
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:44,211
Matthew Zawistowski: Oh, I see Okay, so if because i'm just curious what it looks like, on the other end.

120
00:17:44,211 --> 00:17:51,591
Matthew Zawistowski: yeah cuz I see this when i'm lecturing right it pops up after I say yes.

121
00:17:51,591 --> 00:17:53,601
Joanna Kovacevich: I.

122
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:57,381
Matthew Zawistowski: So not everybody sees that they have to sort of enable that to see it.

123
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:58,311
Joanna Kovacevich: that's right.

124
00:17:58,311 --> 00:18:08,361
Joanna Kovacevich: Okay, so you have the option to turn that on or for anyone who does not want to view that.

125
00:18:08,361 --> 00:18:10,701
Joanna Kovacevich: They can do nothing.

126
00:18:10,701 --> 00:18:11,721
Joanna Kovacevich: But again.

127
00:18:11,721 --> 00:18:17,061
Joanna Kovacevich: That could that should probably be reversed, it should be an opt out turn it off if you don't want it.

128
00:18:17,061 --> 00:18:22,521
Matthew Zawistowski: yeah yeah I agree how do I, what do I go to if i'm the host.

129
00:18:22,521 --> 00:18:26,571
Matthew Zawistowski: Yes, I would have to go to subtitle settings.

130
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:32,631
Joanna Kovacevich: know if you're the host you just have different options, you would click that live transcript button and there's a button that says enable.

131
00:18:32,631 --> 00:18:45,681
Joanna Kovacevich: Okay, and so all I did when I first joined the meeting was I clicked on my live transcript button in my zoom toolbar and clicked enable and now it's on for the whole meeting.

132
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:48,741
Joanna Kovacevich: I did notice, even though I left.

133
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,121
Joanna Kovacevich: And went to a breakout room.

134
00:18:50,121 --> 00:18:52,311
Joanna Kovacevich: And came back to the main meeting room.

135
00:18:52,311 --> 00:19:00,771
Joanna Kovacevich: It was still enabled.

136
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:08,391
Joanna Kovacevich: Going back to captioning videos if you're sharing a YouTube video in class check and see if that video has captions on it.

137
00:19:08,391 --> 00:19:27,231
Joanna Kovacevich: And then we also have auto captioning available for Pinatubo videos and i'm going to share with you a video captioning guide we've created so that videos from all these different potential resources, you may be pulling from how you can get captions on those or check them.

138
00:19:27,231 --> 00:19:43,311
Joanna Kovacevich: And then being aware and checking accessibility of the documents you create whether you create them to share with colleagues, whether you're sending them to maybe a professional group or using in your teaching there's some checks, we can do.

139
00:19:43,311 --> 00:19:46,821
Joanna Kovacevich: So here are our topics.

140
00:19:46,821 --> 00:19:55,071
Joanna Kovacevich: So that was just sort of our brief intro but um let's see where our topics lie.

141
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:59,601
Joanna Kovacevich: i'm evaluating my course documents excellent and then i'm.

142
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:04,191
Joanna Kovacevich: Monica What if we start with the the color blindness.

143
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:08,781
Monica L Rosen: yeah sure thing.

144
00:20:08,781 --> 00:20:11,031
So.

145
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:12,261
Monica L Rosen: You know access again.

146
00:20:12,261 --> 00:20:17,451
Joanna Kovacevich: You do so i'll stop touching my mouse, so you can control it.

147
00:20:17,451 --> 00:20:33,981
Monica L Rosen: Okay, so one thing that we want to talk about mikey said is we'll talk about some of these accessibility principles and i'll jump to the red green one with color deficiency, because that is one of the most prevalent.

148
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:35,691
Monica L Rosen: vision.

149
00:20:35,691 --> 00:20:41,481
Monica L Rosen: deficiencies that we have, so let me just jump in there, real quick.

150
00:20:41,481 --> 00:20:53,721
Monica L Rosen: Okay So here we go, so the one thing to keep in mind, I have before I was an instructional designer I actually worked in a vision live for about seven or eight years, and before we.

151
00:20:53,721 --> 00:21:00,621
Monica L Rosen: set our participants up on doing these vision experiments the cognitive vision experiments we actually do a color.

152
00:21:00,621 --> 00:21:08,871
Monica L Rosen: tests for each of them just to make sure that we're actually getting the cleanest data and you'd be surprised at how many people are actually on.

153
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:14,001
Monica L Rosen: now aware of their color deficiency so we're normally the first people, because nobody goes to the vision.

154
00:21:14,001 --> 00:21:18,861
Monica L Rosen: And says, I need to check for color deficiency, and they don't normally check your eyes for color deficiency.

155
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:28,401
Monica L Rosen: it's normally like, if you want to go into the military or if you go to do a vision research experiment when you're first told that you have a color deficiency, and the most important thing to know is.

156
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:30,831
Monica L Rosen: Actually, one in 12 men actually has.

157
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:49,221
Monica L Rosen: A red green deficiency with the red green being the most common one, you can also have a blue, yellow or you can have be completely colorblind and black and Gray, which is extremely rare, but the most important one is that if they do have a color deficiency is in the red and green.

158
00:21:49,221 --> 00:21:59,541
Monica L Rosen: Sorry, I think I lost X, here we go, so one of the things you want to keep in mind when you're using color as an indicator is to try to think about.

159
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:20,361
Monica L Rosen: adding an additional way of conveying meaning so, for instance, if you use graphs instead of using reading green as the main component to discriminate between variables, maybe using other types of indicators such as bolding or dashed lines or textures like I have here over on the side.

160
00:22:20,361 --> 00:22:30,621
Monica L Rosen: As you guys saw in the in the little accessibility exercise that we did when you have a red green deficiency, it makes it very difficult, especially to read things like graphs so just.

161
00:22:30,621 --> 00:22:40,431
Monica L Rosen: keeping in mind that you might want to use more than one label to indicate meaning can go a long way for those one in 12 men that you're likely.

162
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:46,881
Monica L Rosen: Teaching that may have a color deficiency and may be unaware of it.

163
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:53,181
Monica L Rosen: Really, so what were some of the other things from the idea boards, we should jump over to.

164
00:22:53,181 --> 00:23:06,921
Matthew Zawistowski: A Monica I was, I was going to tell you I don't know you could add this assist if you want to, but there's actually if you're familiar with there's this website called our color brewer that when you're making figure.

165
00:23:06,921 --> 00:23:15,921
Matthew Zawistowski: It can boy using our software, but it actually will help you pick colors and one of the options there's colorblind safe.

166
00:23:15,921 --> 00:23:17,421
Monica L Rosen: So i've seen Nice.

167
00:23:17,421 --> 00:23:30,231
Matthew Zawistowski: yeah like it like it helps you like, if you need $5 and you want them to be different shades of something where you want them to go from like you know one color to another like a heat map kind of thing.

168
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:35,481
Matthew Zawistowski: Because like lots of different options and that's that's one way, you can always do that.

169
00:23:35,481 --> 00:23:38,241
Monica L Rosen: yeah that's Nice, what can you repeat what what's that called again.

170
00:23:38,241 --> 00:23:42,891
Matthew Zawistowski: Our color it's called color brewer.

171
00:23:42,891 --> 00:23:47,511
Monica L Rosen: yeah.

172
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,511
Monica L Rosen: Thanks for sharing that.

173
00:23:50,511 --> 00:23:54,981
Joanna Kovacevich: Some other things you could do are.

174
00:23:54,981 --> 00:23:59,511
Joanna Kovacevich: Using labels, so if the.

175
00:23:59,511 --> 00:24:18,831
Joanna Kovacevich: In this example here if the red bar indicating men actually had a line to it that said men that's going to help people be able to follow that train of differentiation.

176
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:33,771
Joanna Kovacevich: Another item of interest was evaluating my course documents and other items so maybe we will jump to the.

177
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:42,381
Joanna Kovacevich: Accessibility checkers.

178
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:51,801
Joanna Kovacevich: So there's a few things you can do and i'll go ahead and start with the canvas items, one of the most.

179
00:24:51,801 --> 00:24:59,541
Joanna Kovacevich: Of the nicest things about some updates to the canvas content editor is there is now.

180
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:10,131
Joanna Kovacevich: I think there always has been an accessibility checker but now What it does is it actually puts a little notifications as you're typing and adding content you're inserting images.

181
00:25:10,131 --> 00:25:30,801
Joanna Kovacevich: If you're adding color anything you're adding to this content area it begins to give you little notifications of like accessibility errors and when you click on that it's going to allow you to review each one and make corrections to it, as you go.

182
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:40,611
Joanna Kovacevich: So this is really helpful before you kind of had to initiate that on your own, but now these little notifications are going to give you a nudge.

183
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:53,061
Joanna Kovacevich: And this isn't an accessibility checker per se, but one new feature when newer tool that's been added into canvas is a Microsoft tool called immersive reader.

184
00:25:53,061 --> 00:26:04,971
Joanna Kovacevich: More and more we're seeing this so that anyone not even necessarily someone with a disability, but I could click immersive reader and it will just read for me what's on the page.

185
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:18,321
Joanna Kovacevich: So if i'm maybe on the bus and I have my headphones in and I don't want to sit and read canvas content on my phone I can use the immersive reader and just have it read to me.

186
00:26:18,321 --> 00:26:23,481
Joanna Kovacevich: One thing this has picked out is it will.

187
00:26:23,481 --> 00:26:40,011
Joanna Kovacevich: Read for you URLs that you have in there, similar to the way a screen reader would read a URL it will read be https colon slash slash you m ic h.edu.

188
00:26:40,011 --> 00:27:03,471
Joanna Kovacevich: And what that can be is just a cue for you to go and make that an accessible hyperlink because https colon slash slash isn't helpful to anyone, and so, while this is not a screen reader by any means it can help you get some of those base level issues resolved.

189
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:22,461
Joanna Kovacevich: Another really fantastic tool is called the you do it tool which is integrated into canvas you can enable this in your content menu and it's only visible to you, and not to students you do it as an acronym for universal design online inspection tool.

190
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:38,061
Joanna Kovacevich: It will actually scan your course the content you've added into your course provide a report summary it'll list all of the errors and suggestions for changes and allow you to fix them right there in the tool.

191
00:27:38,061 --> 00:27:44,631
Joanna Kovacevich: One thing, it does not do, however, is it's not scanning the documents you upload.

192
00:27:44,631 --> 00:28:03,711
Joanna Kovacevich: Which is sort of a separate accessibility issue that I will move on to, but the fixing tool is you fix it, so the things that this flags, for you are images you've put in your course that don't have alt text that would allow someone with a screen reader.

193
00:28:03,711 --> 00:28:08,061
Joanna Kovacevich: To understand what what's in this image.

194
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:18,921
Joanna Kovacevich: it's gonna if you have any color or any color that's not accessible in your course maybe I actually seen people use.

195
00:28:18,921 --> 00:28:38,481
Joanna Kovacevich: highlight and make text in different colors to provide emphasis for different reasons, and if that contrast ratio is not strong enough people with low vision may not be able to distinguish what those letters and words are it will flag those and allow you to fix those really easily.

196
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:44,661
Joanna Kovacevich: With you do it, there is a lot of accessibility terminology that comes along with that.

197
00:28:44,661 --> 00:29:03,411
Joanna Kovacevich: But I think that's part of the learning process is jumping in trying it and then we're of course here to help you with any questions you have, and as you run into errors and things that need to be corrected.

198
00:29:03,411 --> 00:29:10,131
Joanna Kovacevich: For the word documents you're uploading to canvas site or emailing out.

199
00:29:10,131 --> 00:29:20,181
Joanna Kovacevich: Microsoft all of the Microsoft products have this check accessibility feature under the review tab on the ribbon.

200
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:31,731
Joanna Kovacevich: So it will pull out any things that need to be fixed and with a little explanation of that at the bottom of how to do that and I found those really helpful.

201
00:29:31,731 --> 00:29:45,051
Joanna Kovacevich: It will allow you to flag images that might be in your document it's really good at flagging tables, we put a lot of tables in Microsoft and it'll show you how you need to provide a.

202
00:29:45,051 --> 00:29:56,961
Joanna Kovacevich: table header on that, which is part of making that accessible for someone who might be using a screen reader to review this document.

203
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:11,331
Joanna Kovacevich: adobe acrobat we have access to the professional version of acrobat through the university's through the university and acrobat has a tool called accessibility checker.

204
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:25,071
Joanna Kovacevich: It also has a tool called and I think it's an action wizard item called make accessible and it'll walk you through steps of how to improve the accessibility of your PDF documents.

205
00:30:25,071 --> 00:30:39,081
Joanna Kovacevich: And so I have some additional links and information set aside that will share out afterwards, but these are things that are are extra steps to check canvas won't scan them for you.

206
00:30:39,081 --> 00:30:48,291
Joanna Kovacevich: But they're very critical for people who are trying to review the articles you're sharing as part of your course.

207
00:30:48,291 --> 00:30:56,511
Joanna Kovacevich: And then, this presentation links out to accessibility information on several other items.

208
00:30:56,511 --> 00:31:02,751
Joanna Kovacevich: and tools that we use in our teaching.

209
00:31:02,751 --> 00:31:11,271
Joanna Kovacevich: So it's 1243 and we want to address any other items.

210
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:19,011
Joanna Kovacevich: That you might have.

211
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:23,811
Joanna Kovacevich: To increase my knowledge and awareness.

212
00:31:23,811 --> 00:31:29,151
Joanna Kovacevich: Monica would you like to go over some more of the best practices.

213
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:30,340
Monica L Rosen: yeah sure thing.

214
00:31:33,355 --> 00:31:43,345
Monica L Rosen: Alright, so we'll just kind of go over a few of the other ones, the best practices on dealing with some of the easiest things that we can do to our courses to improve accessibility.

215
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:53,935
Monica L Rosen: So all text and image descriptions are the biggest issue affecting and web accessibility, especially that's pertaining to individuals with site impairment.

216
00:31:53,935 --> 00:32:02,365
Monica L Rosen: That could be poor vision, as well as no vision so whenever they have poor or no vision, they actually have to use what's called a screen reader the most.

217
00:32:02,365 --> 00:32:13,555
Monica L Rosen: Prominent one is jaws and will actually show you a little bit of a clip of what it's like to actually use jaws for seeing impaired individual and how we can improve.

218
00:32:13,555 --> 00:32:19,135
Monica L Rosen: The course by just adding some alt text to the images that we're putting into our course into our materials.

219
00:32:19,135 --> 00:32:24,625
Monica L Rosen: So the common perception, there is a text only web pages are better for accessibility, but that's not always the case, because, as we know.

220
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:34,315
Monica L Rosen: Images can speak 1000 words and if you're using a jaws one and you haven't actually put any image, you know words into what that that image is and actually speaking no words to those people.

221
00:32:34,315 --> 00:32:41,005
Monica L Rosen: you're losing the meaning of whatever you're trying to highlight and most often in academia that's like tables and graphs and things that.

222
00:32:41,005 --> 00:32:45,655
Monica L Rosen: really have some kind of meaning to the lectures that you're you're you're talking about.

223
00:32:45,655 --> 00:33:03,535
Monica L Rosen: So the most important thing, there is that images should be clear and crisp and that the alt text or alternative text is what it stands for, is to improve the experience and are accessible, so you want to be very specific and very descriptive so, for instance, if I had this image in my.

224
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:05,155
Monica L Rosen: course.

225
00:33:05,155 --> 00:33:11,485
Monica L Rosen: One what wouldn't be the best text would be baseball player hitting a ball and a baseball field.

226
00:33:11,485 --> 00:33:22,855
Monica L Rosen: So yes, it is true that's what's happening, but you're missing kind of the importance of who this is and where it's at and what's happening, a better descriptor would be who the baseball player is.

227
00:33:22,855 --> 00:33:35,485
Monica L Rosen: Who they're playing for, and you know where they're at so it's giving them a little bit more of a sense of like what's happening truly it's not just a stock image of a baseball player, but it has some meaning to the material that you're talking about.

228
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:49,615
Monica L Rosen: Alternatively, you could add image descriptions, this also helps for individuals, if you if you don't know how to access the alt text you can having image descriptions is can be also very helpful.

229
00:33:49,615 --> 00:33:58,195
Monica L Rosen: So the other thing you want to keep in mind is tables, I am in academia, we like to use tables a lot, especially in things like the syllabus but it's not.

230
00:33:58,195 --> 00:34:04,525
Monica L Rosen: Always them very useful to individuals who are using a screen reader or using a mobile device.

231
00:34:04,525 --> 00:34:14,545
Monica L Rosen: To be you're using a mobile device, you may have encountered this that tables will end up looking squished and messed up, and so it doesn't really help into individuals and if you're using a screen reader.

232
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:20,995
Monica L Rosen: Just to give you kind of a taste of how the screen readers work with tables, you can tell, I can also be quite messy.

233
00:34:20,995 --> 00:34:36,355
module activities points module one activity one activity to activity 320 3040 module two activity one activity to activity 325 2030 module three activity one activity to 5100.

234
00:34:36,355 --> 00:34:42,685
Monica L Rosen: As you can see there it's not really conveying the meeting of how things are read.

235
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:51,535
Monica L Rosen: from left to right with those descriptors so one of the things I want to keep in mind is Kim this information that I portraying and a table be portrayed in any other way, can I use headers and.

236
00:34:51,535 --> 00:35:02,065
Monica L Rosen: The system of headers can I use bullet points, can I listed out in a different way, so that you can actually read that information correctly.

237
00:35:02,065 --> 00:35:15,835
Monica L Rosen: So we kind of talked about captioning already so I won't spend too much time on here, we do have some additional resources in here for how to get grabbed video captions and some information about using accessible media players, such as pen octo.

238
00:35:15,835 --> 00:35:20,365
Monica L Rosen: In case you want to check those out.

239
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:25,375
Monica L Rosen: The other thing that you want to keep in mind is you, the use of headers and your documents.

240
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:29,995
Monica L Rosen: screen readers actually use these headers to convey structure of a document.

241
00:35:29,995 --> 00:35:43,015
Monica L Rosen: And just simply changing the font size does not actually mean anything to a screen reader it's not going to read things that are bigger text first, so the headers is not just for formatting you know documents.

242
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:48,895
Monica L Rosen: so that you can make pdfs they're actually also there for this screen readers can jump to those different sections.

243
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:54,205
Monica L Rosen: So if you don't have headers in there with a screen reader ends up doing is reading everything sequentially.

244
00:35:54,205 --> 00:36:00,835
Monica L Rosen: And sometimes that's you know that may not be the way that things need to be read you need to jump to certain sections, so the headers actually allow.

245
00:36:00,835 --> 00:36:07,735
Monica L Rosen: screen readers to read the headers and then choose the header of the section that they need to jump to.

246
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:23,335
Monica L Rosen: headings options are available in in all document processors, including in canvas and these actually link out to if you want to learn more about how to implement headers and we're document Google Doc or in canvas also to note, you can still change.

247
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:36,715
Monica L Rosen: Change the size and the color of the headings without changing the heading type so just because it defaults to a 40 point head header one you can change that down to 30 and it's it'll still be header one.

248
00:36:36,715 --> 00:36:49,405
Monica L Rosen: The other concept you'll want to keep in mind is that linking so instead of saying in your canvas site or wherever you have this information click here to view the care to.

249
00:36:49,405 --> 00:36:58,975
Monica L Rosen: comply accessibility on online course content video you'll want to actually hyperlink and actually have the name of the video or the website you're linking to as the.

250
00:36:58,975 --> 00:37:08,485
Monica L Rosen: Item that is clickable and to kind of give you an idea as to why this is important, I have another little example of what the jaw screen reader looks like whenever it.

251
00:37:08,485 --> 00:37:19,765
Monica L Rosen: reads an actual link like so versus whenever it's reading a hyperlink so it's kind of hard to follow, but try and follow with it, so you understand you know words i'm reading at that point.

252
00:37:19,765 --> 00:37:27,055
Monica L Rosen: screen reader example, this is an example of the jaws screen reader a screen readers and assistive technology that takes text, like the document.

253
00:37:27,055 --> 00:37:37,255
Monica L Rosen: you'll see on your screen and reads it allows dash dash As you can hear this example learn more visit link https colon slash slash webinar.org slash techniques select screen readers.

254
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:49,165
Monica L Rosen: Number out to learn more about our screen readers read content things to consider was that lovely little annoying to listen to definitely that's why, instead of the full URL it's better to use a descriptive link like this one colon.

255
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:54,145
Monica L Rosen: learn more about screen readers you may also have noticed that the screen reader read the words on the screen.

256
00:37:54,145 --> 00:38:12,685
Monica L Rosen: But didn't announce visual format and choices light color bolt and highlight and keep this in mind when creating documents and avoid music visual format and that's, the only way of conveying meaning grappling screen reader logo 3.05 inches light by two inches I.

257
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:20,545
Monica L Rosen: Already kind of went over color so we'll skip over that the other two little concepts that I wanted to touch upon was download ability.

258
00:38:20,545 --> 00:38:31,345
Monica L Rosen: So this is something that we hear back from students and student feedback all the time, is that they don't always have full access to the Internet, when they're accessing the material so whatever you.

259
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:44,545
Monica L Rosen: can do make items downloadable students really appreciate this so who benefits from designing for download ability and mobile accessibility, we can't assume that all students have access to.

260
00:38:44,545 --> 00:38:55,195
Monica L Rosen: Bible high speed internet at all times, many students rely on their smartphones to access course materials or download materials at school or to view them later offline.

261
00:38:55,195 --> 00:39:07,465
Monica L Rosen: And as you can see some from some kind of some of the trends here smartphone X smartphone ownership has actually risen over the years and PC laptop ownership has actually decreased.

262
00:39:07,465 --> 00:39:22,105
Monica L Rosen: Meaning that most people are actually accessing a lot of their online content material directly from their phone so it's not just about learners with spotty Internet access, but those who may have to travel such a student athletes who might need to.

263
00:39:22,105 --> 00:39:24,805
Monica L Rosen: download these materials and bring them on the road with them.

264
00:39:24,805 --> 00:39:42,445
Monica L Rosen: And also working professionals or rural students or maybe students in quarantine from code exposure, even those who are low income students with dial up Internet, believe it or not, that still does exist, it, this also is the case for those with severe sensory impairments.

265
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:53,605
Monica L Rosen: That may need to actually bring the materials home with them for assistance to read out loud with somebody who may be helping them with with the course content.

266
00:39:53,605 --> 00:39:56,875
Monica L Rosen: One of the last ones we're going to talk about is this simple.

267
00:39:56,875 --> 00:40:06,025
Monica L Rosen: navigation, this is again another very reoccurring thing that the students are bringing and highlighting is that the course can be sometimes difficult to navigate.

268
00:40:06,025 --> 00:40:21,175
Monica L Rosen: This is not only an issue with those with site impairments, but this is a big concern for those individuals with like ADHD or who have problems with following the course content in a simple navigation.

269
00:40:21,175 --> 00:40:27,595
Monica L Rosen: So there's a couple of tips, we have for how to improve navigation on your course.

270
00:40:27,595 --> 00:40:40,225
Monica L Rosen: Creating a course short creating a short course tour video is one way in which you can do that, right in the beginning of your course launches we actually have a link in here to kind of gives you an idea of how to create a course tour video.

271
00:40:40,225 --> 00:40:47,455
Monica L Rosen: This can be just like a two minute introduction like here's how I formatted the course, this is where you can find the syllabus This is where the assignments are.

272
00:40:47,455 --> 00:40:53,365
Monica L Rosen: This helps a lot when somebody can point you to the direction of how to navigate your specific course because we know that between courses.

273
00:40:53,365 --> 00:41:04,765
Monica L Rosen: And between semesters of the courses, this can this can be very different for each course and if they spend most of their time just learning how to navigate their course then they're actually losing valuable time on learning and turning in assignments in.

274
00:41:04,765 --> 00:41:06,745
Monica L Rosen: Some other things you want to.

275
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:11,425
Monica L Rosen: keep in mind, try to reduce the clicks and the scrolling to find course materials.

276
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:21,175
Monica L Rosen: also avoid relying on the files tab what ends up happening often is that some instructors will go in there and they'll do what we call a content dump they'll take all their content and just dump it into the file management system.

277
00:41:21,175 --> 00:41:31,135
Monica L Rosen: And then have the students have to try and find that material that can lead to a lot of frustration you'll want to group the relevant materials together and the best way to.

278
00:41:31,135 --> 00:41:40,045
Monica L Rosen: Do that is chronologically through your courses itinerary the way it's set up in your syllabus is the best way to actually set it up in canvas as well.

279
00:41:40,045 --> 00:41:47,935
Monica L Rosen: And then you also want to be consistent with the organizational structure throughout your course and even between courses oftentimes you'll have students, taking the.

280
00:41:47,935 --> 00:41:57,865
Monica L Rosen: You know the same very similar course in the same sub domain, with the similar with the same instructor so having that same consistent flow makes it a lot easier for that transition.

281
00:41:57,865 --> 00:42:10,645
Monica L Rosen: attach assignment instructions to the actual submission page, this is very helpful for students, as well, in case right when they're about to turn in the assignment, they can review the instructions as well and they're not on two separate.

282
00:42:10,645 --> 00:42:19,435
Monica L Rosen: Two separate tabs and then also feel free to ask for feedback, if you think that maybe your course maybe difficult or you don't know if your courses difficult to.

283
00:42:19,435 --> 00:42:27,715
Monica L Rosen: to navigate reach out to us we're happy to help you, we have some you know best practices for how, of course, it should be designed online and we can help you out with that.

284
00:42:27,715 --> 00:42:39,355
Monica L Rosen: Also, you can test your course out by looking at the student view, so the view that we, as the instructors designed the course up is actually looks different from the way students use it so feel free to use it.

285
00:42:39,355 --> 00:42:43,615
Monica L Rosen: Student view mode to kind of check everything out.

286
00:42:43,615 --> 00:42:58,345
Monica L Rosen: Alright, so Those are some of those best practices and again if you ever have you need any help we're here to help you with implementing those as well.

287
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:10,555
Patty Bradley: I just wanted to say that you guys did a great job with this you here are the important things definitely great advice for everybody teaching here, thank you very much.

288
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:12,175
Monica L Rosen: Thank you.

289
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:14,725
Joanna Kovacevich: Thanks patti.

290
00:43:14,725 --> 00:43:26,095
Joanna Kovacevich: In just the next few minutes that we have left we there were a couple of things we didn't get to cover, but we will share this slideshow with you.

291
00:43:26,095 --> 00:43:43,195
Joanna Kovacevich: We just want to reinforce that accessible design these small little things like alt text or adding an image description and headers there's benefits for everybody, the captions the live captions during your zoom it's not just people with disabilities.

292
00:43:43,195 --> 00:43:55,825
Joanna Kovacevich: That benefit from these in fact that's one of the takeaways from one of the things we took away from the rackham survey that was done last winter was.

293
00:43:55,825 --> 00:44:05,035
Joanna Kovacevich: There was a 14% of respondents say I don't actually have a disability, but I, like the accessibility.

294
00:44:05,035 --> 00:44:09,265
Joanna Kovacevich: features I benefit from those.

295
00:44:09,265 --> 00:44:22,495
Joanna Kovacevich: And so we have that on a slide if you want to review it later, and we have links to that record report and so that was just a big message to us that it's really for benefits a lot of people.

296
00:44:22,495 --> 00:44:33,445
Joanna Kovacevich: and accessibility is everyone's responsibility you know ssd is limited in their resources they have a process, they go through before they can support students.

297
00:44:33,445 --> 00:44:49,855
Joanna Kovacevich: That process creates barriers for a lot of people, and so it should be all of our responsibility to do what we can with these small things we can do in the documents we create and the canvas sites that we build.

298
00:44:49,855 --> 00:45:01,075
Joanna Kovacevich: And, of course, as Monica mentioned we're here to help so contact us at its pH instruction, we can consult with you on any of the topics we've covered today.

299
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:11,395
Joanna Kovacevich: or help you with trying up the you do it tool for your canvas site or helping you understand the word.

300
00:45:11,395 --> 00:45:15,625
Joanna Kovacevich: Word accessibility checker things like that.

301
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:25,975
Joanna Kovacevich: also want to highlight a couple of upcoming training opportunities we have in a few weeks we'll be covering November 17 we'll be talking about yellow dig.

302
00:45:25,975 --> 00:45:40,705
Joanna Kovacevich: A discussion tool that we use here at spx that you have availability to use we're using it in canvas sites we're using it in a virtual poster session type of activity career services has used it.

303
00:45:40,705 --> 00:45:53,605
Joanna Kovacevich: In work they do with students, so you can come here about some of those experiences and then December eight will have a canvas course checklist i'll DEMO the you you do it tool during that.

304
00:45:53,605 --> 00:46:09,415
Joanna Kovacevich: But helping you run through some things that we highlighted as important things to check off as you're creating your canvas site, so the next semester, you can register for these from the svg events calendar.

305
00:46:09,415 --> 00:46:14,821
Joanna Kovacevich: We just want to thank you so much for your time this afternoon and spending your lunch hour with us.
