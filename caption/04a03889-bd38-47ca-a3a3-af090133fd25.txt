1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,080
Like you go on that before I make some announcements.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:11,430
Are there any, like burning questions or concerns anyone has about any of the material or the class mechanics?

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,990
So far, things have been pretty straightforward for the most part.

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,960
They can sense so the problems that should be available now.

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:32,850
I'm not sure if you got a chance to take a look at it. It's due on the 24th of this month, which is a bit looks like a Saturday.

6
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:36,060
So Saturday, 924 at 11:59 p.m.

7
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,930
If you can try to like get it in before, like right before this, like try to get it in a little bit early if you can,

8
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:48,330
just in case there's an issue with uploading your answers on the campus site.

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,950
I don't know if you've looked over the problems yet, but problem one,

10
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:57,980
I think is probably the only one that we haven't really covered, like how to do that problem yet.

11
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:04,380
I think everything else should be fairly familiar, just based on what you've heard so far.

12
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,500
If not, I think most of all, most of everything should have been covered by the next lecture.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,049
So we're going to cover how to do that. That's more than toxicant kinetics.

14
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,610
And we'll talk about Half-Life and things like that in that class.

15
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:22,770
So if that one looks a little strange, don't worry, we should cover it on Monday.

16
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,650
So yeah. And let's see.

17
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:33,479
Office hours. I looked at the availability across the class,

18
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:40,080
so I identified four days and I think hit like the most amount of people or like the most people will be available.

19
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,390
So the first one will be this Friday from 230 to 3:30 p.m.

20
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:57,630
After that, it'll be weekly Monday from 4 to 5, Wednesday from 2 to 3, Thursday 230 to 330, and then Friday from 230 to 330.

21
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,090
So please come to office hours if they're going to be via Zoom.

22
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:09,629
So you go to the campus site, just click on Zoom and you should see like all of the dates for the office hours available

23
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:15,090
and just like jump into that zoom room and we can chat about any questions you might have.

24
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,530
Um, you don't have to come to office hours, of course, if you feel fine with everything,

25
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:27,570
but if you have any questions or anything you want to talk about, please come on down to office hours and we'll talk about it some good.

26
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:35,570
What? Yeah.

27
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:43,590
So today we so we're going to wrap up a little bit of the tail end of that dose response

28
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:49,620
lecture and just cover a couple more things there and then lead into AMI or absorption,

29
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,580
distribution, metabolism and excretion today. And this is going to be a little bit split up because I structured things.

30
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,500
Uh, funnily enough, the baby came last week like that.

31
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,150
We had our class, so and now it kind of helped that there was that Monday off.

32
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:11,280
So I'm now like in the process of adjusting to the newborn situation.

33
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,240
So hopefully I don't seem too exhausted or tired.

34
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:16,800
We're doing really well.

35
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:23,340
But the reason I say that is I had structured some of the guest lectures around the time that we thought the baby was going to be coming,

36
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:32,580
but you can't predict it to an exact science, right? So long story short, the Abby lecture and material will be kind of split up between this lecture.

37
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:36,000
We'll have a few guest lectures and then we'll finish up the Academy stuff.

38
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,730
So just so you understand, like why the thought process that went into that, let's see.

39
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:49,320
Yeah. But everything that you should need for the problems that should be covered in enough time to turn that in on the 24th,

40
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:56,450
if you have it again, if you have any concerns at all, just email me or come to office hours and we'll talk about it.

41
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:01,520
We'll talk about it. So I will just jump into the material then.

42
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,410
Last chance for any general questions or anything related to the chair before I just start rambling about this material.

43
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:13,849
There is a case of arsenic pollution in water in New York.

44
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,450
That was interesting. If anyone is interested in arsenic. Oh, wow.

45
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:24,480
Okay. Was this, like, pretty reset? The reason I think they don't like either the system was like an apartment complex or like a water cooling tower.

46
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:30,020
So there's an interesting thing is I think of arsenic in Bangladesh or something like that.

47
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,040
Not New York. Okay. Yeah, I will.

48
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,930
I mean, there's like so many public health issues going on, like concurrently across the country.

49
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:47,120
So we have like the Jackson water situation. The other one, I can't even honestly, there's a Baltimore I think is a boil water advisory.

50
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Not particularly, you know, toxicant related per se,

51
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:56,150
but certainly in the realm of like pathogen toxicant interactions, you know, we're not exposed to one thing.

52
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,110
So if people in some areas of Baltimore are exposed to chemicals that are interfering

53
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,460
with their immune system and exposed to water that has like a pathogen in it.

54
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,210
That's generally what the water boil water advisories are about.

55
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,560
That could lead to some concerning health problems.

56
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:18,830
So yeah, just it's sad, but these are really rather problems and that's why you guys are studying this stuff, right?

57
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:27,629
So yeah, if I, if you want to like send me an email about that article, there is actually another article I was going to maybe post, maybe,

58
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:37,140
I guess maybe in the announcements or something for the Kansas site about labeling for workers that work with pesticides in the agricultural sector,

59
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:44,570
getting exposed to pesticides because the labeling was in English and most of these workers were Spanish speakers.

60
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:51,680
And so like trying to address that, how do we develop that risk communication strategy so these people are not getting like poisoned or toxic effects,

61
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,770
which is a pretty kind of interesting article. I'll see if I could track it down.

62
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:03,150
But certainly we've talked about pesticides already in this class and we'll talk about a lot of the stuff even more so going forward.

63
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:09,930
So, yeah, thank you very much for that. Any any interesting news stories, definitely feel free to share those or email them to me.

64
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:13,980
I can like put them up at some announcement in the on the campus site.

65
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:20,860
So. Okay. So I think this is about where we left off with those response.

66
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:28,900
So we talked about these ISO BOLO grams which describe interactions between two or more substances.

67
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:35,830
And so in this case, so there were these different types of interactions I wanted to show you that could potentially happen between two chemicals.

68
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:44,380
So this case, we have an interaction between a chemical, A and B, let's say they're like two chemotherapeutic drugs.

69
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:52,330
And all of these doses of chemical A and B here plotted on this plot are causing a,

70
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:58,120
let's say, killing 50% of the cancer cells in an individual experiment.

71
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:06,160
And so if we have, for instance, additive, that's going to look like this kind of line because essentially, you know,

72
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:10,840
the way you can think about it is if we have a high dose of B,

73
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:17,229
we need a small dose of A to bring it up to the same effect to that effect of killing 50%.

74
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:24,670
And then if we go back to over on this side, if we have a high enough dose of a we just need a smaller dose of B to again produce that same effect.

75
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:32,680
So you're plotting all the different concentrations of A and B in combination that you need to produce that 50% killing of cancer cells.

76
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:42,730
So that's additive. So we can also have antagonism where, let's say dose A and B, let's say chemical a.

77
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:50,790
Let's say we need this much of chemical a but it turns out that when chemical B is around, we need more of chemical.

78
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,780
So essentially the curve is shifted upward and we're going to need a higher dose

79
00:07:54,780 --> 00:08:00,570
of chemical A and chemical B actually to produce the same that same 50% effect.

80
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:05,210
So the curve is going to kind of curve this way away from this additive situation.

81
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,979
So that's antagonism. So essentially you're making the chemicals like less potent.

82
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:18,630
There's some kind of interference going on between these two chemicals in terms of their intended activity.

83
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,239
And then chemical three is the situation three we would call synergism,

84
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,060
where the chemicals in combination instead of one plus one equals two, which is additive.

85
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,640
It's one plus one equals three, for example.

86
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:41,670
And so instead of what we would predict in terms of we need this much chemical a here and this much chemical B, and if there are synergistic,

87
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:48,030
we might need only this much chemical A in the small amount, a smaller amount of chemical B to produce that same effect.

88
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:51,270
Does that sort of make sense across the different situations?

89
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:58,210
So you're making, in this case, a synergism. The chemicals are more potent in terms of their desired effect.

90
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:04,950
They're killing the cancer cells in a more impotent way, a more efficient way.

91
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,080
So that's case one.

92
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:16,230
Case two is a case where we could have one chemical that's active on its own, and then another chemical that's not active on itself, but chemical.

93
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:22,800
So in this case, let's say we have chemical, a activated zone and chemical B is inactive on its own.

94
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,500
And so in the in this case, if we have an activity,

95
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:32,730
B is basically inert and the the curve is going to look something like this where we

96
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,710
just need a particular dose of chemical to produce that 50% response in the cell.

97
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:44,550
And it doesn't matter how much B we add. It's just you're always going to need the same amount of chemical to produce that effect.

98
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,930
Essentially, this is the case where one plus zero equals one.

99
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:55,400
So it's still additive, but it's a different kind of activity where B is not really contributing anything to chemical.

100
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,830
So it's basically inert in terms of this effect.

101
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:10,860
In this case with antagonism, you're going to need a higher dose of chemical A to achieve that 50% reduction in of cancer cell viability.

102
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:17,110
So you can see how you need more of a chemical A in the presence of a higher dose of chemical B to produce that effect.

103
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:22,230
So chemical B is antagonizing chemical, meaning that it's working less efficiently, essentially.

104
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,650
And you're going to need a higher dose to get that same effect. And then I think you can kind of see where I'm going with the third example.

105
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:34,110
This is actually called potentiation because B is inactive.

106
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,759
So just slightly different terminology.

107
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,350
And you'll see that table from the early first lecture that kind of talked about the particular terms we use for each of these situations.

108
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,879
So this is yeah, again, so this is potentiation.

109
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:54,990
So with the with chemical B around, even though it's a nerves not not really contributing to this effect that it's out,

110
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,860
it makes chemical a more potent potentiation potent.

111
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,380
It's making chemical activities more potent matter.

112
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:10,169
So you need less of the chemical to kill these cancer cells and work without chemical B and there's different mechanisms we can talk about for that.

113
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,340
You know, there might be that chemical B, although it's not really doing much to the cell on its own.

114
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:24,040
It might be up regulating a particular enzyme that like metabolizes chemical and causes it to do its like mechanism of toxicity more rapidly,

115
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,060
more efficiently. You can think of other ways.

116
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:33,720
Maybe it starts to, for whatever reason, induces the cells to express more of a receptor that chemical A is acting on.

117
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,350
Even though if you were to measure like the overall viability of those cancer cells,

118
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:42,570
that's not affected, but in the presence of chemical A, you start to see this effect come in.

119
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,459
So there's different sort of dynamics that could be at play between these two chemicals or between.

120
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:56,030
Yeah, between any combination of chemicals. So when we're talking about additive toxicity, remember,

121
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:03,860
we're often talking about things like an l.D 50 or the lethal dose 50 that kills 50% of the animals in a toxicology experiment.

122
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:11,799
We can think about if there are two chemicals, each with their own their own distinct leaves.

123
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,640
So chemical, hey, here, you know, looks like about, say,

124
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:27,850
ten milligrams per kilogram or maybe 15 milligrams per kilogram and then chemical B has a higher LV 50 of say maybe 100, 105 milligrams per kilogram.

125
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:38,990
We can use this kind of handy equation to calculate the the predicted ld 50 of those two chemicals in combination.

126
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:45,700
So if we know the proportion of chemical a by mass that would be a plugged

127
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:49,420
into this equation and the proportion of chemical P by mass plugged into this.

128
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:55,449
So let's see here and you can basically so we have a 50, 50% mixture, right?

129
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:00,070
So 0.5, 0.5, just 50% we have.

130
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,390
Okay. So it's the LG 50th A is ten. I'll be 50 A, B is 100.

131
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:13,570
And then you can basically just solve through the equation, uh, just like fraction here and you'll end up with 18.2 milligrams per kg.

132
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:17,049
So that's just essentially a handy way of if you're given that information,

133
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:24,490
you'll be able to calculate the l d 50 of a mixture assuming additive toxicity of those two chemicals together.

134
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:39,600
We've talked so far about two chemicals in combination. And that's been I don't know about you, but for me it's been like complicated enough.

135
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:50,160
But there are many, many chemicals out there. And so we we are the obvious people that, you know, do a lot of really cool modeling of interactions,

136
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,750
potential interactions between two or more chemicals for chemicals of to, you know, as we talked about in the first lecture,

137
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:02,520
trying to understand what's going on with the expose of like who knows how many chemicals and factors

138
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:09,540
we have to consider in order to understand the overall environmental impact on on health outcomes.

139
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:18,030
So there's a lot of research done in this area and it's pretty interesting, but it's a lot of really involved math.

140
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:27,240
But I just wanted to kind of highlight that and maybe some of you may go on to work in modeling these types of interactions.

141
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,129
Sure. Okay. So there's further reading about that.

142
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:39,360
You can look into and read again, this is something I can like post on canvas if people are interested in learning more, let's see.

143
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:48,410
Yeah. So if any of these documents are like how FDA approaches these types of situations or EPA.

144
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:55,159
ET cetera. I can look into some of those that some of the documents or some of those websites that might be of interest.

145
00:14:55,160 --> 00:15:01,399
But I just wanted to kind of show you the span of different types of agencies and

146
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:07,150
things that are having to deal with these types of situations where we have like,

147
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:14,449
you know, an account for these multiple chemical exposures. I don't know if we need to go much further there now.

148
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:20,630
We will start with the admin portion, but I'll just take a quick second and see if anyone has any burning questions on that.

149
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:27,510
Wrap up from dose response. Cool.

150
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,210
Okay. So add me. We've talked about add me already.

151
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:35,160
So Abby stands for absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion.

152
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:42,299
So absorption is how compound gains access into the body, traversing some kind of biological barrier.

153
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,350
And we're typically thinking about the lungs, the skin or the intestinal tract.

154
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,070
So we're either breathing some kind of toxicant in air pollution.

155
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:51,300
You know,

156
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:58,509
in some cases we're working with chemicals in occupational settings where we may get a chemical spill on the skin or we can ingest chemicals,

157
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:06,120
we say drinking water or food. Distribution so that these names are, you know, pretty intuitive.

158
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,689
I think distribution basically is how the toxicant is carried around the body.

159
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:12,120
And in the context of toxicology in particular,

160
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:17,910
we want to understand like how it's distributed to the particular effector site or the target of toxicity.

161
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,350
So if it's a liver toxicant, we kind of want to know how it gets to the liver,

162
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:30,390
like what mechanisms are at play and like what's the dose essentially that's being delivered to the liver is so that's the distribution component.

163
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:36,250
Metabolism is essentially what our body does to the toxicant.

164
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:41,920
We have lots of enzymes in our body that metabolize toxicants to metabolites,

165
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:48,550
and there's this whole field of metabolomics that assesses the different metabolites that are found in the body.

166
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:55,360
And some of that is in looking at how the body metabolizes toxicants that were exposed to.

167
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:58,540
We sometimes call this bio transformation.

168
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:07,670
So these enzymes in our body can convert, typically convert chemicals into more toxic compounds in some cases or less toxic compounds.

169
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:15,370
The ideal situation is would be a detoxification reaction where you're catalyzing some kind of chemical change to a toxicant,

170
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:18,970
leading to a less toxic metabolite. But that is not always the case.

171
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,100
And then excretion is how a chemical is excreted via urine and feces or exhalation.

172
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:36,459
So this is important because we need to know how toxicants get into cells to cause damage.

173
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:43,060
Typically a toxic that needs to get into a cell and somehow interact with the cell to cause some kind of toxic effect.

174
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:54,400
So you may remember this from your biology or biochemistry classes that the cells are made up of surrounded by these phospholipid bilayer.

175
00:17:54,550 --> 00:18:02,530
Right. Essentially, this like it's like a more aqueous environment within the cell and typically a more obvious environment outside of the cell.

176
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:07,510
But you have this like layer of lipids that make up the cell wall or the cell membrane.

177
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:13,480
And so this would be outside of the cell. This would be the cytoplasm or the inside of the cell on this the side.

178
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:23,260
So you have these phospholipids which kind of arrange themselves where there is a hydrophobic core within this phospholipid bilayer.

179
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:31,450
So hydrophobic meaning water essentially doesn't make it fats and things though do.

180
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:38,320
So it's not just a model layer. There's a lot of things embedded within this phospholipid bilayer.

181
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:46,810
And those include things like proteins, protein receptors, protein transporters, other types of molecules have ion channels.

182
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:53,379
And you could have, for example, like a hormone, some kind of legally binding to a receptor triggering a change.

183
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:58,120
And this is all part of this, the normal biology like mechanics of the cell.

184
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:08,220
So wherever a toxic it ends up, it's passing through some kind of membrane.

185
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,950
We have these types of, you know, the cellular structure in the epithelium of the skin,

186
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,470
the, you know, within our intestines of the capillary beds in the lungs.

187
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,640
And so they all are made up of these, like, similar plasma membranes.

188
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,940
And in general, we have two types of processes by which the toxicant can make it into a cell.

189
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:33,990
We have passive transport in which there is no energy required.

190
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:42,270
So this is like thinking about things like, say, diffusion of a chemical through the phospholipid bilayer into the cell via this like passive process.

191
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:48,090
There is also more active and specialized types of uptake of chemicals into the cell.

192
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:52,740
In some cases, the cell is providing energy to bring the toxicant in, actually.

193
00:19:52,770 --> 00:20:00,400
So there's chemicals that essentially hijack these like mechanisms we have in place where the cell is actively trying to like uptake,

194
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:08,370
like calcium, for example, things like lead or cadmium can kind of like hijack that process because they're

195
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:12,150
kind of chemically similar to cadmium in some way or calcium in some ways.

196
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:21,180
And so these like active transporters are bringing these heavy metals into the into the cell via this active mechanism inadvertently.

197
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:33,979
So I'm going to use a couple. I just want like up front to talk about I might use a couple terms sort of interchangeably.

198
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:36,770
So largely we're thinking over the next few slides.

199
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:48,860
So like largely we're thinking about like lipophilic chemicals and lipophilic city as like non-polar non-polar solvents.

200
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:57,620
So lipids essentially dissolve into like a non-polar environment more than like a polar environment, like water as a polar molecule.

201
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,570
So oil and water don't mix kind of thing. Let's see.

202
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,309
As opposed to hydrophilic as so we have lipophilic and then we have hydrophilic, a hydrophilic situation.

203
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:16,549
We're thinking of things like, say, polar or polar molecules, things like alcohols or sugars or salt.

204
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:21,560
Those are more going to dissolve in a hydro, are going to be more hydrophilic.

205
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:31,129
So I might use like lipophilic non-polar sort of interchangeably and then hydrophilic or polar kind of interchangeably.

206
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:36,320
So if there's anything that's confusing about that, just let me know and to stop me and we'll talk about it.

207
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,150
But I just want to kind of go over those two distinctions between lipophilic and hydrophilic first.

208
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:53,269
So hydrophilic compounds, even though they need to cross this phospholipid bilayer, can make it into the cell via like these aqueous ports.

209
00:21:53,270 --> 00:22:00,030
There are like small pores by which a small hydrophilic compound could make it through this phospholipid bilayer.

210
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:05,379
So typically we're thinking a hydrophilic compound is going to kind of like essentially bounce

211
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:12,190
off the the phospholipid bilayer don't really want to interact with with the cell membrane,

212
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,980
but there are ways that things like, say,

213
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:22,330
a small water soluble type of chemical like ethanol can actually make it into the cell via these aqueous pores.

214
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:32,330
And so hydrophobic compounds, however, can diffuse across the lipid component of the membrane, particularly like small molecules.

215
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:39,130
Oh, and so we're thinking about diffusion. You know, generally we're thinking about this like passive,

216
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,590
this passive process by which there's a higher concentration of a chemical outside of the cell.

217
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,460
And the chemical basically diffuses to an area of low concentration.

218
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:58,440
For larger chemicals. They're not going to as readily pass through the phospholipid bilayer.

219
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:02,340
But if they're like super lipophilic, then they can. That can still happen.

220
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:04,800
It's just that's going to be kind of like the limiting factor.

221
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:14,040
So if a larger compound, like a big molecule is super lipophilic, it can still get through the phospholipid bilayer into the cell.

222
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,480
But it's going to be more limited by like how lipid soluble that particular chemical is.

223
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:30,090
There's a way to learn to like quantify this what we call the optimal water coefficient, which is given by the term like log p.

224
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:38,459
So basically what you do here is you have an experiment by which you can have water and often all acknowledge, you know, kind of the,

225
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:46,800
the non-polar organic phase of water is in the water phase and those form two separate phases within a tube essentially.

226
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,160
And you add a test chemical into that tube, shake it up,

227
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:56,220
and then measure basically how much of the chemical is partitioning into the water versus the optimal phase.

228
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:05,629
And so that's given by the the term log P and with an increasing log P value you're talking you're going to be talking

229
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:11,750
about increasing little felicity or more of that chemical is partitioning to the optimal portion versus the water portion.

230
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,090
So something like, say, DDT or dioxin, these chemicals,

231
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,989
you can see some of these like toxic chemicals that we that we talk about in

232
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:24,940
toxicology a good amount are fairly lipophilic or like pretty really lipophilic,

233
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:25,540
actually.

234
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:34,959
And so that's an important aspect to understanding how they're impacting the body impacting cells is going to it's going to at the cellular level,

235
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,410
tell you whether that chemical is more prone to diffusing into the cell and interfering with the cell machinery,

236
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:46,299
like within the cell as well as where where is it going to partition in the body can really

237
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:52,660
tell a lot from this acting on water coefficient so it's it's an important value to understand.

238
00:24:55,230 --> 00:25:00,900
And then you can see other chemicals like, say, glycine, this amino acid or like let acetate,

239
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:03,990
for example, are going to be more of the water soluble side.

240
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:09,600
And so you're going to kind of think about it differently in terms of where it's going to partition in the body and how it might affect cells.

241
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:20,830
So some of this ability to diffuse through cell membranes is going to be

242
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:26,530
affected by the ionization state of a particular way of a particular molecule.

243
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:33,730
So some chemicals are like weak acids or bases and can be ionized or non ionized.

244
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:41,439
For example, here we have a we have a non ionized molecule and then over here we have this H has been extracted off

245
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:48,280
and we have a ionized molecule with a negative charge in the case of a negative charged molecule.

246
00:25:48,370 --> 00:25:52,480
It's going to be a lot less lipid soluble because remember this non-polar

247
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,649
characteristic is something that's going to be the characteristic of a chemical.

248
00:25:56,650 --> 00:26:03,940
It's going to be more lipid soluble. So if you've got a charge on there, it's not going to as readily dissolve through that phospholipid bilayer.

249
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,800
It's going to be a lot less lipid soluble. Right.

250
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:13,850
And so there are different areas in the body or different parts of the body that have slightly, you know, have different patches.

251
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:22,010
And the patch level in the environment that the molecules in is going to impact the ionization state.

252
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:31,580
And I'll show a table that shows that in a minute. But for just for example, the blood is generally on a neutral page, so not very acidic,

253
00:26:31,910 --> 00:26:37,400
whereas the stomach environment is much more acidic as you can imagine, stomach acid, etc.

254
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,960
And so if we think about this, we have two example chemicals, benzoate, acid and aniline.

255
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,930
And so in acidic environment is benzo acid ionized or non ionized?

256
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:07,100
Well, not ionized right. You could see in the civic environment is like lots of h hydrogen protons floating around so

257
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:14,550
that it has this h on it in that at a neutral this h is actually extracted off and is ionized.

258
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:19,560
And you can see that there are different ratios across the spectrum from acidic to neutral.

259
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:30,270
So at the at a super acidic situation, you have like 1000 to 1 ratio of non ionized to ionized of the spends oleic acid.

260
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:34,500
Whereas at the other end of this in a neutral situation, it's reversed.

261
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,280
You have like a much greater proportion of the ionized form of that chemical,

262
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:49,920
and that was a chemical called Annelie in a acidic and a super acidic environment of one.

263
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,760
Is that ionized or not ionized? Ionized ionized, right.

264
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:00,630
You see that any time you see a plus or a negative, that's a negative sign.

265
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,219
That means that that chemical's ionized.

266
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:10,950
It has a charge either negative or positive charge, and that's going to make it more or less lipid soluble when that charge is present.

267
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:20,230
And that at the neutral page again there's a 100 to 1 ratio of non ionized to ionized form of that chemical.

268
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:31,280
So. Which of these benzo acid or aniline would be more likely to diffuse across the plasma membrane in the stomach?

269
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:39,350
Take a couple of minutes to think about it and address it, or we can just do it.

270
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:43,440
It doesn't matter if you know it right off the bat. That's fine.

271
00:28:48,150 --> 00:29:01,810
I'll give you like a minute or two. Just.

272
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:51,220
Okay. Who wants to answer that?

273
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:56,170
Benzo acid because the stomach is acidic.

274
00:29:57,550 --> 00:30:00,820
And then to cross a plasma membrane that needs to be known.

275
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:08,920
Right. So in the stomach, low acidic environment, it's going to be non ionized.

276
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:19,060
And therefore between these two the benzyl gas is going to be more likely to be crossing the plasma membrane.

277
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:28,570
So kind of a process of elimination, you can say the other one, but which one do you think is more likely to cross the plasma membrane in the blood?

278
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:32,620
It would be the other one.

279
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:38,140
Annalise Right. Because can someone tell me why, though?

280
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:47,020
What is the age of the blood going to be neutral or a neutral?

281
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:50,320
Neutral, right. So we know we're over here on the neutral side of things.

282
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:54,249
And then do you see a charge on that? No.

283
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:58,000
Right. So it's going to be you know, you know, when we're comparing these two chemicals,

284
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:06,820
the non charge version is going to be more rapidly taken into or able to cross cell membranes, feel pretty comfortable.

285
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:13,270
It's just kind of understanding the specific context you're talking about and what that molecule is going to be,

286
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,350
what form that molecule is going to be in. In that specific context,

287
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,549
I guess I'm getting confused because I'm thinking of it as like a high concentration

288
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:27,190
of low concentrations with the opposite be more easily diffused or I mean,

289
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:33,120
I guess, whereas I know that thinking is wrong, but let's see the concentration of what.

290
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:44,829
So if you're talking about the benzo gases in the stomach, what you want the opposite like a stomach being a low, I mean a very toxic environment.

291
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:49,120
We want a non acidic thing to be able to diffuse because it be very different concentrations.

292
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:58,780
Or am I thinking of that from the different way of trying to think of getting a little tripped up on the idea of the concentration?

293
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,810
Gotcha. So can you just repeat one more time what you mean by h thinking of in terms of like

294
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:09,970
typically if something is like a environment with like high salts and low salts,

295
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:15,880
that would equal out and so does that not work in the way for for that's like guess.

296
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:19,450
Yeah not not really.

297
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:26,820
You know, there maybe we can talk about this more maybe in office hours or something, but in this sense we're really thinking about it.

298
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:35,889
It really comes down to ionization state of the chemical and those these other factors might they might be at play what you're talking about.

299
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:38,049
But in this particular situation,

300
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:45,460
I think generally you're going to be thinking of essentially something that's ionized is not going to cross plasma membranes very well.

301
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,580
Essentially. That's kind of the upshot of the whole thing.

302
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:57,370
And that charge is really going to not interact very, very well with this hydro hydrophobic core of the cell membrane.

303
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:04,260
You know, it does. Okay.

304
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:10,380
So when we're talking about diffusion, another factor to consider is this is really relevant for the kidneys,

305
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,969
is this filtration so that that can occur at different parts of the body.

306
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:16,800
So particularly the kidneys.

307
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:25,979
The kidneys have these structures called glomeruli, which have these pores that allow molecules of a certain size to pass through,

308
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:32,190
but block molecules of a bigger size, essentially smaller than albumin, just like this blood.

309
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:42,179
That's one of the proteins from the blood. Well, anything smaller than albumin is not going to make it through like this filtration system.

310
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:49,319
You can see, like you can imagine blood flowing through the glomeruli and things being essentially filtered

311
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:54,180
out and ending up in the urine and then the other stuff just remaining in the blood.

312
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:59,760
And so one way that we can understand or like one predictor of like or I guess way of

313
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,430
assessing kidney toxicity is if we start to see some of these bigger molecules in there,

314
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:11,190
certain chemicals or certain certain molecules that we consider like biomarkers of kidney dysfunction or kidney toxicity,

315
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:18,330
where if this is breaking down and we start to pick up like higher, higher, bigger molecules making their way into the urine.

316
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,740
So in that way,

317
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:28,950
the urine can be like a pretty sort of convenient way to see to see how healthy the kidneys are or if they're functioning in the proper manner.

318
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:36,900
So that's an important process as well to think about in terms of diffusion and distribution in the body.

319
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:49,560
In this example, does he have to do some relation with stones in there in the kidneys,

320
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:58,740
like if there is so too much calcium going through, but it's not going to be eliminated?

321
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:02,640
It does. It is something to do related to that.

322
00:35:03,390 --> 00:35:07,020
I'm going to you know, honestly, that's a that's a really good point. I'm going to say probably.

323
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:12,390
But I'm I would need to look into it more in terms of the kidney of kidney stones.

324
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:20,280
And does anyone here maybe know about kidney the biology of kidney stones better than me.

325
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,720
But I could I could look into that. But yeah, that's a that's a really good point. I'm not I'm not quite sure, to be honest with you.

326
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,460
So whether this filtration process is related to the formation of kidney stones, essentially.

327
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:43,979
Yeah. Or well, I don't know, maybe this term I know that the stones are made some of them are made from calcium on the other side.

328
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:48,270
Don't remember the other component, but calcium mostly.

329
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:54,870
That's why the people that has or has the tendency to have this choice in the kidney,

330
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:59,610
they don't have to eat too much called him because they they can make a liberalize

331
00:35:59,610 --> 00:36:07,050
and make it to to the blood so that calcium shortage in the kidney becomes stones.

332
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:20,010
So that permeability that you that has they are in the in in the kidney must be I don't know, something do something be related to that.

333
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:24,569
Yeah. Yeah. No, that's a great that's a great point. I would need to look into it a little further,

334
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:29,370
to be honest with you that but that's a that's a really interesting it may I'm wondering if has something to

335
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:34,860
do with the uptake of calcium into the cells as opposed to at this level of like the filtration of the blood.

336
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:39,000
But yeah, I would like to look into that a little bit, a little bit more.

337
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:45,840
I can't say off the top of my head whether the kidney stone thing is related to this filtration process.

338
00:36:48,550 --> 00:36:53,500
Thank you. See anything else?

339
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,290
Anything they can sense. Cool.

340
00:36:59,870 --> 00:37:05,209
So. So there are some cases where the movement just like simple diffusion,

341
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:12,260
they're like a pour or like across the membrane doesn't really seem to explain the process by which these chemicals make it into the cell.

342
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:18,400
We could think about like large or lipid insoluble compounds that somehow end up in a cell.

343
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:27,040
Like what is the process that's going out there? And it turns out there's facilitated essentially facilitated diffusion for things.

344
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:32,329
You know, this is part of the normal biology of the cell where chemicals are just sort of like assisted

345
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:36,670
by some kind of receptor or pumps that bring certain types of molecules into the cell.

346
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:40,700
And you see an example here of like these insoluble molecules.

347
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,820
And through this like pumping action, they're binding to the site here.

348
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:51,560
The protein's kind of like changing conformation, probably due to the binding here and then releasing it into the cell.

349
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:58,520
So in this case, chemicals are not usually moved to get some kind of concentration gradient.

350
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:04,020
But this does not require energy like the the currency of energy in the cell is ATP.

351
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,130
This is not a case where we're like spending ATP to cause this to happen.

352
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:14,130
It's kind of like if you could think of like a sort of mechanical device that kind of works on its own without any like additional power source.

353
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:20,090
Just kind of like of changes, conformation, bringing stuff into, into the cell.

354
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:25,790
So this is another way that chemicals can be absorbed by it, by a cell.

355
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,790
And then we have active transport.

356
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:38,069
And in this case we are using ATP or the energy currency of the cells of the stalls like actively trying to obtain certain chemicals.

357
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:44,850
And this is typically the case if you can think about a case where we have less of a chemical actually outside of a solvent inside,

358
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,600
but we're still actively trying to bring this stuff into the cell so that cells,

359
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:56,370
like actively using its energy source to help bring in more of this, this is a process that can be saturated.

360
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:05,730
It's typically selective. There's like certain types of chemicals that are really selected for this, you know,

361
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,180
this like important minerals and things that that have this that these systems are set up for.

362
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,129
You can have in this case,

363
00:39:14,130 --> 00:39:23,160
you can have what's called competitive antagonism where and so if you have two chemicals that are being taken by the cell via this process,

364
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:31,229
one of them may be very structurally similar to the other and bind into the pocket that the part of the receptor

365
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:38,730
that's doing this work but not actually make it into the cell and actually just essentially block up that receptor.

366
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,400
And so there's like certain compounds that, you know,

367
00:39:41,430 --> 00:39:45,750
we need to like synthesize or just naturally occurring compounds that can like block these receptors,

368
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,830
block yourself from being able to like uptake, calcium or what have you.

369
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:57,130
Again, this needs part of the solution, spending energy to do this.

370
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,790
Yeah. And so this is really in terms of toxicology,

371
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:08,420
this is where like things like cadmium and lead can hijack these things called di valent cation transporters.

372
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:12,799
So essentially these are mechanisms that are intended for bringing in essential nutrients,

373
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:22,790
thinking about like say calcium in particular the essentially and diarrheal cation is like a that's a positively charged iron with a two plus.

374
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:28,580
And so cabin cadmium and lead can be found in the same diarrheal state.

375
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:34,579
And so essentially this like receptor things that cadmium or lead looks like calcium

376
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:39,260
and could start and will bring calcium or let it into the saliva of that mechanism.

377
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:47,270
And last time, I believe, I talked about how in cases where individuals might have a calcium deficiency,

378
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:51,650
you'll have a more efficient uptake of something like cadmium or lead, because,

379
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:57,110
you know, essentially those transporters are like more free to like be working on the letter

380
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:01,610
cadmium as opposed to someone with like a sufficient amount of calcium in their diet.

381
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:10,370
So this is where like diet can kind of come in and be a way of mitigating certain toxic effects potentially of chemicals.

382
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,470
Obviously, the the best way is to just like not have the exposures occur in the first place.

383
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:20,150
But if, you know, we have a population, we have a case where a lot of people are exposed to lead.

384
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:28,879
We can use kind of our knowledge of these molecular mechanisms to maybe give advice on how to mitigate some of the effects or to just reinforce

385
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:37,220
the idea that nutrition is very important and can make things kind of essentially worse in terms of the toxicity of some of these compounds.

386
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:46,170
Is there is there something that a person that is that had become toxic?

387
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:58,220
I mean, the leg that the person ingested or or I don't know, in sample some something that they got into his organism.

388
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,760
Is there a way that they can treat it?

389
00:42:02,630 --> 00:42:06,380
So it's created the lead in some way.

390
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:21,100
Gosh, you know, you're there. Is there some something that the person can drink or eat to help to escape from his organism?

391
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:29,049
Yeah. In terms of excreting letters, things, calculators, I don't know how successful the key leaders have been.

392
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:36,730
This is where you're for. And we'll talk about this later where you're forming this, like, complex, bonded, like chemical metal complex.

393
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:41,160
And that can, like, change the ability of the body to, like,

394
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:48,730
excrete certain types of metals or in some cases it's used to facilitate uptake into some tissues that are kind of used for different purposes.

395
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:53,170
And that might be one way. I don't know if there's a successful one for lead,

396
00:42:53,170 --> 00:43:01,120
but that might be one way where you're it's more likely to be essentially excreted more quickly as opposed to like uptake it into the bones,

397
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,239
which is one place to lead resides after exposure.

398
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:13,390
So with blood, for instance, like it with children's lead exposure, the, the, the baby teeth are actually a really important source of like,

399
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:23,170
like a biological sample that we can use to assess lead exposure at early, uh, in early days before they have their adult teeth.

400
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:30,790
So we can, you know, kind of, they kind of are like a record of like overall exposure to the lead across that time.

401
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:37,180
So yeah, there's different, I don't know if there's again, like a killer chelation therapy that's used for that.

402
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:44,829
I'd have to look into that. But yeah, there is collision therapy for lead and how it can do more harm than good.

403
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:51,729
Yeah, that's a state of. I mean, I think typically if it's like stored in your bones and already passed, it's typically not used.

404
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:56,770
However, there's a lot of factors. Yeah. Awesome. Yeah, that's kind of rings a bell.

405
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:03,010
I remember seeing there was something was like legislation therapy and it was like it was basically like it wasn't,

406
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:11,100
it was a negative like spin on that idea. Like I remember thinking either it didn't exist or like if it did, but it's really helpful.

407
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:14,470
Thank you. Yeah, thanks a lot.

408
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:22,510
Good participation. Any anything. Well, let's see here.

409
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:29,470
So we have got this active transport. We also have transporters that go the other way.

410
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:34,950
They basically keep chemicals out of the cell. And this becomes an issue with chemotherapeutic sense.

411
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:43,090
These like proteins that they've found that can basically pump a chemical back out of a cell and you can see that like cancer cells.

412
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:46,950
And sometimes when we treat them with a chemical that we're hoping will kill them,

413
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,370
we'll actually start to pump the cell back out or pump the chemical back out of the cell.

414
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:59,320
So MDR stands for multi-drug resistant protein, making the cell more resistant to a particular drug.

415
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:07,330
There's different flavors of this. Know this is all basically the same idea of just like pumping the chemical back out,

416
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,920
which is there's actually like there's a lot of things we encounter in the environment

417
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:19,570
and a lot of just kind of dynamic biology that we have to sort of develop like,

418
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:25,870
you know, just to, to live. And so it's pretty interesting that the there's like a pretty kind of bigger than

419
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:29,710
you might think region of the genome that codes for these types of transporters.

420
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:36,610
And so this is like a pretty interesting way that we've evolved to sort of deal with our environment by

421
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:43,450
devoting a fairly like 5% of our genome to these types of transport coding for these types of transporters.

422
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:51,219
So that's one thing to bear in mind as well, is that we have these transporters going both into, you know,

423
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:55,990
that will bring things into the cell and the things that will pump certain certain chemicals back out.

424
00:45:57,690 --> 00:46:03,000
Yeah. So very important for cancer biology as these can pump these cytotoxic drugs back out of the cell.

425
00:46:07,350 --> 00:46:10,830
So that's absorption.

426
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:20,339
There are no specific systems for like absorbing toxicants. We didn't like evolve to absorb the phthalates, phthalates into our body.

427
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:29,489
This like synthetic manmade chemical, it's really through cells accessing or diffusing through the membranes and using the

428
00:46:29,490 --> 00:46:34,830
same mechanisms as other like essential chemicals that we that we need to live.

429
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:41,760
So it's really just based on biochemistry. And we have these inadvertent reactions where toxic chemicals are then uptake it into the cell.

430
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:54,819
So we have to remember we have different types of exposures through essentially eating the GI tract.

431
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:58,390
We have inhalation and we have skin absorption.

432
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:07,000
So we'll talk about each of those in the next few slides. So we have here a cartoon of the back of the GI tract,

433
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:14,040
starting with the oral cavity down the esophagus into the stomach, then leading to the small and large intestine.

434
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:21,249
Finally the rectum and anus. And yeah, so very little toxicants can get into the food chain.

435
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:24,700
We can have pesticide residues and produce things like that.

436
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:32,559
And it's funny, the jet track can be viewed kind of as a single tube that traverses the entire body,

437
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:38,290
which is kind of an interesting thing to think about, that we have this tube that just goes through our entire body.

438
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:39,580
And because of this,

439
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:50,140
technically the contents of the GI tract are viewed as exterior to the body before until they're absorbed into one tissue or cell or another.

440
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:54,850
So like technically they're like outside of the body in the way we think about it,

441
00:47:55,630 --> 00:48:00,820
even though they might be within like the oral cavity or the intestine or what have you.

442
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,460
So we see absorption of toxicants along the entire length.

443
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:15,930
Absorption can even occur in the mouth. And the intestines are like this really big surface area by which chemicals can be absorbed.

444
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:19,830
And they have in addition to just being really long we have these visualized is like

445
00:48:19,830 --> 00:48:25,139
finger like projections that increase their surface area to like 40 square meters,

446
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:28,710
which I think is like the size of a tennis court around there.

447
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:33,630
I may be way off on that. I'm really bad with like areas of lakes and stuff.

448
00:48:33,990 --> 00:48:42,510
But anyway, it's big. It's a big surface area, a lot of space, a lot of like chances for things to encounter,

449
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:47,730
a vialli, you know, structure or whatever it would be absorbed and uptake into the GI tract.

450
00:48:50,620 --> 00:49:00,850
This is a nice cartoon that shows. Kind of the components of like kind of in a little bit more detail of how this like absorb channel and also,

451
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:03,940
you know, move it back and forth between these different components might occur.

452
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:09,880
So we have the opening of the GI tract here and then we would have the actual cells like lining the intestines.

453
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:15,880
We have these transporters that are bringing things in. We also have these other transporters that can be kicking things back out.

454
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:22,630
And then from these, the stomach lining, essentially chemicals, toxicants can be delivered into the blood.

455
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:31,710
This is where this acid based charged or not charged thing is really going to play an important role.

456
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:40,860
So you'll have like if something is not ionized, it can be absorbed within this context via this like diffusion mechanism.

457
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:46,090
We can also like absorb things like particulate matter.

458
00:49:46,170 --> 00:49:53,280
So if anyone who's familiar with air pollution might be familiar with like small micrometer sized like things in the air,

459
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:55,470
they can end up kind of swallowing.

460
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:05,210
So the structure of the chemical is, you know, again, going to play a role in the rate of absorption and distribution as well.

461
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:09,920
So the patch of the stomach, again, is going to play an important role.

462
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:16,099
So is this chemical that you're studying, is it ionized or non ionized in a like a really acidic environment?

463
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:21,710
That's an important thing to know if ingestion is an important part of exposure for this toxicant.

464
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:26,719
We also have enzymes that we'll talk about later that are specialized to do

465
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,170
certain types of metabolic reactions that could change the chemical structure.

466
00:50:30,170 --> 00:50:37,579
They can like add a functional group to a chemical or like in the case of, say, phthalate digesters,

467
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:46,670
which are these plasticizers that are used in many, many types of products pretty quickly after like you were you in just a salad.

468
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:53,389
So, so family structure is basically like a essentially like a ring with two tails coming off of it.

469
00:50:53,390 --> 00:51:00,410
The two tails are the the two ester groups. We have these enzymes called life cases that pretty quickly chop off essentially one of those ester

470
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:06,379
groups and turn it into a phallic model buster instead of a digester that happens pretty quickly.

471
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:14,180
And so you'll see if you study solids, most of the in vitro toxicology studies are done using the mono wester metabolite,

472
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,940
not the phthalate digester itself, because that's the one that we find in the blood, in the urine.

473
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,399
This is the one that we think is really the most relevant.

474
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:29,390
It's a very small percentage of the diet soda that remains around in the body because our bodies like really efficiently start,

475
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,370
you know, these metabolic reactions.

476
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:37,640
And so you have these enzymes in your stomach and elsewhere in your body that can change the chemical structure of a chemical.

477
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:45,680
The chemical the structure of a chemical. There's a whole area of studying the gut microbiome as well.

478
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,490
So you have all these bacteria that live in your gut. A lot of them are very beneficial.

479
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:54,440
They can also play a role in like metabolizing or changing chemicals in the body.

480
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:02,120
And this is a whole area of research that I'm not going to like super dove into unless the group really wants to dove into it more.

481
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:10,760
But it's a really interesting area of understanding these like organisms that essentially live within us and help us in various ways,

482
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:15,590
but that could play a role as well. So you have like these multiple factors that you need to think about.

483
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:23,260
Within the GI tract that are contributing to how toxicants are handled in the body, so to speak.

484
00:52:24,770 --> 00:52:29,590
And then residency time. So how long the chemical remains in the GI tract, is it passed?

485
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:32,430
Does it pastor pretty quickly or does it stick around longer?

486
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:40,400
The longer it's around, essentially you have more of a chance of that chemical being absorbed into the into the GI tract.

487
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:51,560
Folks have studied the different types of transporters that are found at different areas of the GI tract.

488
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:56,660
And you can see this handy table here. I'm not expecting you to memorize this or anything,

489
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:02,600
but just to give you a sense of the variability of different portions of the GI tract in terms of how many of these

490
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:11,400
specialized transporters that uptake these chemicals are are distributed in different regions of the of the of the track.

491
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:20,899
So we have like sugars, for example. There's not a lot of transporters or little to no transporters in the colon for sugars, whereas like,

492
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:28,370
say, C like vitamin B12 mostly seems to have transporters found in the lower GI tract.

493
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:39,080
So just to give you a sense of like within the G, it's not just like one, you know, one homogenous sort of set of tissues or what have you.

494
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,820
It's there's a lot of variation with within the track itself.

495
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:51,260
And so this is another thing like if you're studying a chemical and you know that its structure is like similar to like say an amino acid,

496
00:53:51,620 --> 00:53:59,659
you can refer to the side of a table and say, well, this is where we kind of think the most amount of absorption might be occurring based

497
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:04,280
on what's known about the types of chemicals that are absorbed in this region.

498
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:13,070
So there's multiple factors that can modify intestinal absorption.

499
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:17,269
Something like that is actually like normally poorly absorbed,

500
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:22,099
but we can modify that as we were talking about using chemicals calculators which can

501
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:30,440
increase the lipid solubility of lead or absorbance of these like lead ions in the body.

502
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:37,730
So Kiloliter again, is just a chemical that forms complex bonds with a metal and alters the absorption distribution in the body.

503
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:41,590
And they're used for different ways of potentially of like detoxifying in some cases

504
00:54:42,220 --> 00:54:46,420
or otherwise like altering the way the body processes are moves metals around.

505
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:52,829
Grapefruit juice is a big one in terms of absorption.

506
00:54:52,830 --> 00:55:00,930
Actually have anyone to lick have you. Are you aware of like in some cases with a medication you might get the warning too,

507
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:04,049
like not consume grapefruit juice while you're taking this medication.

508
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:10,450
Have you ever heard of that? So the reason for that is grapefruit juice contains a bio flavonoids.

509
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:16,260
It's just a chemical. It's found in, like, a natural plant based material, like grapefruit juice.

510
00:55:18,510 --> 00:55:23,790
Has this honor engine which can inhibit this one of these multidrug resistance proteins.

511
00:55:24,510 --> 00:55:30,510
So this remember these MDR or multidrug resistance proteins basically kick chemicals back out of the cell.

512
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:38,129
And so if you're inhibiting that, the net effect is you're essentially increasing absorption of that drug because those receptors

513
00:55:38,130 --> 00:55:42,810
are not or those transporters are not working as efficiently as they normally would.

514
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,690
In other cases, they've been found to inhibit receptors.

515
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:50,430
Keep saying receptors, transporters that go the other way.

516
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,940
So they can inhibit these transporters called organic ion.

517
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,190
Transporting polypeptides are opiates.

518
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:04,140
And essentially it's the opposite case if you're the net effect would be decreased absorption of different pharmaceuticals.

519
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:14,210
So this is an important thing to consider, like you're designing a drug like or or is it going to be highly dependent on these types of transporters?

520
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:20,220
And if so, you're obviously going to want to include some statement about grapefruit juice consumption while you're taking that drug.

521
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:28,599
There's some other things that I think are kind of intuitive. There's like a diluting effect of food.

522
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:35,320
If you have a lot of stuff and things tend to not be absorbed in your GI tract, they're not going to be absorbed as efficiently.

523
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,229
In some cases, we can have these chemical,

524
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:44,920
chemical interactions going on where exposure to alcohol can increase the GI absorbance of a chemical like blood.

525
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:50,080
And so again, this is where the explosion comes in, where we want to understand,

526
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:55,870
you know, we have these interactions that can really have an effect in multiple ways.

527
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,220
Well, again, you know, we kind of already talked about this.

528
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:05,190
So these toxic heavy metals that, again, they hijack these other dietary iron transporters.

529
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:12,780
I guess I didn't talk about it last time. I'm sorry. So, yeah, so these heavy metals typically,

530
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:19,680
like they're getting into the cell via these like dietary iron transporters inadvertently the cell is trying to bring these types of ions in,

531
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:23,520
but they see another type of iron, which is the heavy metal, and bring that into the cell.

532
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:36,330
And so for that, for that reason, in cases where we have low dietary calcium, this can increase the rate of cadmium absorption because again,

533
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:44,099
these types of transporters are not going to be as efficiently working on the the calcium are they're going to

534
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:48,360
be actually more efficiently working on the cambium that's present because there's not as much calcium around.

535
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:51,600
It's like less competition essentially for these transporters.

536
00:57:55,110 --> 00:58:02,440
And we also have to think this is a big one for GI absorption and exposures like oral exposures children.

537
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:09,540
So in a biological sense, younger children have higher GI absorbed absorbance rates.

538
00:58:09,550 --> 00:58:12,840
They have a more permeable intestinal membrane. They're still developing.

539
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:17,610
They also have relatively immature detoxification systems for the most part.

540
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:22,680
So the enzymes have not developed to metabolize chemicals like they have with an adult.

541
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:29,310
So there's a biology difference between an adult and a younger child.

542
00:58:31,110 --> 00:58:37,950
One thing that my old mentor used to say that I've heard a lot is children are not small adults.

543
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:45,810
They're like a different it's a different developmental stage. And we have to account for all those differences in biology from the fetus to newborn.

544
00:58:46,110 --> 00:58:50,400
You know, there's there's all types of things we need to think about in terms of understanding that biology.

545
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:57,690
So there's also there's the biological difference. And then we also have to think about the behavioral difference in terms of exposures.

546
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:03,239
So we know that children behave differently than adults.

547
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:06,590
For the most part. They're playing on the floor more. They're playing in dirt more.

548
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:11,610
They might be, you know, they're touching their mouths more, ingesting more dirt, dust, etc.

549
00:59:11,910 --> 00:59:14,969
So we need to think about that as well.

550
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:18,180
We're doing like a risk assessment or assessing the exposure of children.

551
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:21,990
Do you have a question? Yeah, it was just about the developmental.

552
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:28,620
Is there a similar binding affinity to the receptors between like all the developed metals that might displace calcium?

553
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,120
And does that have an effect on the rate of absorption of those metals?

554
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:39,239
I think anything that's a divergent cation is probably going to have a a similar affinity

555
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:45,870
for that up until you maybe get to like a really big like ion kind of big atom,

556
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:46,590
for example.

557
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:55,650
But like most things that we would talk about, like if it was a diving ion, it would have a similar affinity, but there may be some exceptions.

558
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:59,399
Yeah, I would need to dig into that more, but I think it's like a pretty, you know,

559
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,340
just kind of taken by general principle that like, yeah, it would probably be have a similar type of affinity for.

560
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:14,150
Okay. Any other questions making sense so far? Well, thank you.

561
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:18,890
Okay, now I'll go to the box. How are you doing on time?

562
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:24,200
I thought we might be able to get out of here early today, but I'm not sure. Let's see.

563
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:31,400
So yeah. So with lungs, obviously we're talking about exposure to things in the air.

564
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:36,170
Usually gases or vapors of volatile compounds are like aerosols.

565
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,759
This is particularly important in an occupational setting.

566
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,139
So there's a lot of situations where workers are working around things that are volatile,

567
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:52,870
izing into the workspace, and we're concerned about exposure in that situation.

568
01:00:55,110 --> 01:01:01,520
So again, vapor is just a gas form of a substance that might be liquid but then evaporate into a vapor for.

569
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:10,260
So mainly we're talking about, as you might suspect, we're talking about the lungs for the most part in terms of absorption of gases.

570
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:17,910
But there is this whole airway. So there is some absorption that can occur in the nose, the nasal cavity, for example, before we get to the lungs.

571
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,360
In some cases, water soluble compounds can actually get trapped in the nose.

572
01:01:22,390 --> 01:01:26,260
So there's this kind of and we'll talk about this a little bit later, but there's some kind of interesting,

573
01:01:26,260 --> 01:01:30,010
like things related to aerodynamics that were a little bit counterintuitive,

574
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,850
at least for me, in understanding exposures to certain types of chemicals.

575
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:42,610
So in general, the airways are, you know, you're exposed to a chemical via like inhalation through the nose,

576
01:01:43,420 --> 01:01:45,400
down through the esophagus, in the trachea.

577
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:52,329
You see this branching into these main bronchi, which then turn into these really interesting structures in the lungs,

578
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:57,880
which are these like branching structures that kind of look like branches on a tree of the kind of smaller and smaller.

579
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:07,240
That at the end of these like branches are these structures called alveoli, which look like a bunch of grapes kind of.

580
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:12,999
And the air in air that is inhaled kind of ends up here.

581
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:17,890
And these alveoli are like basically covered in like blood vessels.

582
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:23,980
And so this is where you get this exchange from the air in the alveoli into the bloodstream.

583
01:02:28,590 --> 01:02:35,130
So the gas will diffuse into the alveolar space represented here by these arrows.

584
01:02:37,480 --> 01:02:45,309
Let's see. And so this is going to be governed by some of the, you know, things like vapor pressure,

585
01:02:45,310 --> 01:02:49,030
Henry's law, things you might have remembered from like earlier chemistry courses,

586
01:02:49,630 --> 01:02:54,700
like this equilibrium that'll form between the amount of gas and the amount that's diffusing into the blood.

587
01:02:55,450 --> 01:03:04,060
In this case, we've just seen, for whatever reason, the ionization state issue is not quite as important as it is for like the GI tract, for example.

588
01:03:05,470 --> 01:03:09,220
I couldn't tell you exactly why that is, but it's just something that.

589
01:03:10,470 --> 01:03:14,280
Think about. Let's see. Yeah.

590
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:22,409
So essentially we get gas. Dissolving via these alveolar alveoli into the bloodstream.

591
01:03:22,410 --> 01:03:25,979
And at once the gas is the gas molecules are in the bloodstream.

592
01:03:25,980 --> 01:03:28,500
They can basically be delivered throughout the body.

593
01:03:28,530 --> 01:03:34,590
Once you make it to the blood, things can pretty much take off from there, be delivered all throughout the body.

594
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:44,120
So we can talk about toxicant absorption in the lungs in terms of these, um, particles.

595
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:52,410
So you may be familiar with particulate matter, these like small particles that are found particularly relevant in air pollution scenarios.

596
01:03:52,980 --> 01:04:03,180
And so those come in different sizes. Oftentimes, we'll talk about PM10 or particulate matter, ten of ten, ten by four, micrometer, diameter, size.

597
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:14,160
And so we see different sort of patterns of deposition within the airways based on the different sizes of particulate matter that one is exposed to.

598
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:21,390
So, for example, we can kind of roughly differentiate the airways into this upper portion,

599
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:27,570
the nasal pharyngeal portion, this trunk brachial portion, kind of the next one down.

600
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:34,080
And then finally, at the level of the alveoli. And so we see with in this upper portion,

601
01:04:34,530 --> 01:04:43,740
we see a lot of deposition of say so this is percent deposition here and then a different diameter or something, particulates.

602
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:51,560
And so you see like the ten micrometer particulates, kind of a lot of them or like between one and ten,

603
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:54,330
a lot of them are depositing in this upper airway here.

604
01:04:55,740 --> 01:05:05,520
And sort of counterintuitively, at least for me, there's a lot of deposition of the really small particulates like .01 micrometer in diameter.

605
01:05:06,090 --> 01:05:13,260
And I'm no expert in this field, but my understanding is that this has to do with the aerodynamics of how the particles are

606
01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:19,500
moving through the air and encountering the airways and has to do with like the curve here.

607
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,730
They just are for whatever reason they're depositing in that region.

608
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:31,500
My intuition would have told me that they were going to deposit really deep into the airways, into the alveoli, but that appears to not be the case.

609
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:34,920
So then you get the trunk brachial.

610
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:45,510
So trunk tracheal bronchial something with a, you know, it was kind of a spike or a lot of the deposition kind of a this mid range of size.

611
01:05:46,050 --> 01:05:52,800
And then the alveolar dust deposition is really important and really something we want to think about in terms of toxicology for a couple of reasons.

612
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:56,070
One, if you're disrupting the function of the alveoli,

613
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:02,730
that's going to be a real problem for like breathing and, you know, just low lung function in general.

614
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:06,150
And then also it's the sites interface with the blood.

615
01:06:06,150 --> 01:06:10,410
So anything that's getting to the alveoli could potentially be delivered into the bloodstream.

616
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:13,230
And so we see these die, you know,

617
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:24,540
so you could see these like a spike of like 6.01 or so diameter particulates kind of depositing all the way down in the alveoli.

618
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:27,190
So I think more and more in the air pollution world,

619
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:34,410
they're kind of like focusing a little bit less on the PM10 and a little bit more on the smaller sizes, is my understanding.

620
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:41,549
But don't quote me on that. I'm not like an air pollution guy, but in general, that was my understanding.

621
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:45,260
Less I thought heard about it. Okay.

622
01:06:45,270 --> 01:06:48,490
So anything. Any comments, questions?

623
01:06:48,500 --> 01:07:01,809
Thoughts? Yeah, one question. A virus is considered toxic is that is a toxic and not really considered a toxicant now in

624
01:07:01,810 --> 01:07:06,640
general that's a pathogen we don't really think about it generally in terms of the toxic.

625
01:07:08,750 --> 01:07:12,650
Only particles. Particles.

626
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:18,680
Like you said, gases or vapors. But no living organisms.

627
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:24,020
But. Well, I'm. I'm asking that because. Because they call it.

628
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:30,860
We absorb by aerosols. And the virus are not living particles.

629
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:37,880
Just particles. So they. They could be like toxicants for our what they are toxins.

630
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:41,660
They go to lower lungs. That's a good point.

631
01:07:42,860 --> 01:07:47,930
A biological agent. We would be thinking about it, toxicological.

632
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:52,649
Response. It gets a little bit blurry, baby.

633
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:55,379
To me, I'm kind of more of a classical toxicologist,

634
01:07:55,380 --> 01:08:01,050
or I'm thinking about chemicals or strictly non-living things, but certainly there are toxins that are produced.

635
01:08:01,050 --> 01:08:07,200
So things like again, I talked about in the other lecture about like cobra venom, for example, that's that's toxicology.

636
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:12,890
But that's more of a in terms of that's like a chemical. But like, yeah, it's a virus.

637
01:08:12,930 --> 01:08:15,719
You could say it's inducing some kind of inflammation response.

638
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:24,600
And certainly, you know, we do take toxicology approaches, for instance, like understanding genetically modified food,

639
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:30,270
for example, that might include certain like proteins that wouldn't normally be found in that food.

640
01:08:30,270 --> 01:08:36,299
And there's concern that that might that that might be inducing a inflammation or immune

641
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:40,530
response and certain people like an allergic response that we didn't anticipate.

642
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:49,680
And the society toxicologist looked at that. So, you know, that's again, I think you're still at the level of like a protein versus like a virus.

643
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:54,780
So but I could see how it would get a little bit a little bit blurry in terms

644
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:58,620
of the strict lines that are like when does a virus stop being like a living?

645
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:07,620
Organism. And, you know, you're looking at it through a pathogen type of lens versus components of a virus that could still be causing adverse events,

646
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:12,440
might be kind of looked at through a toxicology lens potentially.

647
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:19,469
So, yeah, I think that's a good point. I still think you could like have a philosophical debate about is like what what what's

648
01:09:19,470 --> 01:09:24,570
considered like toxicology versus not but in general like something with a virus.

649
01:09:24,570 --> 01:09:28,050
We're not that's not something we're looking at in toxicology.

650
01:09:28,110 --> 01:09:39,659
Overall, I have a question. What is the regional deposition percent referring to is that it's absorption into the blood or if

651
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:46,780
it's passing to the next level of the lungs that I believe it is essentially just where it's ending.

652
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:54,120
So once it hits the particular region, the absorption might vary like into the bloodstream.

653
01:09:54,660 --> 01:10:02,160
I can double check that and make sure that I'm correct there, but I believe that the deposition you're just talking about,

654
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:10,350
like the fact that it's at that physical spot, what happens to it after that could be different depending on the type of particle.

655
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:13,490
And the types of like, say,

656
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:20,719
transporters or other activity that's going on in that particular set of cells that the positive particles are interacting.

657
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:37,870
What? So once something is looks like a particle is inhaled in the lungs,

658
01:10:37,870 --> 01:10:42,790
there are different ways of like removing or like kind of counteracting this deposition.

659
01:10:43,180 --> 01:10:49,320
There's like physical processes. We have something called a mucus ciliary escalator.

660
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:54,910
So we have these structures called like cilia and mucus that kind of like brush things back out of the airways.

661
01:10:56,560 --> 01:11:00,719
So this is like a physical process. It can brush things back up towards like the, like,

662
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:05,290
like let's say they made it all the way down this particle made it all the way down here to, like, brush it back up.

663
01:11:05,770 --> 01:11:09,040
And that actually moved over to the GI tract and like, swallow it.

664
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:14,450
And smoking can suppress this activity.

665
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:23,379
Actually. So this is another situation where we have a chemical, chemical interaction type of situation or an exposure chemical interaction.

666
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:29,410
So smoking, someone who is smoking may in addition to the health effects associated with smoking,

667
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:37,959
you could potentially be more susceptible to the impacts of air pollution because you don't if you're suppressing the mucosal, the ciliary escalator.

668
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:43,810
And that's like something that your body is using to deal with, like high rates of air pollution during certain times of the year, for example.

669
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:52,300
You know, potentially you have that type of like interaction there that's leading to like overall health outcome.

670
01:11:53,610 --> 01:11:59,759
You also have help from your immune system, so you get phagocytosis by what are called alveolar macrophages.

671
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:05,069
Macrophages are like one of the main immune cells. They basically swallow up pathogens.

672
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:13,890
They can also swallow up particles. And so those are like these alveolar macrophages are pretty important in this type of situation.

673
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:19,080
And then also chemicals and particles can be delivered to the lymphatic system,

674
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:26,100
this kind of parallel circulatory system, if you will, that we have so we can like dump things off into the left.

675
01:12:26,460 --> 01:12:33,510
And so there's a couple of different things that the lungs are doing to sort of like deal with exposures to chemicals.

676
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:44,720
Okay. We are absorption by skin. So skin in general is actually a pretty good barrier against toxicants.

677
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:50,600
So I'm not going to ask you to like memorize all the layers of the skin,

678
01:12:51,350 --> 01:12:57,290
but we should be aware of the epidermis which is made up of 4 to 5 like sub layers or strata.

679
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:02,150
This is the most important layer because it's like the top layer that a chemical typically is going to be encountering,

680
01:13:04,070 --> 01:13:10,670
and in particular the stratum cornea, which is like the upper the upper layer of the of the skin.

681
01:13:11,420 --> 01:13:16,790
You also have the dermis directly under that, which is mainly consists of fibroblasts,

682
01:13:16,790 --> 01:13:21,859
which make extracellular extracellular matrix, which gives skin.

683
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:29,570
It's kind of like bouncy like know goes back into position kind of material like characteristics.

684
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:35,720
So we have the strength of the cornea, which is actually pretty good at keeping a lot of stuff out.

685
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:40,130
But there are sort of susceptible spots where absorption can occur,

686
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:48,770
like things like sweat glands or hair shafts have these like openings sort of that there's kind of like areas

687
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:56,239
where a chemical could make its way via the hair shaft or some of these glands or sweat paws in that manner.

688
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:01,810
So it's not just like a monolayer across your whole skin of like this, you know, barrier.

689
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:06,020
There's like variation, especially in different parts of different regions of the body.

690
01:14:06,350 --> 01:14:10,160
You're going to see different differences.

691
01:14:11,870 --> 01:14:17,300
And that's going to impact how absorbent of the skin is or how permeable the skin is to a toxic.

692
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:25,960
Let's see here. So there's a couple of factors that can kind of modify skin absorption.

693
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,820
So one, I think kind of an intuitive thing is the integrity of the stadium cardio.

694
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:38,329
Certainly if you have some kind of abrasion on your skin, that's going to disrupt the ability of this of the skin to like keep toxicants out.

695
01:14:38,330 --> 01:14:45,910
So if you're like in the lab working with like an open or like a like a some type of abrasion, you don't want to you want to cover that up?

696
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:53,319
Of course. And, you know, that's that's an area where a chemical could gain more ready access to the

697
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:58,300
rest of the body and hydration to increase the absorption of polar molecules.

698
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:03,400
So if you're wet skin, you're exposed to a chemical that can sometimes increase absorption.

699
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:09,150
We also have chemicals that can act as essentially carriers across the skin.

700
01:15:09,160 --> 01:15:13,540
So one of these is called dimethyl sulfoxide or DMSO.

701
01:15:14,050 --> 01:15:20,530
We work with those a lot actually in toxicology labs because it's used as a solvent for the experimental chemicals we're working with.

702
01:15:20,530 --> 01:15:24,969
We need like a solvent to dissolve some of these chemicals. And so we work with DMS,

703
01:15:24,970 --> 01:15:30,220
we dissolve them sometimes in DMSO and we have to be extra careful not to get that on our skin

704
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:35,200
because if we're working with a toxicant in DMSO together that's going to look pretty efficiently,

705
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,269
like get through the skin barrier.

706
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:43,420
So we do not want to be touching, you want to be touching basically anything in the lab but definitely don't want DMSO getting under your skin,

707
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:48,010
particularly when you're working around other toxic chemicals.

708
01:15:49,030 --> 01:15:52,030
Temperature. Higher temperature can increase absorption rates.

709
01:15:53,250 --> 01:15:58,020
And then molecular size again, kind of this is kind of universal across the board.

710
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:02,339
A smaller molecule is usually going to be better absorbed in most cases.

711
01:16:02,340 --> 01:16:10,700
And that's the case with skin as well. The thickness of the stadium cornea layer is different in different regions of the body.

712
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:18,980
And so that is also correlated or inversely correlated with the the rate of absorption.

713
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:25,970
So we have a table here that shows the absorption of this pesticide malathion across different human skin regions.

714
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:35,960
And we see let's look at the spreading accordion thickness here, ranging from the skin of Australian cream in the scrotum is very thin.

715
01:16:35,990 --> 01:16:40,280
Like five micrometers up to our poles have pretty thick Australian coarse.

716
01:16:41,310 --> 01:16:49,650
So and so you can see like the four had a little bit on the center side, the back of the hand is less thick than the palm of the hand.

717
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:56,680
And so the thickness is inversely correlated with the absorption rate essentially.

718
01:16:56,680 --> 01:17:04,510
So you're seeing a lot of absorption across the scrotum and the forehead versus like the palm of the hands is going to be a bit more resistant,

719
01:17:05,620 --> 01:17:09,580
like 5% compared to like 100% for the score situation.

720
01:17:10,990 --> 01:17:14,379
And the hair follicles, again, different across different regions of the body.

721
01:17:14,380 --> 01:17:21,270
So that could add another variable to consider. Just like for whatever reason, exposure is occurring on the head.

722
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:24,370
It's like lots of hair follicles versus the palm of the hands.

723
01:17:25,210 --> 01:17:33,650
How do you get over a 100% absorption? I am going to guess that that's like a measurement error of like that.

724
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:36,990
There was. Yeah, I'm glad I saw it myself.

725
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:42,570
I'm assuming that's like maybe background that they picked up or something to do

726
01:17:42,570 --> 01:17:46,950
with the instrument was like just reading it at like a slightly higher than 100%.

727
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:58,770
Like I worked with phthalates before and there's I don't know if this is the case with metal found, but you could potentially like, you know,

728
01:17:58,770 --> 01:18:05,640
in a particular sample like measure it and get a higher like if you add in a certain amount of phthalates to a tube and then you measure it later,

729
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:09,659
you could get a higher amount than what you added into the tube because phthalates are

730
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:13,110
in the environment and could actually have been used to make the tube if it's plastic.

731
01:18:13,590 --> 01:18:17,580
So you see a lot of background of certain types of chemicals just in the environment.

732
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:25,860
It could have been well found was like, I don't know, in the in the dust of like in the house dust of the person that was like doing the experiment.

733
01:18:25,860 --> 01:18:29,940
I mean, I that's my best explanation for it. I don't actually know.

734
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:36,750
There may be something related to how this test was done, where that's not an odd reading to get, but that's my best explanation for that.

735
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:43,450
I saw that as well. Good, I. Uh, let's see here.

736
01:18:44,540 --> 01:18:47,660
Okay. So we've gone through the major routes of exposure.

737
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:52,460
There's others that have that are kind of less considered kind of across the literature.

738
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:59,030
So, for example, more and more, though, we've been looking into things like vaginal and genital urinary exposures.

739
01:18:59,450 --> 01:19:03,410
The vaginal epithelium is pretty absorbed, is like more so than skin.

740
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:11,629
And there's a potential for absorption of chemicals that are found in feminine hygiene and personal care.

741
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:15,140
Products like parabens, phthalates are used in some of these products.

742
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:23,960
And Amy Zona, this researcher, has really done some really interesting work in framing this as an environmental justice issue,

743
01:19:24,620 --> 01:19:31,279
because what we're seeing is that we have these disparities or disproportionate exposures in certain segments of the population,

744
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:40,609
like black and Latino women versus white women that are using these products and marketed to in different ways.

745
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:45,919
And there's like a whole host of like exposures, behavioral things to consider,

746
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:49,520
like differences in behavior and use of these products that we need to consider.

747
01:19:49,520 --> 01:19:57,080
And we really need to be understanding how these chemicals or these products that contain some of these chemicals are impacting health.

748
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:05,990
And so this is like this environmental justice thing. We do not want to ignore exposures just because we're not looking in the right places.

749
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:10,760
And so this has been a really important area of research that multiple people are working on.

750
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:16,100
It's like these parents of phthalates, they're American disruptors.

751
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:22,880
And if we can, like, take them out of these products or, you know, whatever we can do to kind of reduce exposures, that would be great.

752
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:36,470
And then we have even less kind of common rules of exposure that you kind of generally don't see other than in the lab, like intravenous.

753
01:20:36,890 --> 01:20:44,360
Oh, we're getting very close the time. Sorry about that. Let's see if we can pick this up next time.

754
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:54,230
I think and I think we're already over time. So any last questions before you do what people are so much for coming?

755
01:20:54,540 --> 01:21:03,420
Yeah, that's a really good question. With office hours if you have any questions about the problems.

756
01:21:07,230 --> 01:21:09,930
Well, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you.
