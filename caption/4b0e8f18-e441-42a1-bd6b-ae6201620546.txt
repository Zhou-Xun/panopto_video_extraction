1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,790
Similarly to this class, a few of our other electives in the past year have touched on topics surrounding environmental

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:13,310
justice and have discussed the intersection of climate change and racial disparities.

3
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:21,350
This class was a bit different, though, and I think it provided me with a very unique perspective on climate change and the impact climate change has,

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:24,050
particularly on marginalized communities.

5
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:32,540
This class was also different because it really gave us the opportunity to actually implement that knowledge and through the various assignments,

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:38,060
we practice different ways to communicate this information to divert audience types.

7
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,480
The assignment formats were different than any other class I've taken,

8
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:50,420
and they really forced me out of my comfort zone to develop new skills and tools to use in my work, echoing what I heard from many of my classmates.

9
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:54,650
I fell in the alarmed category when I took the six Americas quiz.

10
00:00:54,650 --> 00:01:00,530
I don't think that is surprising, especially after completing this MPH track on environmental health.

11
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:06,290
However, the part that was surprising is that only a quarter of Americans fall in this same category

12
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:10,880
of being certain that climate change is a manmade side effect of industrialization,

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:16,490
and that is having an adverse effect on the planet and our health.

14
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:21,440
I think that is where the skills were developed in this class really come into play.

15
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,430
We are armed with all this knowledge we've learned over the past two years.

16
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:31,310
But it is only really help useful if we can effectively communicate it with the world around us.

17
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:35,150
This class really helped me to see how I can outline the disparities,

18
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:41,600
adverse health outcomes in environmental disasters being faced in a community and draw the connection back to global warming,

19
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:51,110
CO2 emissions, ozone pollution and more. In order to exemplify how important climate change mitigation truly is.

20
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:58,040
I also enjoyed the assignments in this class because by allowing us to choose the community we discussed in our videos and writings,

21
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:06,260
I was able to research and learn more about the environmental issues facing the community I grew up in and the community I live in now.

22
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:11,420
I think it's easy to make the jump to panic when we hear the research and statistics

23
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,860
surrounding the fight against climate change and disputes with climate deniers.

24
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:22,100
Climate change deniers. But in this class, we learn that climate justice isn't completely out of reach.

25
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,540
I think it will take a serious commitment to renewable energy across the entire

26
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:32,270
country in order to reach our current goal of carbon neutrality by 2050.

27
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,080
But I also think that we can move in the right direction by educating people and

28
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,280
exemplifying how important this issue is for all of us to save the environment,

29
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,170
to save our population's health and even to save money.
