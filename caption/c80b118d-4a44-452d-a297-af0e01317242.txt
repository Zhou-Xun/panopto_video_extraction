1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:13,750
A good two or three years. In the next five years, I know nothing because I remember I wouldn't do that.

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:25,380
I literally some $43, I'll tell you.

3
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,730
Yeah. I was like, I got to say. Okay, so it's about starting.

4
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:37,379
Yes. I think that she was snap.

5
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:53,670
And so so the purpose of this lab is to finish lab one, which may be helpful for your homework, one which is still night Tuesday.

6
00:00:53,970 --> 00:01:04,470
Right. And and if you didn't bring your computer, I saw you are not do not have access to that lap material.

7
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:09,780
I have several copies printed over there so you can just grab one.

8
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:23,150
And so I before I before we started doing the exercise, I have zero housekeeping sink.

9
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:35,639
And the first thing is that, you know, the is for your for the sake of your performing well in your homework.

10
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,120
So I hope you can engage in the math.

11
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:46,109
And also the answer key of the lab exercise will not be posted on campus.

12
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:49,589
So it's better if you can focus.

13
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,260
Just take up in the classroom and you make best use of the time here.

14
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:02,250
And also there is no need to finish the finish.

15
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:09,700
You're like throwing all your answers out of these lab documents hand submitted to cameras.

16
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:23,650
There is no need to do this. We want great that now exercise and you can find the lab exercise off the canvas

17
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:33,670
through my Mojo's tab and there the association module periods on that point.

18
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,420
So explain why. Because they check the file and the.

19
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:50,709
And the format of the library is that I will share two part of the exercise, part one, part two.

20
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:59,710
And for each part I will give you around like 10 to 15 minutes to write or think about these questions,

21
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:10,720
and then we will go through each questions one by one for some of the questions I will ask volunteers to answer the questions.

22
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:20,830
Yeah. And first and basically I think that's what I want to do, a warmed up.

23
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:43,149
So now I will give you like around 10 minutes, 5 to 445 to finish part one, maybe not to finish us like you can do as much as you can like by 245.

24
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:58,120
And now we will go through a the answer piece for question A's through G and then give you some time to do part two if you like

25
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:09,500
already finish the if you can't finish all the questions through to G within the 10 minutes before I say we will go through as well.

26
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:16,629
You can just go ahead with doing exercise full hour two.

27
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:27,670
I'm sorry, I realize that I seem to be not on task in my house here.

28
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:42,420
Basically like now you can just start doing your exercise and I will be around me.

29
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,080
Any questions you can ask me? Yeah.

30
00:04:49,370 --> 00:05:53,000
Just one. Why shouldn't. Oh, by the way, like for this exercise, you can discuss these classmates and you can also want to also do it individually.

31
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,520
Yeah, if you want to. Working on well, like no more than three people.

32
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:32,510
She's going to blow your and.

33
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:58,250
Think. Exactly.

34
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:13,640
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

35
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:35,770
Like, I mean, you know, you can shoot for 10 minutes because I can't sit down for a serious matter.

36
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,809
Where's the possibility to actually get into what?

37
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:57,690
You just can't sit there and to listen to it and start to see it.

38
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:07,020
Yeah, I think. Yeah.

39
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:29,530
So it's interesting because all of this is from the movies.

40
00:08:42,960 --> 00:09:50,020
In those. It's a position you and your company can try to convince people that you can.

41
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:58,550
You can. You can just talk to me.

42
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,780
I'm not interested.

43
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:10,190
You can tell me what I think is too much. Yeah.

44
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:20,030
Let's do this. That's all you can say.

45
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,990
So, of course, the big one is one, but wouldn't change me.

46
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:45,510
It's an age for my students when it comes to saying, you know, you want to know the truth about for me.

47
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,640
There are some people who write these things.

48
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:55,290
This is this isn't anybody, because these are the other houses.

49
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,610
You did not hear this. I also.

50
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:14,780
You can choose classes, which reminds you of starting in the economy.

51
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:26,800
It's easy, and I know I'm not Haitian sometimes.

52
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:47,800
Here. You can see the transcript. I didn't see it because I couldn't finish it.

53
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:54,600
Yes. And that's. Yeah. Yeah, I know.

54
00:11:55,090 --> 00:12:11,900
It was supposed to be.

55
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:21,580
Did you see doing this?

56
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:44,290
Because it's like I just thought that was just like.

57
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:50,050
Yeah, it was just it was this.

58
00:12:51,130 --> 00:13:16,900
Oh, I just think if you even if you're a woman, if they had when they didn't want to do it under consistency, I think they still get it.

59
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:26,230
I really do. Just like I don't.

60
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,220
Right. Yeah.

61
00:13:31,500 --> 00:14:03,100
Well, it's these people haven't done enough here and sort of, you know, I guess it's not it's usually said,

62
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:11,469
okay, so, um, well, start here for your own money because that's good activity.

63
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:20,760
So I will go see the answer keys for these questions for someone.

64
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:40,480
The first question, the actual question according to the account if the like had 100 girls had their first menstrual period after their 11/1 day.

65
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:54,910
Well the proportion of people who developed breast cancer 40 years later did the same as what you saying more than what we observed in real life.

66
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:10,420
So that for the second question, I want to give you a chance to volunteer to say out your answers and a one in tears.

67
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,120
You only have 10 seconds to hesitate, so.

68
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,690
No. So why do you think now?

69
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:38,070
Because we can't turn back time and change their exposure and then observe them for 40 years and see the same.

70
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:48,350
Now, basically, like them from what the problem described is the actual life experience.

71
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:52,490
And in this actual I've experienced, everybody was exposed.

72
00:15:52,500 --> 00:16:00,650
So if we want to answer the counterfactual question, we need to have a group to grow for and expose that.

73
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,290
Yeah, but just like what you said,

74
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:13,980
we cannot like we don't have a time machine to go back to the time to make them and expose and observe their outcomes.

75
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:36,110
So. Well, the third question, using the notation to to express the counterfactual question.

76
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:59,389
Yes, I can do. So basically the question the counterfactual as well would be you had everybody in and everybody were triggered.

77
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:05,510
Or we say had everybody had their head ever go,

78
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:16,510
had their first met fantastical period before their first day, what's their counterfactual outcome would be?

79
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:27,799
And because we are observing as a population now, so we would need to know the probability of the counterfactual outcome.

80
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:40,490
If everybody in this population were trained as would this probability be same or different from probability of having

81
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:50,530
an outcome that is developing the of breast cancer aids for everybody has been associated in these population.

82
00:17:53,450 --> 00:18:11,599
So for the question any volunteers one to speak out your answers or your thoughts so we can get a group,

83
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:20,329
a control group of 500 girls as well with the same characteristics as the group that we are studying and the those

84
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:28,550
also that have the same carcinogenic exposures and but without any mark so that we can compare the differences.

85
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:43,999
Yeah. Like, you know, do you have any thoughts regarding like I think this is exactly the group of people we want to find.

86
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:52,220
If we want to answer the counterfactual concern about did you have any thoughts on how to find such a group of people?

87
00:18:54,860 --> 00:19:06,019
Or like, how can we actually answer the average treatment causal effect questions if we only have a group

88
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:12,560
of people that is so we would have to start at the same time and observe them for 40 years.

89
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,489
So I guess you can. Yeah, yeah.

90
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:21,810
In retrospect, didn't take 40 years to go.

91
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:28,219
Can't we just study about people who do not have breast cancer when they're under 50 years

92
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:35,810
of age and ask them when exactly they had their first period and going back just a thought.

93
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:44,299
I yeah, I think that's one that's one way, but that's not the most ideal way.

94
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:56,650
Yeah, it would be to turn back time again in the same group but like a similar group almost like saying actually like,

95
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:59,500
well we want to answer the average treatment.

96
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:10,820
Cause I think what's true, what we like, what experiments we can, we possibly can do, like in real life, what could be in real life?

97
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:14,510
Okay. Yeah.

98
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:22,690
I mean, what is the most ideal way to do this is if they all had twins, like, in a realistic sense.

99
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,720
But I don't. Think this is really, really ideally possible.

100
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:34,080
Any other thoughts? I actually like.

101
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,920
We just need to do a randomization experiment, right?

102
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:50,220
Although, like, it's actually impossible to randomize who will have a manika before this person will have come after eight of its first day.

103
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:58,150
That's basically what we do if we want to answer the questions of average treatment.

104
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:04,650
In fact, we just randomly, randomly assign some girls to be in that exposed group.

105
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,620
That is how there are men madoc before and out of sports and other groups randomly

106
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:16,980
assigned to another group that have their back up after their first day.

107
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:21,630
Right. So what you're being like you can't really do this assignment because it's a biological,

108
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:32,370
you can't really change or the point here that you need to know how we could possibly do it.

109
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:44,070
Because even if like in current in modern times, maybe we cannot achieve this spot, maybe in the future with the technology now developing, who knows?

110
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:50,550
So about like the time machine thing, I don't think it's really like something could be possibly achieved.

111
00:21:50,560 --> 00:22:03,920
So and also another source regarding this question and adds, even if with observational studies you still can't answer causal questions.

112
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:10,350
So. So another example group of people to answer these calls,

113
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:18,540
counterfactual question just use the black group of girls who had their manifests after the first

114
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:27,509
day and compare whether they developed breast cancer without crossing over original group.

115
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:35,909
I think that's one of the answer when you start and this is also acceptable but is just to you

116
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:45,720
need to give you mind or some assumptions to make this to make this association association up,

117
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,460
to make these associations approximate causation.

118
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:57,450
Okay. So do you mind restating that the response to this question?

119
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,540
Yeah. Okay. So like, there are actually there are two ways.

120
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:08,870
Like the first the most ideal one is just do a randomized experiment trials,

121
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:17,910
or you randomly assign some girls who have manic before Ilana's first day and another and some

122
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:25,500
others were randomly assigned to have their first two Manica after their L.A. first thing.

123
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:31,690
And then you compare you compare them 40 years later.

124
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:34,830
What's the proportion of these two groups of people have?

125
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:49,290
Breast cancer and another another approach to this and just like to just enact a comparison group to answer these counterfactual questions also.

126
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:52,350
It's just like you can do an observational study.

127
00:23:52,350 --> 00:24:03,450
So you just randomly you just not randomly just select a group of people who satisfy the criteria of having their Monica after their 11/1 thing.

128
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:07,680
In this case, actually, what you've got is causation, is association,

129
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:18,050
but with some assumptions in your mind, you can like carefully approximate association to causation.

130
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,470
It's it's not so perfect way, but you just know you can do it this way.

131
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:26,190
You can do so for.

132
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:48,160
Question. He personally, I think I will answer it would depends on like which example you gave in question.

133
00:24:48,440 --> 00:25:00,649
So if like if if you give an example of doing them, rather makes like an randomized experiment.

134
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:12,140
So you definitely have these two groups are exchangeable, right, because you are randomly allocate them to different exposure levels.

135
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:23,149
But if you just select a group who were not exposed to, you cannot guarantee that these two groups are exchanged.

136
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:39,950
When asked why you need to be careful to make the association broken down the causation question out, I'm not sure.

137
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:45,380
Like anyway, I want to write your answers on the whiteboard.

138
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,720
I'll give you a chance to show your answers.

139
00:25:52,480 --> 00:26:16,680
Just one audience here. Anyway, I want to have a try and I want to try to write your answers regarding question on the whiteboard.

140
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:57,760
Can you see this plan contingent? This is.

141
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:32,480
Yeah. Yeah. I think that's basically what's the answer or you can write off this is most recent simple way, but you can file easy for more easy.

142
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:37,630
And I'm standing I'm just to expand it so.

143
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:48,670
And more. As a way that looks like more complicated.

144
00:27:48,870 --> 00:28:03,169
So among those who actually exposed that, had they been an expose, what's the probability of developing that outcome in this group of people?

145
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:15,110
And this should equal to the probability of developing the counterfactual outcome and everybody being exposed in those who

146
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:31,220
are exposed and also given and also equals to the counterfactual probability of every body in this population were exposed.

147
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:53,980
At the same time, another inclusion had to be so among those who are exposed, actually exposed,

148
00:28:54,560 --> 00:29:02,510
had they been had they been exposed to one, the probability of having that outcome.

149
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:14,930
And also it should be equal to the probability of how among those who are actually exposed, have they been exposed?

150
00:29:15,470 --> 00:29:21,170
What's the probability of developing outcome and equal to the probability of that

151
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:27,650
counterfactual outcome and everybody everybody in this population being exposed to that.

152
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:36,830
Okay. So we'll have like one minute for the last question, Jean.

153
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:51,980
So so because of the two different situations, I give you one question.

154
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:59,750
If it is for the situation of doing a randomized driven trial, then in this court, in this case,

155
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:11,780
like that's why these two groups should be exchangeable at the time when they were born, so that you can answer the causal questions.

156
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:22,759
And if it's if it if it was for another situation and then just to choose a group who are exposed and then the

157
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:34,070
characteristics before the exposure pool for this group would still be differential between exposed and exposed.

158
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,350
For example, the gene and their birth may be different.

159
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:51,020
So now I will give you, do I think, around 15 minutes to answer part D.

160
00:30:51,020 --> 00:31:02,600
So I will ask someone curious or I would just go through the next several questions at 315.

161
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:16,810
So since.

162
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:24,650
We only have three questions for part two.

163
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:30,760
So again, feel free to discuss with your customers if you like.

164
00:32:38,940 --> 00:33:14,140
She's. You know, she's.

165
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:31,940
He's. He's.

166
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:20,440
I mean. We keep making dramatic.

167
00:35:52,780 --> 00:36:33,850
This is not something we haven't seen here in the U.S. That's not what I thought.

168
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:45,370
Okay. Because that's like when I look at the calculations, I think so.

169
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:49,180
I think about you. Why are you still working?

170
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:59,430
Are you done yet? Yeah, but you have people calling it a condition of somebody else.

171
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:18,340
10%. 2% rate. Do you need to do what you call social media posting by yourself?

172
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:25,780
So you're saying like this is just me because of position?

173
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,580
Yes. Okay. Okay.

174
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,240
But it's just one more season.

175
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:49,569
So from the second point, I guess like when they are talking about content,

176
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:57,930
that 12 months seems really cool, but you had to think about a little time machine and things like, right.

177
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:21,050
It is the thing that you want to do something that they just went away and just when I guess when it's just like something's not right,

178
00:38:21,070 --> 00:38:24,960
you just want to say what really happens, right?

179
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:33,830
Yeah. Yeah.

180
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:39,840
I mean.

181
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:43,130
These children. I mean, if they're not causing you're putting something on because he couldn't do it when he retired.

182
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:58,910
I think there has to be something. But then you want to keep doing this.

183
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:02,660
You're going to write this book.

184
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:06,500
You I think I may try.

185
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:38,820
Yeah. And then, you know, we had a little bit confusion which people two users and each of the initial groups with 50 and 95, 540 500.

186
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:48,100
And then we have the ones. I think it's because I see whiteness in 600 out of 5000.

187
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:57,270
Consistent. Question H He's asking for association, right?

188
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:06,910
So asking for an association means to use data which you actually officer doesn't change.

189
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:19,690
So. So.

190
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:24,650
Not yet. Yeah, that's.

191
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,850
Which is good. Yeah. Yeah.

192
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,350
This is like we're doing some homework and it's like.

193
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,930
Yeah, I just don't know yet.

194
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:42,959
Is this. Is the observed?

195
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:58,050
Is this. Yes. Yes.

196
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:06,630
That's not enough for them.

197
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:11,950
Nothing compared to the actions.

198
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:25,600
I think. It is fictional.

199
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:59,830
I think it is great that his sincerity in his criticisms and associations customs is because of the differences between nations.

200
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:07,500
But what you see is association because. Yeah.

201
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:18,580
Interesting. That's what they. This was more of the same association.

202
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:51,420
Excellent. And this one goes to show you some of these conditions between.

203
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:07,480
Okay. So we'll start with this question.

204
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:17,860
Age Pension Age asks for association between early mammal and development of breast cancer.

205
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,280
So suddenly he's asking for association.

206
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:26,950
So you actually need to you will you will use the data to actually observe.

207
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:35,560
So the type of probability you will use to answer the association question is conditional property.

208
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:43,540
So you are teaching now what is the probability of developing that outcome?

209
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:56,400
At least now people who are exposed and whether this probability is different or saying from the probability of.

210
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:07,180
Developing the outcome among those who were actually exposed and this to promote share

211
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:12,830
saying that you can see that there is no association there that if there are different,

212
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:22,360
you can say there is an association. So among those who are actually exposed, there are like 500 people.

213
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:28,370
Right. And those who develop cell outcome is 15.

214
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:40,309
So the probabilities point one and among those who are actually exposed, there are 4005 hundred.

215
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:43,340
Right. So can develop the outcome.

216
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:53,610
So the probability of be point oh shoot these two are these two conditional probability are different.

217
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:59,480
So you can see that there is an association between the exposure and having the outcome.

218
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:11,480
The whole question I ask it is asking whether there is a causal effect.

219
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:17,480
So could you just repeat again? Is there an association between those two or not?

220
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:27,350
There is no. There is no. Because the probability of developing an outcome among those exposed and is different

221
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:31,100
from the probability of developing an outcome among those who are an exposure.

222
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:35,060
These two numbers are different. So there is an association.

223
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:48,800
Okay. So for question, I is asking the causal effect between the exposure, whether there is a causal effect of the exposure on the outcome.

224
00:46:49,310 --> 00:47:01,790
And to answer the causal question. You all need to have the think about the counterfactual experience concentration.

225
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:12,620
So have that. So basically this formula you need to know this quantity and this quantity and everybody being

226
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:19,820
cheated or which they had everybody being exposed was their probability of developing the outcome.

227
00:47:20,450 --> 00:47:28,460
So like the I guess the second sentence sums up Trump describe that has everybody.

228
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:41,719
So this quantity will be everybody being exposed everybody would be 500 plus 4005 hundred.

229
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,160
Right. So how many develop the outcome?

230
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:54,530
Oh, sorry. So this is the total number of people in this population, right?

231
00:47:56,270 --> 00:48:01,940
Those who are actually exposed and those who are actually and expose them.

232
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:07,990
And how have they all been exposed to how many developed outcomes?

233
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:18,110
Exactly right. So this quantity would be .12.

234
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:29,130
And for this quantity, it would be like. I'm sorry.

235
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,310
It's kind of messy for this court.

236
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:43,620
It'll be like still the same group up a whole population council and have they all are being exposed to only

237
00:48:44,070 --> 00:48:55,350
50 develop outcome so the probability would be point of one so this quantity these two quantities are equal,

238
00:48:55,350 --> 00:49:04,170
right? So we can say that there is there is an causal effect of exposure on outcome searches.

239
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:09,990
So every time you are talking about causal effect, you have to use the marginal probability.

240
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,370
Yeah. Yeah. So when you are talking about association, you have to do the condition of probability.

241
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:18,659
Yes, always. Yes, maybe.

242
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:28,710
Not always. But at least in this situation, you can only get the marginal probability for that cost.

243
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:33,869
But if I had the data about who was like between the groups, if I had this data,

244
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:40,200
I could use the conditional probability to measure to causal were things I,

245
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:48,740
I don't think I can answer you with certainty about a theory and think maybe a concrete example situation.

246
00:49:48,780 --> 00:50:00,450
Right. So we should like you said, I think it depends on the case, but most of the time we use marginal probability for causal questions.

247
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:15,629
But that what if you do not have information how marginal you like information, maybe you need other approximation to get a causal estimates.

248
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:19,470
But I'm not sure now because there is no concrete examples.

249
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,560
Is there a reason why you didn't? It is the counterfactual probability to get the causal effect.

250
00:50:27,510 --> 00:50:41,010
So let me ask you, how do you frame what is the causal effect if the counterfactual probabilities are equal or like we can see

251
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:52,229
like the causal effect of early man of breast cancer means here is a group of people who had who had exposed,

252
00:50:52,230 --> 00:51:02,820
who had early manner a man. And we know that the proportion of those people who develop breast cancer, this is what we observed.

253
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:14,130
If we want to answer the causal question, we need to know had this group of people were not exposed or did not have early,

254
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:17,880
what their probability of developing breast cancer. Right.

255
00:51:18,330 --> 00:51:30,479
So this is like a comparison between sentences because so I think it's like on the board it's the same but you just didn't

256
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:41,400
use the like y superscript equals zero for that word so you don't have to write those words I guess is what I'm asking now.

257
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:49,130
Yeah. I think for, I think for causal question.

258
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:57,690
You must use the superscript triad because that stands for a gap counterfactual situation.

259
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:17,070
Okay. So well the last question actually the last question is asking is association is causation, right.

260
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:32,339
So like we need to, we need to test to whether the assumption of making an association or causation, whether it is fulfilled.

261
00:52:32,340 --> 00:52:45,450
So one of the one of the assumption would be that would be exchange ability right to think because only when two groups you observed are exchangeable,

262
00:52:45,450 --> 00:52:52,560
you can say that if there is a association between that exposure and outcome,

263
00:52:52,840 --> 00:53:03,419
it can be approximate as causation because there is no other factor that can influence the occurrence of the outcome except the exposure, right?

264
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,340
If two groups are exchangeable.

265
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:20,760
So basically you need to test together these two, whether these two this white accretion or these two equation are fulfilled.

266
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:26,970
Right. So I think from question.

267
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:34,170
All right. We know this quantity. We know these quantity of these quantity arrived.

268
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,780
These two quantity from here from question. So marginal.

269
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,120
Marginal probability.

270
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:51,300
So if you need to know why there are these equation and these equations fulfill, you need to find out the value for this one or this one.

271
00:53:52,020 --> 00:54:03,030
And why not this one? Right. And so the problem also said, like assuming consistency.

272
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:15,950
So what are they saying? So I say assuming consistency means that for a group of people who actually are exposed or who actually are exposed,

273
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:26,730
had we sent a had we send them back, if we have a time machine, they will have the same outcome every time.

274
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:38,040
Right? So which means that for those exposed or those exposed are counterfactual outcome of had

275
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:47,790
they been exposed to be actually exactly the same as what we observed in real life.

276
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:55,590
Right. So the probability about those who actually are exposed to the probability of those,

277
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:02,199
the probability of developing an outcome among those who actually are exposed will be exactly the same

278
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:14,940
once their the probability of their counterfactual counterfactual outcome among the same group of people.

279
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:19,770
Right. So we already have this quantity, right.

280
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:24,150
From the question h we answer here.

281
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:32,650
So this probability will be lined up.

282
00:55:35,270 --> 00:55:47,870
2.02 and this probability would be calculated here and point a lot, right?

283
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:53,950
So. .02 is not equal. 2.001.0 y.

284
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:58,550
Right. So actually this equation is not fulfilled.

285
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,080
So basically on here,

286
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:13,489
we can see now that we can see that the exchange ability between these two group were not satisfying because if you cause the exchange,

287
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:18,710
but you must be matched for both of these two equations.

288
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:29,630
And so we can also still calculate that for these both for the second equation,

289
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:40,520
these quantities among those who are actually among those who actually expose their quality of having the counterfactual outcome,

290
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:54,499
have they been exposed every time these property will be equal to what we are sorry, what we observe in real life?

291
00:56:54,500 --> 00:57:00,080
Right. So now those who expose the probability of developing the outcome.

292
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:04,820
So this one would be what we calculate here.

293
00:57:06,110 --> 00:57:09,290
So .01.

294
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:14,170
Right. And this one we calculate here.

295
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:19,640
.012. So these two are still different.

296
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:32,880
Right. So this means that the exchange ability between these two groups, the explosive exposed, were not satisfied.

297
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:37,079
So definitely the causation is not association.

298
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:46,740
The causation maybe. Find like why the exposure is affected.

299
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:56,190
It is associated with the outcome maybe because of the influence of other variables that is different between these two girls.

300
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:02,070
So not exactly the cause of the exposure.

301
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:24,419
Yeah. Because I understand about this.

302
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:27,450
I usually have the first question, but I just wanted to clarify.

303
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:37,200
So with the groups of like 500 girls and another hypothetical 500 girl, you say that they would only be exchangeable,

304
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:45,290
like in the scenario where you randomly assign them to something like clinical treatment or something that would like induce like

305
00:58:45,690 --> 00:58:54,740
an early period like in that kind of scenario or is it like that they're also going to assign them other types of followers?

306
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:02,850
I guess. Why not? Yeah, I think they are only exchangeable if we do randomly assigned out people, right?

307
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:10,950
I think so. It's like make them experiment around randomization.

308
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:17,999
I think you need to imagine that at the time they were receiving their randomization

309
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:25,000
and they still don't know whether they when they were out that felt a lot of trouble.

310
00:59:25,470 --> 00:59:39,210
So I will I will randomly assign some people to this girl and we assume they are all people that I'm not familiar with you as my others.

311
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:43,230
You know, we stay on the average about them.

312
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:48,050
And so that's all I really like possible and like a very theoretical way.

313
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:51,890
Yeah. Like in real life that you can't do that.

314
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:58,590
That's also, you know, I think like.

315
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,960
I just was like, Yeah, I know.

316
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,770
I can be in the front.
