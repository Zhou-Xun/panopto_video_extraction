1
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:09,540
Yeah. I wasn't holding you to it. And I'm going to add to from the.

2
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:18,000
So yeah, I guess I'm going to have to get you out of here.

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,530
I'm like, All right.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,370
All right, everybody, you got a lot to talk about today, so that's great.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,210
So we're going to finish. You know, I want to do a story about schizophrenia.

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,240
So this is this is why I just want to emphasize, it's really important you do the readings for each week.

7
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,280
You know, it's you just you've got to kind of get those come in on Monday knowing, you know,

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:51,299
having done those and because it's it will really help you learn more about what we're talking about.

9
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,320
Much, much so today.

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,530
We're going to continue the kind of conversation we started on Monday,

11
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:04,590
which is we've talked a little bit about how genetic and environmental risk factors for schizophrenia work together and say,

12
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,040
I'm going to tell you a story and I might tell it to you as a story, you know.

13
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:15,330
So I want to start with a caveat that I'm going to just like all stories, it's like more complicated than what I'm going to present today.

14
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,800
So I'm going to present and present a story that is true but is also incomplete.

15
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:30,110
Okay. But I'm going to tell you how epidemiology has been instrumental in helping us identify at least one cause of at least one form of disease.

16
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:40,569
Before I do that, I want to remind you that one of the videos that you watched or that was assigned for this week

17
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:48,330
was about why the data that we have on schizophrenia are limited in the way they are limited.

18
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:57,340
Given that most of this research I want to show you today just what I showed you on Monday comes from one of European countries.

19
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,000
Why is this the case? Why is this in Switzerland?

20
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,160
Because they have a registry deficit? Yes, because is a rare condition.

21
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:12,730
So the prevalence of schizophrenia, depending on sort of where you are in about a half a percent to 1% of the whole population.

22
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:16,110
Right. So that means and that the incidence is even lower than that. Right.

23
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:19,450
So the prevalence prevalence is instead of two times duration.

24
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,550
Okay. So incidence is we are orders of magnitude smaller than a percent a year.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,980
So if I want to identify new cases of schizophrenia, I literally need samples of thousands of people.

26
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,480
Or if you're Sweden, that's got they've got a population of about this the size of Michigan.

27
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:42,970
So all of Michigan imagine that we have this whole registry that and I could use this kind of work that do this kind of work in America.

28
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:49,460
We don't have those kinds of things in America like there is no registry, like there is a health care registry like this.

29
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:54,879
If we have Medicaid registries, we have Medicare registries, private insurance,

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:01,390
there's health care records that if you had seen here at Michigan and if you went and got seen at Sparrow Health at East Lansing,

31
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:08,260
they may or may not have any. In fact, they probably would have no communication with each other unless you directly transferred your records over.

32
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:13,510
So there is no place in which we know we've got total information on the population.

33
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,890
And so that most of what I'm going to show you is from these these specific these countries, this is Norway, Sweden, Finland.

34
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,249
So that the other thing I want to just kind of prime you want to remind you on is about your immune system.

35
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,490
So we've all gotten a crash course in immunity based on COVID.

36
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,860
And we have all you know, if you're in this room, you've almost certainly got a shot.

37
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,860
Right. And like, what did that what did that vaccine do?

38
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,830
How did that work? Yeah.

39
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:55,480
Okay. I'm not sure that's all right. Definitely. Didn't it basically, like, give you, like, inactive viruses?

40
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,530
That way you can build up immunity if you were to come in contact with, like, a live virus.

41
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:08,590
So. Right. So that vaccine had part of apparently like this like spike protein on the outside of this of the COVID virus.

42
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:17,710
If I was talking about whatever the official name is and that trained our immune system to develop something called antibodies.

43
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:24,730
So when you get exposed to COVID, which is really just a matter of when, not if at the point that we're going,

44
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,350
that it wouldn't be the first time you've seen it before, that your immune system.

45
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:34,240
And so what that means is that you would be able to mount an immune response faster because it's

46
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:43,840
almost like thinking about it is like it's it's it knows what to do when it encounters this,

47
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,160
this, this thing. So that is what we call adaptive immunity.

48
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:53,690
I'm going to show you that in a second. You see antibodies here. But there's also this other part of the immune system, the innate immune response.

49
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:59,550
This is like. It's mucus in your gut lining and stuff that kind of prevent stuff from getting in.

50
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:11,100
But if it gets in the way, your body both has specific and nonspecific ways to react to it.

51
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,270
So again, your adaptive immune system.

52
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:21,059
So this is again the idea of you're going to recognize this specific pathogen.

53
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,270
So when you're exposed in the future can respond more quickly.

54
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:31,530
For some things, not all things, but there are some illnesses that you really only get once because afterwards your body kind of becomes immune.

55
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:36,359
So like the vast majority of us will never get chickenpox again or will not experience shingles,

56
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,290
because that's something that really seems to like, for whatever reason for our immune system, that that seems to to stick.

57
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:49,170
Well, okay. And so this is all going to become apparent and why we need to know about this later in the lecture.

58
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:55,799
So antibodies are just proteins and sugar that are in our that are circulating in our blood.

59
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,910
They are created by our immune system, these b b lymphocytes.

60
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,410
Again, it's this kind of specific lock and key mechanism.

61
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:10,049
The idea is the antibody attaches to the pathogen,

62
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:17,490
the antigen that's floating around in your body that prevents it from attacking the blood cells or that pretends it protects it

63
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:26,850
prevents that antigen that's in this case like COVID from infecting your cells because it's got this label of the antibody,

64
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,280
which then tells the rest of your immune system, hey, come kill this thing at the same time.

65
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:38,009
It's supposed to be here. Okay? So this is this is important because we're going to talk about autoimmune disorders today.

66
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:43,979
And an autoimmune disorder is a situation where in many cases, not all cases, but in many cases,

67
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:50,310
the body is making antibodies to something that it should not be making antibodies to.

68
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:57,719
So in type one diabetes, for example, the body makes antibodies to the beta cells in the pancreas and destroys the beta cells.

69
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,250
Your papers are what produce insulin. And so without those you don't make insulin.

70
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:08,159
Without insulin, you don't make it so that this this.

71
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,569
But the reason people with type one diabetes lose their beta cells but not the rest

72
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:16,980
of the pancreas is because they are making antibodies directly for these beta cells.

73
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:24,480
Okay. So questions about that before I tell you or I tell you the story.

74
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,089
Right. So and so. So this I was in the stage crew when I was in high school.

75
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,950
And I see the rest of you prefer to work backstage. Okay.

76
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:44,370
And then you front stage folks who are actors, your friends, we didn't want to go to your party anyway.

77
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:54,600
So okay, so the first thing that we and I'm going to present these observations because that's really what they are, things that people noticed.

78
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,819
So the first thing that people noticed is that people who go on to develop schizophrenia as

79
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:09,210
when they become adults are more likely to be born in winter months than in some months,

80
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,810
and that this seasonality of birth pattern is not really observed for mental illness writ large.

81
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,440
It seems to be something specific to the frame.

82
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,190
So this is an example of a study that looked at this. So first of all, I want you to notice a couple of things.

83
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,550
One is the wide confidence bands first thing.

84
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,730
The second is that the risk effect here is very, very modest.

85
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:37,890
So any of you who have winter births, sometimes I show this, some people I immediately think of, don't worry about it, it's okay.

86
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,030
Sure. So but the point is, is that it's a modest effect. But it's it's interesting.

87
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,319
Right. And it's not expected.

88
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:50,280
And we don't really have like an off the shelf explanation as to why there would be a seasonal birth effects for something that,

89
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,530
you know, kind of doesn't show up until many, many years later. So this is more recent data.

90
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:03,600
But again, it kind of shows you this is interesting because it's comparing the patients in this case as people with schizophrenia to their siblings.

91
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,290
And you can see, again, this is the same array of months across the x axis.

92
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:10,560
And so this is much more compelling than the graph I just showed you.

93
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,180
Again, notice the y axis. This y axis still only goes to 1.15.

94
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,770
Okay? So it looks like it's a big effect.

95
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:22,740
But it to me, I always want to point out you can make anything look impressive without changing the scale on the axis.

96
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,850
But the point is, is that these are comparing people with schizophrenia to their siblings.

97
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:34,020
Okay. So the siblings are also a little bit for whatever reason, like these that are coming from families that tend to have kids more in the winter.

98
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:41,130
You can see that way, way, way more likely to be born in the winter if they develop schizophrenia relative to their sibling.

99
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:50,549
And there's debate as to whether this has changed over time as women have gotten greater access to more effective birth control.

100
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,500
Right. So it's a little bit faster, a little bit more effectively than you could in the past.

101
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,559
And so it would actually kind of we if there is evidence that we don't see the seasonal birth effect as strongly anymore,

102
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,860
but that's part of that we think is due to just access to birth control. Okay.

103
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:21,610
So now this is from Sweden. The one of the things what would make you feel more confident about this season of birth control?

104
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:25,550
Decrease your risk. Just it would change.

105
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:33,890
So the presumption is that it would it could change when women choose to have a baby.

106
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:39,499
So it wouldn't change. It wouldn't reduce your risk. It would reduce the risk of this.

107
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,450
But it would sort of change who is actually having babies in the winter versus the springtime.

108
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,390
So the assumption that they have more control to choose to have their babies more.

109
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:56,090
Not during Christmas time. Right. Yeah. That would be the that would be the assumption that they that they would exert control over

110
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:01,190
that in a manner that would potentially like reduce the likelihood of a went to first,

111
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,480
correct? Yes. I should have I should have like a lower.

112
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:11,690
Like this, like. But like the like it's affected as well.

113
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,479
And as we're going to talk about, like, because we it is still the case that if you have an extreme psychiatric disorder,

114
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:21,590
you're more likely to have your child is more likely to have a psychiatric disorder.

115
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:26,419
And so women with a psychiatric care maybe less likely to use birth control.

116
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,600
So the effect might get even potentially might be greater.

117
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:39,710
But the point is, is like these are data pre the pill and so it's the whether I should say it is.

118
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:44,900
So this is actually more research. I think this is a good this will come back actually when we talk about autism.

119
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,370
So with autism is one of the only other examples where there was a season of birth effect.

120
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,370
Now autism the diagnosis of autism is strongly correlated with socioeconomic status in the United States.

121
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:03,890
That is, it is far more common among higher families and higher as high as women are far,

122
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:08,270
far, far more likely to use birth control and not have winter births.

123
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,660
So the. So with autism, we had a season of birth effect and now we don't have a season.

124
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:25,070
So that's that's that's why I mean. Yes. So I'm showing you stuff for the Northern Hemisphere, you might say, but what about the Southern Hemisphere?

125
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:30,070
Right. Maybe this is just Christmas time stuff, right? So the answer is even if you work.

126
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,180
So this is all different countries you can see and this is the odds ratio of one.

127
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:40,300
This is showing you the seasonal birth effect for Winter Springs compared to summer autumn births.

128
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,420
Where is Australia? You not up here. Around here somewhere.

129
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:52,930
Maybe have a different. That's okay. So they've also replicated this in the southern hemisphere again.

130
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,050
So this is during the Southern Hemisphere winter.

131
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:01,659
So this is going to be June, July, August. So it's not just like the holidays, right?

132
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:06,190
But that's been consistent. But you can kind of see these different studies here showing the consistency.

133
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,909
So that's the first findings is the first observation.

134
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:16,270
Pardon me, not even to find it. The first observation is that people want to develop schizophrenia in their late teens and early twenties,

135
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:21,640
are more likely to be born in the winter compared to people who do not give up schizophrenia.

136
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:25,390
That's the first observation. So what happens in the winter?

137
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,380
Perhaps some things happen in the winter. Yeah.

138
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,590
Plus some less sunlight. Yep. Good. What else? Everything.

139
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:38,990
Yeah. The flu. Right. So there's this, you know, there's this seasonal.

140
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:46,709
So the second. Observation. And so this is flu data from I was 20 years old now, but this is going to look the same.

141
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,890
So this is weeks of the year. So this is week one.

142
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:53,969
So January 1st, week of January 1st, going all the way over to December.

143
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:59,880
And you can see that the flu kind of really gets going and week 12 is March.

144
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,220
Okay. So this is kind of what you do know. It's not winter.

145
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:06,060
We don't necessarily think about others winter except here at Michigan where of course we know it can snow through May.

146
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:18,090
But the point is, is that there's there we see that flu really kind of is getting going in the early actually late winter early spring it's.

147
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:26,229
And prior studies had shown that exposure at this data is not great,

148
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:40,660
but had suggested that being in utero that is being done by a fetus and having the mom get exposed to influenza was associated in this case.

149
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:44,320
You can see that seems to. None of these are statistically significant.

150
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,080
But there's this order issue of seven out of ten times that happens in the first trimester.

151
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:56,440
This actually doesn't line up with ICU number. The fact I just told you actually is what you would expect it to be, trimester three.

152
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,920
So kind of just what it just pointed out. It's never as clean as it looks.

153
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,020
But the and this is just one, one study. But but the.

154
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:19,320
Studies had suggested that being exposed in utero to an infectious agent was associated with later development of schizophrenia in adulthood.

155
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:25,500
There is some potential biological mechanism for this. So this is in mice.

156
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,800
So of course we don't have a good animal model of schizophrenia.

157
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:36,460
But what this is suggesting is that mice who were exposed to influenza while they were in utero have less.

158
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,899
They behave a little bit more anxiously. Okay.

159
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:44,760
So this is comparing time in this open field test, which is just like a big space.

160
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,660
And mice don't really like to be out in the open. They want to kind of scurry around the sides.

161
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:56,490
And so if this mouse happened to be exposed to influenza while it was in utero, it spends less time in these open field tests.

162
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:01,710
So there is some potential mechanism, a mechanism as to what might be happening here.

163
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:06,540
Of course, things aren't as simple as they look.

164
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,280
So I told you that on Monday that there is a strong genetic influence of schizophrenia,

165
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,790
although even a strong genetic influence we don't fully understand.

166
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,030
Can we talk about how it might shape environmental risk?

167
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,030
Well, I'm going to this is just this this is on the next slide. It's just a enlargement of the panel.

168
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:34,380
See here. So let me walk you through this. So this first is asking, does mom have a history of a psychiatric disorder, schizophrenia, specifically?

169
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:38,220
Does mom have a history of a psychiatric disorder? No. Yes.

170
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:47,190
No. Yes. And this is did the child experience the child who's either going to go on to have it develop schizophrenia or not?

171
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,570
Did they experience an infection five years before Mom?

172
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:58,800
Or five? Was there an infection during pregnancy?

173
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:08,850
No. No. Yes. Yes. And so what you see first is this one, which is if mom has a history of psychiatric disorder, the likelihood that the child has.

174
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:15,000
In this case, we're looking at non effective psychosis, which is schizophrenia is a form of non effective psychosis.

175
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:19,710
We see this odd ratios about three. Okay. So that's showing the genetic effect.

176
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:28,170
This panel right here, the second panel, the third panel is now saying mom does not have a history of psychosis, but there is an infection.

177
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,460
And what we see is there is this modest relationship here.

178
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:38,820
Okay. So this this effect is is there that is this order issue is not include one, but it's modest.

179
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,600
And then this is if both things were true. Okay. And so we see that again.

180
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:49,260
So that the argument might be that it's possible that that these things work together,

181
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:54,089
although these these effect estimates don't look that different when both are occurring.

182
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,270
So perhaps they're just sort of two totally independent risk factors.

183
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:04,350
But the this was this was an interesting study, too, that looked at fraternal infection.

184
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:10,440
Right. Because like the mechanism by which your father being infected with influenza affecting your schizophrenia risk doesn't make sense.

185
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:15,440
Right. There isn't like a biological pathway to get that to get there.

186
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:21,150
But what's interesting is that if your dad was infected with influenza while you were pregnant,

187
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,730
you're also a little bit more likely to develop schizophrenia.

188
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:29,100
So it suggests, even though it doesn't make sense, there's no biological mechanism for that, except if it's something about.

189
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:35,600
That type of environment that is happening. So you're he he's getting the flu.

190
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:40,930
You're you're already making it. So this isn't a sperm question yet.

191
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:49,360
But the point is, is that it's it's interesting because sometimes we only look at mothers and of course, there's two people involved in.

192
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:53,860
Maybe so. Okay. So the plot thickens.

193
00:18:54,970 --> 00:19:04,870
So, again, it's not I don't present this, but the observation the second observation is that to summarize would be that early life infections,

194
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:10,810
including infections that occur in utero, appear to be associated with later risk of developing schizophrenia.

195
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:18,549
And the third observation is cats. So this is something that was on the Internet before.

196
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,430
There was like social media. It's called spreading. Amazing how it begins.

197
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,620
And this is a very important part of this, an important thing for you to know about your Internet history.

198
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,190
So this is something people did with their adorable cats. Okay.

199
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,520
So how many of you have a cat? What do you know about them?

200
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:39,370
Are there any specific guidelines for who you should or should not?

201
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:44,139
Bless you to clean the cat's litter box? Yes, pregnant people should.

202
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:50,540
Why should pregnant people not clean the cat's litter box? It's just an excuse cause it's gross.

203
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:59,350
Nobody wants to do that. So the reason that private people should not clean the cat's litter box is that cat to include in this bacteria.

204
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,759
Sometimes this thing called Toxoplasma Gondii and Toxoplasma gondii, if you are exposed to it in utero,

205
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:13,840
is associated not just with risk of schizophrenia, but with associated with risk of lots of other kind of problems.

206
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:18,110
Okay. So it's not just in the brain, but in in general.

207
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:23,020
So this is why your doctor will always advise you to not do that litter box.

208
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,980
But of course, this is a bacteria, not US virus.

209
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,340
And that's a that's a different ball of wax, right? Really?

210
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:37,480
Why would that if it's something specific to flu, that doesn't quite seem to make sense.

211
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:42,990
So let me summarize. So we are there.

212
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,090
So that's the that's the third observation. So now let's think with this for a second.

213
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:51,880
So we know that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental condition.

214
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:58,690
I mean, it's something that is expressed or sort of is first becomes symptomatic when people are adults.

215
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,610
But it's something that we believe is present or is sort of there is that there's there's signs of it early in life.

216
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:09,970
We know it has a substantial genetic component. We talked about the gene environment interaction and gene environment correlation.

217
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:15,530
I just showed you, and I'm telling you that there is a lack of specificity.

218
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:22,399
While it is true that it looks like what their exposure to different types of agents,

219
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,870
whether viral or bacterial in utero, is associated with risk of schizophrenia.

220
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:33,770
There's a lack of specificity to that. Right. And it's kind of weird that both the bacteria and a virus would cause the same sort of thing.

221
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:40,190
I didn't show you this, but there's also studies that show that postnatal infections are like getting meningitis when you're a child,

222
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,159
for example, that these things are also associated with this schizophrenia.

223
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:48,230
So it doesn't really fit right that it would sort of be like some specific agent.

224
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,600
So perhaps it's not the agent itself that's the problem.

225
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:01,730
But something about the immune response that is is being triggered by these exposures that's relevant to etiology.

226
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:11,090
So again, maybe it's not the agent, but something that my body is doing in response to some foreign invading body.

227
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:11,930
All right.

228
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:23,720
So the an example of what your body doing, your body doing something in an appropriately in response to a non invading body is an autoimmune disorder.

229
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,880
So autoimmune disorders are very poorly understood.

230
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:34,879
They are complex and they are heterogeneous. There are autoimmune disorders that are cell specific.

231
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,830
I told you about type one diabetes already. There are autoimmune disorders that are tissue specific.

232
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:45,540
So multiple sclerosis is an example of a condition that is attacking the myelin cells of nerves.

233
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:51,919
So this is the kind of fat cells that kind of are responsible for helping to propagate action.

234
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:56,840
Potentials along the axon of nerves are nerve cells are they could be widespread.

235
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,580
So like this is not a mean disorder. We're basically like everything is comforting.

236
00:23:01,810 --> 00:23:10,970
There's people are attacking everything from hearts to kidneys to joints.

237
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:18,770
It's in general, they are caused by an antibody response that's then followed by this innate inflammatory propagation phase.

238
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:28,580
And while we don't really have specific genetic components, we believe that all of these are a combination of genetic and environmental causes.

239
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:41,290
So now I'm going to tell you a fourth observation. And the fourth observation is that having a family history of schizophrenia

240
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,540
is associated with the likelihood that you will have an autoimmune disorder.

241
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:52,080
That's weird. Okay, so let me walk you through this table.

242
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,550
So this is again, you can see Copenhagen. So this is that we're in Denmark now.

243
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:02,010
Okay. So the first is that if your parents are.

244
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,640
This is. But what I'm looking at is the the likelihood that you have an autoimmune disorder.

245
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,360
So if your parents are wealthy, you are less likely to have an autoimmune disorder.

246
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:16,230
If you live in the city, you are more likely to have an autoimmune disorder.

247
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,530
Here, if your parent has an autoimmune disorder, you're more likely to have an autoimmune disorder.

248
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:31,360
That makes sense, right? If your parent had schizophrenia, you're five times more likely to have an autoimmune disorder as.

249
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:38,640
So. That's why we get this observation.

250
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:42,959
And then the question is, well, what the hell's going on? Right. But this is coming out of the reason.

251
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,410
And this notice this name, this is Bill Eaton. So he's the P.I. of the Baltimore City study.

252
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:57,010
So he was my advisor at Hopkins. He just retired this year. He's another example of a very interdisciplinary scientist whose training is actually

253
00:24:57,010 --> 00:25:02,740
he trained in sociology at the University of Wisconsin under David Mechanic.

254
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:09,360
David Mechanic, you may remember, is the person I was telling you about his work we did to talk about sick roles, right?

255
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:13,210
So like that's where the scroll and like edit you decide your something's wrong.

256
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:21,510
Therefore you go to the doctor and not the other way around. So, so now this is, this is the same paper.

257
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:25,740
And so it's like, okay, well, what autoimmune disorder do those people have?

258
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:30,330
So again, what I'm looking at here, so now this is this table here and I know you can't read it.

259
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:33,810
I'm going to call it one thing in a specific, specific question.

260
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:39,900
So now this is do you have so this is this is your parents have schizophrenia.

261
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,210
You're more likely to have an autoimmune disorder. This is you have an autoimmune disorder.

262
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,850
What's the likelihood that you will get so you have an autoimmune disorder.

263
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,989
What's like when you have schizophrenia? Okay. So this one is parents have schizophrenia.

264
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:59,310
You have an autoimmune disorder. This is you have an autoimmune disorder, you have schizophrenia.

265
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,680
And there's lots of different things I've been going on here.

266
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:06,360
But the one I'm we're going to talk about today is celiac disease, where there's a moderate.

267
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:10,710
This ratio here is 3.8. So that means if you have celiac disease,

268
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:18,810
there's 3.8 higher odds that you will have schizophrenia relative to people who do not have an autoimmune disorder.

269
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:23,819
Okay. And many of these are up here.

270
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:28,229
So it's not you know, here is this is Crohn's or this and this is colitis.

271
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:33,809
I think right here is 8.3. There's somewhere it's it's inverse.

272
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:39,110
So it's not just everything that's on here, interstitial cysts, whatever that is, you know.

273
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:43,920
But the point is, is that there's some clear link.

274
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:50,190
Most of these are positive relationships. And we're going to talk specifically about celiac disease as one example.

275
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:55,170
So what is celiac disease? I just asked if people know what this thing is.

276
00:26:55,170 --> 00:27:01,020
Yeah, I get intolerance or gluten is more than an intolerance and ability to have.

277
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:09,030
It is a autoimmune reaction to lose your body when you when you ingest if you have celiac disease,

278
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:14,129
when you ingest gluten, your body makes antibodies to the gluten.

279
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:25,470
Proteins if you use gluten protein like a virus and it takes it up and that's not good for your gut to have a battle happening in your gut.

280
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:30,239
So it's associated with, you know, extreme gut pain.

281
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:40,050
People like they can't absorb nutrients properly. They, you know, they may be more prone to like gut related infections.

282
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:47,570
But the good news is that if you don't eat gluten. Your body doesn't produce antibodies.

283
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:57,320
And so you aren't experiencing these painful symptoms of this disorder unless you introduce that agent that your body is misidentifying as a problem.

284
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:04,390
Right. As a foreign agent. Okay. So it is something that's different than something other than if you have type one diabetes don't matter what you do.

285
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,670
Your body's attacking your body's cells. There's nothing you can do.

286
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,820
There's nothing you can stop or start doing that's going to make your body stop doing that.

287
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:16,860
But if you stop consuming gluten, your body will stop producing antibodies in response to it.

288
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:23,870
So there is a dietary intervention that people with celiac disease do to manage their condition.

289
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:29,860
Okay. So so so we see this now.

290
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,730
This is a study. So now we know we're like, gosh, that's interesting.

291
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,520
So this is a study called The Case Study.

292
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:42,970
This is one of the largest studies of treatment studies of schizophrenia that we've ever done in the United States.

293
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:50,850
Now now we're back in the United States here. So what I'm looking at here is participants in the Katie trial.

294
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:56,530
Everyone in the Katie trial has schizophrenia. And then a sample of comparison, people.

295
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:01,120
Okay. So I've got about 4000 people with schizophrenia, about 900 people who don't have schizophrenia.

296
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:06,070
And I'm looking at two different antibodies that are both associated with eating.

297
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,290
And what do you observe?

298
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:17,520
We observe that people in the Katie trial, which is just a trial, there's is a drug trial for schizophrenia, like trying a new antipsychotic.

299
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:25,750
It has nothing to do with nothing whatsoever to do with anything, you know, anything to do with gluten, nothing to do with immune disorders.

300
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:36,430
We observe that. And in this study, they have to take blood. But if you were in the Katie trial, about 1.5% of them had high antibodies to this.

301
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:41,050
Yeah, these are two different forms of are two different antibodies that are released with

302
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:48,190
1.5% of them had antibodies to whatever I see two years compared to 0% of people

303
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:54,339
who did not have schizophrenia and 12% of them had high antibodies in response

304
00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:00,370
to this letter as compared to only 1.3 of the non people without schizophrenia.

305
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:08,440
So these are people who have been chosen to have this is not based on like did you did you see a doctor?

306
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,380
Did they get you that diagnosis? Right. Because you should be you should be suspect of this table, right?

307
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:17,139
This is people who got access to care. Autoimmune disorders are hard to diagnose.

308
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:22,030
How do we know they got the right diagnosis, etc.? Well, this is just this is literally just testing antibodies in the blood.

309
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:31,840
And so what we are observing is that people who have schizophrenia are more likely to have antibodies to gluten and people comparison.

310
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:37,360
People do not have schizophrenia. This is not dependent on a diagnosis, not dependent on a clinical diagnosis.

311
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,780
But you might also say, well, you know, people in this county trial, they probably had schizophrenia for a long time.

312
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:50,710
Maybe they changed their diet. Right. Maybe this is reverse causation. Right.

313
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:54,430
Because I remember that from when I learned that, I learned that in class.

314
00:30:54,850 --> 00:31:02,739
So now we've got a study that is comparing people who do not have schizophrenia to people who have schizophrenia.

315
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:08,620
But it's not a recent onset. So they've had schizophrenia for many years to people who have schizophrenia

316
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:12,340
and they've been this is onset in the last I think it's just like six months.

317
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:19,810
And now the Y axis here is again these two different antibodies to two.

318
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,860
And what we see is that. Actually the highest antibodies are observed among people who have the most recent onset of schizophrenia.

319
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,100
So this is the recent onset schizophrenia, longstanding schizophrenia and people who do not have schizophrenia.

320
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:37,569
So for both groups they are more likely to have antibodies, but it's actually even higher in the recent onset schizophrenia,

321
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:40,270
which suggests this is less likely to be due to reverse causation.

322
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:46,420
And I developed schizophrenia and then I changed my diet or so I started taking medication for my schizophrenia.

323
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,850
And that somehow screwed up my gut, right?

324
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:53,230
Like, whatever that whatever is like, that's less likely to be the case.

325
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,030
I'm not saying it's it's impossible, but it's less likely to be the case.

326
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:09,990
But now I'm going to show you a situation where it is impossible. So now this is a study of I'm not ready to show you that one.

327
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,110
That's the next slide. Okay. I got a couple of more slides.

328
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:22,490
Okay. So this is even more again, showing you again, this is the odds ratio of having elevated gluten sensitivity.

329
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:28,860
Now, everyone in this chart as schizophrenia, so they're more likely to have recent onset psychosis,

330
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,010
but these two are not statistically significantly differently.

331
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:42,120
And then you can see that the we and the idea these are all a little bit higher than in the recent onset versus last.

332
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:49,049
And now I'm showing you a meta analysis. So again, now there have been a multiple studies,

333
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:56,050
again showing that there are elevated biomarkers of gluten sensitivity are more common among people that have a non effective psychosis.

334
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:02,580
So that is schizophrenia or any kind of psychosis that is not bipolar disorder relative to.

335
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:11,100
So that's what these estimates are here. Okay. So now we've got multiple studies, but again, we can't before we get too excited.

336
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:17,939
What could explain this? Right. What could explain why people with schizophrenia have different levels of

337
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,640
gluten sensitivity than people without kind of already indicated this is very.

338
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:33,440
Like the medications they take. So there could be that this kind of reverse causation.

339
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:39,749
Right. So here, this is an example. Like somebody might get married because potentially people are happier, are smarter interpretations.

340
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:43,440
No one wants to marry an unhappy person. Right. And that's probably true.

341
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,340
But the point is, is that the that the notion that.

342
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:56,360
The diet is not randomly assigned. It could be that people were experiencing early symptoms of schizophrenia and then

343
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:01,250
changed their diet in some way or engaged in some other type of thing that somehow was,

344
00:34:01,430 --> 00:34:07,880
for whatever reason, increasing the likelihood that they would be producing these antibodies.

345
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,550
So now I'm going to show you a situation where that's impossible.

346
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:18,950
So every one of us has had within an hour of birth, you had your blood taken for the first time.

347
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:26,840
This is a neonatal plastic. Okay. And this is testing for inborn errors of metabolism and things and genetic testing.

348
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:31,070
And so now this is what I'm showing you here is maternal antibodies.

349
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:37,700
Because, baby, you're not doing anything that mom didn't eat. As a baby did not choose to eat anything.

350
00:34:37,730 --> 00:34:40,960
So now the question is. Ah.

351
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:45,220
What if we look at Mom's antibodies?

352
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:52,140
If we look we're looking at the heel stick, right? So this is babies antibodies, but they're antibodies to things that mom ate.

353
00:34:54,330 --> 00:35:02,610
Okay. Is that. I'm taking blood from the newborn, but it's those and those antibodies to gluten are reflecting antibody levels to what mom ate.

354
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:07,980
And the question now is, is there a relationship between.

355
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:14,540
Antibodies to gluten that are present at birth and schizophrenia at 25 years later.

356
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:17,190
And the answer is yes. Okay.

357
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:26,030
So now there is no reverse causation because this is not a situation where the child eat something or change their behavior.

358
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,060
There was no behavioral changes within a within an hour of birth.

359
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:39,800
Okay. So, so together and this is just a kind of summary of things that.

360
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:51,370
All sorts of now interesting findings on mining in terms of just differences in terms of immune abnormalities in get

361
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:57,310
in that are not they don't all line up perfectly it's never it's never obvious or I should say it's never obvious,

362
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:59,860
but it's never as clean cut as we want it to be.

363
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:09,040
But there's enough evidence to suggest that there's something there's you know, there's enough smoke here to suggest there's something.

364
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:16,480
And then we're getting kind of more interesting types of study design. So this is one that I found a few years ago.

365
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:27,459
This a very old study from 1966. And what this was looking at was changes in hospital admissions for schizophrenia in countries during World War Two.

366
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:32,770
So during World War Two, there was massive rationing of food.

367
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:36,280
And in fact, it was really hard to get things like bread.

368
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:49,540
Okay. And the what the study from way back when in terms of the sixties showed that there was a relationship

369
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:56,320
between countries that had greater restrictions on on actually greater rationing of foods.

370
00:36:56,340 --> 00:37:00,040
These are countries that are like Finland, Sweden, that are in the war.

371
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,690
And I mean, Finns are fighting the Russians or the Soviets at the time.

372
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:09,370
Sweden is in bed with the Nazis and technically not at war during this time.

373
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:13,540
So but the point is they're still everybody's eating food is being rationed to these countries.

374
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:18,909
Canada, that doesn't seem like such a big deal for them. But, you know, anyway, the point is this, you know,

375
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:27,100
this idea that we can look at that is is an interesting even though the data I'm just shooting were all relatively recent,

376
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:32,770
this this is actually kind of an interesting old idea from the idea of rationing during World War Two.

377
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:38,660
So let me pause here, because that was just a lot of a lot of information.

378
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:52,390
So in relation to the mother, I guess it like if the mother gets infected with something no matter what and they have this immune response

379
00:37:53,590 --> 00:38:00,280
that causes the baby to have an auto immune response potentially and also potentially schizophrenia.

380
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:09,150
So, yeah, so we don't fully so the question is about sort of so if mom is infected, how does this translate into like baby's immune response?

381
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,470
Right. And so the short answer is we don't fully know.

382
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:19,420
It's it's possible that what's happening is that there's like a legitimate, like, adaptive response.

383
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:27,310
So if as a fetus, your mom is exposed to a lot of infectious agents, you may develop an immune system that's very reactive.

384
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:32,220
Right? And you're like, oh, [INAUDIBLE]. Like, the world is like very is full of pathogens out there.

385
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:37,480
I've got to kind of be primed up to deal with that. Right? So there might be some, but that's one potential mechanism.

386
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:48,280
It could also be, though, that the information that is experienced by the mom during the infection, some of that crosses the placental barrier.

387
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,429
Right.

388
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:59,140
The placenta does form a barrier that protects both the fetus from mom's immune system, but also protects the mom's immune moms body from the fetus.

389
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:01,569
So there's there's interesting findings, for example,

390
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:07,120
that women who have boys are far more likely to develop an autoimmune disorder relative to women who only have girls.

391
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,859
And the mechanism for which this they think this is operating is that fetal

392
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:16,660
DNA does cross the blood brain barrier and you can identify fetal DNA in mom.

393
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:25,120
So like most of the genetic testing that we do now in utero, in utero genetic testing is not done through amniocentesis or anything like any

394
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,160
direct like taking DNA from the fetus for another time through mom's blood draw.

395
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:36,640
And the reason for this is that you can you can separate out fetal cells from mom's cells just from a blood draw.

396
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:43,150
So, like, I mean, I had this time when I was pregnant with my son, like we were doing this test to identify trisomy 21.

397
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:50,560
You know, I don't have Trisomy 21. So if there's cells in my bloodstream that had for me 21 of them, that my feet like my son had it right.

398
00:39:50,920 --> 00:40:01,000
So that's how prenatal genetic testing is done now. So there is some crossing of fetal into mom's system, but the placenta protects a lot of that.

399
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:07,270
So the short answer is we don't fully understand the mechanism, but autoimmune disorders are,

400
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,090
again, we think, a combination of genetic and environmental risk factors for,

401
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:20,430
for example, like type one diabetes for the vast majority of these cases are coming on the heels of a major infection that the kid had.

402
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,709
But it's usually not specific. It's usually not like one specific time.

403
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:28,930
It's not like, oh, you had flu and therefore you get type one. And obviously the vast majority of people who get flu do not develop type one diabetes.

404
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,810
You know, so it's it's not specific or something.

405
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:37,420
There's some other elements that are pushing that chain, that causal chain for us that we don't fully understand.

406
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:47,150
Yes. Is there a single set? No set of genes to define schizophrenia.

407
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:54,170
Like schizophrenia. From what I know, there's no, like, physiological signs.

408
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:59,810
So. So there are. Yeah. So to answer your question. So is there a specific set?

409
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:02,000
No. There is no like gene for schizophrenia.

410
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:11,660
We have a sort of probably probably a few thousand genes now that explain about 10% of the variance in genetic risk for schizophrenia.

411
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,999
But it's not it's not like an autosomal dominant recessive.

412
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:21,200
It's not that is not at all what we're talking about, or rather this sort of like combination of things.

413
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:29,310
And as we talked about a little bit on Monday, those genes are not in neurotransmitters or there's there's there's variants are not.

414
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:36,290
As far as we know right now, are not in neurotransmitters. They're in like basic cell housekeeping except for the ones that are in our chromosomes.

415
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:43,470
Which am I tell you about. So then all this, like the tests are done,

416
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:51,180
like the associations between like the autoimmune diseases like schizophrenia is that's based on the clinical diagnosis, only clinical diagnosis.

417
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,810
I haven't seen any genetic data today. Yeah. Yeah.

418
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:59,550
So if you have a diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder, you are more likely to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

419
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,350
Yes, good question. Other questions.

420
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:16,470
So I told you that, you know, the way we found this culminating evidence,

421
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:23,040
but this is celiac disease is a condition that can be managed with a dietary change.

422
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,960
And so there is an intervention. We can imagine an intervention.

423
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:33,790
From this, I would actually test the question of does celiac disease cause schizophrenia?

424
00:42:34,570 --> 00:42:46,470
What would that intervention be? Don't eat gluten free, gluten free.

425
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,830
So people have tried doing this. So these are this is some very old studies.

426
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:56,090
And the first one is from 1969. And this is this story.

427
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:04,800
This these are studies. These are all done. Many you can see many of them were in people who were impatient and a lot of them didn't have any changes.

428
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:07,409
Okay. But this is the idea is that this was like gluten withdrawal.

429
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:13,800
And the the argument was, will people who have schizophrenia, if we put them on a diet, you can see these samples are very small,

430
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:22,920
eight, 15 seconds that people have been trying to do this for a while and skip this one.

431
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:28,380
And this is a clinical trial that is in the in the works right now.

432
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:30,600
And I'll show you some data from this right now.

433
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:38,640
So clinicaltrials.gov is a place is the website where every clinical trial that is done in the United States needs to be registered.

434
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:43,139
And so you can actually go to this website and you can look at the inclusion and exclusion criteria,

435
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,790
and you can you can do this for all the coban trials if you are so interested, right?

436
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,830
All of these things are registered here.

437
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:58,170
And so this was the goal of this study was to effect test, test, whether it's putting people who have schizophrenia,

438
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,520
who also have high levels of these antibodies, because not everybody had high levels.

439
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,070
Remember from the Katie trial, I told you about 12% of people.

440
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:10,379
So it wasn't it wasn't 100% of people schizophrenic had high antibodies, about 12% of them had anybody.

441
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,770
So it's you've got schizophrenia and you have these antibodies.

442
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:19,080
And now the question is, if I put you on a gluten free diet, what happens to your psychiatric symptoms?

443
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:24,180
So this is a paper that might show you data from notice. The last author here again is Bill Egan,

444
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:31,290
who I just told you about runs the study very important guy and here's their here's a figure from that

445
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:39,089
paper so this is these are people who are the blue line is they are not told to change their diet.

446
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:43,280
Their diet contains well these are the people who are put on a gluten free diet.

447
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:46,830
This is nine people. This is 70. It's not a large trial. Okay.

448
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:54,870
This is week zero. And we go out to week five. This is the total symptom count stands is the scale of assessment of negative symptoms.

449
00:44:54,870 --> 00:44:58,830
So negative symptoms of schizophrenia are not hallucinations and delusions,

450
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:05,040
but these are things like volition or difficulty verbally communicating or.

451
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:14,330
Flat affect. So but anyway, the point is that these are parts of symptoms of schizophrenia and more importantly,

452
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:17,780
these are the symptoms of schizophrenia that don't respond well to antipsychotics.

453
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:21,860
So these are symptoms that we actually don't can't really help people deal with.

454
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,090
Well,

455
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:32,360
and so what we what you can see here and what they talk about here is that there was if you if you if people were randomized to the gluten free diet,

456
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:36,409
they had improvement on the global clinical, global impression scale.

457
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:42,200
And in negative symptoms. The clinical global impression scale is essentially like psychiatrists are kind of trying to sum up like, how are you doing?

458
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:49,850
Okay. So overall, you know, and there were no improvements in the positive symptoms or the cognitive symptoms.

459
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:56,059
But again, I guess I see a little bit of improvement in attention and or maybe not more importantly,

460
00:45:56,060 --> 00:46:01,670
but as expected, the GI systems felt better, which is good, right?

461
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,540
Because all these people have gluten intolerance and nobody's helping them with it.

462
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:13,370
And so they are feeling a lot better. If any of you have GI issues, you know that that's not a small thing to have improvements there.

463
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:22,130
So now we've got incredible, incredible evidence from moving from the first observation I told you, season of birth,

464
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:29,750
which planted the seed as to why the [INAUDIBLE] is that happening to clinical trial data on a specific

465
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:36,410
intervention for a subset of people with schizophrenia where diet can be considered part of treat.

466
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,840
So I want to bring it back to genetics, though, because I like the break.

467
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:48,890
You told me you spent Monday telling me how like not there's not all the environment is sort of being shaped by the genes you had to get into.

468
00:46:49,230 --> 00:46:53,340
So this is a recent target ten years ago now. So this is all true.

469
00:46:53,370 --> 00:46:57,940
Still genome wide findings for schizophrenia.

470
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:01,950
So these are, you know, millions and thousands of cases,

471
00:47:02,130 --> 00:47:06,030
tens of thousands of cases of schizophrenia compared to tens of thousands of cases of controls.

472
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:12,669
And you can see that these these highest hit that is the ones that are most strongly related

473
00:47:12,670 --> 00:47:19,770
to schizophrenia are are all in on chromosome six and they're all all these variants again,

474
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:29,020
which are just like Leo. Right. So it's an A instead of a T. These first five hits are all in something called the major histocompatibility complex.

475
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:38,400
That is your immune system that that this is these are genes for schizophrenia.

476
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:42,809
Right. So this is these big case control studies where they're trying to identify what are the genetic

477
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:46,470
factors that are that are associated schizophrenia compared to people who don't have schizophrenia.

478
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:51,540
It has nothing to do with autoimmune disorders. They're not trying to find genes for autoimmune disorders.

479
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:55,050
They're trying to find genetic variants for schizophrenia.

480
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:02,220
And they're finding them. But first, the top five hits for schizophrenia are in the immune system.

481
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:06,980
And this is it.

482
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:12,580
There's no immune system in the brain, but there is an immune system in the brain.

483
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:18,600
It turns out that the major histocompatibility complex this is a neuron for this is a cartoon synapse.

484
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:24,590
Here's your glutamate, which is a neurotransmitter that we know is something that is affected by our

485
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:30,209
psychotic medications and what's sitting on those nerve cells that make glutamate.

486
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:37,830
And the answer is your major histocompatibility complex that there is a these things are it's it's circumstantial evidence.

487
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,700
Right. But they're at the scene of the crime. They're I suppose they're okay.

488
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:48,420
They're both there and we now have a much more.

489
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:57,210
Oh and the further this is more recent data this is two years old.

490
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:03,810
Antibodies to gluten are also associated with neurotransmitters among people with schizophrenia.

491
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:09,179
So now now we really like you might be, you know, like I thought schizophrenia was a brain disease.

492
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:17,700
Yes, it is a brain news, but it's also probably at least some forms of it are an autoimmune disease that is expressed in the brain.

493
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:27,040
Okay. Just like multiple sclerosis. Is an autoimmune disease as expressed in your nervous system.

494
00:49:28,030 --> 00:49:40,770
Okay. So, you know, and this is I guess I want to make it clear, like there's there's a lot of like wellness trash out there about your gut.

495
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:49,560
Okay. There is a lot of so you can see this and then be like, you know, we should all avoid gluten, but I'm not saying that at all.

496
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:52,770
Right. Like there's a lot of trash nutritional science out there.

497
00:49:53,860 --> 00:50:01,940
But there is also good evidence that for a subset of people with schizophrenia who are also experiencing who also have antibodies,

498
00:50:02,950 --> 00:50:09,950
that part of treating part of treating their conditions, it involves nutritional management.

499
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:14,530
And as a result, it's possible that this might be an avenue for prevention.

500
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:18,969
If we know that you have a family history of autoimmune disorders, then we could potentially,

501
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:23,530
just like we put kids who have PKU on a diet that does not have fetal alanine.

502
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:33,220
Snyder Can't remember exactly so because it is an enormous inborn error of metabolism and children who have this,

503
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,290
some of those tested at neonatal blood spots,

504
00:50:35,650 --> 00:50:42,790
if you have this and you eat a regular diet, you can use your brain, you will develop different your brain will get hurt.

505
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:48,460
And but if you don't eat that diet, you won't have problems.

506
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:53,230
The problem is that phenylalanine and like everything, right? So it's a very, very restricted diet that they have to be on.

507
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:59,169
But here we're potentially talking about a diet that's much more reasonable that people can adhere to for their entire life,

508
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:02,770
or at least through their entire risk periods, like a high risk period of life.

509
00:51:04,710 --> 00:51:12,060
So let me just summarize here. So for a subset of individuals with schizophrenia who may be particularly sensitive to it,

510
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:16,920
they may be extremely sensitive to inflammation due to this immune activation of these specific antigens.

511
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:24,280
This is complete. This is this is in line with the prior studies that showed that, you know,

512
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:27,540
there's like these inconsistent these kind of relatively consistent findings,

513
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:32,579
because it's not that there's this kind of specific thing that causes the auto immune response,

514
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:36,660
but the rest of it is just this like propagation of nonspecific inflammatory markers.

515
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,680
Okay. So it's not there's elements that are specific and there's elements that are nonspecific.

516
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:48,570
We now know that that looks like that, that the you know,

517
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:54,959
this immune activation is associated with things like increased permeability of the cells of your intestines.

518
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,560
It's also associated with increased permeability of the blood brain barrier.

519
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:03,060
Right. So not just in your guts but actually like, you know, getting things into your brain.

520
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:08,520
And so perhaps it's not the gluten specifically, but it's something about, again,

521
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:14,099
the downstream effects of being in this inflamed state that are then allowing

522
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:18,360
things like other pathogens or other toxins to cross the blood brain barrier.

523
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,080
And those are the real like kind of proximal culprit. Right.

524
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:27,659
So we don't know we don't know fully what the what the chain reaction is between these things.

525
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:32,010
But there's certainly several different types of mechanisms that we think might be operating.

526
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:39,510
This is a video that describes, like, a lot of this you can take in.

527
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:45,300
And again, this is so this is from this from Christopher Lowy at the University of Colorado.

528
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:49,490
So again, this is in your slides if you want to watch this, if you're really interested in this.

529
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:54,690
But the idea that there's there's more and more evidence that this gut brain reaction

530
00:52:54,690 --> 00:53:00,209
or gut brain relationship is relevant to a whole host of psychiatric conditions.

531
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:12,420
In fact, I'll tell you a short story of I was at a conference a couple of years ago now, but the the woman was presenting on again,

532
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:17,430
starting with a similar kind of story where apparently we'd known and this was this was new to me.

533
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:23,940
But apparently we've known for many years that people who have had their appendices out are less likely to develop Parkinson's.

534
00:53:27,230 --> 00:53:35,320
I just. So I learned the following, I guess three facts from this woman's talk.

535
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:38,890
The first is that your pit, your appendix, has its own microbiome.

536
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:49,590
The second thing I learned is that there is apparently direct integration between your appendix and the vagal nerves, which is going up to your brain.

537
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:57,270
And the third thing I learned is that in animal models, if you cut that connection between the pancreas and the vet in animal models of Parkinson's,

538
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:02,940
if you cut that connection between their appendix and the vagal nerve will develop.

539
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,440
And they apparently think that there's like literally like some sort of like direct connection,

540
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:17,010
like there's like a path somehow between this microbiome of the stupid thing that we still have and the brain in these Parkinson's models.

541
00:54:17,310 --> 00:54:25,920
So again, it may be that in ten years from now, we have a how we think about Parkinson's again as a brain condition.

542
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:31,259
But the causes of that don't have to be like insults to the brain in a direct manner,

543
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:37,469
but rather the fact that we've got this a neck that is that is connecting our brain to the rest of us,

544
00:54:37,470 --> 00:54:41,190
and that those types of interactions are where we're actually seeing the expression of a condition.

545
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:51,490
But the causes of which are not insults of the brain directly. I told you this already said environmental action matters.

546
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:56,560
And then I'll let you know. I think this is my last day and plenty of time for questions.

547
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:05,830
So, you know, you probably have learned in your training so far that things like ecological studies are very weak forms of evidence.

548
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:10,000
And that's true. They are weak forms of evidence. But rather than.

549
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,530
But they're weak forms of evidence to test a hypothesis.

550
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:18,310
They are not weak forms of evidence to generate a hypothesis.

551
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:25,299
Okay. So what I encourage you to think about is when you see when you see data like in this case,

552
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:29,320
I showed you season of birth and you can even consider the war time rationing of bread.

553
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:34,670
These are about generating hypotheses. Could this is there something worth looking into?

554
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:41,479
Is this a reasonable question? You have cohort and case control studies to clarify hypotheses.

555
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:47,100
Prior to here, we learned that history of infection or family history of an autoimmune disorder, these were not randomly assigned, right?

556
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:52,300
Nobody was randomly assigned to get an infection. Nobody was randomly assigned to have a parent born with an autoimmune disorder or not.

557
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:59,020
So there's still subject to all the biases that we worry about in terms of identifying a causal effect.

558
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:02,770
But they're certainly better than the ecological studies.

559
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:11,290
We can then get animal and clinical observational studies that help us identify in this case that identifying

560
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:15,970
like the case study showing that there were elevated antibodies to gluten among people who had schizophrenia.

561
00:56:16,070 --> 00:56:20,100
Now, we had a more specific potential mechanism in place here, right?

562
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,329
Because this up here is based on all health care records.

563
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:25,960
And now I'm actually I'm actually in the body and I'm looking at like an actual biological mechanism.

564
00:56:27,070 --> 00:56:30,220
And then if everything is sort of lining up with these,

565
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:40,150
it allows me to move into a situation where I'm potentially going to expose someone to an intervention that I think they are likely to benefit from.

566
00:56:40,810 --> 00:56:45,460
And that's the other really important, that you cannot expose anyone to anything that you would think that would harm.

567
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:52,360
That's completely unethical. Right. So the fact that we have an opportunity here to identify something that we think might

568
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:57,519
benefit and we we but we have to move into that into a randomized controlled trial,

569
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,840
which is exactly what we've done.

570
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:09,369
And Bill is as I bring him up as an example of this interdisciplinary scientist who was again trained by a traditional medical sociologist,

571
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:11,470
David Mechanic, who was studying things like sick.

572
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:19,540
He then goes to the National Institute of Mental Health and gets is is a program officer there before moving to Johns Hopkins,

573
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:24,790
where he becomes the director of the Baltimore side of the epidemiologic catchment area study.

574
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,920
And that's a study that's looking not at schizophrenia, but looking at depression and anxiety and other things.

575
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:35,110
But he still is forming connections with people in the Scandinavian countries to

576
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:38,820
do some of the work that I showed you earlier on the autoimmune disorder stuff.

577
00:57:38,950 --> 00:57:43,750
Right. And now he's literally like, you know, helping to direct a clinical trial.

578
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:51,790
I mean, it's just it's an incredible, incredible career arc. And so I hope it sort of gives you some both, like, hope that not hope,

579
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:58,359
but like an idea that where you start your career may not be where you and your career and that there's it's really

580
00:57:58,360 --> 00:58:05,620
important to I think he's probably better is probably the knowledge that he gained from training in sociology

581
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:12,459
is not irrelevant to his work in this clinical trial even though you might think it's irrelevant but it it all

582
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:17,440
formed how he thinks about the world and how he thinks about how we understand what's going on with schizophrenia.

583
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:23,400
Okay. So that's. That's what I have for you today.

584
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:28,120
So. I hope I made some sense.

585
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:32,940
Let me ask you a question. Yes.

586
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,480
So I wasn't thinking about the whole Syria connection.

587
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:40,320
Is it more like you going gluten free helps?

588
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:46,980
Like do they think that it's gluten or that the antibodies produce?

589
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:52,020
Is that cause schizophrenia or like is it hard to make sense of the schizophrenic

590
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:56,550
is like could it really like prevent getting schizophrenia altogether?

591
00:58:56,750 --> 00:58:58,340
So yeah, that's a great question.

592
00:58:58,350 --> 00:59:04,890
So the question is, is it is it is it a intervention for treating schizophrenia or is it an intervention for preventing schizophrenia?

593
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:11,390
And right now we only have data on treating and it is promising for those who have it,

594
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:19,740
but that that sets the stage for the goal, the potential for a prevention trial.

595
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:23,940
So we know that we can test for these antibodies very early in life.

596
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:27,000
And in fact and we also know we can identify family history. Right.

597
00:59:27,030 --> 00:59:32,759
And so, you know, if you have a parent that has an autoimmune disorder, you're more likely to develop schizophrenia.

598
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:38,760
So we already can kind of like think about who would potentially benefit from were we to recommend a gluten free diet.

599
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:43,919
But that hasn't been done yet. So right now we're still on the kind of the early stages of this intervention.

600
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:49,920
Is this is this an intervention? So it's and again, it's not going to benefit everybody with schizophrenia.

601
00:59:49,980 --> 00:59:50,879
That's the other thing. Right.

602
00:59:50,880 --> 01:00:02,070
So the that these, these earlier case studies were, um, they were small, you know, they were also done a long time ago, but they weren't tests.

603
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:06,240
They weren't limiting it to people who had or had the antibodies.

604
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:09,180
Okay. So if you don't have celiac disease,

605
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:14,230
there's no expectation that going on a gluten free diet is going to do anything to your mental health or your gut.

606
01:00:14,340 --> 01:00:18,390
Right. There's no there's no reason to believe this is going to be this is going to help you in any way.

607
01:00:18,810 --> 01:00:26,910
So it's not surprising that these studies, which were not focused on people cheating, were showed mixed findings.

608
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:32,280
That's why this trial, which is specifically like if you look at the inclusion exclusion criteria,

609
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,870
they actually enrolled people with schizophrenia and then their next thing they do is do a blood test.

610
01:00:36,870 --> 01:00:41,760
And if you had your blood test positive for antibodies doesn't mean you have celiac, but you just have antibodies for gluten.

611
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,559
Then you can enroll in the trial.

612
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:48,960
So there's a selection process in here for this very specific group of people that we think will potentially benefit from the intervention.

613
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:55,550
It leaves open the possibility which is huge because we actually don't we don't have.

614
01:00:56,620 --> 01:01:02,799
Interventions that we think can prevent psychosis. So it's like a trial for prevention of schizophrenia.

615
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:08,320
Would you have to try to prevent or prevent celiac disease or.

616
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:11,649
Yeah, you would. Yeah. So the argument would be that. And.

617
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:15,730
But you won't. So you will. People will still disease have celiac, period.

618
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:23,380
But they they are not in a state of chronic inflammation if they are not eating right.

619
01:01:24,130 --> 01:01:30,090
So it's it's one of these rare autoimmune disorders that it's always present.

620
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:35,410
And if they were to eat, they would produce these antibodies and then they would have the propagation of inflammation.

621
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,719
Right. But they don't the body's ready to go for it, but it's not doing that harm.

622
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:45,220
So the thought is that this is a really good point of clarification.

623
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:52,150
So the thought is that it's not the fact that you have the condition, it's the inflammation that's happening through that condition.

624
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:55,780
And so if we can so that's why we think so.

625
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:02,740
These people are put on a gluten free diet and we see an improvement in their overall scale and in their negative symptoms, in their gut.

626
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:06,400
Right. Which is like the mean when people have see like this is their main complaint.

627
01:02:06,670 --> 01:02:10,749
The chief complaint of people with celiac disease is like diarrhea and intestinal pain.

628
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:18,640
Like that's what they're experiencing. So but for for a subset of those people with schizophrenia are also experiencing this.

629
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:26,020
And we now have a better understand, I mean, the like largest outside of your central nervous system,

630
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:30,310
the second part outside of your central nervous system, which is brain and spinal cord.

631
01:02:31,090 --> 01:02:34,990
Then next largest collection of nerve cells in your body is in your gut.

632
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:42,260
So it is not. It is not even. That's why I want to kind of warn you against like the woo kind of wellness stuff,

633
01:02:42,260 --> 01:02:48,979
because all I can tell you these facts and you're like, Oh, and then it also means that I should adhere to some special diet.

634
01:02:48,980 --> 01:02:52,730
And like, the answer is like, almost most of that is based on almost no evidence.

635
01:02:53,990 --> 01:02:58,879
Okay. So that I want you to take both what I've said today with a grain of salt,

636
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:02,780
but also this other kind of what we know about or don't know about nutrition.

637
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:09,380
We're kind of salt. I'm not saying it's not possible, but the evidence there is in three types of other types of things.

638
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:19,760
This is going to come up again, though, when we talk about autism. So, I mean, I'm not going to spoil the lecture, but Andrew Wakefield,

639
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:25,729
who is the person who was the author of the paper that identified was purported

640
01:03:25,730 --> 01:03:32,060
to show that vaccination with the MMR vaccine was associated risk of autism.

641
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:40,280
I don't know how a doctor he he was is not used as he's been like part or whatever happens you can't you can't practice medicine anymore but I

642
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:49,460
mean what kind of doctor he was sees a guy doctor and the patients that were coming to see him are coming to see him because of GI complaints.

643
01:03:51,800 --> 01:04:01,930
They were not coming to see him because of autism. But he had a belief that there was something around the environment that was causing autism.

644
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:05,310
And he also supported, you know, supported these like.

645
01:04:06,590 --> 01:04:12,229
Radical diets for kids with autism and salivation and these other kind of weird

646
01:04:12,230 --> 01:04:17,389
interventions that people have done for kids with autism to remove toxins,

647
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:24,350
etc., etc. So it's there's there is like there's a a dark side to this conversation that can happen very quickly.

648
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:31,060
We talk about the relationship between nutrition and mental health, and it can happen with autism, still technically autism, which is.

649
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:41,330
Other questions. Yes. So like if both like celiac, an influence that can be like linked to like just chronic inflammation.

650
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:50,360
The general thing is that like a possible intervention for conditions like schizophrenia, like treat like preventing that.

651
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,650
Yeah, yeah. Yeah. So so the answer is yes.

652
01:04:54,650 --> 01:04:57,920
I mean, for so, for example, with depression,

653
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:02,780
there are trials of different anti inflammatory medications as adjuvant therapies for

654
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:07,549
depression because that's another condition where we see changes in immune functioning.

655
01:05:07,550 --> 01:05:11,840
So we know when people have depression, they are slower to heal.

656
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:15,260
We know that their immune system is is not as effective.

657
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:22,159
It's a different mechanism than what we've talked about here. But sort of the notion that there's there's something going on with this immune

658
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:27,590
functioning that's then getting expressed as depression is is very real.

659
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,870
And I think the conversation around long COVID is exactly this conversation.

660
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:40,820
So both in terms of COVID exposure being associated with risk of developing mental health disorders, I don't know if I believe that data yet,

661
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:49,880
but I do believe that the data on COVID is is likely is this kind of like which long-covid the primary symptoms of that are brain fog,

662
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:57,230
chronic fatigue. Right. Things that are we have that like people talk about chronic fatigue syndrome.

663
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:01,040
That's also to like a condition where we think that their immune system,

664
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:10,460
there were some sort of external immune exposure that for some subset of people, there's a propagation that doesn't seem to stop.

665
01:06:10,820 --> 01:06:13,580
Right. So even though the vast majority of people are exposed to the same thing,

666
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:18,350
are not going to develop chronic fatigue syndrome or are not going to develop long-covid for a subset of people.

01:06:18,590 --> 01:06:25,820
There is something still happening in the body that is somehow getting into the brain, which is where your fatigue and brain fog is.

668
01:06:26,390 --> 01:06:30,110
You know, that's where that's coming from. Yeah, it's a good question.

669
01:06:41,050 --> 01:06:44,780
I had a student tell me on Monday, which I. I don't know if you meant it as a compliment.

670
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:49,900
I will take it as a compliment that she feels like she understands less from this class.

671
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:54,550
I don't. I know less, but understand more my remembering. Right? I know less, but I understand more.

672
01:06:54,670 --> 01:06:58,350
And I hope that I will take that as a greatest compliment as a professor.

673
01:06:58,360 --> 01:07:04,430
So I hope that, you know, less understand more about schizophrenia on this week.

674
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:10,820
Okay. I'll let you go next week talking about depression. So I want to stick around here for you guys.

675
01:07:11,090 --> 01:07:14,540
All right. Well.
