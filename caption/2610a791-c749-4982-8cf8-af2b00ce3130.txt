1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,130
Okay. And nice to meet you.

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,720
I feel like that's a.

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,100
And then there's some more under after a break.

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:29,220
Hey, good morning, everyone. So before I introduce our guest speaker today, I wanted to make just a couple of quick announcements regarding the exams.

5
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:41,370
So I should have the grades, just the scores posted to canvas possibly later tonight, but more realistically by tomorrow at the latest.

6
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,720
And then for our class period on Thursday, I will spend the first few minutes talking about the exam passing back.

7
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:52,230
You can check them out. We'll go over some specific questions.

8
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:00,390
You know, find out what the average score on the exam, all those interesting facts, and then go ahead and move forward in the course schedule.

9
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,930
All right. Any any questions regarding the logistics of that?

10
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,960
Okay. So today we are joined to talk about exposure modeling.

11
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:22,530
One of my close colleagues for, I should say, many years here in the School of Public Health Professor Marie O'Neill.

12
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,890
And she has a particular expertize in the background of the topic for today.

13
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,480
Marie is not just a colleague of mine within Environmental Health Sciences.

14
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:39,840
She also has the joint appointment with the Department of Epidemiology as well here at the school.

15
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:46,890
And like I said, we are tapping as many of this local expertize to come in and talk about these specific topics.

16
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,620
And Marie absolutely fits the criteria for this one.

17
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:55,080
So, Marie, the floor is yours. Thank you so much. Thank you.

18
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:01,140
It's very nice to see everyone, including my team.

19
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,570
So, yes, as you mentioned, I'm Marie O'Neill and I've been around here as a faculty since 2006.

20
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:16,320
And I training I actually have a master's in environmental health sciences and an epidemiologist.

21
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:29,220
So today I'm going to talk to you about air pollution exposure assessment and a couple of important methods that we use in this field.

22
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,110
And I'm my plan is to give you an overview of these methods illustrated with some

23
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:43,670
existing presentations that I thought kind of gave you the idea of how these work.

24
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:51,900
And then also an article that I collaborated on using land use regression in Mexico City.

25
00:02:52,410 --> 00:03:01,110
And then my goal is not to speak for too long so that we can have a class exercise where you are all in some groups

26
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:10,290
and talking about how you might model exposure to other area level variables that have similarities to air pollution.

27
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:18,270
And then we'll reconvene and report back. I'll provide you with some guidance about what you're going to talk about.

28
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,500
So with that, I will. Start.

29
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:36,180
And there is a large literature in epidemiology looking at health effects related to exposure to ambient and indoor air pollution.

30
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:44,580
I list a number of the outcomes that have been studied mortality and hospital admissions for various causes.

31
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,459
These have been seen on higher pollution days and a more acute way.

32
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:56,730
And then also comparing residents in a more polluted city versus a cleaner city over time.

33
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:08,520
We also see emergency department for outpatient visits, respiratory symptoms, altered lung function, respiratory illness, cancer.

34
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:14,040
And then a growing body of literature is looking at reproductive effects.

35
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,610
So whether the mother who may be exposed to pollution while she's pregnant,

36
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:28,170
is more likely to have a low birth weight or preterm baby, or there's an enhanced risk of infant mortality.

37
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:40,200
So these exposure assessment techniques are relevant to all of this kind of literature, which is the basis for health standards worldwide.

38
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:52,050
So the study approaches that we take mainly when we're studying outdoor air pollution exposure is to obtain the health outcome data.

39
00:04:52,110 --> 00:05:02,430
My own HD was using dust cert data from Mexico City, administrator of hospital admissions claims from Medicare.

40
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:13,260
And then you could also look at clinical parameters, blood pressure or other kinds of lung function that individually measured health outcomes.

41
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:18,480
And then you want to ask the question, is this linked to air pollution?

42
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,770
And so very frequently and early in the field,

43
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:32,450
people estimated the exposure to outdoor pollution levels from monitors that are cited for compliance purposes.

44
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:43,560
So I know prior lectures from Dr. DuPont addressed the issues of air quality regulations and other kinds of experiments.

45
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:55,900
So the real question in epidemiology is, of course, how does what a monitor outside is measuring relate to what we are breathing?

46
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:04,889
Given that we spend so much of our time indoors and sometimes it doesn't relate to well, other times it does.

47
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,340
It depends on the pollutant. That's a whole literature.

48
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:17,460
But this graphic just shows that, as a matter of fact, in this case, this is respiratory, respirable, suspended particles and older metric.

49
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:27,480
But the personal breathing of air pollution can actually be substantially higher than what an outdoor monitor might be measured.

50
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,040
It might be measuring it. So that could be in an occupational setting.

51
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:40,860
There's the fact that people talked about where you might pick up dust or other particles indoors,

52
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,070
handles other kinds of sources, can relate to personal exposure.

53
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:54,479
So the key question in all epidemiology, especially when we're just estimating the air pollution exposure,

54
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,110
is how does personal relate to what we measure outside?

55
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:12,209
So the two models that I'm going to talk about today, the model classes are ways that in addition to just simply measuring one monitor,

56
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:22,380
the closest monitor or doing averages, ways that epidemiologists and exposure scientists estimate exposure to outdoor pollution.

57
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,920
So land use regression is widely used.

58
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,930
It involves the actual ambient measures of concentrations.

59
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:37,470
You can look at other spatial variables such as how close you live to a roadway,

60
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:44,520
vegetation, meteorology, other things that you think may affect your exposure.

61
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:51,089
And then you put those into a statistical model to create either neighborhood estimates,

62
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:59,879
or sometimes you may have the geo location of the person's home so you can get an even finer estimate.

63
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:08,100
And then using those exposures, you want to do your statistics and look at the health outcomes and how they relate to that pollution.

64
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:14,580
And then here we can just see that we know that their point sources of air pollution,

65
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:21,750
area sources, larger dispersion and then light sources, which are typically road.

66
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:33,700
So the strengths of this kind of model is the ability to capture the smaller scale variability in community health studies,

67
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:44,290
because we know that a person who's closer to a bus or other location may well be more exposed than someone

68
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:53,319
who lives near a park that's resource intensive compared to asking a person to wear a personal monitor,

69
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,120
for example. And then the land use data are often widely available.

70
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,100
However, like any approach, there are limitations.

71
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,410
The inputs you would like to have accurate monitoring data at a large number of sites.

72
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:18,370
Ideally, you know, spatially dense set of monitors, which is not always the case.

73
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:29,370
And then you can't really transfer the model from one urban or rural area to another because they're created with specific inputs of the location.

74
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,580
They estimate one pollutant at a time.

75
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,340
And of course,

76
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:45,130
we all know we're exposed to mixtures and then lacking the fine scale resolution for estimating the shorter term exposure to air pollution.

77
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:52,480
And those are often only ambient measures versus indoor personal.

78
00:09:53,050 --> 00:10:00,520
And then sometimes you can connect to specific sources of emissions, to concentrations for developing communication strategies.

79
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:15,269
So I'm going to show you one example of a case study of land use regression where a team actually use air

80
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:24,839
pollution concentrations predicted by a couple of large scale air quality models that use both ambient monitors,

81
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:35,220
but also some meteorology, quality data and other kinds of data in order to predict benzene, nitrogen oxides and particulate matter.

82
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,490
And this was a published paper.

83
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:50,880
And in this case, they obtained air pollution concentrations at census plots, group sites in New Haven, Connecticut, using an existing data set.

84
00:10:51,660 --> 00:11:05,040
And their goal was to predict the daily concentrations for two month periods to calculate seasonal averages for these pollutants based on.

85
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:12,389
Daily means for the year 2001. So this gets to the structure that I mentioned.

86
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:18,180
So you've got your your what you're looking to do is to predict pollutant concentrations.

87
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:28,770
And so you're using other data sources, traffic intensity and proximity in roadways, ports and harbors, industrial sources,

88
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:39,570
all to do a little bit of a better job of predicting finally find scale concentrations to link to human locations.

89
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:41,790
And so you fit these models.

90
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:54,990
You often put in many predictors and narrow them down as you hopefully learning in your statistical classes to pick 19 land use variables.

91
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,290
And as you can see,

92
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:08,100
you have these centroid which is really like the geo statistical term for the center of a a not not a circle in an irregular shape.

93
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:21,420
And then you want to fit your models and evaluate how well they actually predict the air pollution that's not measured at these locations.

94
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:30,329
And so, as I mentioned, there's a whole process statistically of how you develop your models.

95
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:37,049
This is a lot of detail, but the important thing to think about here is that you're trying to predict air

96
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:41,580
pollution at a location where you actually don't have a measurement of air pollution.

97
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:52,200
And so you have to validate and quantify how well your model is working because that is, you know, really the essential question.

98
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,910
So there's a whole process of doing that.

99
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:12,540
And in this particular case, to summarize what they did, they used the concentrations to fit some models and they evaluated the fit of the models.

100
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:16,320
And what they suggested was that these.

101
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,980
Air quality models could cope.

102
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:30,390
Improving land use regression estimates and emission based modeling results and urban environments may be better with other types of modeling,

103
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,860
which I'll talk about.

104
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:42,329
And then one of the articles that you were assigned as background reading, optional reading, I guess is what I read about calls.

105
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:45,569
It was a supplemental.

106
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:48,750
Thank you. Skim skimming reading.

107
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:58,890
This was a project that I worked on with various colleagues and the idea was to

108
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:06,180
fit a land use regression model to assess air pollution exposure in Mexico City.

109
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,360
And this is a map of Mexico City.

110
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:17,370
Anyone ever been? So what can you tell me about Mexico City?

111
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:27,030
I was there this summer and my partner has asthma and we left Mexico City for like a few days and suddenly she was doing very good.

112
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:32,519
And then we went back to Mexico. Oh my goodness. So but it's huge.

113
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:43,610
And there's lots of traffic and there's like many different sources of transit that are not that great quality cars are coming.

114
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,520
So. Yes, yes. It's a beautiful city.

115
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,850
It is. It is. It's surrounded by mountains.

116
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,800
Well, I was only there for like a day or two sided.

117
00:14:55,950 --> 00:15:04,200
I get to experience a whole lot of the city, but we were more like immersed in the culture and stuff like that.

118
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,420
So I really enjoyed it though. Yeah, yeah.

119
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:16,350
It's one of my favorite places in the world and I spent probably a total of two years there between shorter term trips and then living there.

120
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:24,600
So obviously this map doesn't give you the full sense, but it's in a valley surrounded by mountains.

121
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,030
I think current estimates are they're like maybe 25 to 30 million people in the area.

122
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,540
So lots of pollution and high altitude.

123
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:44,190
So the city Mexico City government has been measuring air pollution for quite a while and these triangles are the actual monitors.

124
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:54,630
And so as you can see, they are somewhat spatially dense, but not not so spatially dense that someone,

125
00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:00,330
you know, living here, for example, you know, is close enough that we think it's reliable.

126
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:09,270
So the objective of our work was to do better than just using the concentrations so that people with asthma.

127
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:15,930
Yes. Isn't that also where the like fit for the trip of the park where that's missing monitors.

128
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,790
Chapultepec Park is. Yeah, in the in the middle of the city although down here these are this is where you start

129
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:29,279
to get into the mountains that go towards Cuernavaca so that it is more parkland.

130
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,930
And even within the city there are zones that are like parks.

131
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,460
Yeah, we were in school and that's quite okay.

132
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,940
Okay. Yeah, that's great.

133
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:49,870
So yeah, so and asthma having lived there when they shut down the schools because of the air quality.

134
00:16:49,870 --> 00:17:00,809
Yeah, it's definitely affects people with asthma. So in this case, the idea was to use the data from the monitors.

135
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:06,540
But then also this illustrates perfectly kind of the point that you were making is that

136
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:13,829
you see some isolated parks and then the vegetated areas as you go up into the mountains.

137
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:20,940
And so some of these data are also relevant to a land use regression, obviously, because it's land use.

138
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:32,310
So in the models that our team did, Google traffic counts were one of the sources, which is pretty cool.

139
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:37,980
Nowadays, you can get a lot of information on Google and other public sources,

140
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,660
land use and then the measured air pollutants and the ultimate outcome which these maps are in.

141
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:57,480
In the the article was these maps that kind of show, as you can see, the fine spatial variation in the levels of pollutants.

142
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:05,770
And so you can see different pollutants may behave differently, you know, wind patterns.

143
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:14,700
And then even this is the one ozone, you think, well, wow, down here, if you look at that map, there's a lot of vegetation.

144
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:23,469
Why is there high ozone? It's because of the way. Pattern's below in the ozone, and that's often been seen sometimes.

145
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:30,879
So you can see that. You could imagine that if a person is sensitive to one of these pollutants, more so than the other,

146
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,870
that they might experience different effects, not to mention the mixture effects that you would see if you overlay these.

147
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,790
All right. So that was to illustrate the lab use regression models.

148
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:54,290
And then I'm going to talk briefly about the dispersion models, which essentially model how air pollution expands and diffuses.

149
00:18:55,070 --> 00:19:02,570
And has anyone seen a large smokestack near the School of Public Health?

150
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,760
I grew up here. Okay. So, you know, it's the power station.

151
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:14,600
And so sometimes you can see the plume, which we hope is mostly steam because it's natural gas.

152
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:23,330
But essentially dispersion models are about how does air pollution emitted from a source, then disperse.

153
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:27,379
And you often know a lot about that pollution at the source.

154
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:33,920
And then how does that relate to what people who live not right next to the stuff are actually breathing?

155
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:45,680
So there are various principles involved in this kind of modeling and based just like the land use regression on site specific data.

156
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,040
So you can see historically you've got some pretty polluted areas.

157
00:19:52,050 --> 00:20:00,060
Pittsburgh is the example here and there are also places that still have this kind of pollution.

158
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:08,810
And so we can model the dispersion of that pollution across a larger area using various types of models.

159
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:20,399
The Gaussian plume you probably learned about the Gaussian normal distribution that's essentially assuming that it's kind of spreading out.

160
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:31,110
And you might even see that if you see the plume from the local power plant and then you use these other kinds of models,

161
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:40,709
which I won't describe here, I'll talk about the Gaussian dust version model, which is which is very common.

162
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:52,550
And again, that's why I mentioned it kind of goes out there is an equation that that describes how you you run this Gaussian dispersion modeling

163
00:20:52,560 --> 00:21:00,810
and I'll just share I listened to some of the recorded lectures about what are you going to be tested on and is it going to be like,

164
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:03,780
what is the air quality standard?

165
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:16,740
I took a class where we had to write out the entire Gaussian model of Sigma and everything else on the midterm, and then it appeared over the final.

166
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:27,329
So, so the thing thankfully Doctor DevOps is not that much, but I think the idea in that particular class was like,

167
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:36,870
this is a really important kind of modeling, and I think it integrates some of the statistical concepts that we're learning as some of you.

168
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:39,420
First-Year Public Health students, others not.

169
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:48,120
So again, similar to the land use regression, you have this model structure where you need that your input data,

170
00:21:48,930 --> 00:22:00,120
a meteorology emissions and then receptors where the receptors often you know a person or a location where you

171
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:07,530
know people to be the model does the calculation and then it estimates the concentrations at the receptors.

172
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,270
So you want to think about what kind of source type it is.

173
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:21,240
The point like a smokestack area volume flare, there may be methane at a landfill that's being flared off,

174
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:28,440
stack or source emission data and some of the relevant parameters there.

175
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:35,069
And then of course, receptor data. Where are people? Are they, you know, two meters above the ground?

176
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:44,790
Are they inside? Outside? And then, of course, the pattern of dispersion depends on the conditions prevailing during the release.

177
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:50,280
So maybe there's a thermal inversion, maybe it's a super windy day and, you know, quickly goes.

178
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:57,510
So the atmospheric stability, the mixing height where, you know,

179
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:02,940
how well does the air mix and at what highlighted next and then the wind speed and direction.

180
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:13,770
And then you also have to consider location specific areas, what kind of terrain you have.

181
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:19,540
Is it an urban canyon with skyscrapers that may very drastically affect how the

182
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:25,690
pollution disperses and then the distances to your receptors from the source?

183
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:37,930
So the other reading that that supplemental reading that you had is one where this is a group from Europe that

184
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:47,530
does a huge set of coordinated epidemiologic studies where they gather health data from multiple European cities,

185
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:52,530
and then they use harmonized methods for estimating exposure.

186
00:23:52,540 --> 00:24:04,839
And so in this case, they compared these methods, they fit these kinds of models and compared the methods for estimating residential exposure,

187
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,580
meaning where a person lives to ambient air pollution for epidemiologic studies.

188
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,090
So actually, let me just see if I have.

189
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:20,560
Yeah. So this this is just to kind of show, for example, in in Rotterdam, Rotterdam, the Netherlands,

190
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:27,370
they they fit these models and you can see really pretty different spatial patterns.

191
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:35,470
And of course, that might be expected because of the nature of the modeling approach that that they used.

192
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:47,079
But the conclusions I'll just highlight and you can read that in there is that, you know, it is important to compare these kinds of models.

193
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:59,229
And then sometimes even if they seem to be performing similarly, they calculate the correlations between the model, let's say nitrogen oxides,

194
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:07,990
which they highlighted there, and actual measurements because they have validated people more monitors on their person.

195
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:17,620
And so they could really validate that even if the correlations are pretty good and similar, you can still get a very different effect estimate.

196
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:27,249
If you fit a model with your health outcome, you might see a risk ratio of 1.2 or 1.1.

197
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,190
They often tend to be small with air pollution studies,

198
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:41,590
but it's important to do this kind of sensitivity analysis because as much effort as is put into these models, we know that there's always some error.

199
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:51,010
And that's something that speaks to the credibility of the results that are derived from using these kinds of models.

200
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:58,540
So. Let me.

201
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:12,610
Introduce the class exercise and or let me maybe I'll just stop for any kind of questions from the lecture material.

202
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:17,679
And then very nicely, we have plenty of time for the class exercise,

203
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:23,910
which I think will be which will be a good chance for you to get your own brains into thinking about all of this.

204
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,090
So any questions about the modeling approaches?

205
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:38,430
Yes. Experimentally. What would sort of cause you as an experimenter to choose one method versus the other?

206
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:55,390
That is a great question. So if you have the luxury of having estimates from two different models,

207
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:05,470
you might choose the one that gives you maybe the most precise estimate where a confidence interval is smallest.

208
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:12,900
Or you may just report in the supplemental table in your paper.

209
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:19,090
You know, we're going to report in the main paper the results from the land use regression model.

210
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,100
But we're going to show the results we got with these others.

211
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:32,340
And then I think another choice may be what kind of health outcome are you looking at?

212
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:46,030
So some of the discussion in the papers was about some of these models work better for very short term estimates of acute exposures.

213
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:54,490
So just to give an example, there are studies where people actually take data from a pacemaker,

214
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:06,430
an implanted defibrillator that actually broadcasts data and then correlate that with hourly air pollution levels.

215
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:17,680
And they have, in fact, seen that a person exposed to a peak in air pollution may be more likely to have a, you know, an irregular heart rhythm.

216
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,629
So in that case, you might think,

217
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:28,270
I want a model that's really going to do well at looking at the fine scale in another kind of study where you want to look at,

218
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:41,290
you know, life expectancy, it's okay to have a model that works pretty well at predicting air pollution exposures on a scale of years.

219
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:46,180
So different kinds of decisions that you might make.

220
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,450
And, you know, not all papers.

221
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:58,100
I mean, my own dissertation work was looking at exposure assessment methods in Mexico City because I perhaps naively thought,

222
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,990
oh, it should be straightforward.

223
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:09,709
But then I went through this whole exercise of, Oh, they measure particles with two different types of monitoring equipment,

224
00:29:09,710 --> 00:29:13,180
and they don't always measure the same concentrations.

225
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:18,950
What do I do with this? So I did not expect to have a whole paper.

226
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:30,200
And in fact, I even used airport visibility data as a as kind of a proxy for particles, because we know that the visibility is affected.

227
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:34,910
You probably saw that my descendants descend into the brown suit.

228
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:39,049
Yeah. And then once you're on the ground, it's like, oh, this is such a great city.

229
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:48,000
But you don't because you don't see that while you're about to eat or tropical or some other delicious food.

230
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:58,400
So hopefully that helps. Yes, I'll add to that actually back to the question of, you know, what what directs, what models you might choose.

231
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:03,410
I think a big part of it, at least historically, is just what data you have access to.

232
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:08,570
Right. So you can have the best, most elaborate dispersion model,

233
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:15,259
but if you don't have available very detailed emissions data about those sources that

234
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:21,379
you're trying to model and your dispersion model is and isn't very useful in that case.

235
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:27,709
Right. And, you know, similarly with land use, if you have, you know, great land use data, fantastic.

236
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,460
And, you know, Dr. O'Neil's Mexico City study,

237
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:37,340
that's an example of a large urban area that for many decades has had a really elaborate

238
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:46,160
monitoring network that is that's not over those same decades is not replicated at many other,

239
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,140
you know, urban areas to that extent. Yes.

240
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:55,639
Are there any so that try to, like, reconcile the two together like this one?

241
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:00,860
Like is there some way of like almost like averaging the time, but not quite what's going on there?

242
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,900
But that's actually an interesting question.

243
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:16,430
I don't know off the top of my head, but I expect that, you know, that's a way of combining data or even,

244
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,440
you know, thinking about, well, we think it could be as high as this or as low as this.

245
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:27,920
You know, they encourage us to not be focused solely on a binary.

246
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:35,030
Is it statistically significant? But what really might be the plausible range of exposure to pollution?

247
00:31:35,030 --> 00:31:40,129
Because we all know, you know, it's the best guess at the model is imperfect.

248
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:44,060
So that would be really interesting idea.

249
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:49,370
So actually, I'm going to foreshadow something that always comes up with the class exercise,

250
00:31:49,370 --> 00:31:59,659
but I think it relates directly to terms point about some places don't have these monitoring networks.

251
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:05,540
What places in the world might you imagine? Don't have a lovely map with triangles.

252
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:19,510
Most of the world. Okay, that's fair. We'll place lower resource settings.

253
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:28,959
I mean, that's always been a kind of a critique. A lot of the body of air pollution epidemiology literature comes from industrialized,

254
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:36,370
richer countries where they can afford the monitors, but they have the scientific capacity.

255
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:40,510
So there are places in the world where they don't have monitoring networks,

256
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:49,990
and so there are ways to estimate pollution without having a monitored concentration.

257
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:54,370
Any thoughts about what such ways might be?

258
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,170
I mentioned one in my. Are your comments.

259
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:17,250
All right. So I'll say and a student colleague of mine back at University of North Carolina, Nitya,

260
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:22,950
was her name was from Thailand, and they didn't have a really great monitoring network in Bangkok.

261
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:32,300
And so she was encouraged to get airport visibility data because that's, you know, the planes are flying regularly.

262
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,150
They need to know for aviation safety, can the pilot see?

263
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,209
So she used airport visibility data to estimate particle concentrations.

264
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:48,520
So that was great. In a place with an airport, in a place that doesn't have an airport.

265
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:53,859
And, you know, many places I'll just think of, you know, the continent of Africa.

266
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,659
They don't have monitoring networks.

267
00:33:55,660 --> 00:34:07,020
But fortunately, we have satellites that are going around our globe on a regular basis and they measure a number of parameters.

268
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:16,900
There's remote sensing. So the images that you can see on the news stories and this is when you think about your your.

269
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:27,670
Your group exercise case studies think about could remote sensing data be useful and the beauty of the remote sensing as it covers everything.

270
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:33,969
And so people have used aerosol optical depth,

271
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:44,530
which is another measure of visibility that can be measured from particles as a way of estimating concentrations of pollution all over the world.

272
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:51,550
These estimates from satellites are often validated in the same way that I described for these models,

273
00:34:51,550 --> 00:35:01,060
where you compare what the satellite estimate says about the air pollution level in Sao Paulo,

274
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:10,390
Brazil, and then you have a nice network there where you can say, okay, it looks pretty good, or we want to calibrate it up or down based on that.

275
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:21,100
So satellite imagery is becoming a really powerful tool for exposure assessment of air pollution as well as other environmental exposures.

276
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:33,009
And so that's something to think about. Now some of the work that I've done with colleagues has linked satellite estimates, ones that I've made.

277
00:35:33,010 --> 00:35:36,940
But groups have fancy tools to have made those estimates.

278
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:48,850
And then you can link them to data where it's in one case, it was a World Health Organization survey that included India, China, Africa, you know,

279
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:59,979
lots of different places where measured air pollution wasn't available to look at what might be you see here with these birth outcomes.

280
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,610
So I think that's an important thing to think about,

281
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:12,819
is can you do epidemiology and exposure assessment in places where they're not measuring things on the ground?

282
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:23,229
And the answer is often yes. If you get creative and you get the use of Google or people, we we had a project where we were thinking about Twitter.

283
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:28,299
You know, people are tweeting out there that air pollution is terrible today.

284
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:34,900
Can you use can you mind that data? Can you get access to that data for privacy concerns?

285
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:42,220
But can you mind that often geo located data to augment what you know from measuring?

286
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:59,549
All right. So the class exercise, you have the task of modeling an environmental exposure using techniques from land use regression or other methods,

287
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:07,860
including perhaps a couple that I've mentioned. And the exposures are vegetation.

288
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:17,820
So we know that green space walk in in the are walking in a park can have a number of positive health effects.

289
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:23,070
It can also mitigate pollution very good.

290
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:28,889
In many ways, heat is a really important exposure, especially with climate change.

291
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:36,000
It's something that I work on quite a lot. So we're concerned about heat for health, vegetation in general.

292
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,870
We think of as an environmental good, you know, like it may be that people have better birth outcomes,

293
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:46,080
better mental health if they're close to greenspace,

294
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:56,700
whereas heat, negative noise, another generally negative, although one person's noise is another person's music.

295
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,300
So you get into some of the subtleties of of that.

296
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,079
And then the fourth is fine particles.

297
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:12,180
And I know we kind of covered that a lot in the class, but I think especially, you know, this is an important area of research.

298
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:17,190
If you ever go to the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology Meetings,

299
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:22,679
you'll find probably half or more of the presentations relate to air pollution.

300
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:26,339
So it's just one of those priority areas.

301
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:32,370
So hopefully in your group you get a chance to delve a bit more.

302
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:33,719
All right.

303
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:46,650
So this is kind of a big list of things to do in a relatively short time, but I think you should be able to do it, and I'll just leave this slide up.

304
00:38:47,010 --> 00:38:53,280
So you want to think about what are the health impacts? Obviously, you don't have to do a complete review, but, you know, come up,

305
00:38:53,790 --> 00:39:01,830
have a scribe in your group that might make, you know, a slide or just tell us what you've identified.

306
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:07,290
And then you can you can get creative. Where do you want to do your study?

307
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:13,889
What population are you concerned about? Are you concerned about a mexico City tourist who might have asthma?

308
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:23,549
Are you concerned about children living in an area of Detroit and maybe the city is thinking about planting some trees?

309
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,670
You know, could would that be a benefit to their health?

310
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:34,350
Okay. Data sources that you would use and then also you could pick one and then think about what other

311
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:40,350
alternative data sources could you use that might cost more money or be more labor intensive,

312
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:51,870
but, you know, maybe are the gold standard, like asking a person to take a picture of the vegetation around, you know, around them and then map that.

313
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,530
How would you validate your exposure models?

314
00:39:55,590 --> 00:40:02,280
I talked about comparing what you estimate with the gold standard, for example,

315
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:09,780
it could be ground truth where you actually physically go to the place and take a measurement

316
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:16,589
or take a visual and then talk about the strengths and weaknesses of various data sources.

317
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:29,309
So this could be a lifetime exercise, but we're going to give you about 20 minutes to talk through it.

318
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:35,820
And so what I am going to ask the class to do is to count off.

319
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,580
We have numbers corresponding to each exposure.

320
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,680
And I would like the groups to be.

321
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:53,190
It's not the groups who are sitting next to each other like the early students.

322
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,510
So why don't we start yet? I'll be one. Okay.

323
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:03,210
Two, three, four, four.

324
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,360
To Group four or Saga.

325
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:13,940
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, one.

326
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:18,440
Okay, so how could you.

327
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:22,220
Why don't you say the ones you share?

328
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:33,950
Wow. The lucky twos can be back with a little too far with a view of the vegetation.

329
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,320
Maybe freeze over here in the morning.

330
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:47,450
And then just remember to pick your scribe.

331
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:52,100
And does everyone remember to memorize nothing?

332
00:41:52,160 --> 00:42:01,880
So you offer new statements.

333
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:10,400
Just keep strong and it's okay to resource three.

334
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:15,970
Yeah. Three. What's over or are you a three? Yeah. With Quarry.

335
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:16,363
All right. Thank you.

336
00:42:17,874 --> 00:42:25,403
All right. So we are now recording after the groups disperse to talk about their topics.

337
00:42:25,404 --> 00:42:36,564
So rather than go in numerical order, I'll ask which group feels inspired to start and share their story.

338
00:42:36,604 --> 00:42:40,644
How do I get back to the slide? Yeah. Let's share their thoughts.

339
00:42:45,314 --> 00:42:51,104
I'm going to call on this large group since you had five brains instead of four.

340
00:42:51,114 --> 00:43:02,744
So I'd love to hear if you have a spokes person or scribe share came up with and say your name just so I start to get to know people.

341
00:43:03,404 --> 00:43:09,733
I'm Rebecca. So our group was Vegetation for Health Impacts.

342
00:43:09,734 --> 00:43:14,234
We talked about how trees can help mitigate heat.

343
00:43:15,614 --> 00:43:20,624
We also talked about like allergies with pollen, CO2 and mental health.

344
00:43:22,194 --> 00:43:27,624
So for the population, you're thinking about looking at like the Detroit metro area,

345
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:33,444
comparing like vegetation levels among different neighborhoods, a lot of wealthier neighborhoods,

346
00:43:33,834 --> 00:43:44,214
a lot of wealthier neighborhoods have more vegetation, but there are like urban lots with community gardens and stuff like that in lower income areas.

347
00:43:45,814 --> 00:43:54,304
For data sources. We talked about using city planning, data maps, satellite data, air quality monitors.

348
00:43:55,804 --> 00:44:03,094
And then we talked about how a dispersion like modeling approach would be better than the land use,

349
00:44:03,934 --> 00:44:10,354
because most of the monitors are in like more industrial areas rather than community areas.

350
00:44:12,974 --> 00:44:13,104
Yeah.

351
00:44:13,244 --> 00:44:23,233
So then like also pollen counts, temperature data and then hospital data for admissions for things like heat related illness and respiratory issues.

352
00:44:23,234 --> 00:44:29,594
And also on psych psychiatric admissions for validation.

353
00:44:29,594 --> 00:44:40,634
We talked about using data from things like Google Maps or like monitors in the airports in the area and then for weaknesses,

354
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:44,354
again, most of the receptors are in more industrial areas.

355
00:44:44,534 --> 00:44:50,593
And then we also were thinking like data on the vegetation itself is more likely to be qualitative.

356
00:44:50,594 --> 00:44:57,854
Like you wouldn't really have data about like the actual like like vegetation mass like across different areas.

357
00:44:57,854 --> 00:45:01,244
So that might be like another limitation.

358
00:45:02,564 --> 00:45:03,534
What do you mean by that?

359
00:45:03,584 --> 00:45:14,594
Cetacean That's like I guess if we're looking at vegetation, it's more like we're looking at like what areas have more vegetation than others.

360
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:18,074
But, but it's more of a qualitative meaning for looking at that.

361
00:45:18,764 --> 00:45:26,024
It's not like you can't really put a number on like how much vegetation there is other than like taking square footage I guess.

362
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:30,584
But like we don't know, like the density and like the different types of plants as much.

363
00:45:31,244 --> 00:45:34,424
Yeah, we talked about the seasonality of some planters and other ones as well.

364
00:45:35,054 --> 00:45:43,754
Yeah. Well, great. You really touched on a lot of things and it sounds like your part of your thinking was,

365
00:45:44,234 --> 00:45:49,154
you know, in epidemiology, we talk about you're interested in the exposure of vegetation.

366
00:45:49,154 --> 00:45:59,774
But, you know, there are other things that you talked about, various pathways that can reduce heat exposure, but a potential downside is the pollen.

367
00:46:00,484 --> 00:46:04,124
And as an allergy sufferer, I know that that can really affect you.

368
00:46:04,124 --> 00:46:08,593
So I think your thinking was really excellent.

369
00:46:08,594 --> 00:46:17,714
And I'll I'll just mention that you have the satellite data I worked last year with a masters student in occupational and environmental epidemiology,

370
00:46:17,714 --> 00:46:26,263
and we actually she actually got remote sensing data of vegetation across Mexico City and looked

371
00:46:26,264 --> 00:46:33,313
at you can quantify it using something called the normalized difference vegetation index.

372
00:46:33,314 --> 00:46:40,004
That kind of gives a sense of the ranges in a very green area or is that a gray urban area?

373
00:46:40,004 --> 00:46:46,994
And then link that to home locations of pregnant women that we followed and looked at.

374
00:46:47,324 --> 00:46:50,864
Do we see an association? But exactly what your group talked about.

375
00:46:51,254 --> 00:47:00,704
She also looked at air pollution exposure estimates, as you know, is it a confounders of the modifier definitely be impacted.

376
00:47:01,664 --> 00:47:09,614
So great great great thinking vegetation team any other comments for.

377
00:47:13,134 --> 00:47:19,763
Your team. All right. I will move to this team whose topic?

378
00:47:19,764 --> 00:47:24,784
I cannot recall the spokesperson.

379
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:30,264
Well, I don't know if you are going to start, so I didn't see it.

380
00:47:31,524 --> 00:47:42,504
Okay, so we did PM 2.5 and the health impacts that we there's so many, but the ones that we listed, asthma, reproductive impacts,

381
00:47:43,494 --> 00:47:53,544
your nose and throat problems, lung cancer, heart disease, chronic bronchitis, visibility issues and higher mortality and hospitalization.

382
00:47:53,544 --> 00:48:03,564
Just in general, the place that we decided to look into is L.A. We know that they're known for just having pretty bad pollution.

383
00:48:04,624 --> 00:48:12,264
Well, 2.5 and. Okay, moving on to data sources we plan to use,

384
00:48:13,734 --> 00:48:23,334
our anthropologist had a good idea to just look retrospectively at data during the pandemic and then kind of compare that to what's happening now.

385
00:48:23,994 --> 00:48:37,884
So we could look at the traffic patterns during that time and satellite imaging we could use to see the geographic landscape and structure,

386
00:48:38,754 --> 00:48:44,484
land use and topography, which is just like the elevations.

387
00:48:44,664 --> 00:48:55,644
Yeah. We could use the EPA monitoring map that we found, which shows just like different monitoring sites for PM 2.5 in L.A.

388
00:48:56,574 --> 00:49:02,424
And we could also look into like where manufacturing is taking place.

389
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:11,454
There's a fashion district apparently like in there that has like a lot of concentrated fashion things going on,

390
00:49:11,454 --> 00:49:14,694
which is kind of being a big polluter.

391
00:49:15,594 --> 00:49:22,794
And we can also put monitors on the people, which would be like really costly but could be ideal.

392
00:49:23,864 --> 00:49:32,874
And we thought for modeling, we could do the dispersion and the lure model and then maybe combine the two.

393
00:49:33,594 --> 00:49:37,494
And that's as far as we got. Excellent.

394
00:49:39,294 --> 00:49:43,524
You know, you all need to write a grant proposal to enable you to do this.

395
00:49:45,154 --> 00:49:51,274
I think that's great. And I think the anthropologist who added the suggestion, I mean,

396
00:49:51,274 --> 00:49:59,914
that's been in a way covered is an example of the natural experiment where everything shuts down, people aren't commuting.

397
00:50:00,574 --> 00:50:08,284
And so you have, you know, other kinds of natural experiments have been looked at like Beijing Olympics.

398
00:50:08,284 --> 00:50:15,964
They decided to restrict the traffic going into Beijing so that athletes wouldn't be getting lung fulls of pollution.

399
00:50:16,324 --> 00:50:20,944
And they also then evaluated, did hospital admissions go down?

400
00:50:21,964 --> 00:50:29,344
Visibility, of course, increased. People I read people in China were like, wow, you know, look at the view, look at the blue skies.

401
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:39,154
So I think that, you know, the idea of looking at something that happens in the real world that,

402
00:50:39,484 --> 00:50:44,634
you know, whether it was intentional or not, reduces air pollution, allows you to to look at that.

403
00:50:44,644 --> 00:50:49,024
So yeah really good thinking.

404
00:50:49,024 --> 00:50:53,554
Any comments for the PM 2.5 team from.

405
00:50:56,524 --> 00:50:59,534
And that comes up, right?

406
00:51:01,824 --> 00:51:04,934
As a group, we are the noise pollution group.

407
00:51:05,484 --> 00:51:12,924
So the health impacts of concern that we came up from was actually provided to us by Dr. Neitzel and his lecture a couple weeks ago.

408
00:51:13,374 --> 00:51:19,823
So obviously our first main concern is hearing loss and it's also been linked with hypertension,

409
00:51:19,824 --> 00:51:24,684
ischemic heart disease, sleep disturbance, performance degradation, annoyance and psychological effects.

410
00:51:26,034 --> 00:51:32,124
Our population that we're interested in was New York City, particularly in low socioeconomic areas.

411
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:38,514
And as far as data sources that we plan to use, we came up with a funding list.

412
00:51:38,934 --> 00:51:44,964
So while we were trying to see of sound decibel monitors, if there was a good network already in place in New York,

413
00:51:44,964 --> 00:51:51,744
we found out that there has been a recent implementation of roadside sound meters for ticketing noisy cars.

414
00:51:52,134 --> 00:51:54,863
So we thought that would be interesting data to have access to,

415
00:51:54,864 --> 00:52:02,234
along in conjunction with traffic data from like Google construction sites through their like city or public data, airport data.

416
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:04,704
And then as far as like alternative data sources go,

417
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:12,684
we were looking at smartphone data because apparently they could listen to your ambient noise exposure as well as your phone usage for music.

418
00:52:13,134 --> 00:52:23,594
Again, the Apple hearing study. So and then we were thinking of using a land use model to see sites of noise pollution by zip code or area versus.

419
00:52:23,604 --> 00:52:28,524
And then we thought it would be interesting to kind of overlay that with existing green spaces in New York for disruption of noise

420
00:52:28,524 --> 00:52:34,044
pollution and that we didn't quite get through the strengths and weaknesses of all of our data sources because we were kind of jumping,

421
00:52:34,044 --> 00:52:40,194
but with sound decibel monitors, which are the personal monitoring for noise exposure,

422
00:52:40,614 --> 00:52:45,654
you're not always aware of the source of the exposure, just the overall decibels that are being exposed.

423
00:52:46,434 --> 00:52:50,994
So I think that was pretty much what we discussed.

424
00:52:53,594 --> 00:52:59,124
Yeah. Excellent. So you actually did some Internet searching to discover that New York.

425
00:52:59,174 --> 00:53:03,823
Was that part of your decision and focusing on New York is that they have these South

426
00:53:03,824 --> 00:53:08,834
Street theaters now where you start to pick a city that had like a lot of traffic,

427
00:53:08,874 --> 00:53:12,244
a lot of like like airports surrounding them for, like the noise itself.

428
00:53:13,244 --> 00:53:18,874
Yeah. And I'm sure how many folks have been in New York City.

429
00:53:20,534 --> 00:53:31,153
A number. Okay. When I'm there, like you just I'm struck by you're, you know, trying to go to sleep in your hotel room and sirens.

430
00:53:31,154 --> 00:53:33,944
It's like it really is the city that never sleeps.

431
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:45,404
And even Chicago, like, you know, take the train over there and you just it's the kind of sound tapestry your background is louder than,

432
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:52,034
you know, the house I grew up in in Kansas, you know, where you just hear crickets if if anything.

433
00:53:52,514 --> 00:53:56,414
So that's really. Yeah.

434
00:53:58,664 --> 00:54:05,924
I think that, you know, one of the things that you kind of touched on when you were talking about the different sources and the mapping,

435
00:54:06,584 --> 00:54:14,444
this is another theme that I I've talked with Dr. Neitzel over the years of collaborating on some noise research,

436
00:54:14,444 --> 00:54:20,114
because one of the things that we know is if you're living near a heavily trafficked road,

437
00:54:20,654 --> 00:54:26,724
obviously you're breathing more air pollution and you're hearing more traffic noise.

438
00:54:26,744 --> 00:54:35,804
And so initially, a lot of the air pollution epidemiology studies were just looking at air pollution and the outcome,

439
00:54:35,804 --> 00:54:39,524
let's say hypertension, to name one that you mentioned.

440
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:45,523
And so the idea is, oh, you're living near a heavily trafficked roadway and breathing that we know there

441
00:54:45,524 --> 00:54:51,433
could be mechanisms by which pollution exposure could cause hypertension,

442
00:54:51,434 --> 00:54:56,834
but it's also noisy. So you need to think about how do I measure noise and account for that?

443
00:54:57,454 --> 00:55:05,594
And so the same thing, you know, in the project that I have in Mexico City, we have pregnant women living around the city.

444
00:55:05,924 --> 00:55:10,754
Our main exposure of interest that we were funded to study was air pollution.

445
00:55:11,084 --> 00:55:23,743
But then is noise a confounder? And so at one point I found the acoustic engineer who had developed a noise map for Mexico City and said,

446
00:55:23,744 --> 00:55:30,614
Hey, maybe we can use that overlay with our estimated pollution and include that exposure.

447
00:55:30,614 --> 00:55:38,414
And I also asked Rick, because that's his expertize maybe we could validate is by helping people use it.

448
00:55:39,704 --> 00:55:49,063
It didn't get funded, unfortunately, but that's kind of the story of the academic life is like try if you get some funding and not others.

449
00:55:49,064 --> 00:55:53,984
But in any event, I think your your group did a wonderful discussion.

450
00:55:53,984 --> 00:56:00,994
And I don't know if Dr. Neitzel talked about this, but, you know, in Europe, they fund a lot of noise research.

451
00:56:01,004 --> 00:56:04,664
They have incredible noise maps, you know, in Mexico City.

452
00:56:05,804 --> 00:56:11,614
Dr. Rodriguez had developed this noise map, but there are a lot of places that they don't have it.

453
00:56:11,624 --> 00:56:18,464
And of course, if you look at it, it looks like a road map. That's a big part of the data's, the roadway noise.

454
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:29,264
So some of the things you all talked about, construction sites which make very important those are also important sources to to consider.

455
00:56:30,494 --> 00:56:38,563
All right. Oh, just a few more minutes. Last but not least, let's hear from this group, which was the heat group.

456
00:56:38,564 --> 00:56:44,954
Right. Yeah.

457
00:56:46,034 --> 00:56:54,554
So our exposure was heat and the various health impacts that we were looking at were heat exhaustion and heat stroke sunburn.

458
00:56:55,004 --> 00:57:01,364
But most interested, we're most interested in vitality as it exacerbates different comorbid conditions.

459
00:57:02,474 --> 00:57:08,263
We wanted to look at Dubi because it's a very hot city, so that's why we picked it.

460
00:57:08,264 --> 00:57:13,944
Even though unfortunately none of us happened to know very much about Dubi is a learning experience.

461
00:57:14,024 --> 00:57:20,144
We thought about using as our data sources meteorological data on heat index, wind patterns,

462
00:57:20,514 --> 00:57:25,964
U.V. humidity, number of days in a year with heat warnings as well as hospital data.

463
00:57:27,614 --> 00:57:31,993
Other data sources we were thinking about doing and seeing how many people had

464
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:35,804
air conditioners and the electrical demand imposed by using air conditioners,

465
00:57:36,254 --> 00:57:42,914
public transport data, surveys, occupational data, and then social media posts about heat.

466
00:57:43,514 --> 00:57:50,563
We thought about validating this model with data from personal monitors, ideally as well as pacemaker data.

467
00:57:50,564 --> 00:57:57,794
If we had access to that strength and weakness, the meteorological data are fairly robust, but it's hard to tell,

468
00:57:57,794 --> 00:58:05,684
like how many people would comply with the various types of analyzes that we wanted to do.

469
00:58:06,674 --> 00:58:13,364
And it's hard to tell as well how many fatalities are due to heat versus how many are ultimately due to the co-morbid condition.

470
00:58:13,694 --> 00:58:18,343
Or perhaps I guess deaths could just be reported in different ways too.

471
00:58:18,344 --> 00:58:24,824
And different employers, for example, might have different incentives to report a death as one thing versus another.

472
00:58:27,644 --> 00:58:31,154
Yes. Hey. Thank you. Hate group.

473
00:58:31,844 --> 00:58:33,404
Anything to add from the other?

474
00:58:35,004 --> 00:58:45,334
So I think also I know this exercise was just to get your brain piqued, but I think the point that you brought up about, you know,

475
00:58:45,354 --> 00:58:56,094
if you're interested in mortality associated with or caused by heat, yes, there are codes for heat stroke, heat exhaustion, heat related deaths.

476
00:58:56,724 --> 00:59:05,153
Those are often just the tip of the iceberg because sometimes he can contribute to a death from a person who already

477
00:59:05,154 --> 00:59:12,944
has a chronic condition like diabetes or is taking medication that affects their perception of thermoregulation.

478
00:59:12,954 --> 00:59:24,923
So some of the epidemiology I've been involved in, you know, actually reports heat associated mortality from cardiovascular or respiratory causes.

479
00:59:24,924 --> 00:59:33,164
So you're not limited to the tiny fraction that is actually definitively, you know, this was a heat caused death.

480
00:59:33,534 --> 00:59:42,054
I think occupationally. That's you know, that's also a really important question and you know, farm workers, for example,

481
00:59:42,054 --> 00:59:52,344
with climate change and just in general occupational lack of regulation, I think Dr. Neitzel mentioned there is no heat standard right now from OSHA.

482
00:59:52,794 --> 00:59:58,314
So I think you really hit on a lot of the critical points with that.

483
00:59:58,554 --> 01:00:07,524
We are at 950 and I think everyone, this was wonderful to meet you all and hopefully I'll see you in the future.

484
01:00:07,794 --> 01:00:08,904
So thank you very much.
