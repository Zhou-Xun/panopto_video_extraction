1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,740
alright. thank you very much for having me. this is a picture

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:17,180
of Bank. the number for any of you. I've been there. I'm sure you can but it's lovely

3
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:22,800
and if you have been trying to get there at some point.

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,820
so I'm not gonna talk about the check on the status at all today. unfortunately I

5
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:32,820
would love to you about this working. hasn't we haven't gotten to that but this is your economic status

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,960
round yet. I'm gonna talk instead about work that we've been doing. I actually

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,580
you know very in Cancer prevention recommendations and I'm gonna show some data primarily

8
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:49,700
data from British_Columbia. but also some American data because we've left that some of that.

9
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:54,840
using the nationwide inpatient sample as well. so I assume that

10
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,873
we're not all very in cancer experts in the room I saw a little bit of background on ovarian cancer.

11
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:06,013
is often known as the silent killer and not because it's largely a symptomatic

12
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:11,193
until very advanced stages with usually diagnosed in advance pages one survival

13
00:01:11,193 --> 00:01:16,253
rates are really low. it affects about twenty five thousand

14
00:01:16,253 --> 00:01:21,373
Canadian and American women annually. and about seventeen thousand of them

15
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:26,573
will eventually time to the disease. so survival rates are not very good.

16
00:01:26,573 --> 00:01:32,053
women who have a black one or Brockton to journal I need patient are at really increase

17
00:01:32,053 --> 00:01:37,153
risk for a very in cancer. we have a sixty and thirty percent lifetime risk

18
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:42,293
respectively for this disease. compared to the general population risk which is somewhere around

19
00:01:42,293 --> 00:01:47,333
one. five percent. lifetime risk for a very in cancer still relatively

20
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:52,453
low and my general talk to you later within

21
00:01:52,453 --> 00:01:57,493
probably the last ten to fifteen years. we've made some significant masses in our understanding of

22
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:02,561
what a very in cancer really is we were treating it as one this thing be used

23
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:07,881
for a very long time and not making very much progress in our understanding of a very in cancer.

24
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:13,181
a bit about in around two thousand and five. we really started to understand that this is not Wanda Singh.

25
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:18,221
these are actually five different history logic some type of a very in cancer and they're very

26
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:23,661
different high grade serious cancer is the most common in the most

27
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:29,081
lethal form. so it represents about seventy percent of all over in cancer diagnoses and about ninety

28
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:35,301
percent of all of that. due to a very in cancer. height high grade zero so very in cancer.

29
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:40,301
and we also began to understand that high rates are so very in cancer. appears

30
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:45,561
to most often originate not on. ovary were the dominant

31
00:02:45,561 --> 00:02:50,581
tumor mass is found. actually in the Philippines two and then the pass the sizes

32
00:02:50,581 --> 00:02:56,021
to the ovary. once he understood the role of the Philippians you.

33
00:02:56,021 --> 00:03:01,141
we started to think that there maybe some effective prevention approaches. this

34
00:03:01,141 --> 00:03:06,425
is the so love you and you can act into different ways

35
00:03:06,425 --> 00:03:11,585
when it comes to a very in Cancer. you can act as a conduit. which

36
00:03:11,585 --> 00:03:16,785
we're here on this side. so we've had a pretty good avenue logic

37
00:03:16,785 --> 00:03:21,885
evidence for a_while now that you would like patient is quite protected against which

38
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:27,045
you can next most common type so very in cancer which are called in Demetrio eight and clear

39
00:03:27,045 --> 00:03:32,105
seller very in cancer. we believe that that she will ideation is affected because

40
00:03:32,105 --> 00:03:37,365
it actually blocked. the passage way that retro grade ministration inflammation

41
00:03:37,365 --> 00:03:42,425
and infection use you got from the uterine and your. I'm

42
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:47,525
used to get from the uterus to the ovary to the location

43
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:52,625
is also slightly effective in preventing high grades or his cancer. not as

44
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:57,685
effective as it is for and to meet you right in clear cell. given that we believe

45
00:03:57,685 --> 00:04:02,925
that the tissue of origin for hybrid zero cancer is actually here in the skin

46
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:08,421
created and of that Philip two. we have proposed

47
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:13,621
that remove all the Philippians into actually removed

48
00:04:13,621 --> 00:04:18,921
the tissue of origins for hydrate grades or at a very in cancer and you would also

49
00:04:18,921 --> 00:04:24,761
get the benefits that we see West to the light geisha and four and you need your writing clear cell cancer.

50
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:30,221
we've also eliminated that opportunity for the slope back. as a conduit from the uterus

51
00:04:30,221 --> 00:04:35,341
to the ovary. so we're

52
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:40,561
full busy and on prevention as well because unfortunately despite

53
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:45,581
a significant amount of energy and effort the time and blood sweat and tears from people who

54
00:04:45,581 --> 00:04:51,081
have spent years and years and years trying to develop an effective screen approach for a very in cancer.

55
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:56,201
we really just haven't been able to do so. so our past time.

56
00:04:56,201 --> 00:05:01,341
so that's far. really comes from the UK. where they publish the results

57
00:05:01,341 --> 00:05:06,747
of the you Casey talks trial which involves you know years and years.

58
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:12,447
I follow up on a large population of women. I'm using a combination

59
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:17,667
of trans vaginal ultrasound and blood work and basically

60
00:05:17,667 --> 00:05:22,727
they concluded that if they followed I'm gonna get his number possibly slightly wrong but I approximately

61
00:05:22,727 --> 00:05:28,287
six hundred and fifty women for twelve years. they could prevent someone

62
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:33,427
from over in cancer. so not a very cost effective screening approach.

63
00:05:33,427 --> 00:05:38,707
at this time. so we're really still unable to effectively screen for this disease which is a shame

64
00:05:38,707 --> 00:05:43,847
because if you catch it in early stage at that stage as it is actually quite curable. we do have

65
00:05:43,847 --> 00:05:49,027
good survival rates. if you catch a very cancer early it just doesn't usually ever

66
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:54,067
happen that way. we also have not made a_lot_of progress in

67
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:59,687
treatment. you can see that these are very high survival curves across.

68
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:04,729
you know since the nineteen eighties. so we've been trying to develop new treatment strategies

69
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:09,829
and there have been some more recent. you can visit our back holes. so we're in the process right

70
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:14,889
now updating our survival data in British_Columbia. bye. there have been some

71
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:20,189
more recent innovations that may help

72
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:25,249
with survival but nothing significant. so really there's a case for prevention here

73
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:30,489
if we can prevent the disease. this maybe our best approach.

74
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:35,809
and with that in mind. in September of twenty ten you're very in cancer research

75
00:06:35,809 --> 00:06:41,139
team in British_Columbia which I'm now part of recommended changes in clinical

76
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:47,219
and surgical practice all kinda colleges in the province and they need three recommendations.

77
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:52,239
in the first while to reform stop and Jack to me which is a complete removal of

78
00:06:52,239 --> 00:06:57,479
both to look into. at the time of hysterectomy. so before this recommendation

79
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:02,859
if the woman is having a hysterectomy and she was not having her ovaries removed at the same time.

80
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:08,299
they would just leave which you and the ovaries in which you now the recommendation

81
00:07:08,299 --> 00:07:13,599
is. if you're doing a hysterectomy. don't leave that you remove that you just

82
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:19,419
continue to leave the ovaries removed that you and remove the entire finger rated and

83
00:07:19,419 --> 00:07:24,419
that will be an issue with the purpose of ovarian cancer prevention and

84
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:29,679
nine. the same recommendation was made with respect to women who are receiving permanent

85
00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:34,819
any reversible to both their life patients. rather than why didn't you just

86
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:39,938
remove that you that was the surgical practice change that was recommended and we called this

87
00:07:39,938 --> 00:07:45,018
opportunity six out in Jack to me and we call it that we had. we're not recommending that we

88
00:07:45,018 --> 00:07:50,058
didn't go out in the data surgery that week that they would not otherwise have received. we're

89
00:07:50,058 --> 00:07:55,518
merely saying. if you have an opportunity because you're already performing another surgery

90
00:07:55,518 --> 00:08:00,858
for another indication removed that you about that time. so it's an opportunity for

91
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:06,558
a cancer prevention initiative. the third recommendation is around to that experience

92
00:08:06,558 --> 00:08:11,638
with around better. perhaps in our bracket one and two women who carry a black

93
00:08:11,638 --> 00:08:16,678
one and two term I need patient to identify those patients as early as possible so that we

94
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:21,698
can intervene and prevent future brass and a very cancer recommendation. we

95
00:08:21,698 --> 00:08:27,158
are with that. all women who are diagnosed with a high grade serious or very in cancer.

96
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:32,994
he stands for genetic screening to be sent for a Brock oh one or two

97
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:38,434
your remind mediation test. in order to determine whether or not they are a carrier

98
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:43,854
and then we can bring in female family members who will then have an opportunity

99
00:08:43,854 --> 00:08:48,894
to prevent future cancers and if we find it they are also Rocco Weiner teacher

100
00:08:48,894 --> 00:08:54,234
my nutrition carriers. when you talk about a little bit today.

101
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:59,754
is I'm gonna tell you that about the data that we use for this analysis because we've been telling you about about

102
00:08:59,754 --> 00:09:04,814
some of the large state initiatives that you have underway here and it sounds similar to some of the

103
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:10,094
electronic health record data that you're working with. I'm gonna talk about the case

104
00:09:10,094 --> 00:09:15,434
so just because we recommended. I'm sure you're all aware of that telling doctors that you would like them to do something

105
00:09:15,434 --> 00:09:20,654
does not mean that they are in fact going to do that thing you back to continue. so I'm gonna tell

106
00:09:20,654 --> 00:09:26,654
you a bit about what happened in terms of whether people are due in both in British_Columbia in United_States.

107
00:09:26,654 --> 00:09:32,038
and then I'm gonna tell you what we know about the safety of it. so obviously we don't want to be performing

108
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:37,898
prevention procedures that are putting patients at Harmon at the point of surgery

109
00:09:37,898 --> 00:09:43,218
and then discuss the recognition first allergy based referral and I'll take every freaking

110
00:09:43,218 --> 00:09:48,298
surgeries on women with the Brock bedroom line patient and I'll tell you a little bit about

111
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:54,458
what we're doing in the future. I've to follow up. so

112
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:59,458
before I start. I come from Canada. we have a very different Health Care System. I just tell you a

113
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:04,898
little bit about how things work in British_Columbia. so we have a provincial he administered.

114
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:09,958
Universal medical medical and hospital health insurance system. that covers all of our

115
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:15,058
four. five million residents of the prominent and our ministry of

116
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:20,118
house is responsible for that system and they collect date on everything that

117
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:25,958
happens within the Health Care System. so they have information on all diagnoses procedures

118
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:31,464
car from every time that anyone in DC visit. any

119
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:36,764
practitioner that is covered under our medical plan which is all physicians and specialist and mid wives

120
00:10:36,764 --> 00:10:42,744
and nurse practitioners as well as anytime somebody is hospitalized

121
00:10:42,744 --> 00:10:47,904
or have a day surgery procedure and then we also have information on every

122
00:10:47,904 --> 00:10:53,004
drugs at trans an outpatient setting as well. and the Macy's

123
00:10:53,004 --> 00:10:58,124
data available for research purposes. so

124
00:10:58,124 --> 00:11:03,164
what we have for this project is a cohort of every woman born after nineteen

125
00:11:03,164 --> 00:11:08,344
fifty five in British_Columbia and we have information for nineteen eighty five to two thousand

126
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:13,784
and fourteen. we have data on every contact that they've had with anybody

127
00:11:13,784 --> 00:11:18,884
was covered by the Medical Services plan so those are the practitioners that I just listed. we know

128
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:24,224
the date that that that that visit occurred. we know the diagnostic codes that were related to the visit.

129
00:11:24,224 --> 00:11:29,280
any procedures any car related to that but that we also have information

130
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:34,380
on all hospitalization. so DATES diagnostic code.

131
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:39,540
anything that was done. Jerry not hospital stay. and then ways that we can

132
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:44,780
cost those hospital space as well. and then we have vital statistics information

133
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:49,900
on date on gas as well as birth. so we know grades parity

134
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:55,060
information as well as safety staff and possible staff. and this

135
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,200
is Lynn Cabal with our drive information. this is BC Farm and I assume you know

136
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,440
any kinda medications the sense what was dispense when it was the signs for how long

137
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,540
the duration was the prescription and all of that information. we also have a cancer

138
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:15,680
registry. so anytime anyone is diagnosed with cancer. they are entered into

139
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,720
the registry so we have information on their cancer diagnosis.

140
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,760
we use this information to you to stop pay if you're having cancer it's in perfect your child

141
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:31,002
have a little bit about any minute and then we have for some information

142
00:12:31,002 --> 00:12:36,102
on treatment of cancer. and then we also have a cancer agency screening program

143
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:41,302
and actually the guy that we use to identify patients who were tested and then

144
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:46,382
found to have Brock at one or two to remind patient and this also has date

145
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:51,602
on mammography as well and in British_Columbia everybody

146
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:57,542
is covered under the health insurance program and their all given a personal house number

147
00:12:57,542 --> 00:13:02,842
and that is the unique identifier that we use to find everyone across all of these data

148
00:13:02,842 --> 00:13:09,742
fast and then links together. so that we have a complete picture.

149
00:13:09,742 --> 00:13:15,082
so in this cohort we have two. seven million women and we have about fifty

150
00:13:15,082 --> 00:13:20,220
million person years of data. so it it's very very very big and

151
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:26,180
every woman average is about nine visits to Medical Services practitioners annually.

152
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:31,400
and one fifteenth of the cohort has some kind of either inpatient stay or day surgery

153
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:36,460
every year. and then the number of drugs prescribed is. so

154
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:41,900
it's a lots of model data.

155
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:47,080
some common problems that you know you running to working with data like that.

156
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:52,120
is that they really not selected for research they're collected for other purposes. so you're

157
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,120
often missing really important pieces of information. so you know the one that

158
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:02,660
I always really wish that I had information on necessity. there's nothing about

159
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:08,680
the city in any of the status. so I never have that information.

160
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:13,880
this is your economic status information is is often not ideal we have_to use neighborhood level

161
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,955
income data versus the economic status this is a lack of sufficient

162
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:23,975
detail. in some ways. so for example.

163
00:14:23,975 --> 00:14:29,295
we rely on the International Park Station of these codes. this is not how the physicians code

164
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:35,075
in the state. they're notorious for often coding at the third digit.

165
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:40,075
the IC codes which they actually go to five digit. so if you want really really precise

166
00:14:40,075 --> 00:14:45,375
information you need to use all five digit. you the only three can be problematic

167
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:50,395
in the most obvious example that afternoon. is that. if you want to be able to

168
00:14:50,395 --> 00:14:56,095
distinguish between type one or type two diabetes. you need the force code.

169
00:14:56,095 --> 00:15:01,255
so at the third told you to know somebody has diabetes. but if you don't have the fourth.

170
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:06,415
you don't know if it's type one or type two which I'm sure everybody knows those are very different diseases. so if

171
00:15:06,415 --> 00:15:11,415
you can thing was between type one or two you basically can't do anything meaningful. with respect to

172
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:16,445
diabetes. not all physicians code only at the third. bye

173
00:15:16,445 --> 00:15:22,705
many of them do. so. so that can be frustrating working with these data

174
00:15:22,705 --> 00:15:27,765
and then the cancer sub hygiene is often in precise and this is again because we rely

175
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:33,205
on these more for logic house. to stop take the cancers and we end up with.

176
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:38,285
there are some more of the logic codes that are for the patch all codes. and you basically cannot

177
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:43,305
say whether or not your patient. patient has serious cancer and to make sure to pick up as you got

178
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:48,405
the lump them into the unknown category which is you know not very helpful when

179
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:53,505
you're trying to do. I'm good over very in cancer research. and often

180
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:58,585
there are issues with the Octavia to be as well so we have we have you know some

181
00:15:58,585 --> 00:16:03,605
cases where were quite certain that they have watched the pit is incorrect and there's not really a_lot we

182
00:16:03,605 --> 00:16:09,025
can do about it. at this point we're working on and then privacy concerns can sometimes

183
00:16:09,025 --> 00:16:14,585
be difficult to work around the data Stewart. their primary purpose is to ensure privacy

184
00:16:14,585 --> 00:17:15,297
of these data and so you have_to be very careful

185
00:17:15,297 --> 00:17:20,397
so I find that sometimes it's hard to find really talented enthusiastic young

186
00:17:20,397 --> 00:17:25,437
people who want to play with these different you know the rest of their career.

187
00:17:25,437 --> 00:17:30,497
but if you are interested. it is great. and there's a lots

188
00:17:30,497 --> 00:17:35,737
of work to behind the Venus. so I highly recommend that it is a steep

189
00:17:35,737 --> 00:17:40,817
learning curve but once you Burns. it's actually not that

190
00:17:40,817 --> 00:17:45,837
challenging. you develop sort of message to get around a_lot_of the

191
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:50,957
and then you just get to do them over and over again. and it's time consuming. so everyone

192
00:17:50,957 --> 00:17:56,117
of those data set has his own data steward and they all need to Grant permission for all

193
00:17:56,117 --> 00:18:01,417
of your pro Jack. and anytime you wanna make a small change. every single

194
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:06,457
one of have_to sign off on that change. again means that your research isn't

195
00:18:06,457 --> 00:18:11,587
always as in Ball as you might like it to be because if

196
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:16,587
something new comes to light and you sing. oh my goodness I didn't ask for that piece of

197
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:21,767
information but now clearly this person is showing how important it is. you can be an owner

198
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:27,687
of process has_to go back and then that piece of information added to your pro Jack.

199
00:18:27,687 --> 00:18:32,947
which you know we do and you have_to have patience but that's just

200
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:38,027
one of. so just call issues of working with you later.

201
00:18:38,027 --> 00:18:43,047
let's get back to you the recommendations around take a box and a six hour project in

202
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:50,007
British_Columbia what did we see. so how many of you think that we got doctors to change practice.

203
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:55,787
anyone anyone. so you're gonna be so surprised.

204
00:18:55,787 --> 00:19:01,007
this is what it looks like. so back in two thousand and eight. we had eight

205
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:06,027
percent of women who are getting a hysterectomy with out correctly. having their

206
00:19:06,027 --> 00:19:11,195
Philippine tubes removed at the same time. so this is because our sign

207
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:17,555
off. we're already doing. they believed in it so strongly that they just started doing it and solve

208
00:19:17,555 --> 00:19:22,735
my twenty fourteen eighty percent of our hysterectomy patients are

209
00:19:22,735 --> 00:19:28,195
getting their shoes removed at the time of their hysterectomy when leaving their ovaries and such you.

210
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:36,035
so gynecologist is really really came on board very very strongly in British_Columbia.

211
00:19:36,035 --> 00:19:41,335
we see also see good I hate not as significant with five thousand technique for surly

212
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:46,675
but still remarkable. so basically this was not happening in British calling you at all

213
00:19:46,675 --> 00:19:51,755
before the recommendation and twenty fourteen we're up to fifty percent of

214
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:59,195
our people surly stations occurring through yourself and Jackson he this is remarkable

215
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:04,835
knowledge translation and we actually have a research project underway at the moment to try to understand

216
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:09,995
why this is so successful and it seems like the answer that question is largely

217
00:20:09,995 --> 00:20:15,775
that we have a very height net Community gynecologist in British_Columbia.

218
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:20,815
to meet every year at a conference that people really make a point of coming

219
00:20:20,815 --> 00:20:26,315
from all over the province to attend and gynecology gynecologist oncologist

220
00:20:26,315 --> 00:20:31,395
are really trusted in the prominent. so when they asked the gynecologist to make this practice

221
00:20:31,395 --> 00:20:36,395
change they said. if so and so just tell me to do it and I believe it's the right thing

222
00:20:36,395 --> 00:20:42,195
to do and I'm gonna do it. so that seems to be why this work. so well in British_Columbia.

223
00:20:42,195 --> 00:20:47,715
so it's not clear if that you know gonna be easily translated to other area

224
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:53,618
but we did have significant uptake here

225
00:20:53,618 --> 00:20:59,018
what didn't receive when we left that uptake in the United_States. so in order to do the address.

226
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:04,398
we use the nationwide inpatient sample and I say we could leave as part of best research projects

227
00:21:04,398 --> 00:21:09,578
as well and we look at two thousand and eight to two thousand thirteen. so I'll just

228
00:21:09,578 --> 00:21:14,578
process this by saying that. these recommendations were actually picked up by

229
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:19,778
eight cards in January twenty fifteen. they release recommendation for opportunity

230
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:24,838
six appendectomy almost exactly the same way that the regulations were made in British

231
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:29,858
family and twenty times. we don't obviously don't have the most recent data and

232
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:35,198
this project so I expect that rates will probably have gone. but we included

233
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:40,278
women who received the hysterectomy at to my dish and or appendectomy. we did

234
00:21:40,278 --> 00:21:45,398
anyone who was under fifty and anybody who's been diagnosed with any kind of a kind of harsh

235
00:21:45,398 --> 00:21:50,478
and ready to be seen. so you can see that we're

236
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:55,488
doing a_lot last hysterectomy in general which

237
00:21:55,488 --> 00:22:00,848
is a good day. Direct needs. we're happening to frequently. so this downward slope

238
00:22:00,848 --> 00:22:05,888
is good. this is hysterectomy with bilateral stopping those fresh needs so that means

239
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:11,688
you're taking. you dress shoes and ovaries and that hysterectomy alone.

240
00:22:11,688 --> 00:22:16,928
these are the people who we really wanna see that that you come out at the same time. this

241
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:22,468
is your leaving the ovaries. you're taking your. we want you to take with you. so

242
00:22:22,468 --> 00:22:27,648
that we're doing few days in here you can see we are doing more

243
00:22:27,648 --> 00:22:32,888
hysterectomy with our purchasing shop in Jackson in the United_States. this is a three hundred and seventy one percent

244
00:22:32,888 --> 00:22:38,048
increase over this time period. but still not where we would hope

245
00:22:38,048 --> 00:22:43,068
to see you because really we want all of these positions are almost all

246
00:22:43,068 --> 00:22:48,408
of those patients to be having there to removed at the same time. they're not very many contra

247
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:54,282
indications removing that use at the same time. this Reshmi

248
00:22:54,282 --> 00:22:59,582
so is happening here. I'm missing three scenes that were obviously nowhere near the rates

249
00:22:59,582 --> 00:23:05,102
that we're seeing in British_Columbia. so what do we know about the safety of the procedures or reasons to be concerned

250
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:10,522
about safety. so in DC we love that really makes. following

251
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:15,902
optimistic subject to me at the time of hysterectomy and is subject to me.

252
00:23:15,902 --> 00:23:20,962
first early station and our control group is always the surgery that the woman would have gotten

253
00:23:20,962 --> 00:23:26,282
had she had we not made the recommendation for the surgical practice change. so a hysterectomy alone

254
00:23:26,282 --> 00:23:32,062
as our comparison group for hysterectomy patients. if you would like patient first early patient patients

255
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:37,062
and you can see that there's no increased rest for hospital re admission and either

256
00:23:37,062 --> 00:23:42,582
group there's a slightly increased risk when you have a bilateral something that was brought to me which is not that surprising

257
00:23:42,582 --> 00:23:47,762
because that's a more complex procedure.

258
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:55,004
we look that blood transfusions. there is no increase rest for blood transfusion

259
00:23:55,004 --> 00:24:00,004
there is a shorter length of stay. associated with having opportunity

260
00:24:00,004 --> 00:24:05,024
stop check me with your hysterectomy and subject me for

261
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:10,224
their life nation. now if you're wondering why license stays seem really large

262
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:15,924
for something simple like people like patient or subject me which is the day procedure it should take

263
00:24:15,924 --> 00:24:21,304
a couple of hours. it's because many of these patients actually have this done. following a live

264
00:24:21,304 --> 00:24:26,424
first. so the hospital stay here is the postpartum day. if

265
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:31,644
you remove all of the patients you're having that surgery postpartum. then the

266
00:24:31,644 --> 00:24:36,704
license is actually point one one four to the light patient and point one oh

267
00:24:36,704 --> 00:24:41,704
four subject check me for Star licensure. and then we look

268
00:24:41,704 --> 00:24:46,904
at the time in the operating room. we want to know was just taking a_lot_of extra time to get time operating

269
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:52,244
room time is money and we found that there's a need of sixteen additional

270
00:24:52,244 --> 00:24:57,776
minutes in the operating room to include self inject any other time this is Reshmi

271
00:24:57,776 --> 00:25:02,796
and there's a need of ten additional minutes to do it instead of the July patient. so a

272
00:25:02,796 --> 00:25:08,136
tiny bit more time in the operating room but not significantly. you not ours

273
00:25:08,136 --> 00:25:13,616
more time. what we finally look at fifty data in the United_States.

274
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:19,596
basically the same thing really that there's no increase risk for

275
00:25:19,596 --> 00:25:24,596
a blood transfusion. there is no increase risk

276
00:25:24,596 --> 00:25:30,016
for a postoperative complication. there is no increase no significantly

277
00:25:30,016 --> 00:25:35,756
increase risk for postoperative infection. and you know significantly in distress for post operative

278
00:25:35,756 --> 00:25:40,756
fevers. so in summary of what

279
00:25:40,756 --> 00:25:45,916
we know for opportunities up in Jackson he is that practically it's a little

280
00:25:45,916 --> 00:25:51,176
bit more time in the operating room. not a large safety.

281
00:25:51,176 --> 00:25:56,456
all the safety evidence that we have_to this point looks quite good. we have noticed on a bill increase in anything

282
00:25:56,456 --> 00:26:01,640
that we've measured and then in terms of paying. we have a really germ

283
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,800
asked to take the procedure in British_Columbia and nine in the United_States.

284
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,220
if you look at only the hysterectomy with ovaries which retains

285
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:17,560
it increased from two. three percent of all his truck maybe in two thousand and eight to fifteen point

286
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,620
eight. in two thousand and thirteen and we expect that that will

287
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:27,980
have increased further since the eighth part recommendation was released in January

288
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:33,056
of twenty fifteen so what

289
00:26:33,056 --> 00:26:38,816
do we know about apology based referral. this is a recommendation. again that

290
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:44,196
anybody West hydrate serious. this recommendation. the third one that anybody

291
00:26:44,196 --> 00:26:50,376
with a high racer is a very in cancer besides for genetic screen. so

292
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:55,616
I wanna back if you need patients for those of you who aren't familiar with sanitary.

293
00:26:55,616 --> 00:27:00,796
increase risk for ovarian and breast cancer. so woman with the Brock oh one

294
00:27:00,796 --> 00:27:06,156
zero I need patient have a forty to seventy five percent life time rest for a very in cancer

295
00:27:06,156 --> 00:27:11,216
with Brock at two eight two thirty four percent lifetime rest. compare to

296
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:16,256
one. four and a one. seven in the general population with breast cancer.

297
00:27:16,256 --> 00:27:21,516
one is journal my need patient. I carry a fifty five to sixty five percent lifetime

298
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:26,516
risk for breast cancer. the brackets you it's forty to fifty percent compared to

299
00:27:26,516 --> 00:27:31,812
about a twelve percent lifetime risk and the general population so these are

300
00:27:31,812 --> 00:27:37,072
really quite dramatic genetic mediation. they really you significantly increase

301
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:42,312
your risk for both breast and a very in cancer. so

302
00:27:42,312 --> 00:27:47,411
again patients. so at the time of the reservation was made. there was also

303
00:27:47,411 --> 00:27:53,132
a change made on the apology reports in British_Columbia. so when a pathologist

304
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:58,592
with diagnosing a high grade serious cancer on the path report. they put

305
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,092
their statement exactly. high grade serious carcinoma of the ovary

306
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:09,752
slash Olympian to flash parents and him is associated with a blackout one and she medication

307
00:28:09,752 --> 00:28:15,252
in over twenty percent of patients. we recommend this patient be referred to the BCC.

308
00:28:15,252 --> 00:28:20,392
hereditary cancer program. so whenever I got a call just are dying on for any doctor

309
00:28:20,392 --> 00:28:26,012
who was diagnosed being a patient with high raiser is over in Caster. got a pass report

310
00:28:26,012 --> 00:28:31,076
that was printed right on and why did

311
00:28:31,076 --> 00:28:36,656
they do that they did that because there was something missing work that came out.

312
00:28:36,656 --> 00:28:42,196
on PC and other places but I'll just tell you about the DC study that examines

313
00:28:42,196 --> 00:28:47,196
Bracken mediation status in women who are undergoing surgical staging for

314
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:52,235
non- business so very in cancer and they found that twenty five percent of the hydrate zero so

315
00:28:52,235 --> 00:28:57,656
very in cancer patients had a broccoli one or breakfast you to remind mediation and patients

316
00:28:57,656 --> 00:29:02,696
with other type of brain cancer. non- of the had records

317
00:29:02,696 --> 00:29:07,975
to remind patients and there's been other large covert studies. in other parts of the world including

318
00:29:07,975 --> 00:29:13,056
Australia that have reported really similar findings. so between a twenty twenty five percent

319
00:29:13,056 --> 00:29:18,235
rate. I'm on hydrate serious cancer patients and usually if the pathology

320
00:29:18,235 --> 00:29:23,276
is really really thorough. no recommendations in women with any other sub

321
00:29:23,276 --> 00:29:28,407
type of a very in cancer also found. we

322
00:29:28,407 --> 00:29:33,407
went from eight hundred and thirty one women and they got all the family history information that

323
00:29:33,407 --> 00:29:38,447
genetic counselor whatever pain from them and they said how many of you were qualified

324
00:29:38,447 --> 00:29:43,507
based on your family history alone to have gotten broccoli one or bracket you need patient

325
00:29:43,507 --> 00:29:48,507
pass because these test are only given out to families. two women who

326
00:29:48,507 --> 00:29:53,567
have a strong family history of breast or a very in cancer. and there's very clear ways that somebody

327
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:58,767
qualifies to get a pass. they found only nine percent of use

328
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:03,867
twenty five percent of women would actually qualified based on family history alone. and

329
00:30:03,867 --> 00:30:09,027
this is largely because family sizes are just getting much smaller and we often don't know our second

330
00:30:09,027 --> 00:30:14,067
cousin in our great dance we don't know what happened to those people. as well

331
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:19,067
as one might need you in order to really understand your family history for breast

332
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:24,579
or a very in cancer so it's just that they seen our testing on family history

333
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:29,759
alone is just not gonna cut it in terms of capturing our high risk women. if we're really trying to prevent

334
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:35,919
cancer. we have_to identify the people we have_to identify them early.

335
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,739
so the reason is questions that we asked was did Theresa Brock wanted to testing on the high racer.

336
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:47,119
have the patience increase. following the educational campaign and how many carriers has

337
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:52,199
been performed because if we're only capturing your remind a patients in

338
00:30:52,199 --> 00:30:57,379
the women who already have cancer but they not actually testing any of their family

339
00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:03,019
members are performing any carrier test. then we're not. again we're not gonna prevent future cancer.

340
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:08,059
we only part the mediation in the next patient we really need to capture carriers. in

341
00:31:08,059 --> 00:31:13,179
order to have affected prevention strategies and then we were also wanted to know

342
00:31:13,179 --> 00:31:18,199
once we know who has a black one or two German vacation what are we actually doing

343
00:31:18,199 --> 00:31:24,419
about it because the whole reason again for identifying high risk patients is that we have risk you to intervention

344
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:29,639
we can put in place in order to prevent future cancers. we need to know if there's actually

345
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:34,959
off take of any of these procedures. so here we

346
00:31:34,959 --> 00:31:40,339
looked at five thousand seven hundred and twelve women who were tested for Bracken water to

347
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:45,759
Germany patient at the Credit Cancer Program. twelve hundred and eighty four. Sam did have

348
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:50,759
medication. the rest were negative. there were five hundred and three index

349
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:55,939
cases. so that means the first affected patient she comes in for the task is the index

350
00:31:55,939 --> 00:32:01,279
case and anybody that comes in because of this index patients or sister

351
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:07,199
or daughter. her mother is a carrier time.

352
00:32:07,199 --> 00:32:12,299
so over time what we see with our rack and wanting to test is that they're dramatically

353
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:17,479
increasing the dotted line is the educational campaign. I'm on our a very in cancer

354
00:32:17,479 --> 00:32:25,276
patients who came in for test post diagnosis. you can see this is increasing over time

355
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:30,576
when we look at the his the logic. I'm tied of who was tested before and after the campaign.

356
00:32:30,576 --> 00:32:36,176
you can see here that before the campaign was about fifty nine percent zero stations and after.

357
00:32:36,176 --> 00:32:41,375
it's about seventy three percent. you can see here that after the campaign about eighty percent

358
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:47,215
of that back up positive. our patients were serious cancer patients

359
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:52,416
and here these numbers are what I need when I say we don't entirely trust our host

360
00:32:52,416 --> 00:32:57,556
the logic sub hygiene. we believe that all of these should be zero. if

361
00:32:57,556 --> 00:33:03,355
that is the logic of taking one hundred percent correct because

362
00:33:03,355 --> 00:33:08,651
the data suggest that in any trading yourself cancer patients are not usually

363
00:33:08,651 --> 00:33:13,938
back I July need patient positive. so we're in the process of trying to fix these data. we're actually

364
00:33:13,938 --> 00:33:18,958
having to re identify the patients going got their team or samples.

365
00:33:18,958 --> 00:33:24,198
review the pathology and then link it back to the data in order to be sure

366
00:33:24,198 --> 00:33:29,678
that this is the logical thing is accurate. and then this group of patients in

367
00:33:29,678 --> 00:33:34,858
pain of my existence. so these people who we really just can't say what subject

368
00:33:34,858 --> 00:33:40,318
they have because we don't have enough information to properly sanitize them.

369
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:45,718
and you can see here. just based on their numbers alone. that they are mostly hydrated

370
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:50,758
zero so very in cancer patient. but we obviously can't just make that assumption. we

371
00:33:50,758 --> 00:33:56,098
need to look at their pathology reports and see their tumors. so again we are working

372
00:33:56,098 --> 00:34:03,138
to try and do that. so that we can properly set up tight presentation.

373
00:34:03,138 --> 00:34:08,298
so in order to see what affect the educational campaign hired we compared our serious cancer

374
00:34:08,298 --> 00:34:13,415
patients randomly trading your self cancer patients because campaign you know recommendation

375
00:34:13,415 --> 00:34:18,515
around changing screening for these patients really only recommended a change for the serious cancer

376
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:24,095
patients. they're acting as our control. you can see here that their testing rates were

377
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:29,495
really in line off until about two thousand and nine. when all of a sudden

378
00:34:29,495 --> 00:34:34,535
we see a dramatic change in screen I'm on our serious cancer

379
00:34:34,535 --> 00:34:39,795
patients and a slight drop off dinner and you need writing yourself cast patience.

380
00:34:39,795 --> 00:34:45,095
and again the dotted educational campaign. so change started happening before the educational

381
00:34:45,095 --> 00:34:51,495
campaign not unlike what we saw was opportunity to stop and check me. bye. significantly more.

382
00:34:51,495 --> 00:34:56,595
I'll take your occurred after the campaign and we got to the point here where about forty

383
00:34:56,595 --> 00:35:01,815
four percent of our serious cancer patients were in fact going to the heard that right a check cash

384
00:35:01,815 --> 00:35:06,915
program and got Brock I wanted you to remind you Keisha.

385
00:35:06,915 --> 00:35:12,385
sorry I'm like running out_of time. I just okay.

386
00:35:12,385 --> 00:35:17,505
that includes no question. okay. so it can be was

387
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:22,885
dead. they said Terry is. so here recently. before

388
00:35:22,885 --> 00:35:28,245
and after the campaign that before the campaign we're doing about two. two. carrier have

389
00:35:28,245 --> 00:35:33,385
her back upon the patient after two. eight. before I'm on our back

390
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:38,385
because of over and cancer patients we're doing about two. five after about three. three. this

391
00:35:38,385 --> 00:35:43,465
is not a Ross back of the envelope calculations just that if we're gonna be

392
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:48,485
really effective in prevention of any cancer. we really need to be bringing in between four

393
00:35:48,485 --> 00:35:53,965
and five carriers. her back a positive patience.

394
00:35:53,965 --> 00:35:59,085
so we got work to do here. I'm ready. so whenever we

395
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:04,305
see with the risk for using intervention. basically this flight is just to point out

396
00:36:04,305 --> 00:36:09,525
here that I'm on our back I wanna brought back if you have the patience we have a_lot_of people who had

397
00:36:09,525 --> 00:36:14,733
a cancer before they got their genetic pass so when we look

398
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:20,773
at this we just always wanna try to fight by whether or not they have a prior history of breast for

399
00:36:20,773 --> 00:36:26,193
Dinesh answer. just here when we work at race a bilateral mastectomy by previous

400
00:36:26,193 --> 00:36:31,713
cancer history. you can see that about. just over thirty percent

401
00:36:31,713 --> 00:36:37,373
of the women who have a no no history of a prior breast regarding cancer

402
00:36:37,373 --> 00:36:42,993
have decided she got a bilateral mastectomy to reduce their breast cancer rest. and

403
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:48,453
I know who have a previous history is slightly higher at around just over forty percent.

404
00:36:48,453 --> 00:36:53,773
and in brackets you these numbers are a bit lower. just under thirty percent

405
00:36:53,773 --> 00:36:59,253
and just over forty percent care for women who are under taking bilateral

406
00:36:59,253 --> 00:37:04,773
message yesterday. with respect to helping

407
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:09,953
open for said that the recommendation in our high risk population is still the house.

408
00:37:09,953 --> 00:37:15,133
both ovaries and shoes removed. if you are Barbara Brock wanna record teacher and I need patient

409
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:20,589
carrier in order to prevent a very in cancer and you can see just by the fact

410
00:37:20,589 --> 00:37:25,849
that that's a fairly intensive surgery that many women are in fact offering

411
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:30,969
to do that if they have black eyes or in line. new patients and this is

412
00:37:30,969 --> 00:37:36,649
likely because with breast cancer. we can't provide

413
00:37:36,649 --> 00:37:42,029
more intensive screening. so MRIs are fairly effective screening tools and annual

414
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:47,289
MRIs and a high risk population is currently the recommendation for breast cancer screening.

415
00:37:47,289 --> 00:37:52,549
it is not full proof which is why you see many women. parking for the bilateral mastectomy.

416
00:37:52,549 --> 00:37:57,749
but since we have no screen approach for over in Cancer. we have more of our back

417
00:37:57,749 --> 00:38:02,769
and one in record to positive women often have bilateral something direct me.

418
00:38:02,769 --> 00:38:09,349
you can see here rates about fifty percent and women who are not been affected by a previous cancer.

419
00:38:09,349 --> 00:38:17,131
just over sixty and know if you have an similar here in our Breckenridge Whitman

420
00:38:17,131 --> 00:38:22,131
just fight for us. we also wanted to see how many were diagnosed with the breast or gynecology

421
00:38:22,131 --> 00:38:27,551
cancer. after they already knew about their back up positive status. so are there people who

422
00:38:27,551 --> 00:38:33,051
you know we really just Celine. in terms of helping avoid this cancer

423
00:38:33,051 --> 00:38:38,191
and unfortunately the answer is yes. there are. so there were seventy women who knew that

424
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:43,491
they were at high risk for breast in a very in cancer because of that term I need patients who ended

425
00:38:43,491 --> 00:38:48,551
up developing a breast cancer. and there were twenty one. who developed the

426
00:38:48,551 --> 00:38:53,911
guy next logic cancer. after they were aware of their of their new patient

427
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:59,171
status in seventy six percent of these guys counselors were very in cancer

428
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:04,411
and unfortunately twelve fifteen. seven. one percent had actually undergone

429
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:09,611
our RBS. so before the cancer diagnosis which they just

430
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:14,611
that we just intervened to too late. so by the time we went in to take the cheese

431
00:39:14,611 --> 00:39:19,809
and the ovaries there was either already cancer four. we

432
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:25,449
hope that you've been ovaries but there has already been a leash and that had half the size to the parents.

433
00:39:25,449 --> 00:39:30,489
so we were just too late. what are we doing

434
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:35,769
for future research. we're doing a brighter and more comprehensive safety assessment

435
00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:41,769
issues again. we just want to be absolutely one hundred percent sure that there is no difference

436
00:39:41,769 --> 00:39:46,821
in our groups in terms of any outcome of the surgery we're offering

437
00:39:46,821 --> 00:39:51,821
a cohort study. so I have right now. we don't believe that the flow

438
00:39:51,821 --> 00:39:57,061
be into place. any role in terms of for non- function. but we don't

439
00:39:57,061 --> 00:40:02,161
actually know that was one hundred percent certainty. so we are

440
00:40:02,161 --> 00:40:07,261
in the process of trying to determine that with one hundred percent certainty

441
00:40:07,261 --> 00:40:12,281
that there is no hormone overall that the flow be into place and the way that we're

442
00:40:12,281 --> 00:40:17,381
giving. we are going to measure age and

443
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:22,421
then apart as in women who had opportunity to in a six hour project me for the purposes

444
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:27,501
of their patients. we're not gonna study our hysterectomy we you get a hysterectomy

445
00:40:27,501 --> 00:40:32,541
itself has a fairly important fact on her own function. and we

446
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:37,801
just don't believe that we're gonna be able to power it enough to to Texas. I need a little extra difference

447
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:42,901
that might result from removal of that chickens at the same time. so we're gonna do this and the women who just

448
00:40:42,901 --> 00:40:48,094
had their shoes removed first early station and we're following up the women who had this

449
00:40:48,094 --> 00:40:53,134
done. you know started when we first started giving it in two thousand and eight two five nine two

450
00:40:53,134 --> 00:40:58,674
thousand ten. we're contacting that in the next year or two to ask about about

451
00:40:58,674 --> 00:41:03,774
their last menstrual period. among other things to determine whether or

452
00:41:03,774 --> 00:41:09,154
not there is a difference in the agent wants it in. I'm not sure if many of you know about

453
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:14,614
decreasing the agent wanted to menopause comes in a whole host of other potential health problems including

454
00:41:14,614 --> 00:41:19,834
an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality. we really don't wanna do is figure

455
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:25,114
out that we were basically just removing their one point five percent lifetime

456
00:41:25,114 --> 00:41:30,294
or ask for a very in cancer just to give them that increased. one. eight

457
00:41:30,294 --> 00:41:36,314
percent risk for cardiovascular and smart holidays. so wife you know way the actual

458
00:41:36,314 --> 00:41:41,414
helpful aspect of this prevention efforts. we don't think this is the case all the short term

459
00:41:41,414 --> 00:41:46,506
data that we have_to adjusted there is not any hormone function differences in each group

460
00:41:46,506 --> 00:41:51,806
we really do need this long term. they got to be sure. and then of course

461
00:41:51,806 --> 00:41:56,966
the million dollar question is are we in fact prevent you know very in cancer that's what we really wanna

462
00:41:56,966 --> 00:42:02,106
know. so we're doing the effectiveness study combining data with another

463
00:42:02,106 --> 00:42:07,146
province in Canada. so that we have more power and we expect that when once we

464
00:42:07,146 --> 00:42:12,286
have follow up to the end of twenty nineteen. we will be able to answer this

465
00:42:12,286 --> 00:42:17,286
question once and for all. in the meantime there's a bit of preliminary data that

466
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:22,686
suggest that we are on the right track. so these are two retrospective

467
00:42:22,686 --> 00:42:28,186
covert studies that were done in Scandinavian countries and they reported

468
00:42:28,186 --> 00:42:33,406
that a bilateral cell project and he was associated with a hazard ratio

469
00:42:33,406 --> 00:42:38,526
of point three five forever developing in a very in cancer.

470
00:42:38,526 --> 00:42:43,566
this group in Denmark report and hydration appoint five eight. among women

471
00:42:43,566 --> 00:42:48,620
who had had a bilateral [INAUDIBLE] jacked me Dee the retrospective.

472
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:54,080
so the women would've gotten subject to me for purposes of the path to logical purposes.

473
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:59,520
they had hide your cell pants or public inflammatory disease or something that would've affected

474
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:05,300
their underlying risk for a very in cancer in the first place. and then also

475
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:10,320
the surgeons tell me repeatedly that they do the surgery different when

476
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:15,340
they do it for the purpose of pro full access. they're removing a flow and two

477
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:20,560
for a very in cancer prevention. they're very very careful to make sure that they got every

478
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,000
little bit of fasting braided. end of the flip into. if they're removing at you because

479
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,340
had your cell things. they're not as careful. so we expect that when this is done for the purpose

480
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:37,020
of pro flax. it's actually gonna be more protective than what these retrospective studies are reporting

481
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:42,680
and this is a pro active study on excision out to both their life patients

482
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:48,160
coming out_of the United_States and they reported Andre show up. five nine

483
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,700
but it was a smaller study and they didn't have quite enough power to show significance

484
00:43:53,700 --> 00:44:00,520
and they want a few different forms of exceptional. she will surly patient together.

485
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:05,860
but also just that this is likely to be effective in terms of moving

486
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:11,480
cancer prevention. and we are hoping to have an impact on

487
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,100
decreasing race of a very in cancer. so we one thirty percent reduction in a very in cancer.

488
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:22,280
results from this from this educational program. we expect

489
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:27,660
about ten to fifteen percent reduction to subject me other time with us directly. the same

490
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,660
for first early station and then we hope to decrease

491
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:37,980
the rate of over in house right at five percent bike that are identifying intervening

492
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:43,020
in our high rest population. that's it.

493
00:44:43,020 --> 00:45:00,530
thank you very much

494
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:05,970
yeah so I have hi. I obviously just didn't have time to show you all the data.

495
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:11,410
yeah we'd love to chat or a concept of pill use and we are going to be

496
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:16,970
taking further into Earl Hutchins. he'll use I. we actually would like to do a project

497
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:22,010
that combine Pharmacy date with specimens.

498
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:27,290
so that we can look at whether or not there's a difference

499
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:32,450
in pre- cursor mission among women who have or have not used zero hundred

500
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:37,550
have the pill for more than five years. that's an addition study that we're still you know

501
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:42,790
trying to design that we have I think that there's probably important differences in the form of the oral contraception

502
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:47,830
of tell. so you know we're gonna try to do something

503
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:53,082
interesting there yes I do have a real concept of how that I just didn't have a chance

504
00:45:53,082 --> 00:46:10,402
to show any of that today.

505
00:46:10,402 --> 00:46:15,502
you know need to Lisa's house actually gone. so

506
00:46:15,502 --> 00:46:21,018
we do know that we're probably missing like they're probably position to recommend

507
00:46:21,018 --> 00:46:26,798
their patients ago go. and the patient make the choice that it's not something that they wanted do.

508
00:46:26,798 --> 00:46:31,818
so and we just unfortunately have_to buy anything because there's no where in

509
00:46:31,818 --> 00:46:36,858
the status exercise. I recommended the patient go. so

510
00:46:36,858 --> 00:46:42,078
there will be people who make the choice but it's not right for them. we expect that there'll always be some

511
00:46:42,078 --> 00:46:47,658
people I need for example if there's a woman who has no e-mail relatives or anybody

512
00:46:47,658 --> 00:46:52,718
you know is not concerned about anyone in her family she need a side wall. it's too late for

513
00:46:52,718 --> 00:46:57,778
me I already have cancer. so it doesn't really make a difference. whether or not

514
00:46:57,778 --> 00:47:03,138
I know. so I'm not gonna take this test. now having said that

515
00:47:03,138 --> 00:47:08,138
this is all dramatically changed within the last year because there is now a treatment

516
00:47:08,138 --> 00:47:14,078
for high or it's over in cancer. I'm not women with a record at Sterling mediation.

517
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:19,298
call her and he better and so in order to qualify for the treatment you need to know

518
00:47:19,298 --> 00:47:24,467
that you have a black one or record teacher and I need patient so all of a sudden we are now doing

519
00:47:24,467 --> 00:47:29,707
much better job because it actually affects how we're gonna do for your cancer. now it's really

520
00:47:29,707 --> 00:47:34,727
important that we know. immediately upon diagnosis what your vacation status

521
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:39,727
is. all of this has changed radically in the last year because of this

522
00:47:39,727 --> 00:47:53,247
change in treatment for women with the Brock I wanted you to remind the patient

523
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:58,647
there yet. we have looked at the number on first and second surgery

524
00:47:58,647 --> 00:48:03,867
relatives and the agent agent is not seem to be particularly a factor. and actually

525
00:48:03,867 --> 00:48:09,047
your number. first second and third be relatives does not seem

526
00:48:09,047 --> 00:48:14,107
particularly to be a factor. but as of right now

527
00:48:14,107 --> 00:48:19,367
as I said you know this all becomes a little bit of a move point because now this is the treatment

528
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:25,245
decision so people are going to to pass whether or not they're

529
00:48:25,245 --> 00:48:43,425
relatives coming. it's gonna be bad. the big question now.

530
00:48:43,425 --> 00:48:49,065
bye. oh

531
00:48:49,065 --> 00:49:15,725
you ain't enter your protective for a very hazard. gosh we you probably know that better than I do.

532
00:49:15,725 --> 00:49:20,865
yeah. so for a long time. there was interest in our relation high processes which they just said

533
00:49:20,865 --> 00:49:26,287
that anything that need you off you late last min thought you were gonna see you're resting over in cancer

534
00:49:26,287 --> 00:49:32,067
and this is part of the going process before we understood the role of the flood being too big now.

535
00:49:32,067 --> 00:49:37,187
I think people are sort of changing their sink you know a little bad but it does appear that there is

536
00:49:37,187 --> 00:49:42,267
some relationship between. so parity you know being pregnant having

537
00:49:42,267 --> 00:49:47,847
children does decrease your risk breast feeding

538
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:52,847
possibly or a concept to tell you yet. you know all the

539
00:49:52,847 --> 00:49:58,107
things that actually stop population do up here. related to decrease rest.

540
00:49:58,107 --> 00:50:03,167
but not exactly the ratio that we would expect if it were quite so simple as every

541
00:50:03,167 --> 00:50:08,167
time every month that you don't populate your response down it doesn't appear that it's quite straight

542
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:22,612
forward
