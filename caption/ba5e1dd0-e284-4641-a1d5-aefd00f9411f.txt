1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,850
That's. How are you doing?

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,380
Great. Are you crazy? We went to Chicago.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,770
Oh. Oh. How was it?

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:16,690
You know, just magnificent and huge buildings.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:24,310
Oh, how lovely. Yeah. And the trees are all orange and red, so it's very beautiful.

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:34,370
It's beautiful this year, you know? Oh. How long were you there helping?

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:44,990
Three days. Three days? Yes. The weather was good. Yes, sort of, you know, a little with a little windy.

8
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:50,140
Yeah, it's called the Windy City. Yeah. Yeah.

9
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,700
I was talking to somebody who was up north in Michigan, just in Traverse City, and it was snowing there yesterday.

10
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:08,690
Oh, really? Oh, yeah. I know. It's coming on the eve of that day.

11
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:36,230
No, it couldn't be. Oh.

12
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,500
Happened. Yeah, there were.

13
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:48,719
No it's like another occasion. Oh, well, I guess it's.

14
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:59,970
Where is it? I believe it's celebrity status, apparently.

15
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:06,420
Order is an order. Yeah. Don't go to six.

16
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:15,090
Yes. No, no. 46. 46.

17
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,210
Yes. I am the one who feels like killing myself.

18
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,980
So it's okay? Yeah. Thank you. There is no time like this.

19
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:36,420
Yes. In 46 years.

20
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,000
Two. Some years? Yes. Oh.

21
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,250
Visibility on the screen. Is it better if I turn the light off?

22
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:59,340
Yes, it is going to get so dark. But this is so poor right now.

23
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,810
All right. I'm going to get started just for we have a few things to get through.

24
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,610
I know everyone's in the middle of midterms right now, so it's very stressful.

25
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,350
So I hope they're all doing okay. Getting through them.

26
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:22,590
Yeah, but it's helping since we've got the beautiful leaves to get through the season right now.

27
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:29,860
I just want to go through a few housekeeping things. So next week we will have a guest speaker.

28
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:37,320
Michelle, Amy is going to join us. She's a big champion for disability research and awareness at the university.

29
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:44,280
And I also wanted to make you aware of a conference that's going on, actually, that's starting this week, which is related to.

30
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:56,219
Disability on campus. And so this is a conference called toward an anti ablest academy, so towards an anti ableist academy at Michigan,

31
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:01,340
so that we would be more inclusive with respect to people with disabilities.

32
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:05,280
So just like there's ageism and there's able is an.

33
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:12,160
You know, sort of this sort of bias that we are unaware of. It's got some fantastic events and talks.

34
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,940
I think most importantly is this one, imagining a disability cultural center at the University of Michigan.

35
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:25,120
This one is something that I know a lot of students have been really pushing for, to find a place,

36
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:32,250
a cultural center that recognizes and can be a safe space for talking about disability and supporting disability.

37
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,940
So it's really exciting to see this attention to disability on campus.

38
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,730
It's long overdue and I encourage you all to to intend whatever you can.

39
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,480
And we look forward to Michelle Lee walking us through some of the work that she's doing on campus as well.

40
00:04:50,830 --> 00:05:01,560
So that is just a little heads up information. The other thing is I just do a heads up for the November 30th class.

41
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:08,920
This is the class that's after the Thanksgiving break. We will be having the class at the Institute for Social Research.

42
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,760
So that is on Thompson Street. 426 Thompson Street.

43
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:19,510
It's not it's like about a 15 minute walk from here, you know, on the other side of the diag in that direction.

44
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,730
We will be there and we'll have a class in the in the building.

45
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,590
I'll give you the room number later for the first hour and T.J. is presenting then.

46
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,670
But then for the second hour, the reason why we're going to be over there is that I managed to get us a tour for the University of Michigan Home Lab,

47
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:48,939
which will give us which is relating to the topic of technology and aging, because it is about kind of understanding how technology campus is tiny,

48
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:57,879
but the link is in the slide there to understand how technology can be used in the home to support people aging in place,

49
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:06,310
but also technology advances that are being used to monitor people for after discharge from surgery or from hospital.

50
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,819
So it's sort of some neat ideas and really a very zipped up fancy lab that does all sorts of biomedical or or biometric censoring as well.

51
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:25,450
So we'll get through there. If anybody has any issues or difficulty in making that location switch, please let me know.

52
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,820
We can work out accommodations. Any questions?

53
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,930
Does everybody. Has anybody been to Easter? Yes, my party.

54
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,160
I drive through and I saw this. Okay.

55
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:48,840
It's a fun place. It's sort of where I'm based. And it's it's a fun place.

56
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:52,390
It's a completely interdisciplinary, interdisciplinary building.

57
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:57,010
Everyone's sort of passionate about social science research, so it's very cool.

58
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:04,780
Okay. Um, I wanted to also spend a little bit of time talking about the finer point,

59
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,850
a little paper assignment my mother has been working at this morning, and we are.

60
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,520
I just wanted to go through it. It's not due until the, you know, the end of the semester.

61
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,099
So the final papers are due December nine. But I wanted to just kind of revisit this.

62
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,049
We talked about this obviously very early in the class, but go through what this entails,

63
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:31,390
make sure I can make sure it's very clear for everybody and I want to be able to answer any questions that people might have.

64
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:38,260
So it's really a 10 to 12 page paper, double spaced, excluding references.

65
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:48,100
It's an opportunity for you to take a topic that you're passionate about and relate to aging and apply what you've learned

66
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:56,140
in the course to thinking about it from the perspective of a life course or perspective of ageism or structural ageism.

67
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:02,709
So for example, if you were to pick cardiovascular disease in older adults,

68
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,900
kind of thinking about how life course perspective could be used to understand

69
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,730
premature onset of cardiovascular disease or inequalities in cardiovascular disease,

70
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,670
and then how a social determinants of health perspective contributes to understanding that.

71
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:25,540
And so what that means is kind of taking some of the concepts we learned in the class where these social

72
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:30,760
determinants of health could be things like the home environment or the neighborhood environment,

73
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:39,310
and how those factors could help people to prevent cardiovascular disease or premature cardiovascular disease with aging.

74
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:47,200
So, you know, pull on social supports or health policy or education or income,

75
00:08:47,530 --> 00:08:50,559
sort of just thinking about the concepts that we've been talking about in this

76
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,209
class and apply them to understanding the topic that you're interested in,

77
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:04,840
that you're passionate about. And the rubric is really sort of, you know, the first piece is providing a comprehensive overview of that topic.

78
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:11,559
So what is known about cardiovascular disease, for example, in the literature, including what are the evidence,

79
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,920
you know, what's the epidemiology of it, what's the evidence for health inequities across different social groups?

80
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:26,739
Again, how ageism or the life course perspective could be used to understand the topic and then diving into some of the

81
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,940
key social determinants of health that shape inequalities in in that a particular topic that you're interested in,

82
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,219
you can use any reference style,

83
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:47,500
just make sure it's consistent across the paper and then include whatever references you need to provide support for your statements.

84
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:55,850
Any questions? Okay.

85
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,670
I am absolutely happy to talk to anybody about their paper as we get closer.

86
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:04,730
Feel free to, you know, grab me after class, before class, email me.

87
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:08,060
I'm happy to meet in person via Zoom, whatever. It's convenient for you.

88
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:15,830
This is just really a chance for you to to apply what you've learned in this class to something that you're passionate about with respect to aging.

89
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:21,470
I use this term a think piece because that's when I was in graduate school that we were often told to write.

90
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:25,999
You know, essentially, I think a piece which is basically a critical piece of thinking about,

91
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,810
you know, an issue thoughtfully and critically so that it's not just a descriptive paper.

92
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:42,220
All right. Any other questions? Nothing. All right.

93
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:48,010
Okay. So we'll back in to talking about social supports and loneliness.

94
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:51,489
So this is a topic about risk,

95
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:57,010
but also resilience and how we can think about social supports and social relations as a

96
00:10:57,010 --> 00:11:02,230
resource to actually help people that are aging and prevent loneliness and social isolation.

97
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,940
So my goal is to really think about the.

98
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,780
Help you to understand the importance of social supports and the different types of

99
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,280
social supports that there are and how they might operate for health and in later life.

100
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,680
And then to situate these different topics of loneliness and social isolation within a lot,

101
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,330
of course, perspective and thinking about structures of ageism in society.

102
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,830
So we'll talk about think different types of social supports.

103
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:37,280
We'll think about the life course perspective in terms of how it applies to this convoy model of social support,

104
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,960
which is a really powerful model, has been very successfully applied to understand aging.

105
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:50,060
We'll talk about loneliness and how that's distinct from the absence of social support and how it's distinct from social isolation.

106
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:56,150
And then we will take a break here from come back after the break.

107
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,540
Lisa is going to present a paper on loneliness and mortality.

108
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:07,520
This paper was one of the first really strong empirical evidence that supported showing an association between loneliness and death.

109
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,050
So loneliness kills.

110
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:16,759
It came out and it made a huge impact in the field, and everybody started putting questions about loneliness in all their national surveys.

111
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:21,530
So it was a very profound paper. And then we'll have opportunities for a class discussion.

112
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:33,850
Okay. So social support. So in the gerontology literature, there's been a long, long, long focus on social supports in health.

113
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:41,830
So going back into the 1970s, scientists had long seen that there's been an association between social relationships and health.

114
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,190
So this is like old, old stuff, right? This is many, many years ago.

115
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:56,890
So in a paper that a study was done in 1968 actually found that if you have at least just one person, one close confidante,

116
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:04,780
someone that you can really trust and confide in, you are significantly less likely to be instantly institutionalized in the following years.

117
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:10,930
So very, very powerful evidence that was coming out, but it also had a lot of critiques around it.

118
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,370
One was that this isn't real science. Social support.

119
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,340
What is that? You know, it's not measurable and it's definitely not causal.

120
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:25,000
And so it subsequently there was a lot more attention to try to actually make this more rigorous and empirical.

121
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:33,339
So this this is a paper by Jim House and colleagues that came out in the late eighties,

122
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:39,520
but it began to synthesize the emerging evidence that was coming out from longitudinal studies

123
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:46,780
looking at the effect of social support on death and premature mortality by prospective follow ups.

124
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:55,269
And so you've got multiple different cohort studies that were doing this that were looking at social levels of social integration.

125
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:59,259
So the amount of frequent contact that people were having with different groups,

126
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:04,540
with friends and family and relatives, and how that was related to subsequent mortality.

127
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:13,329
And you can see that there is, you know, in terms of looking at these effects, people that are have high levels of social integration,

128
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:19,720
more social contact, more embedded in their social world, had much lower risks of death.

129
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:25,090
You know where the study was published? Science.

130
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,300
So it began to be recognizes this is actually real.

131
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:35,490
It's scientific. It can be. It's actually you know, it might even be a causal relationship.

132
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,270
It is something that we can measure. And it is not just off science.

133
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:44,280
So this paper was really profound in actually saying, you know, this is real stuff that we need to pay attention to.

134
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,640
I'm going to just ask her here a pause for a second. Do you. In your work, in your area of research, is there attention?

135
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:58,560
How much attention is there to social supports? Is there a recognition of social support as being a factor?

136
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:08,579
Q So yes. Yeah. So like in the in the ICU don't like it, especially in older adults.

137
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,970
Like there's like ICU. Delirium is fairly common. What's that?

138
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:15,210
Okay, so you delirium. So it's like. It's like.

139
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:26,090
Exactly how. I mean, it's like so delirium is like on the spectrum of like psychosis, but like in,

140
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:31,850
like older folks are just like prep like, you know, like the lights in the ICU are like on all the time.

141
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,000
There's like, like the food cycles being disrupted.

142
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:42,920
And then there's, there's just like a high risk, especially for older adults to just begin to be a little disoriented.

143
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:49,760
And it's it's like a well-documented thing, but I don't think it's, like, truly understood, like what's causing it.

144
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:58,940
But one thing that is known as like having family present, like having people they know present as much as possible in the ICU helps prevent delirium.

145
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:06,110
And so, like, that's like that's recommended to families to try to just have someone like the person who was present as much as possible.

146
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,840
That's like warding off this, um, delirium. Very interesting. So there's evidence to show that association there must be again.

147
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,100
Yeah. Yeah, they're interesting. Other people.

148
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,810
Yeah, Aboriginality.

149
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:31,270
We also have studies on social supports, especially in social epidemiology and in this way we have come down some readings on how marital status,

150
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:40,710
in fact VR, house and study find that people marry, people are more healthier than white people.

151
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,470
So that's pretty interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

152
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:50,380
No, there's a there's a lot of dynamics around that. We'll get to some of the complexity of science in a couple of more slides.

153
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,889
I know in the cardiovascular health literature, it's there's a lot of focus on social supports.

154
00:16:56,890 --> 00:17:05,080
There's been a lot of evidence based studies showing the impact of having know strong social supports for positive cardiovascular outcomes following,

155
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,860
you know, surgery. Know, it's it's kind of interesting.

156
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:13,330
Okay. So types, what do we mean by social support?

157
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:19,240
We talked a little bit about the sort of frequency of social interaction when we're looking at the previous slide.

158
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:24,960
It can it captures a lot of different things. There's just the size of your social network.

159
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,680
Like, how many people do you know? How many people are that you can count on?

160
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:34,120
How often do you meet with them? What's the frequency of interaction with them?

161
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,969
But what is the quality of those relationships?

162
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:43,390
Having a lot of people that you can, you know, meet with and get together with may not actually reflect the quality of those ties.

163
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:50,050
So a lot of work has shown that it's not just the number of people that you have in your social network, but it's the quality of those ties.

164
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,610
Remember that one confident study? Just one person could be enough.

165
00:17:54,610 --> 00:18:01,330
If that person is close to you and you feel that you've got someone, you can count on those different kinds of social support.

166
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,930
Right. There's the instrumental support. And we talked about that with the handyman.

167
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:11,650
You know, someone that can come and change your light bulb, fix your sink, fix your leaking toilet.

168
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,400
Someone that can help you with dropping.

169
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:22,690
Some that can help you manage your finances or even just be able to give you a loan if you're short of cash one week.

170
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:31,300
Then there's another aspect which is like less the delivery of help, physical help, but more emotional support,

171
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:37,030
which is a sense that you are you can count on someone to be there if you need them in a time of crisis,

172
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:45,190
a sense that you're feeling cared for and that you're you're loved in a sense that you can actually that someone can listen to you.

173
00:18:46,090 --> 00:18:51,700
There's also negative support, which is that, you know, people are in relationships that are always not always positive.

174
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:57,910
And there can be negative support that comes through for through criticism or people making too many demands on you.

175
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:05,770
So there's a lot of dynamics in that solution when you say it's a support by you and use the word negative also.

176
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:11,700
It's a good question. That's kind of the way it's being written in the literature and negative support.

177
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,450
But I think a more accurate term would be negative social relations.

178
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:26,670
Do you think is that your sense? Yeah, it's a good let's do some kind of social things that you are experiencing if you have someone else.

179
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,230
Exactly. Exactly. Yes, that's a good point.

180
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:39,660
And then the question is, are who are those people and how does that relationship type affect that support delivery?

181
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:50,520
So, you know, a spouse or a partner versus a friend, you know, a spouse can be, as I said, a really critical person in an ICU situation.

182
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:57,760
A spouse can also be, you know, helpful in day to day life, but may not be as accessible,

183
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:02,550
say, as a friend that you meet for coffee and can share some of your really,

184
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:07,260
you know, I don't know things that you don't feel you could share with your spouse, for example.

185
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,250
So there we have different kinds of relationships with different kinds of people.

186
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,810
So how would we even think about measuring these things to understand them in epidemiological studies?

187
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:25,750
So these are the kinds of questions that were asked in many, many surveys, as I mentioned.

188
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,410
And I'm just going to show you the example of how they're asked in the health and retirement study.

189
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,700
Remember, this is the the leave behind psycho social questionnaire that's left behind for

190
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,200
people to self complete and then mail email back to the the survey coordinators.

191
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:46,120
The questions on social support are quite extensive, but they mirror what's in many other studies.

192
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,530
The first question that respondents are asked is and how many?

193
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,220
You know, the question is actually, do you have any friends?

194
00:20:54,760 --> 00:21:01,090
And if you had friends who answered yes, then you were asked about a lot of those sort of perspectives that you have about your friends.

195
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:07,090
And then you're asked how many of those friends would you say you have a close relationship with?

196
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:12,640
And you write this down in this little box and then they ask about family members.

197
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:20,320
Do you have any other family members? And how many of those family members would you say that you have a close relationship with?

198
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,900
So it's not just all I have a very big family. It's actually how many of those family members are you close to?

199
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:33,480
Thousands of children. And then they ask obviously about a spouse and what that whether that's a close relationship.

200
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:39,420
So you have all this information, all these different numbers of people that you report.

201
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,010
And then if you actually look at the distribution of this, this is just a histogram of it.

202
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:48,930
We're talking about people that you add them all up in the health and retirement study.

203
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:56,889
It ranges from zero to over 45 and a huge range.

204
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:02,580
Right. Of people, the number of people that you had in your social network who are close social ties.

205
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:08,160
The median obviously is around like ten or so, but it's a huge number.

206
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,970
But it can also be very small. But does it really matter?

207
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,670
So the obviously the question is how often do you interact with those people?

208
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,380
You can say you have so many friends, but you may not actually see them very often.

209
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,069
So measuring the frequency of getting together with these people, the questionnaire then goes on to ask, well,

210
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:36,310
you know, for, you know, for your children or the category or for your friends category or your relatives category.

211
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:43,330
How often do you do each of the following things with them not counting on people that live with you, but people who you know?

212
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:51,640
How often do you get together with them? You know, meet up in close boat, including both arranged and chance meetings?

213
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:58,930
Is it two or three times a week, or maybe just once or twice a week or even just less than once a year?

214
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,630
How often do you speak on the phone with them? What about writing them or emailing them?

215
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:12,550
In the 2022 survey? They have a new question which is added here, which is how often do you interact with them on Facebook and social media?

216
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:19,519
You know, different kinds of connections, right, with people. Some of them are more intimate with getting together with friends.

217
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:26,620
Some might be, you know, different kinds of correspondents, you know, either digitally or speaking on the phone.

218
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:36,840
And then if you look at the distribution of how these responses play out in people in the health retirement study over the age of 50,

219
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:46,890
you know, most people are engaging with people, with other people around, you know, once or twice a month or once, twice a week.

220
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,110
Meeting up tends to be mostly once or twice a week.

221
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:58,110
But there's also people who, like, only meet up with people once a year or every few months.

222
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:08,100
So it's a huge distribution. Which one of these connections do you think is is most important or potentially most important for health?

223
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:14,340
Is it meeting people or, you know, face to face or talking on the phone?

224
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,250
Or does it actually really matter how you connect with people?

225
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:33,590
I mean, it's hard to so I would think face to face, but I guess maybe quality would trump media if it was a really, really, really good friend.

226
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:39,630
As long as you could talk to them on the phone or be on Facebook with them, they would still have the same.

227
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:49,230
Yeah. What do other people think? Depends on the event that makes you want to connect with your friends.

228
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:58,950
Sometimes for you that might not be feasible. And if you want it to, for example, you need emotional support immediately.

229
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,690
You lose a pack, for example, and you are very, very sad.

230
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:14,560
Would you ask a friend to come out and then hide in front of her or you text now and then or call her and then express your sadness?

231
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,590
You meet up later.

232
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:30,750
So those numbers, I think, indicates in a way about their interactions, but it doesn't really reflect what's what are included in the interactions.

233
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:34,260
Yeah, that's a great point. That's really insightful.

234
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:44,780
So we will talk a little bit about, you know, those kinds of supports.

235
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,940
Like what does that actually mean to engage with someone and what the quality of those relationships are?

236
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:56,180
So for each of the categories, like the friends category, the relatives of the partner and the children,

237
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,890
the respondent in later life is asked to actually assess the quality of that relationship.

238
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:07,640
And this is what's with respect to emotional support and emotional interactions in terms of the positive or negative aspects of it.

239
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:13,430
So for example, the participant is asked, we'd like to ask some questions about your partner or your spouse,

240
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:18,050
and then please mark the answer, which best shows how you feel about each statement.

241
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:24,800
How? The first question is about your spouse. How much do they really understand the way you feel about things?

242
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:32,090
A lot, a little or not at all? How much can you rely on them if you have a serious problem?

243
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,320
How much can you open up to them if you need to talk about your worries?

244
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:43,850
Sometimes people will respond to this more favorably to about their friends than about their spouse, for example.

245
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:49,310
How often do they make too many demands on you? These we get to the negative aspects of these social relationships.

246
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:54,230
How much do they criticize you? How much do they let you down when you are counting on them?

247
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,270
And how much do they get on your nerves?

248
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:06,650
So the negative side of it, and if we look at the distribution of responses, this is the positive aspects of emotional support from spouse.

249
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:13,999
You know, most people are responding that you can rely on them a lot on their spouse, a lot.

250
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,590
They are able to open up to them a lot and they're able to and their spouse understands them a lot or or some there's some,

251
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:26,930
you know, distribution there about those negative aspects of social supports.

252
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:36,030
Well, um, there's certainly responses that, you know, most people say my spouse never lets me down.

253
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:44,290
Not at all. But sometimes, you know, we make a little too many demands on me and a little bit of time,

254
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,890
you know, they criticize me and they feel, let me down, maybe.

255
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:56,940
But what's really interesting is, is they get on your nerves a little or even, you know, getting out to these areas about something.

256
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,510
So those dynamics of relationships show that, you know, it's just because you have a close relationship with someone.

257
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:14,900
It also comes with the negative aspects of support as well. Another aspect of social support that gets studied is religious attendance.

258
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:22,820
This is a history, a long history of research in the United States, in particular, showing the importance of religious attendance for health.

259
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:29,060
This is a question that's asked in what used to be asked in a lot of surveys.

260
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,400
And it's was this is a result that's going to show you from the National Health Interview survey,

261
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,780
which is just simply how often do you go to church, temple or other religious services?

262
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,160
Never less than once a week, every week or more than once per week.

263
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:55,370
And the data show that research shows that the more that you go to religious services, you live longer, you're less likely to die.

264
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,680
This is the life expectancy at age 20, starting at age 50.

265
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,670
And how many more years that you're sorry at age 20?

266
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:11,870
How many more years are going to live based on the attendance of religious services and especially for men and women?

267
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:23,240
And you can see that if you the more that you go to church, for example, the longer your life expectancy is for women.

268
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:31,070
The orange virus, it's most pronounced that once per week for men, it's most pronounced if they go more than once per week.

269
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:42,870
But this is something that's been found in the literature a lot in the United States in that it's just simply going to church is good for your health.

270
00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:47,100
And they've done a lot of research on what on earth is that about?

271
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,410
Like, what is it about going to church that makes you live longer? And they look at it.

272
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:56,970
What is it about the spirituality? You know, is it a belief in something higher?

273
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,750
Is it they've done all this like different questions and surveys to ask us?

274
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,860
It's not that it's nothing to do with any of that. It's just it's just going to church.

275
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:10,360
It's just going there. So what is it about that environment?

276
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:15,120
What is it about that that actually makes you healthy? What do you think it is?

277
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:22,170
But I wonder if part of it is like some of the regions have.

278
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:29,580
Meaning. Certain meanings are following my vegetarian diets.

279
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:37,700
Yep. Yep. That's a point. Good point. And have they like determined whether you live longer.

280
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:45,350
Like depending on the type of religion I am not that I know of, but that's an interesting question.

281
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:55,610
Yeah. And to pick on my grandma, she's not even close.

282
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:04,880
Yes. And like, as you say, a community that you have see regularly every week.

283
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:10,310
No. But you have you know, you can count on them a sense that you can actually find people that you can talk to.

284
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:16,520
Often meals are served so you can actually, you know, get a hot meal, for example, and.

285
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,430
It's kind of it's interesting. The patient's thinking.

286
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:30,770
Yeah. So actually this comment I was thinking whether the religious attendance can and.

287
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:35,520
Like it just is something that represents that.

288
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:40,020
You have regular social interactions with other people.

289
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,590
It's just this is like one circumstances that you can measure.

290
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:53,700
There might be other circumstances that can have this in the relationship, but this just supports how important social interaction between the like.

291
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,670
Yeah, I know what you're saying. I think that's a good point.

292
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:00,390
I wonder if they've done studies I think they may have, which is actually separate out, you know,

293
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:05,100
the effects of like difference of kind of social interactions like the church attendance versus,

294
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,820
you know, going to meet up with people and do different organizations.

295
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:14,310
But it's a it's a good question. Is it just simply, you know, as part of a reflection of someone's social network?

296
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:22,170
Some literature has suggests it's it's it's to do with have being in an environment where there is an element of.

297
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,820
But when they say they call it control, like social control, in a sense that,

298
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,060
you know, expectations for certain kinds of behaviors or not smoking or example or,

299
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:44,250
you know, having a healthy diet, having certain kinds of expectations for, you know, positive health behaviors, for example.

300
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,200
And that is sort of why some of the pathways that people have talked about.

301
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,730
So, you know, social support, religious attendance, what are the mechanisms by which these things can be beneficial for health?

302
00:32:57,090 --> 00:33:04,770
A lot of people think it's related to health behavior so that you if you interact with you know, if you're going to, you know,

303
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:09,540
interacting with your friends and your family, they can help you and provide support for you if you're on,

304
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:11,850
you know, trying to engage in physical activity.

305
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:18,570
They can be out with you for a walk to give you support while you you know, you're actually engaging in physical activity together.

306
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:26,460
There can be, you know, support for healthy diet and encouragement for engaging in preventive health care, for example.

307
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,300
So some of these mechanisms have been hypothesized to be the reason why social support is related to health.

308
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,350
It could also be that if you're engaged in a network and a strong network that has actually bad health behaviors,

309
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:43,379
it could in fact have a negative relationship.

310
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:50,850
That the more people that you have, for example, who smoke in your friend network, you might be able to smoke and you might be smoking.

311
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,880
So that can have negative effects. So, you know, not exactly a completely clear story here.

312
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:04,260
The other there's a lot of literature, though, that shows that there is physiological pathways that, in fact,

313
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:13,890
having a sense of support is actually associated with different biomarkers of better health in terms of lower blood pressure.

314
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:20,150
A lot of other kind of. Measures of atmospheric load as well.

315
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:27,240
So it seems to me it's a very powerful thing and it's not really clear essentially why it works or how it works all the time.

316
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,819
One of the ways that makes the most sense to me about how social support works is that it's this kind of roll over effect modification,

317
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:38,860
the stress buffering, role of social support.

318
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:46,390
What this means is that the social support, the benefits of social support are really, really most profound.

319
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:49,090
When you have something bad happening to you.

320
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:56,410
So like Lisa was saying, if you've had some event in your life which is problematic, disconcerting, distressing,

321
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:05,830
if you have a social contact or social support that you can rely on in that time of stress, that mitigates the impact of the stress on your health.

322
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,680
So this is there is a lot of literature showing that this actually is one of the ways that social support benefits help.

323
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:18,100
In fact, there's been some work by Tony Antonucci showing that people with low education,

324
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:25,720
if that as long as they had high quality social relationships, their health is the same as other people with high levels of education.

325
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:31,810
There's again, I mentioned that social support is associated with better outcomes from cardiovascular disease.

326
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:37,990
So there's a lot of literature and research that's being done in cardiovascular health related to understanding of social support.

327
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,769
It's going to show you some examples here just empirically so we can get a

328
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:48,190
handle and see how social supports related to more of these clinical outcomes,

329
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:55,390
I would say. So this is a study that was done through the University of Michigan's congestive heart failure clinics.

330
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:04,600
This is published in 2000. What they did is they recruited patients from this congestive heart failure clinic in their early nineties,

331
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:16,210
and they wanted to see sort of how what is the impact of social supports in terms of marital quality on preventing poor health outcomes,

332
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:23,860
in terms of death, preventing death for people who are in that stressful situation of having a congestive heart failure.

333
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:28,720
So they're quite ill and they've got a risk score for mortality.

334
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,110
But how good is marital quality before that?

335
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:34,300
So this is the gain, the stress bearing role.

336
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:44,409
What they did was they recruited them to this study and then they assess their quality of their marriages,

337
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:51,190
of these risk participants by videotaping a conversation between them, the patient and their spouse.

338
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:56,110
So they actually had them actually engage in some kind of a dialog that could lead to an argument.

339
00:36:56,530 --> 00:37:01,240
And they videotaped this to kind of assess the quality of the relationship in terms of how they were going to be,

340
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:05,469
how they interacted with one another. They had some other questions as well.

341
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:11,830
But it was, I think, is there a way to actually objectively measure the quality of the relationship?

342
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:18,250
So it's kind of interesting. But regardless, they found that after four years of follow up,

343
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:26,350
people that were in better quality relationships in terms of marriage had a much more were much more

344
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:30,670
likely to be alive at the end of four years than those people who were in poor quality relationships.

345
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:38,560
So again, kind of thinking about that stress buffering role, like how social support can be most influential when you're dealing with,

346
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,770
you know, a very serious chronic condition like congestive heart failure.

347
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:51,420
This is another study that was done from the National Social Life, Health and Aging project, looking again at systolic blood pressure.

348
00:37:51,450 --> 00:38:00,139
So measured blood pressure, they had people this is a sample of over 3000 older people and they measured

349
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:05,820
that systolic blood pressure and they looked at people who had they categorize

350
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,160
them either in a relationship that was low in terms of ability for them to

351
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,250
confide in their spouse versus high in that I can confide in my spouse a lot.

352
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:26,880
So for people who had a low relationship quality so high, let's call these people first.

353
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:34,919
People who are in a relationship where they really felt that they could confide in their spouse when they have a stress situation,

354
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,129
that they are their blood pressure is much lower.

355
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:44,880
It's much more attenuated when they're in that environment than people who are in a relationship where they can't confide on someone.

356
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:50,550
So what this means is that in the absence of stress,

357
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:56,430
there's really not much difference between blood pressure and those with different relationship quality.

358
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:03,119
But when your stress hits that, those people who are in that high confiding relationship have lower blood pressure.

359
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,480
So it's kind of you know, that's when it shows itself to be useful.

360
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:13,729
This is another from the same study looking.

361
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:20,330
It's not just whether you can confide in your spouse, but the relationship quality with respect to whether they make too many demands on you.

362
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,820
Remember that question that we had in the previous slide, which is,

363
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:29,450
do they make too many demands on you for people who where they do not make many demands on you?

364
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:35,270
The effect of the stress didn't seem to be any different.

365
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:40,910
But for people who are in relationships where your spouse is making too many demands on you,

366
00:39:41,390 --> 00:39:50,060
when a stress hits one of us and blood pressure goes down, so it's great that people make demands on you.

367
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,540
You're in a stressful situation. Why would that be?

368
00:39:54,260 --> 00:40:04,040
I'll show you one more thing. This is kind of a cool paper that has a catchy title life sustaining irritations,

369
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,330
relationship quality and mortality in the context of chronic illness.

370
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:13,670
This is a prospective study using data from the Americans Changing Life study.

371
00:40:15,530 --> 00:40:22,220
So what this basically did they talk about these are people over the age of 40, 2500 of them,

372
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:27,380
and they get an assessment of their self-reported marital quality with respect to whether they

373
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:32,330
making too many demands on you or they criticize you and also positive aspects of support,

374
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:38,810
like whether you feel that they care for you and they love you and then they follow them for 16 years.

375
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:47,720
And they looked at the association between that exposure and, you know, marital quality and death, adjusting for a whole bunch of other things.

376
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:53,120
What they found was, you know, as you're following them along, some people developed chronic illness.

377
00:40:54,200 --> 00:41:01,850
So these are chronic conditions, quite serious chronic health problems in those for people who didn't have any chronic conditions,

378
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,570
relationship quality didn't have any effect on their mortality.

379
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:12,140
But people who experienced chronic health problems over this follow up period for 16 years.

380
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:20,929
If you're in a relationship where you said that my spouse makes too many demands on me in the presence of that chronic health condition,

381
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,640
like after you get that chronic health condition,

382
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:27,380
you're actually going to live longer than people who say, my spouse does not make too many demands on.

383
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,720
If you were in a relationship where you say,

384
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,690
my spouse criticizes me an awful lot and you've got a chronic health condition, you're going to live longer.

385
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:43,790
If you're in a relationship, we say, my spouse cares for me and loves me, then I get up with you.

386
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,600
End up with a chronic health condition. What's going to happen when I die sooner?

387
00:41:52,070 --> 00:42:01,500
So why do you think this is going on? So they tend to look at my.

388
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:08,070
I mean, I didn't make them exercise and then they did me.

389
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:17,140
But that says I happen to like the healthier that the the health behaviors like someone demanding that you engage in health behaviors.

390
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:20,739
Yeah. Exactly.

391
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:24,130
Yeah. Yeah.

392
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:31,780
Constantly checking on other person to make sure that. Doing the things that they need to do.

393
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:36,720
Did you take your medication and, you know, don't take medication. Don't do this.

394
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:41,750
Do that. Things like that. Yeah. Yeah.

395
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:45,309
Apparently, kids, if you have a child, it makes too many demands on you.

396
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:51,580
That's very powerful and protective. So if your kids are telling you, you know, that you can take your medication, go to the doctor.

397
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:59,190
I'm going to say something to you anyway just to get a picture here.

398
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:06,240
It's just it's a very complicated story. If we then take all of these different concepts and we put them into a life course perspective,

399
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:10,650
there's this core model, which is called the convoy model of social relationships.

400
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:18,180
It was developed by Tony Antonucci. She is a fantastic scholar in gerontology and psychology.

401
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:23,070
Contribute a lot to understanding social relations for aging over the life course.

402
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,510
The convoy model is, you know what a convoy is like. You know, a convoy of ships.

403
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:35,069
It's in Second World War. They had a lot of convoys that got actually supplies across the Atlantic, convoys of trucks.

404
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:41,790
So it's like it's the idea that you don't actually experience your social relations in, you know,

405
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:48,290
at one single point in time, but that you actually have a group of people that you have been living with,

406
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:56,520
knowing, aging, with, being potentially together since childhood that you you age with and that you that collective

407
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:03,450
experience is more than just simply the social supports that you might have at any one time.

408
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:09,150
So being cognizant of thinking about who we might have known, who we have known since childhood.

409
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:16,800
I have a really good friend from high school and I'm still in touch with her and I have great friends now,

410
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:23,940
but having contact with my friend from high school connects me also to a part of me that,

411
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:27,630
you know, when I was younger and what who I other people that I knew.

412
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:31,350
It's, you know, it's sort of an awareness of how we are.

413
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:39,090
My friend and I are both aging, watching our kids grow up. There's a there's something to that that's more than just people that I know now.

414
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,200
There's something more that I get from that relationship, for example.

415
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,690
There's also what this work shows is that aging brings a shift in social relations.

416
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,390
So what the research has shown that with less time to live,

417
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,290
older people actually tend to concentrate their energies more on people who are most important to them,

418
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:06,030
and that it's the younger people who wish that they had more friends rather than the older people.

419
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:11,099
So even though older people might be have fewer and lower network size,

420
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:17,010
it may actually be their choice to, you know, focus their energies on people in a smaller network size.

421
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:23,809
Okay. Quickly talking about loneliness. We're going to get into this more after the break.

422
00:45:23,810 --> 00:45:29,330
Even richer presents on this topic, but this is really getting a lot of attention,

423
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:37,400
particularly recently since COVID on loneliness and the perception of social isolation or the subjective feeling of being lonely.

424
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:45,649
So how do how is loneliness measured? This is one of the most common ways people measure loneliness in surveys.

425
00:45:45,650 --> 00:45:49,129
A three item survey. It has a much longer version.

426
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:52,280
That's in a number of surveys. But some surveys only have this three item version,

427
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,770
which is simply they ask and ask questions that are about how you feel about different aspects of your life.

428
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:02,479
How often do you feel you lack companionship? Often.

429
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,260
Some of the time, hardly ever. How often do you feel left out?

430
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:13,150
How often do you feel isolated from others? So how does this look in older adults?

431
00:46:14,410 --> 00:46:21,549
Most people say, I never experience those things, but there are, you know, about 30% of people who say, yeah,

432
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:28,900
you know, I sometimes feel I lack companionship, I sometimes feel left out and I sometimes feel isolated.

433
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:34,690
And then, you know, lacking companionship is the most frequent one that's been reported for those thing often.

434
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:47,890
So what is the difference between, you know, having a lot of friends, social networks being embedded in and being lonely?

435
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:53,110
Can is it possible that you could have a big network size a lot of people that you know,

436
00:46:53,110 --> 00:47:00,069
that you interact with, but you could still be lonely or could also be that you actually don't know anybody.

437
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:06,940
You don't have any friends, but you're not lonely. Maybe you're happy like that.

438
00:47:07,210 --> 00:47:18,730
Maybe you want to be alone. Josh and I know this is your area of research, so I want to just I wonder if you have any ideas or thoughts,

439
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:23,290
if you can share your your wisdom about this because you think a lot about this.

440
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:33,910
Um, yeah, I would say yes. Many Saudis investigate the bombing of some house and they also control for social.

441
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,330
And they find that independent, outside social isolation.

442
00:47:40,810 --> 00:47:44,350
50,000 people and nursing homes. Interesting.

443
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,370
And why do you think that is? What is that going on with that?

444
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:59,450
I think it's maybe something about personality that some people are using that used to be or there used to be a law and they.

445
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:10,280
Yes. Yes. Joshing is loneliness is something like self-reporting.

446
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:15,460
So do you have any standardized way to measure it?

447
00:48:15,470 --> 00:48:20,270
Like different people have different perceptions of loneliness.

448
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:25,640
Do I have a standardized way to, like, standardized the loneliness?

449
00:48:27,560 --> 00:48:30,360
I don't think I don't think so. Is is the measure.

450
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:42,290
And in one of my dissertation, I am proposing qualitative bias analysis to detect whether men compared to women are less likely to report loneliness.

451
00:48:43,550 --> 00:48:51,050
So the assumption is that men are less likely to report on negative emotions such as fever and.

452
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,360
Wow. That sounds amazing. That'd be great. It'd be a great finding to be able to get into that.

453
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:01,300
Yeah, there's a lot of dynamics in it.

454
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:12,350
So getting into social isolation, which is distinct from loneliness or social support, but just being isolated potentially.

455
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,659
I want to think about this in the context of structural ageism in that, you know,

456
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:21,260
this what we've kind of come back to over and over again is thinking about older

457
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:27,110
adults being pushed to the margins of society in western the United States culture.

458
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,879
This is a quote from a gerontologist back in the sixties,

459
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:40,010
really recognizing that unlike other periods in the life course in which old rules are replaced by new ones, the role of old person is unstructured.

460
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,570
It's basically an empty role.

461
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:49,579
So this sense of being kind of pushed to the margins as you get older, not being connected with society in general is one of the,

462
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,960
I think, the biggest risk factors for social isolation and poor health as a result.

463
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:58,820
So this is something that came out from the Pew Research Center,

464
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:06,799
which is looking basically worldwide in that probably four in ten older adults around the world,

465
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,980
they live with extended family, either, you know, whether it's extended family, a couple relationship.

466
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:19,610
But in the United States, most they are the ones that are most likely to be living by themselves.

467
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:27,710
So living alone is a key risk for social isolation, obviously, and being disconnected with with others.

468
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:34,399
This is data that came out as well showing that most older Americans actually

469
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:40,910
spend quite a bit of time on their own for for older adults over the age of 60,

470
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:45,290
they spend 7 hours of their day alone.

471
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:49,700
For people who live alone, that's 10 hours of their day.

472
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:57,710
They're alone. So being alone is actually, you know, because we're going to talk about a little bit more one of the big risk factors for poor health.

473
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:06,139
You might not be lonely and you might even have, like, you know, contacts that you can Facebook with and text with.

474
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:13,730
But you are alone. I'm going to show you two bits of evidence that talk about the risk of being alone.

475
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:18,680
And we're going to think a little bit about what it is about our what we could do in terms of from a life course

476
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:25,040
perspective or from social determinants of health perspective to mitigate some of the risks for people who are aging alone.

477
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:30,560
This is data that came out in from the New England Journal of Medicine way back in the nineties.

478
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:34,610
But basically it was over a period of 12 weeks.

479
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:43,909
Paramedics in the city of San Francisco found that they were 387 events in which people,

480
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:49,400
older people were found or people were found in their homes, either helpless or dead.

481
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:53,870
The vast majority of the people that were found like this are in are older.

482
00:51:53,870 --> 00:52:01,669
So this is something that affects older adults. And then some of the examples that they give in the case report of this about what

483
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:07,729
was the situation leading up to them was an inability to get up or weakness.

484
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:17,570
So for example, one person could not get up from the toilet and try to move to the ground,

485
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:22,160
but then became wedged between the toilet and the bathtub for nine and a half hours.

486
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:29,180
So if we were thinking about one of the things we've learned in this course, right, about what we could do to prevent this from happening.

487
00:52:29,510 --> 00:52:32,720
Simple baths from home modifications. Right.

488
00:52:33,230 --> 00:52:38,270
Not letting this person be in the situation. Obviously, social supports would have helped.

489
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:43,550
This person wasn't living alone. They could call and say, you know, help, I'm stuck in the bathroom and can't get out.

490
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,900
Having those lifelines, the little buttons that you can press around your neck,

491
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:52,460
you know, is also another huge benefit for older adults who are living alone.

492
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:53,900
My mom had this.

493
00:52:55,220 --> 00:53:04,670
She used to it was a huge lifesaver for her because she she got stuck in the bathroom one night and we didn't know about it for at least another day.

494
00:53:05,090 --> 00:53:12,080
And so and being able to press that button is actually for us, for family members, knowing that they have that resource is a huge thing.

495
00:53:12,770 --> 00:53:18,559
As she became demented, she started pressing it to call the support center, ask them to turn on the television for her.

496
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:21,860
So it was it became a bit misused.

497
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:29,870
But it's, you know, anything that you can do to connect with someone, to stop them from being socially isolated is a big point.

498
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:38,530
This is an example of someone who a patient wasn't seen in ten days and they found the body in the bathroom.

499
00:53:39,430 --> 00:53:48,580
So no contact with people. And being unable to reach people or being alone is a huge risk factor for for obviously falling,

500
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,330
for being unresponsive, for being weak and then for mortality.

501
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:59,050
But one of the one of the key stories I wanted to raise with you is this event that happened in Chicago.

502
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:08,350
It was the 1995 Chicago heat wave. I know some of you mentioned that you watched the video in your in your slide deck that you talked about this.

503
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:14,170
And it was a really powerful thing. And there was some you know,

504
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:20,590
Eric Klinenberg did some work after this and did a lot more research into understanding what happened and who was at risk and why.

505
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:27,700
And he wrote a book on it called As It Was about the social Chicago heat wave, the social autopsy of Disaster.

506
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:37,930
And it was about the fact that, you know, there was this enormous big spike in heat and, you know, people were really vulnerable.

507
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:45,790
And the people that were vulnerable were older people. And it was older people who were living alone and who were socially isolated.

508
00:54:46,210 --> 00:54:52,360
So they were found dead in their homes in extremely hot rooms.

509
00:54:53,290 --> 00:55:02,410
One of the biggest risk factors was the lack of air conditioning, but the main factor they found was that the people just nobody was checking on them.

510
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:07,350
No one knew that this heat wave was actually going to be as bad as it was.

511
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:14,050
But then when it hit, there weren't enough people that were connected to the vulnerable older adults to go in and just say, Are you doing okay?

512
00:55:18,190 --> 00:55:26,319
I think, you know, there's been a lot of work coming out of this, this study that actually has drawn attention to the importance of being a meeting,

513
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:32,140
that older adults are not isolated, that they have some kind of connection. We talked about long term services and supports last week.

514
00:55:32,590 --> 00:55:35,469
Having someone just come in, you know, even if they're, you know,

515
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:39,970
delivering Meals on Wheels to be able to connect with that that person and make sure they're okay.

516
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:45,930
But also, you know, just the importance of air conditioning and making that available.

517
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:51,690
But the cost of that, especially in buildings, which if you don't have air conditioning, you know, is is a real risk factor.

518
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:56,800
Many low income older adults are living in buildings without air conditioning.

519
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:05,170
And it's also very costly to run air conditioning. And many older adults will choose not to run the air conditioner, even if if they have it.

520
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,740
So there's a lot of dynamics around this, but kind of highlighting, I think,

521
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:18,489
the the structural aspects of of society in terms of how we build our environments, the isolation of older adults, the lack of, you know,

522
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:24,010
services and supports, and even being able to obtain those services and supports, as we learned last week,

523
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:32,830
put older adults at risk in situations where there is an extreme event like a heat wave or like COVID 19.

524
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:36,909
So Victoria is not here today, but her. Her slide deck.

525
00:56:36,910 --> 00:56:43,690
The slide that she contributed pointed to exactly about how the overlap in the county the census tracks in Chicago,

526
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:51,460
where there was the greatest deaths and the number of heat related deaths in the heat wave are very similar to the the tracks,

527
00:56:51,670 --> 00:57:01,810
which had the highest number of deaths in COVID 19. So vulnerability, you know, is is translated and transferred to different situations.

528
00:57:02,890 --> 00:57:05,320
And I think this is something they really need to really think about.

529
00:57:06,970 --> 00:57:11,500
Did anybody else have a chance to look at the video and have any thoughts about it?

530
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,570
Yeah, I did. And I mentioned how I started.

531
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:31,260
One thing was interesting was that they looked at two different neighborhoods like outside.

532
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:36,040
And, you know, traditionally they would have expected the new.

533
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:40,970
Similar risk. Morbidity and mortality.

534
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:47,680
Just as far as like. There are minority neighborhoods.

535
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:52,719
They were saying that one neighborhood had far less, far fewer deaths.

536
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,470
And the other neighborhoods are in. And I think it was because of.

537
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:02,870
Just like the neighborhood had more economic activity was busier.

538
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:06,140
There are people living on top of each other. It was denser.

539
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:16,670
And so they think that that, you know, probably I'm assuming they thought that had to do with like the amount of social support that.

540
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:23,969
Right? Right. And they also said that they had similar values, too,

541
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:31,410
and they both valued connection and the same sustaining relationships like family and friends and or age.

542
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:37,830
So it didn't necessarily have to do with. Whether or not these people have close ties to their family and friends.

543
00:58:37,830 --> 00:58:43,920
But it was just the mere. Back to being surrounded by a lot of other people that seemed to correlate.

544
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:50,220
Number of deaths. Right. Right. So sort of neighborhood social cohesion, a sense of looking out for one another.

545
00:58:50,790 --> 00:59:03,840
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I, I think like my positive and I asked that question like, is density does is density like a confounder almost to socioeconomic.

546
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:05,850
It depends.

547
00:59:05,850 --> 00:59:16,740
I think low assist neighborhoods often have very high social cohesion, partly because of the necessity, you know, looking out for one another.

548
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:23,820
So it's not necessarily. Is that what you're thinking? Yeah. Yeah. They also found, which was something else I want to mention,

549
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:31,200
is that they found that the African-American communities were not as at risk as the white adults.

550
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:35,750
So the African-American older adults actually were less likely to die than the

551
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:42,089
white older adults because the African-American community was more supportive,

552
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:45,030
that there was just more dynamics around that, that there was more looking,

553
00:59:45,030 --> 00:59:50,309
a sense of looking out for one another, whereas, you know, the whites were more socially isolated.

554
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:56,190
So, you know, getting out to sort of sense of community environments that can support that.

555
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:59,939
Yeah, it's it's much it's much bigger than just one's own network.

556
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:05,810
Right? It's the whole community that many people are living in. I don't know.

557
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:09,140
It's like it's really scary to think about aging in the U.S.

558
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:14,780
It's like it's just it's like this is just so terrifying.

559
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:19,550
And I especially, like, if you're, like, unmarried, you don't have children.

560
01:00:20,360 --> 01:00:27,750
The U.S. just feels like a really scary place to age and. Yeah.

561
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:35,760
It's certainly I mean, it's I think it's so important to think about the risks and identify people at risk in the communities at risk.

562
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:40,950
And then do you know targeted intervention to think about what can we do in terms of modifying homes

563
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:46,500
or running air conditioning to make sure people know about services and supports that are available?

564
01:00:46,770 --> 01:00:51,930
You know, the education that you know that you can access these things, this sort of help navigating the system.

565
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:58,990
So that people are just more connected because it really has this, you know, that we really do shun older people.

566
01:00:59,230 --> 01:01:03,130
But then again, I think to myself, you know, with the baby boomers going through, are they going to change this?

567
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:09,530
Are they going to demand change or are they going to say, no, I'm going to be connected with people or young people around me or, you know what?

568
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:13,750
How is it potentially some cohort effects that are what we're observing here to.

569
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:20,280
So you potentially changed by the baby boomers, especially?

570
01:01:20,970 --> 01:01:29,520
Because I saw how. Infected people just living in nursing homes, you know, and social isolation and so many deaths.

571
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:35,170
Yeah. So I know for my parents, I'm like, I want to go to a nursing home.

572
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:40,170
Why you please don't put us in nursing pad or things like that.

573
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:45,930
So yeah, I think that's a possibility that. Changing the system.

574
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:54,640
Yeah. Building communities where, you know, the more more integrated communities across different ages.

575
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:01,999
Tiny home communities. But it's important to learn.

576
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,420
I think I think about the structure of something. All right.

577
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:14,450
Let's take a break and then we will learn from Alisha about loneliness and mortality.

578
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,740
It's really a morbid topic. We're talking a lot about death here.

579
01:02:20,600 --> 01:02:23,840
Pick up the pace and do something exciting or new.

580
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:59,020
If feel like I'm just a matter of messed up like the bystander effect of like.

581
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:02,750
You know, you've heard like her.

582
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:10,370
They're like stories of like in cities where like some of the screaming and like, nobody calls because they just assume, like, someone else has.

583
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:18,080
Like, I think that has been factored into like. Density.

584
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:28,550
Even if you're in a small community. Go ahead. Okay. Then you think that no one else like you.

585
01:03:28,580 --> 01:03:33,400
Are you in through here at your responsibility? Yeah. Yeah. It's just the things that you've got.

586
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:38,000
Right? Yeah. If someone else is taking care of.

587
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:44,700
Yeah. I constantly see.

588
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,120
I think small towns and rural areas are much more connected.

589
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:52,429
People do look out for one another more as opposed to big cities where you kind of see what someone else is looking

590
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:57,770
out for them or that they're services that will look at them or you don't really care what happens to them.

591
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:03,350
Yes, I know. Is that allowing me to say in without sunny outlook.

592
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:16,740
Yeah. Know, it's. You know, it always makes me think I've got to always check on all the people.

593
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:23,200
Mm hmm. Yeah. Yeah.

594
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:30,580
A friend of mine had a father died.

595
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:35,830
He is in Toronto. He had gone out of his house to take the garbage down.

596
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:41,980
And, you know, it was later in the evening. And as he was coming back, he he slipped and fell on the ice.

597
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:48,280
And he nobody knew about it. So it just.

598
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:52,129
It just completely. Yeah, it's a no. No one checks on you.

599
01:04:52,130 --> 01:04:55,550
Like, I think just being alone. It's such a risk factor.

600
01:04:55,730 --> 01:05:00,520
Yeah. Yeah.

601
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:12,549
And, like, so preventable. And I think I mean, technology like certainly, you know, like my parents were like Apple watches.

602
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:16,900
And so like I would like ask them if they like fell down or whatever, if they're like,

603
01:05:16,900 --> 01:05:27,550
if it senses like a oh like a some kind of like change in glass, you know, they were it an album watch Apple like my whole life and I was like,

604
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:34,959
yeah and like yeah I guess like that's also said to me to that like the path,

605
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:39,300
like the solution is just through like more technology and like less social contact.

606
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:46,450
Yeah. Plus, like, reconstructing our society would just be more of a light on the screen.

607
01:05:47,410 --> 01:05:53,980
So much like there's such a brainwashing of Americans to, like, value autonomy and, like, independence and just.

608
01:05:55,810 --> 01:06:01,030
And that's a good thing. Yeah. And like this obsession with, like, monogamy.

609
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:06,910
I mean, there are just so many forces at play that are setting people up for failure.

610
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:16,090
You know, there's kind of an intermediate solution that at least, you know,

611
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:22,809
there is some monitoring that can be implemented to remotely be aware of someone who's fallen.

612
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:30,610
So we'll learn about this in the home when you visit there about remote robots and things that can sound an alarm if someone hasn't,

613
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:33,700
you know, come back into the house, everything can dirty channel, for example.

614
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:37,389
Hmm. But yeah, I mean, it's.

615
01:06:37,390 --> 01:06:43,810
It's a game of supports that my situation has evolved to just give you a robot.

616
01:06:46,900 --> 01:06:51,190
All right. But animals were not pets, you know, that could be a thing.

617
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:57,120
Yeah. Yeah, they have, like, there's kind of robotic parts.

618
01:06:57,150 --> 01:07:09,580
Yeah, I saw that. You just, like, that was cool. Yeah, but if you have, like, if you have a dog or a pet and yeah, they would know if you them.

619
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:13,260
But what do they do. You don't like train them to. Yeah.

620
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:24,340
A lot. Yeah. Yeah. I'm trying to make it bigger.

621
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:32,740
Oh, because the font was a little bit too small, so I tried to make it bigger so people can see.

622
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:37,020
Yeah, I know. I was struggling with this for a little bit.

623
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:54,570
They should give officers today? Yes, I would come in maybe as a withholding class.

624
01:07:55,050 --> 01:08:02,910
No, I just signed for another class. Yes, that is the sass class, the coding.

625
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:06,690
Oh, cool. Yeah, but it's very hard.

626
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:11,250
You will have the harder one next semester. This one is. Are you serious?

627
01:08:11,310 --> 01:08:15,480
I think so. 602 Are you thinking six or two?

628
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:20,580
I don't know. I think we did it last year. Yeah. Is also using SAS.

629
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:28,799
Yes. I was checking that in my inbox that I set up in a 640 class and I saw I have six

630
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:37,050
all two homework folder and it contains many regression models using SAS analysis.

631
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:41,250
So right now is like SAS one, two, one. And that will be a tool too.

632
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:49,560
Okay. So and that's why we want everybody to at least know how to use it, but it's so hard.

633
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,310
And that usually one is hard to use.

634
01:08:54,840 --> 01:09:02,540
Like, just like, oh, I don't really have to go out harder than ah, I don't know, I don't know why this is nice, but you know,

635
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:11,030
knowing as we do things like half an hour that's like all we do, every play a little bit more is that's really.

636
01:09:11,070 --> 01:09:14,130
Yeah. I feel like everyone uses data now or our data.

637
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:20,610
Yeah I use R but for SAS, I mean Scott you SAS.

638
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:27,930
So when you are doing many repeated procedures but using different data SAS for example,

639
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:34,890
you are data management person, you are going to create a different data SAS according to different people's needs.

640
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:42,030
Then he would just change one or two things and then without changing so many things in a code.

641
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:51,959
So I don't know. And we talk about this like there are some pharmaceutical companies that are not allow you to use ARD.

642
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:55,020
They are changing that time. We are shifting now. Yeah.

643
01:09:55,410 --> 01:10:03,240
Well yeah, a little bit but when, when they come out, when they go get out of school like in two years, things will not change by then.

644
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:09,360
So that's why if you want to work in industries or health departments and health departments,

645
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:18,149
they need you to use SAS like well you told us that sort of doctor recommended but like Kazaa is open source.

646
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:21,600
So there's a security people write packages.

647
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:26,900
So the packages are not developed by all companies. There are many different users, right.

648
01:10:26,910 --> 01:10:33,959
Packages. So you don't know if there's any backdoor not like backdoors in their coding that they are trying to

649
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:41,490
store still or data is like a concern but people don't know but is a concern that they might do this.

650
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:50,250
Yeah. So then like some companies are like enforcing you said yes because is you need to buy license and everything is encrypted in that way.

651
01:10:50,460 --> 01:11:02,250
Yeah. So there's a different debate about it and I tried to comfort my students and say this is good, know, I think brands are going to come to us.

652
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:06,719
So yeah, okay. So I think I would have many people coming today.

653
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:10,900
I got so many emails about the homework, should they have a homework deal?

654
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:15,000
Okay, maybe you can say. Yeah, sure.

655
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,750
Yeah, you can make it super. I.

656
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:23,410
I am going to actually write it perfectly. I just. I'm making the font bigger.

657
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:29,400
All right. This is your board. Thank you.

658
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:33,059
All right. I am so pleased to introduce Alicia,

659
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:41,150
who will be speaking about SATs today and how he will be talking about loneliness and mortality and specifically that people are talking about.

660
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:45,360
That is one of the first thing, that loneliness and death.

661
01:11:45,450 --> 01:11:49,050
This is a very interesting thing. So.

662
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:53,440
Hi, everyone. I'm going to sit down today.

663
01:11:53,460 --> 01:12:00,450
We are going to have a little paper discussion on this interesting paper that examined loneliness,

664
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:05,760
health and mortality in old age, which they're using their health and retirement study.

665
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:10,680
And this paper was published ten years ago in 2012.

666
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:16,260
Okay. So a little bit of background introduction.

667
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:27,030
So loneliness is actually on average or a little bit high prevalence regarding the numbers amount, older adults.

668
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:36,719
So about 20 to 40% of older adults reported that they feel lonely and they are 5 to 7% reported.

669
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,629
They are feeling intense or persistent loneliness,

670
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:48,210
which means it's not a short term and instead is actually they always feel lonely and it's not going away easily.

671
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:55,349
According to Pink Heart and Sarrazin in 2003,

672
01:12:55,350 --> 01:13:03,900
they have a definition of loneliness which can help us to have a little bit of standardized understanding about loneliness.

673
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:08,850
So it's the perceived isolation from other people from outside world,

674
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:18,990
and also it's a distressed feeling that accompanies the discrepancies between ones desires and actual social relationships.

675
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:28,650
And the second point is really interesting here, because when we are talking about your the reality doesn't match what you want.

676
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:35,340
It actually happens a lot, not only in older adults, but also actually everyone.

677
01:13:35,610 --> 01:13:40,980
So but not everyone report loneliness because of that.

678
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:47,010
So this brings up the question that we can think about is,

679
01:13:48,210 --> 01:14:01,050
is there any in internal ways that people are dealing with this discrepancies that prevent them from feeling lonely

680
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:12,120
or they are finding another positive way to deal with this so they can make that reality closer to their desire,

681
01:14:12,150 --> 01:14:19,770
if that makes sense. So this this paper actually proposed a relationship here.

682
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:26,490
So loneliness can actually be associated with many different health.

683
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:32,220
And in this paper, we have three types, including emotional, physical and functional.

684
01:14:33,300 --> 01:14:45,780
They also propose to see whether loneliness has an association with mortality, which is also the main relationships they want to study today.

685
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:51,610
So this is a little bit of background. And then we're talking about the study itself.

686
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:59,280
Now, the purpose of the study, so this is a bag that was that I actually modified from this version.

687
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:05,370
So what they are going to study is they want to first of all, study is loneliness.

688
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:09,120
The exposure is associated with the mortality.

689
01:15:09,630 --> 01:15:17,640
So loneliness in the year 2002 related was the mortality that is from 2002 to 2008.

690
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:23,040
So that's the first model they are going to study.

691
01:15:23,790 --> 01:15:27,450
And also, they are going to study whether emotional,

692
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:38,190
physical and functional health is going to play a mediation mediation effect on this association between loneliness

693
01:15:38,190 --> 01:15:46,260
and mortality to see how much of the association is actually modified by these three health components here.

694
01:15:46,740 --> 01:15:50,700
So that's their second purpose of the study.

695
01:15:51,960 --> 01:16:01,590
And they also actually study what they call as a reciprocal and dynamic relationship,

696
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:09,240
which means whether loneliness and emotional, actually this another arrow coming from the house, three health to loneliness.

697
01:16:09,420 --> 01:16:14,580
So whether that relationship also exist because this is a longitudinal study.

698
01:16:14,790 --> 01:16:21,480
So it's very important that they study whether these two actually interact with each other, not only of one direction.

699
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:27,540
Okay. So methods they are using.

700
01:16:27,830 --> 01:16:33,020
So they include the populations. That is from year 2002.

701
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:38,600
And the total sample size is about 2100 is for the health and retirement study.

702
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:50,330
So starting from this number, they have the same person have the data in both three waves 2000 and 2004 and six.

703
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:53,600
But they also use the 2008 mortality data.

704
01:16:54,980 --> 01:17:00,530
The exposure in this study is loneliness in 2002.

705
01:17:01,130 --> 01:17:06,260
And instead of asking, Do you feel lonely? They use three questions,

706
01:17:06,260 --> 01:17:15,590
which Philip has show in the slides earlier that has three questions asking you How often do you feel that you are lack of companionship?

707
01:17:15,950 --> 01:17:20,690
You feel you are left out and you feel like you are isolated from others.

708
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:26,570
And then you answer how often ranges from hardly ever or never?

709
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:34,400
Sometimes and often. So that will be assigned point 1 to 3, and you have three questions.

710
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:38,480
So the total points can be from 3 to 9.

711
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:42,920
The mediators here, including three parts.

712
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:54,830
So emotional health is depression and depressed depressive symptoms is calculated using this is the system that type wrong.

713
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:58,700
CSG Oh yes, yes.

714
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:00,360
See as the scale.

715
01:18:01,070 --> 01:18:10,850
So originally it has eight questions, but in this paper they actually removed two and we are going to talk about that in the discussion question.

716
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,810
So the physical health is a self-rated health.

717
01:18:16,010 --> 01:18:25,760
They are going to report how well they feel that their current health status is and the functional health is actually a functional limitation score.

718
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:30,380
They include 12 agents in total, so the highest can goes to a trough.

719
01:18:30,800 --> 01:18:35,750
And an example here is do you feel any difficulties walking a block?

720
01:18:36,620 --> 01:18:41,719
So similar questions and they have 12 in total. The outcome is the mortality.

721
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:51,170
So deaths are they were they were they were they died at any point from 2002 to 2008.

722
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:57,220
So their methods are really, really statistical.

723
01:18:57,850 --> 01:19:02,320
There are some very advanced methods that we're using.

724
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:05,710
So first of all, is the survival analysis.

725
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:12,340
I think they use another method that is not a Cox survival analysis,

726
01:19:12,640 --> 01:19:22,270
but another one called another one called parametric hazard models with Weibo distribution,

727
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:27,820
because it says this produced more efficient estimates than the normal.

728
01:19:27,940 --> 01:19:31,210
Cox has a lot of self use. So that's why they picked that one.

729
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:38,440
But we are in a general introduction of this paper, so I'm not going to go into details of other like the mathematics.

730
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:43,120
In model one, they have two outcome volatility,

731
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:56,440
loneliness and in 2002 as the predictor and then adding in the socio demographic covariates including like age, gender sex in, in 2002 also.

732
01:19:56,890 --> 01:19:59,590
So a model to further adjust for social relationships.

733
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:07,210
They have model three for the just for health behaviors and then the health variables which is this for these three variables here.

734
01:20:08,380 --> 01:20:12,550
So they are using that and then will they will predict the hazard ratio.

735
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:20,620
And as we put it in table two, we will go into that later. The second one, the cross lab has analyzes.

736
01:20:21,340 --> 01:20:31,390
This is to test the risk for reciprocal influences of loneliness and health simultaneously.

737
01:20:31,670 --> 01:20:35,889
So I haven't heard about this before, and I find it really interesting.

738
01:20:35,890 --> 01:20:40,840
They use a newspaper and they also find some interesting results.

739
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:53,560
But this analysis assumes that the prospective relationship between the health variables and the loneliness and variable are stable over time.

740
01:20:53,830 --> 01:21:03,850
So this is also something that we are going to discuss later because this paper actually makes many assumptions in order to to run the analyzes.

741
01:21:05,560 --> 01:21:16,299
Okay. So results they actually so as each each individual is assigned a weight because they they when they sample people,

742
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:22,720
they oversample some Southern minorities and each each person is assigned a weight.

743
01:21:23,110 --> 01:21:28,450
So in the table, one summary statistics, they actually weighted those numbers.

744
01:21:28,450 --> 01:21:36,700
But in the analyzes they do not. So if you look at the loneliness here, first of all, it ranges from 3 to 9.

745
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:41,620
So the mean number is actually 3.84.

746
01:21:42,280 --> 01:21:51,850
And it was pretty stable. And then in year 2006 is slightly increased to 4.29, but still very, very low.

747
01:21:53,980 --> 01:22:02,830
The Self-Rated health is about average in the middle is around three and is fluctuating a little bit,

748
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:10,570
but pretty stable for the functional limitations you can see is also pretty stable as well, but a slightly increase.

749
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:14,469
So when we look at this table,

750
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:28,060
we can see that this is US older cohort that has the average age in 2002 at about 67 years old and they have a pretty low scores for loneliness,

751
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:36,790
low depressive symptoms, a median self-rated health and have an average of three functional limitations in general.

752
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:43,090
So this is what the sample is about. And keep a question in your mind that is this sample can.

753
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:48,940
Is this sample representative of the overall US older adults.

754
01:22:50,700 --> 01:22:53,910
Okay. So this is the survival analysis part.

755
01:22:54,660 --> 01:23:03,809
First of all, if you look at the rest circles here, you can see if you don't adjust out everything,

756
01:23:03,810 --> 01:23:12,630
the health behaviors, your health, you you have about 40% higher out of date of death.

757
01:23:15,270 --> 01:23:27,840
Any time granted an intuitive sense of an innate if if you have a I think one point higher in loneliness is a social with 14% higher odds.

758
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:29,970
If you want to interpret in that way.

759
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:43,380
But when you adjust out those covariates is actually marginal because the 95% confidence intervals here now crossed one.

760
01:23:43,590 --> 01:23:53,370
So is is is a little bit higher than one marginal significance, but it's not really statistically significant anymore.

761
01:23:53,700 --> 01:24:00,720
Mm hmm. The meta, they didn't really show the tables that talk about the mediation test.

762
01:24:01,380 --> 01:24:04,560
So they only describe it in the paragraph.

763
01:24:04,950 --> 01:24:12,570
So they actually model for further adjust for the three health variables.

764
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:21,840
So what they did here is they test for the mediation effect of these three health outcomes together.

765
01:24:22,650 --> 01:24:31,290
And actually, this mediation effect was tested significant with a beta equals 2.05.

766
01:24:31,620 --> 01:24:41,400
Pretty, pretty small, but still is it is statistically significant with a positive mediation beta.

767
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:53,190
So this is in general the main takeaway from from the friend front of survival

768
01:24:53,190 --> 01:25:00,420
analyzes is that the higher scores that you reported feeling loneliness,

769
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:08,350
the higher odds that you are going to die, which is said, um, okay.

770
01:25:09,600 --> 01:25:15,930
Okay. So this one actually is something that's really interesting about this paper.

771
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:23,280
So this is the cross left relationships between loneliness and the three health outcomes here.

772
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:30,690
So A is depressive symptoms, B is SELF-RATED health and C is functional limitations.

773
01:25:31,230 --> 01:25:37,700
When we talk about with reciprocal relationship, it means that this is loneliness.

774
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:48,780
For example, in 2002, this is going to have a relationship with depression in the same year.

775
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:52,940
Depression in the next year. And that the lonely in the next year.

776
01:25:52,950 --> 01:25:58,020
So there are so many things connected together just in different years.

777
01:25:59,010 --> 01:26:03,149
So they test this reciprocal relationship.

778
01:26:03,150 --> 01:26:05,940
You can see they're very tiny small numbers here.

779
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:19,380
And what they found is actually, first of all, feeling loneliness and depressive symptoms is was significant.

780
01:26:19,710 --> 01:26:30,210
So the loneliness and depressive symptoms, first of all, was significant with a beta e close to .13 to the green colors here.

781
01:26:30,990 --> 01:26:39,690
And then, as I mentioned, they assume that this relationship is constant in every year.

782
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:44,220
So it will not change. That's why it has the same numbers here.

783
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:51,090
And also, depressive symptoms can have an effect back to a feel of loneliness,

784
01:26:51,270 --> 01:26:55,350
not to the previous year, animal prejudicing year and the year in the future.

785
01:26:55,830 --> 01:27:03,000
So that they also tested being significant was a beta because 2.113.

786
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:07,020
So this is depressive symptoms and loneliness.

787
01:27:07,260 --> 01:27:16,110
They also find a similar one ones in loneliness and functional limitations here which is the same trend,

788
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:20,220
has a positive beta and being significant back and forth.

789
01:27:21,720 --> 01:27:32,520
So that's the main finding. And I think regardless of the concerns that we have about this paper,

790
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:40,140
this is this study is really important to aging because as we can see in the very first page,

791
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:46,260
half of the introduction, 20 to 40% people, older adults reported feeling lonely.

792
01:27:46,620 --> 01:27:51,989
And all we are thinking about whether. The lonely is just like a one time thing.

793
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:58,200
Like you were feel lonely at this moment. When I was doing the interview and they went away.

794
01:27:58,380 --> 01:28:02,820
Or is a persistent loneliness that is going to affect your health in the long term.

795
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:07,860
But regardless, is also is still a high number.

796
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:17,060
And this is definitely, definitely a public health concern because loneliness is show in this paper and also so many other literatures.

797
01:28:17,550 --> 01:28:25,050
That's in the introduction and discussion of this paper that it actually can affect older adults in many other ways,

798
01:28:26,040 --> 01:28:29,190
not only mortalities, but also other health outcomes.

799
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:37,800
So the second point here I want to make is they are actually addressing some of the mediation pathways.

800
01:28:38,010 --> 01:28:44,340
For example, in this one, they have the depression, functional limitations and the Self-Rated health.

801
01:28:45,180 --> 01:28:50,880
So and they also find out that some of them are really mediating the pathways here.

802
01:28:51,120 --> 01:28:53,430
So if we find out the relationship,

803
01:28:53,640 --> 01:29:04,500
can we have the professionals to find out a way to intervene those health health outcomes in the middle so that we can kind of reduce the risk of

804
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:13,770
what the mortality for older adults theoretically because if we are based on this our findings that if we intervene on those health outcomes,

805
01:29:13,770 --> 01:29:19,080
then it will reduce the risk for them to die. Okay.

806
01:29:20,040 --> 01:29:26,130
So there are some studies of this paper. You can see I have mobility plus in the locations.

807
01:29:26,670 --> 01:29:33,030
So for this gens, they use three eyes and composite index for loneliness instead of asking, Do you feel lonely?

808
01:29:33,570 --> 01:29:46,290
So first of all, the three item index showed good value, validity and reliability to measured this very subjective loneliness item.

809
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:52,680
But also this paper also, I think it's important that they avoid asking, Do you feel lonely?

810
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,680
Because there's this social stigma around loneliness?

811
01:29:56,280 --> 01:29:59,430
If you say, I feel lonely, do you want people to know you feel lonely?

812
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:03,420
Maybe you don't want to admit in that way I don't feel lonely.

813
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:08,070
But if I ask you those three questions is reflecting your inner thoughts.

814
01:30:08,430 --> 01:30:12,659
So we can use that to reflect your feeling of loneliness in a way.

815
01:30:12,660 --> 01:30:24,990
So I find out that it is really good. And this one is also a longitudinal design that includes three waves and then the mortality data also in 2008,

816
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:28,530
also the mortality from the three waves too.

817
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:37,560
So this really ensures or strengthens our conclusions regarding the temporality.

818
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:49,410
So because you know what happens first and what happens later on, whereas many studies before this one only use cross-sectional design,

819
01:30:49,410 --> 01:30:53,910
which means all the outcomes and the exposures were measured at the same time point.

820
01:30:54,270 --> 01:31:01,320
So it's hard to make a conclusion regarding which which one influenced the next one.

821
01:31:02,670 --> 01:31:11,370
The cross lack past analyzes enable us to explore the less clear, reciprocal relationship between loneliness and other house outcomes.

822
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:20,430
So we are not really indicating a one way influence between two variables, but also how they influence each other.

823
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:25,830
So I find out this and this method is really fascinating.

824
01:31:26,820 --> 01:31:31,110
So regardless of all the stress, let's talk about the limitations here.

825
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:36,430
First of all, this paper is hard to generalize the conclusions to other cohorts.

826
01:31:36,690 --> 01:31:43,860
When I say other cohorts, I mean other cohorts that has different age range because as I said,

827
01:31:43,980 --> 01:31:50,730
we sometimes we may feel lonely too, but the loneliness can come from many different resources.

828
01:31:51,150 --> 01:31:55,530
And that is something that making this one hard to generalize.

829
01:31:55,530 --> 01:32:02,669
And also the age also is hard to generalize is this conclusion to the similar cohorts with similar ages.

830
01:32:02,670 --> 01:32:14,160
But in other countries, because the different policies might be might be impacting how people can have as a resource to deal with loneliness.

831
01:32:16,650 --> 01:32:19,860
The second limitation this paper makes many assumptions.

832
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:27,600
First of all, it assumes the relationship between variables are stable, as we see in the past.

833
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:35,460
So it says that, for example, the loneliness, the lonely of depression from zero,

834
01:32:35,790 --> 01:32:42,750
lonely 0 to 2, depression zero four is the same as Lonely zero four to Depression zero six.

835
01:32:43,350 --> 01:32:49,380
But is that really the case? Is there any social factors that happens in a whole society that may change that effect?

836
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:54,250
Size. That is something that we need to think about. So this is the first assumption they made.

837
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:58,540
The second one is they assume that, oh, this is the one.

838
01:32:58,990 --> 01:33:02,560
This is the assumption. The second one was the thing that I was talking about.

839
01:33:02,890 --> 01:33:07,630
They also talk about the prospective relationship between variables are stable.

840
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:18,400
So this is talking about. So what's happening before is always going to have the same effect on the variables that happens later.

841
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:27,460
And then they have a very interesting conclusions, findings from this paper.

842
01:33:27,700 --> 01:33:33,080
But giving that is assumptions I find out is really hard to apply.

843
01:33:33,100 --> 01:33:42,550
Let's apply these findings for our future researches, because the scenarios in this dataset and in this paper,

844
01:33:42,730 --> 01:33:51,460
I don't I don't think I don't want to say I don't believe I don't think this is going to be applicable to other other data sets.

845
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:56,590
And the third one is as a biased cohort anyway.

846
01:33:56,740 --> 01:34:00,580
And this go back to our table one. As you can see.

847
01:34:00,580 --> 01:34:06,640
So I know if if I also show a histogram that most of the people reported not very long.

848
01:34:07,060 --> 01:34:11,650
There are some in the middle. That's the report. Sometimes not many people report it often.

849
01:34:14,290 --> 01:34:17,110
But the point here is it's a really skilled dataset.

850
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:25,029
And then when you have the mean reported in this way, it's always going to be very close to the lowest point, which is three here.

851
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:30,070
If if you mark as 0 to 6, it will be very close to zero in that way.

852
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:34,600
So that is something we just think about.

853
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:39,620
So people leave that long and they're reporting very low depression symptoms.

854
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:45,520
Is there any reasons behind that? Is there for example, they are retired people.

855
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:53,830
They had a they had a good job before. Is there something that might affect their feeling or the ability to deal with loneliness?

856
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:59,170
The fourth one is a question, not really a limitation.

857
01:34:59,350 --> 01:35:06,520
I was I was thinking, can we do any stratified analyzes to see if the association differs between racial groups?

858
01:35:06,700 --> 01:35:15,910
So that's only an example. And when I was talking about that, I was also thinking about can we actually the loneliness scale here?

859
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:20,290
We asked, we have the sum of scores, but we also have three categories.

860
01:35:20,710 --> 01:35:28,420
So can we can we see do we have enough sample size to study those?

861
01:35:29,500 --> 01:35:34,000
For example, using feeling never lonely as a reference group.

862
01:35:34,180 --> 01:35:38,430
And then to study what will be the effect for those that reported.

863
01:35:38,440 --> 01:35:41,139
Actually, they feel sometimes lonely or often lonely.

864
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:47,440
And then, compared to those who report never feeling lonely, was there us of being more likely to die?

865
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:56,320
So that's what I have for the limitation. So that's the yes, this is the last slide.

866
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:59,650
So I have some discussion questions that I wanted to ask you.

867
01:36:00,370 --> 01:36:07,689
The original I have it right here. The SD scale contains eight items and they remove two questions.

868
01:36:07,690 --> 01:36:11,810
So now it only contains six questions that remove the question.

869
01:36:11,830 --> 01:36:22,450
One, I felt lonely because they think this is an overlap and they will avoid the social stigma and also avoid.

870
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:29,080
Question two is sleep was worthless because it's something to do with the functional, functional limitation.

871
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:33,280
So they only set up the rest six items to get a score.

872
01:36:33,790 --> 01:36:37,870
But do you think after the exclusion, how valid is this measure?

873
01:36:37,880 --> 01:36:50,530
Because the paper I at least I didn't see they performed any test to see whether this is also a good validity to to measure measure depression.

874
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:59,200
So like a correlation between a new score and old score or can I do any sensitivity analyzes to see whether they would get a similar results,

875
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:07,730
even adding those two scores back? Second question is can loneliness in 2002?

876
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:15,489
Because that's their exposure. It's not like in 2004 six, but only in one point predict the following six years.

877
01:37:15,490 --> 01:37:20,150
Mortality. And do you think loneliness is a relatively consistent measurement?

878
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:25,270
Or do you think it will mostly likely change in any of the six years?

879
01:37:26,230 --> 01:37:31,210
And if yes, they are going to change, why? And if no you think is persistent, why?

880
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:35,620
And there are many reasons for death. And what were you?

881
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:41,380
So that's. That's what I said. Because. Like suicide or an accident.

882
01:37:41,650 --> 01:37:46,510
Accident is also like a car crash is also counted as a death.

883
01:37:46,780 --> 01:37:49,810
But I think it will also be shown in the mortality data as well.

884
01:37:50,020 --> 01:37:56,560
So do you think that is really something related to loneliness? So what will you do to polish this study and further establish the conclusions?

885
01:37:57,070 --> 01:38:02,530
And then the the first question is regarding the now the season pauses now in the U.S.

886
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:07,240
What else can we do to make older adults feel less lonely? Does it?

887
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:15,060
Thank you. Well, an awful lot to discuss.

888
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,320
Yes, I have one extra.

889
01:38:20,030 --> 01:38:29,480
Does anyone have any questions? All right. First of all, are comments.

890
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:37,790
Anyone ever use a cross like panel? My comment is that it seems very convoluted.

891
01:38:37,940 --> 01:38:43,580
And so I'm wondering like if there are any other studies out there who abuse that and like, what was their.

892
01:38:48,890 --> 01:38:51,980
Draw conclusions. That's mine.

893
01:38:52,010 --> 01:38:55,670
It's very overwhelming. Just at first glance.

894
01:38:55,950 --> 01:39:01,730
Yeah. In the paper. It's a it's a method that comes from structural equation modeling.

895
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:05,299
And so it used to be very I mean, like I'd say the seventies or so,

896
01:39:05,300 --> 01:39:10,790
I learned it as a graduate student and particularly using infrastructure, informational purposes.

897
01:39:11,720 --> 01:39:15,379
So it's just really getting into the guts of a regression model where regression models,

898
01:39:15,380 --> 01:39:20,450
everything is kind of surface, but it looks like what is going on with those variables, how are they related?

899
01:39:21,020 --> 01:39:28,430
Do they actually, you know, affect each other? But you have to make the assumptions to have the analyzes run like the stable over time.

900
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:32,060
So that's when they chose to make that assumption of you.

901
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:38,540
You may not have to, but you have to be able to. What's called identify the model, which means you can't ask it to just estimate everything.

902
01:39:38,540 --> 01:39:43,759
You can only asked it as the model to estimate, you know, a certain number of paths.

903
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:48,200
Given the amount of data that you have, you can't just say, okay, tell me everything that's going on.

904
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:52,310
So you have to set assumptions to get the model to run to be identified.

905
01:39:52,670 --> 01:39:56,090
So they make decisions about what they think, you know, that they're saying, okay,

906
01:39:56,090 --> 01:40:00,620
let's just make this assumption that is relatively stable and has a stable across time.

907
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:03,979
We'll do that so that we can see under that assumption.

908
01:40:03,980 --> 01:40:10,040
Okay, how does loneliness then make you depressed and how does depression then reinforce loneliness?

909
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:20,930
So it's I think they're great models because they really show you they they get out things that are implicitly assumed in regression models,

910
01:40:20,930 --> 01:40:26,210
but they're explicitly assumed in these models that you really are forced to say, these are my assumptions.

911
01:40:29,400 --> 01:40:37,030
I have a question for you as inclusion so that the number of stars at 2100 into that into any is decreasing.

912
01:40:37,380 --> 01:40:42,120
I know is because they come back every two years and some people decided not to

913
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:46,780
come back or there's some reasons that you cannot wish out to them anymore.

914
01:40:46,800 --> 01:40:53,430
Is that true? So a couple of answers. So in each of us, as all studies, they are following them over time.

915
01:40:53,430 --> 01:40:57,180
But then there's attrition due to loss to follow up, but mostly due to death.

916
01:40:57,810 --> 01:41:00,390
That's one of the main reasons why you lose people over time.

917
01:41:01,650 --> 01:41:08,590
This particular data that they're using came from a pilot study when they were just developing that psychosocial leave behind questionnaire.

918
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:14,740
They did a little small pilot with about 2000 people, and they gave them this this questionnaire.

919
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:18,300
So they're using that very preliminary data of following these people.

920
01:41:18,930 --> 01:41:24,120
But in subsequent years, you'll get the whole you know, on the off years we get the full sample.

921
01:41:24,250 --> 01:41:30,870
Yeah, but that's but that's why. But yeah. So there's definitely attrition and I was surprised that they didn't.

922
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:40,170
You're welcome to sit down. Oh, so you just. I was surprised they did not wait the analysis, but they weighted the descriptive.

923
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:48,120
Yeah. So what do you think about that? Um, from what I've read from other people, this is an interesting one.

924
01:41:49,350 --> 01:42:02,850
Like, it is done in analysis, but it's just technically you can't, you can't use the estimates of the hazard ratio to apply to the general population.

925
01:42:03,210 --> 01:42:14,070
It only applies to a specific sample, I suppose, but I think not a lot of people like I don't people.

926
01:42:14,070 --> 01:42:19,000
It's very clear. I mean, there's different kinds of ways to measure us, right?

927
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:22,240
There's that. There's actually quite a few different ways. Yeah.

928
01:42:22,450 --> 01:42:27,070
And there there's special. So you know this better than me.

929
01:42:28,230 --> 01:42:32,560
Weird strategic sense of that survey rate procedure.

930
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:37,240
Yes. Yes. Right. Where you actually specify the strata and the different segment.

931
01:42:37,750 --> 01:42:41,760
And they have ways for different variables that when you only one,

932
01:42:41,790 --> 01:42:46,420
if somebody want to study methylation, you have a methylation to not the not the simple way that.

933
01:42:46,930 --> 01:42:49,870
Yes. Interesting. So it gets better.

934
01:42:49,870 --> 01:42:57,429
And I think what people are doing is and so it says here in a one sentence, in a static procedures, it says, we did that.

935
01:42:57,430 --> 01:42:58,299
We did not wait,

936
01:42:58,300 --> 01:43:05,800
because research has shown that included variables related to sample selection in the regression produce unbiased coefficients without weights.

937
01:43:06,130 --> 01:43:09,580
So that's why as a present, we have people who support it. So that's why we go with it.

938
01:43:10,790 --> 01:43:16,380
Mm hmm. This social. Different athletes.

939
01:43:18,500 --> 01:43:22,000
Yes. We get to make choices. Interesting. Yeah.

940
01:43:23,330 --> 01:43:26,990
Is that like, mostly what people say that assurance is not reliable?

941
01:43:27,020 --> 01:43:31,550
I don't actually. I don't know that much might be addressed. I don't reply.

942
01:43:31,700 --> 01:43:36,950
I mean, flawed, I guess, rather than unreliable is backward. I don't know.

943
01:43:37,340 --> 01:43:40,069
I mean, I think it has its limitations that relate to what you were saying.

944
01:43:40,070 --> 01:43:46,400
The issue that is is probably a biased sample in terms of their survivors, people that make it to 51 or older.

945
01:43:46,870 --> 01:43:52,670
So the racial diversity in the sample is not what it would be, you know, given the population.

946
01:43:53,540 --> 01:44:01,660
But it's a it's one of the more rigorous stage, I think, in terms of having longitudinal follow up data, if you will, to train people.

947
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:09,830
It's younger than, for example, in rats, which stands at age 65 and the National, National, National Health and Aging Trends Study.

948
01:44:11,310 --> 01:44:12,230
Yeah. What about you?

949
01:44:12,420 --> 01:44:23,829
Do you think that's a piece that each of us is a generally good representative of the US population in a way that if you want to study just general,

950
01:44:23,830 --> 01:44:27,080
like how people graduate, maybe graduate from school,

951
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:34,310
they work and then they retire like this bunch of people like the majority, but I don't think is a good way to draw conclusions,

952
01:44:34,550 --> 01:44:40,280
especially if one is studying minorities like people who are vulnerable to some health conditions.

953
01:44:40,640 --> 01:44:45,860
That's why there are some other other cohorts like data that you can use for that.

954
01:44:48,260 --> 01:44:56,000
By the way, the number of people and I do think we didn't really know.

955
01:45:01,280 --> 01:45:08,689
In my own way. There's some things that I think the reason that I just for him to on top of

956
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:18,250
me like during the whole thing in my mind I think that it's the same thing.

957
01:45:18,290 --> 01:45:25,170
But you know, they have to know that when they were coming, they used to say that.

958
01:45:25,890 --> 01:45:37,820
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I was going to say was, I know a package that might be in conference that it will work, but instead I feel lost.

959
01:45:39,470 --> 01:45:44,560
Yeah, I think the boys are handled much better in theater than they are in that sense.

960
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:49,440
But you've got to be incredibly sensitive. Give or take five.

961
01:45:50,490 --> 01:45:56,000
What about some of these great questions? So what do you all think about taking out those items?

962
01:45:56,010 --> 01:46:00,430
I felt lonely from the sea eased for this. For this analysis.

963
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:13,979
I know some seriously come down with this kind of validity and reliability test based on different sections that kind of like

964
01:46:13,980 --> 01:46:23,639
separate the whole service into different sections and they test on what when validity and the reliability of different sections.

965
01:46:23,640 --> 01:46:35,250
So if these two questions are in one separate section, I think you draw this in terms of the whole overall validity and reliability of this.

966
01:46:35,740 --> 01:46:39,760
Survey questionnaire. Yeah, I thought I got all in the same section.

967
01:46:39,910 --> 01:46:43,630
Yeah. Yeah. And the ESD has been validated with those items in it.

968
01:46:43,910 --> 01:46:45,459
Yeah. And I think your point is a good one.

969
01:46:45,460 --> 01:46:50,590
They should at least report, you know, what's the ultimate reliability, Asian or something, you know, without these.

970
01:46:51,070 --> 01:46:55,299
But do you I mean, you think it's a legitimate concern that if you actually have the measure,

971
01:46:55,300 --> 01:47:03,760
I feel lonely in your exposure as well as your, you know, mediating pathways, etc. is potentially problematic.

972
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:11,010
And we did a shooting school. And I just I was surprised to report anything about just that I would raise them.

973
01:47:11,700 --> 01:47:17,180
Yeah. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. Um.

974
01:47:22,820 --> 01:47:29,240
Yeah. The other question too is interesting, right? So they only assessed loneliness in the in the cost model.

975
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:36,820
We only assessed loneliness at baseline. And do you think loneliness is like, you know, is that a valid assumption?

976
01:47:36,830 --> 01:47:41,570
Do they want to changes over time? Yes.

977
01:47:41,740 --> 01:47:47,690
Yeah, definitely. I think especially as people get older, they probably are more likely to live in.

978
01:47:48,290 --> 01:47:58,420
Lose a spouse or. Another short time I filmed from epidemiology to measure of perspective.

979
01:47:58,690 --> 01:48:06,970
Loneliness in later life will not go back to the loneliness of Islam, which will not make on the same level as it comes down.

980
01:48:07,480 --> 01:48:13,270
So you are not comfortable with the officer association between those at baseline and the law mentality.

981
01:48:13,560 --> 01:48:18,400
But I would say loneliness in their life may lie on causal paths as a mediator.

982
01:48:19,750 --> 01:48:24,250
So, yes, absolutely. So what would you recommend?

983
01:48:24,790 --> 01:48:31,450
I would say if your concern was the classification of loneliness.

984
01:48:32,930 --> 01:48:42,410
You can say that before, but how would you make it as a non differential misclassification that most estimates more than more.

985
01:48:42,770 --> 01:48:47,650
So I think you can support the enforcement officer or an officer representation

986
01:48:48,020 --> 01:48:52,310
or if you want to provide a stronger evidence about loneliness and mortality.

987
01:48:52,670 --> 01:49:01,250
Yeah, I would suggesting all sorts of measure on this for certain points and then measure the measure along this for a longer duration of time

988
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:12,020
and then measure on time in the subsequent waves to provide a stronger evidence of other temporality where we understand that except like,

989
01:49:13,730 --> 01:49:14,000
you know,

990
01:49:14,330 --> 01:49:23,420
some say let's just like get a sense about how much longer this changes over the first 2 to 3 weeks and then look at subsequent mortality after that.

991
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:29,830
I suppose in our analysis, my own case of dementia, well, I need to incorporate the idea that loyal to a confrontation way.

992
01:49:30,110 --> 01:49:36,920
So I round the clock smile for a moment for like a year and subsequent mortality interviews.

993
01:49:36,950 --> 01:49:46,040
And I find that the longer duration, the long this expensive, unnecessary compliance would be associated with higher mortality rates.

994
01:49:46,520 --> 01:49:50,270
But the association does not observe along those that one or two families.

995
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:58,570
But I see that the illness response strategies there is a dose response, but it's really that three years is what makes you see a.
