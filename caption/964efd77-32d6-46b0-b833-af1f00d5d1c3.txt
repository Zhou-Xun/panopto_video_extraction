1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:10,570
So my name is the monetary value. So why are you interested in this position?

2
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,520
I'm going to answer, like, it's like a basic research position.

3
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,530
I'm really interested in this position because I think it's a great opportunity

4
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,090
to apply the skills that I've learned from my Masters degree as far as research.

5
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:31,660
For research and community engagement to make do really impactful work in a vulnerable community.

6
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,100
And what are some of their strengths and what are some of your weaknesses?

7
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:45,180
A major strength of mine is that I can work very independently if I'm given kind of grabbed from her project.

8
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,280
I feel very comfortable developing that research unit and making it into something of my own.

9
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,840
Along with that, because I work so independently.

10
00:00:53,850 --> 00:01:02,150
A weakness of mine is that I don't always ask questions when I should, and I also can sometimes struggle with that.

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,530
Communicating with supervisors if I don't understand a project, which is something that I've worked on in my past.

12
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:13,389
You. Positions as far as like reaching out to supervisors regularly,

13
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:22,440
making sure that I have like strong communication channels with supervisors, in my view, over other projects.

14
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:28,960
I have a background in health education. My bachelor's degree is in health education and I work as a whole bunch of people for a year.

15
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:38,649
So I have really strong communication skills when it comes to communicating complicated or scientific information to more lay audiences.

16
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:43,379
And I think that's a skill that might be lacking in other people with environmental health backgrounds.

17
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,570
So I think that would make me more successful in this position.
