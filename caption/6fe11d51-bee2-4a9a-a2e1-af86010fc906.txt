1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,130
I want to know how much of the study is right.

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:35,910
I always go back open if I want to know what I have to learn or not.

3
00:00:38,850 --> 00:01:08,550
Yeah. Yeah. I feel like they're not going to be able to give me an hour and a half now because

4
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:51,540
I haven't heard the interview and everything what I was like I was all for.

5
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:06,900
It's kind of like you're the one who had a good weekend.

6
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,259
So this week, hope today and Thursday,

7
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,709
we're going to be talking about kind of the state of quality and value in the U.S. So I have a couple of lectures.

8
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:22,920
There'll be some discussions, discussion points and kind of group activities.

9
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,850
So that will be kind of the agenda for this week.

10
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:33,509
We just had some new name cards printed out, so we'll start next Thursday.

11
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:39,410
When you all come in, we'll have them sitting right here. Please pick them up before or after they're at the end of class.

12
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:43,320
Over time, we'll keep bringing them so that you don't have to worry about track of them.

13
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,210
But we'll start that on Thursday so that everyone has those right as you come out.

14
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:59,340
A couple quick things. The great planning assignment is do they Thursday, does anybody have any questions on those?

15
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,180
Still got a couple of days. These are not legally binding agreements.

16
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:09,110
So whatever you put in there does not have to be what you do. But something.

17
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:09,710
Yeah.

18
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:17,720
I didn't realize you already had an Excel template until I turned it down as a code return, just like an Excel sheet and showing the same things.

19
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,319
Yes, I think that was fine. So yeah, the templates there just to be used with.

20
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:26,030
Yes. So that that should be just fine. But again, what you put in there is not you don't have to follow that to it.

21
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,380
It's just more of a way to think through some of the activities that we have for the class.

22
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:35,060
So we're not legally bound by it. Yes.

23
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,660
And I notice all of them are.

24
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:45,590
And so is that like a really good or. Yeah, it's rolling deadlines so you can complete them now you completed towards the end.

25
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,870
I think the idea is that you can do them as your kind of schedule gets busy and not busy too.

26
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,590
Hopefully you'll be able to take time to take advantage of those times. You're not quite as busy.

27
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:58,099
Do a couple of things that's yeah. So they're open till the end of the year. So the sooner you get them in the better.

28
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:06,050
But you know that's, that's up to you. I guess I was to get started on someone like that, but it's sure you don't know for sure.

29
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,110
So as I understand because I was going through one of those today, if you hit the start questionnaire portion,

30
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,880
it will have I believe it has the lecture components in the quiz when you open it up.

31
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:22,219
Oh, I think so. They should be in there and they should be like there's little segments of them.

32
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:28,340
And then between segments there's questions to answer. So I think that's how those are set up and that's what I saw when I was going through this.

33
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:38,089
You know, the question is, I don't know. Okay, we're working on developing a Qualtrics.

34
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,990
Oh, yes. Do we get one of the text on the quizzes? I'm sorry.

35
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,469
Unlike the plus lectures, we only get one attempts on the quizzes.

36
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:52,130
Yes. Yeah. So it's not as many times do I put this one two times and that's what we should be reading through it.

37
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,090
Yeah. You know there is no time limit to it.

38
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,020
So if you start it, you don't have to worry about I have to finish it within a certain period.

39
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:06,530
So as far as I know, there's nothing to do with your questions.

40
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,740
Okay. So for the group projects, we're going to be sending out a Qualtrics survey that will essentially show you

41
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,500
are are you going to view or plan to do a case study or an empirical analysis?

42
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:25,459
And then from each of those no, these kind of subsequent pages, which case study,

43
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:30,530
there'll be a sort of do selections of like typical project ideas or general,

44
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,800
you know, example projects, ideas for you to like select a view to hopefully get some preferences.

45
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:42,230
And then if you have a group in mind, you can put names in there that you will help.

46
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:46,520
If you don't have anybody that you're really, you know, that would be formulated.

47
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,900
You don't have to put names there. We have a group of people together based off preferences.

48
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,580
Once those are all collected, then we'll kind of send out group assignments for those.

49
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,440
Know the case study that you're choosing the group results.

50
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,719
So I would go to the canvas site and look through that because there's a there's a grading template for the case study.

51
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:11,450
So we'll see how those are broken up. Groups are 3 to 5 people.

52
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,590
So however you want to do that, you know, that's that's kind of what you can expect.

53
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,290
And then there are some examples.

54
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:29,430
I put some examples of past case study presentations on campus, so you can take a look at those just to get a sense of kind of what you would expect.

55
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,139
There's also the empirical project, so just a clarification on that.

56
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,490
It is 60 points. There are two components to that.

57
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,770
There's kind of a mid-term report, which is not the final project.

58
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:46,920
But the idea is that you think through kind of like the context of the problem, a general kind of introduction of the problem,

59
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:54,629
the goal of what you're trying to do for kind of projected study plan in terms of what kind of analytics you're going to be doing,

60
00:06:54,630 --> 00:07:00,300
what data source you're going to be doing, kind of anticipated challenges. So it's almost like everything but the results and conclusion.

61
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,510
So that will be do earlier and I'll make sure that that due date is clarified on the canvas.

62
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,130
And I will report that on Thursday.

63
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,729
And then following that midterm, for the other 30 points of that, 60 will be a group presentation of that whole project.

64
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,430
So that will include will, you know, all of a sudden essentially you wrote for the midterm as long as the results even include.

65
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,640
So that's how those 60 points are broken up.

66
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,799
And there are some examples of the midterm reports on there on trying to look through past class campus sites,

67
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,900
to look for some of the presentations I've found in the end, but I'll make sure to make the presentation on there as well.

68
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,900
The idea is once the the Qualtrics is filled out, if people are choosing empirical analysis,

69
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:47,639
I'd like to meet with the groups to kind of help through walk through some of the, you know, the study plan,

70
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,459
what kind of data such as to make sure that, you know, you're not being thrown to the deep end and have some kind of a sense of how to move forward

71
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,940
with that and whether or not this is kind of an appropriate choice for what you want to do.

72
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:06,350
So any questions on the group projects? Not once, but twice.

73
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:15,800
Okay, so keep an eye out for the Qualtrics. I hope to have it sent out by the end of the week or early next week, and you should go from there.

74
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,160
Any other questions before we get started? Okay.

75
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,290
So overview of the topics for this week.

76
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,239
We'll talk we talk a little bit last week, just kind of off end about what we liked,

77
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,440
about what I worked on, on health care system, what's not so good about the health care system.

78
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,260
We'll go into a little more depth into those things today,

79
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,230
trying to put a little bit of data around it, hopefully give people a kind of framework to work from.

80
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:49,070
And then on Thursday, we're going to focus on how do we specifically evaluate domains of quality performance.

81
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:53,300
Just kind of from a high level. And that will be in Thursday's lecture.

82
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,369
So some some take home issues from from lectures.

83
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:03,620
You know, we want to identify like specific strengths about how our health care system does operate well.

84
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,990
So things like research and development,

85
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:13,250
the workforce that we have choice and provider ensure those are things that we would highlight the strengths, our unique weaknesses.

86
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:20,610
It's very expensive. There's a lot of inequalities, inequities, barriers to access system fragmentation in the world.

87
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,950
While some aspects of our health care system do seem to be improving things like population, health and whatnot, certainly like online.

88
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:31,130
So this is a kind of cliff notes version of things that will be going through.

89
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:37,610
So let's talk about the good things. It's not all bad.

90
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,870
It's not all doom and gloom. There are some things that we do do well.

91
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:50,990
We're very good. The health care system here is very good at rapidly developing, adopting new health care devices, drugs, procedures.

92
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,660
There's a lot of innovation that happens in the U.S. that is kind of a unique feature of our system.

93
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,470
So there are really important benefits there.

94
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,220
Not to say those don't occur in other places, but that is an emphasis of a lot of our health care system.

95
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:08,900
We do pay relatively well for people to enter the profession.

96
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:16,100
We are amongst the kind of higher paid side of professional medical professionals in the world relative to other countries.

97
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:23,000
Patients have a lot of choice in theory, presuming they have health insurance.

98
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:26,110
So there are a lot of kind of caveats, that statement.

99
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,549
But for those that are quote unquote, within the system, they have a lot of choice which some can view as a good thing.

100
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:37,129
And I would highlight a instead of a market based health care system,

101
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:40,700
but that is what some would say is which is an advantage of our health care system.

102
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:47,780
So let's try to put some data around this. So these are from what's called the World Index of Health Care Innovation.

103
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:54,860
This this group ranks countries about how they perform in certain aspects of health care and tries to compare them.

104
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:59,380
It is an inexact science. You can certainly poke holes in this just like any other ranking system.

105
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:03,709
So I'm not saying that this is without fault or without issue,

106
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:10,440
but I think it just gives us an idea of how we can maybe frame and put our health care system in the context of what we see in other places.

107
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:17,360
So they have the U.S. as the fourth best health care system in the world, which I'm sure is up for debate.

108
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:27,180
So some of the things they highlight as benefits of our system are things like relative to choice, science and technology.

109
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,900
Those are ones that we rank the top and relative to other countries on this list.

110
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:42,340
So let's dig into that a little more. So we do spend more on health related R&D than any other country.

111
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,380
So sorry for the fuzziness of the picture.

112
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,410
Really, the important thing is where we sit, which is always a big red circle.

113
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,360
So if we look at kind of the percent of our budget appropriations for health R&D,

114
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,560
we are we are on the other side as well as the percent of GDP that we spend on that.

115
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,360
So we spend a lot of money in health care so much more than other countries.

116
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,129
So one could use that.

117
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:10,820
You could view that as we invest a lot, we see it as a really important part of our economy, of our part of our service to our citizens.

118
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:15,650
We spend so much on health care, whether it's in developing new systems,

119
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,830
paying and funding our current systems relative to other countries, we spend a lot.

120
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,709
We spend a lot on health related R&D, a lot more than other countries.

121
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:35,630
So if we think of like federal funding, our research funding, if we look at kind of the percent, these are from World Report from NIH,

122
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:41,510
how much the National Institute of Health gets in terms of like of all the money that's spent in these major

123
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:50,030
institutions on health care research that each makes up by far the largest component relative to others in Canada,

124
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:57,380
the UK and Europe. And so you can see the National Institute of Health here in the U.S. makes up a huge chunk of that pie.

125
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:08,130
If we look at kind of like health related expenditures in millions, it's, you know, $26 billion for 2013 and the next closest is 3 billion.

126
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,220
So it's just multiple orders of magnitude more in the U.S. and other countries.

127
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:20,960
So that is I think what some would say is a benefit is that we have a lot of money to spend on developing new therapies,

128
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:28,909
technologies and new ways of delivering health care. So when we try to put this into context, things, you know, cancer medications,

129
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:35,000
you know, REVLIMID for multiple myeloma, Herceptin for HER2 positive cancer therapy,

130
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,989
these are new drugs that were developed in the U.S. Obviously the most recent example, Emirati vaccines for COVID 19,

131
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:47,990
those were not solely done in the U.S., but the U.S. was the major testing ground for many of these.

132
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:52,730
And a lot of the funding came from the U.S. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

133
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,159
This is something that I kind of do research on on the side,

134
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:03,049
but these are kind of very minimally invasive heart procedures that traditionally required open heart surgery for older patients.

135
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,560
And these new these new devices are life changing for money.

136
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:13,999
HIV antiviral therapy, these are these are all examples of just the ways in which U.S. and funding from U.S. sources,

137
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,040
not solely, but a large part of many of these kind of life changing treatments for many.

138
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:29,530
Workforce. USA has 15 of the top 20 medical schools in the world relative to others in the world.

139
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:33,460
Unfortunately, Michigan ranks at 11 just outside the country.

140
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,790
That's okay. We'll get there.

141
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:44,410
But in terms of where people from all around the world come to the U.S. for medical training and so in terms of training,

142
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:47,110
the next generation of medical professionals,

143
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:56,140
the U.S. has, by law, by and large, is the best training ground in the world outside of a few places around and other parts of the world.

144
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,770
However, when it comes to like the supply of physicians, it's a very different story.

145
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:04,540
So this is touching a little bit.

146
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:10,590
And what we don't do so great, while we have a lot of these great medical schools, our physician nursing supply is not so great.

147
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,370
So this is a challenge.

148
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:21,510
You know, if we look at the number of physicians per year, 4000 in the U.S., it's about three and a half in kind of a comparable countries.

149
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,290
And the U.S. is about to happen. So we don't have the greatest supply.

150
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:32,350
I would do a little bit better in terms of nursing, but I'm sure we'd all be better.

151
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,210
There are a lot of reasons for this to be a conversation today.

152
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,230
But even beyond this, you know, this is, you know, the overall averages.

153
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:48,100
When we look at how things are distributed, it's also not equal.

154
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:55,120
So this is a challenge that physician supply may be a certain number, but that number is not the same across the country.

155
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,130
And so there are certain parts of the world of the country that that have a larger supply.

156
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:04,510
Certainly on the coasts, there are a lot more physicians that we see in middle America.

157
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,300
And this is both primary care and specialist.

158
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:14,020
So these are these are kind of standard problems that we deal with U.S. health care systems that are trying to get physician supply

159
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:21,280
and physician workforce relative to those across our country and not just located in kind of metro major metropolitan areas.

160
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:29,260
So for choice. So for people with insurance, we do tend to have a lot of choices.

161
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:34,540
So whether it's what kind of insurance plan we're going to have or what hospital, which hospital we want to go to,

162
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:41,110
which physicians we're going to see for those that have health insurance, there is a lot of options.

163
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:48,220
Options. I mean, if you go there, if you look, these are just plans offered if you are a michigan medicine employee.

164
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,020
So there's a lot of different options that you can do that very much care from your network coverage.

165
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:54,160
Blue Cross Blue Shield.

166
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,960
There's a lot of different options that you can pick and choose what you want to do based off of what you think you're going to need.

167
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:04,960
They all come with different price points. So this is just within our institution here.

168
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,649
So there's a lot of choices that you can pick from. Even though that said, if you don't want to do that,

169
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:14,920
you can go on to the other extreme and you can look for different health plans based off of what you want to have.

170
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,130
You know how much you pay out of pocket, how much you want to pay premiums.

171
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:22,840
And you do have a lot of ability to tailor kind of what you want for what you think you need.

172
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,160
So again, just went onto their website and typed in some information, got, you know, for a family of five.

173
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:36,960
What is the, you know, how much they're going to pay a month and what is the plan from the come with, you know, what is the rating of the plan?

174
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:43,300
What does it not include? What is included? These are all things that if you have access to it, you have a lot of options.

175
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:49,569
And so that is what some would say is a benefit of the whole process,

176
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:56,650
is that we kind of tailor what we think we need and want when it comes to doctors.

177
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,280
You can go on to us. World News Report. What for?

178
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,870
What is the best hospital? If I need to get answering your words. Best place to go close to me.

179
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:10,030
You can look at the rankings and I'll give you all sorts of information on how they do and outcomes how they do in patient experience.

180
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,370
You can really learn a lot from just going on these sites and figuring out, you know, where do I want to go?

181
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,080
Is it close to me? You know, there's a trade off. Like if I go really far for better care or am I good here?

182
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:29,590
You go and find a doctor and look for any type of specialist need and really do all that on your and you can learn a lot about that.

183
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:33,130
Our U.S. News and World Reports largely paid for.

184
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:38,020
Oh, for sure. Yes. Yeah. That's not that's not really a reflection of who the best doctors are.

185
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:44,049
Right. Yeah. So there's an appropriately sized grain of salt to be taken here, which is that these rankings are imperfect.

186
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:48,970
And we'll get into that in the next couple of sessions about like how do we actually measure performance?

187
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:52,150
How would actually measure quality? Because in U.S. world news,

188
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,980
too many of these things are how much money can you consider things or how much can you

189
00:18:57,490 --> 00:19:02,830
how much PR can you generate with your own institution or within your own network?

190
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:09,460
So these are imperfect. I think if you largely take them at face value, you're probably going to do okay.

191
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:13,300
But like, again, it's like the difference be number one and number two.

192
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:18,010
Is there really a meaningful difference there? Maybe, maybe not.

193
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:25,899
I think it's just from the from the broad perspective of, you know, you can look to see how people rank and then go from there.

194
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:32,650
But, yes, I would fully agree that there are limitations with with those rankings and how they're estimated and how they're used.

195
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,580
But again, all this is to say we have a lot of choices.

196
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:42,820
There's know there's a lot we can learn from these systems to to figure out where we want to go with health care.

197
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:46,300
You're not beholden to just this physician or just this hospital.

198
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:55,330
Okay. So. What else in the context of health care quality in what we see today, we talked a little bit last week.

199
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:01,479
What do you all think in terms of these things outside of choice or workforce?

200
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,500
Or are the big picture things that you think we do really, really well here?

201
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:22,629
Fortunately it's not happening. Your so one of the articles we have talked about how we're really good with like preventative medicine.

202
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,830
So we read about breast cancer screening and I think it was flu shot.

203
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,290
Yeah, yeah. Prevention, we do well.

204
00:20:29,290 --> 00:20:38,349
And I think, you know, if we think of things that we focus on, you know, guideline recommended care, we often do well in some cases.

205
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:41,990
And so prevention screening is one of those aspects. So yeah.

206
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,720
Yes, absolutely. I actually have a question.

207
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:52,930
Yeah. Um, or the you know, when they say that we're good at prevention, is it literally just breast cancer and flu shots?

208
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:57,639
Because I'm pretty bad at other kinds of prevention. Yeah, chronic disease for sure.

209
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,030
I mean, it's certainly not just kind of carte blanche. We're good at all prevention.

210
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:06,790
We look at population health as whole. We certainly don't do what is it actually literally just breast cancer screening?

211
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,500
Oh, no, I'm sure there are others. Those are just examples of things that we do.

212
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:19,270
So yes, there are some quite specific outcomes that we do really well on, but I think one is if you have a heart attack.

213
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,560
Yeah, really well compared to other countries at treating it really means keeping you alive.

214
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:28,050
Yeah. Absolutely adorable in time. All these things. And you know,

215
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:31,600
one thing that I'm sure we'll get into at some point is like the the kind of

216
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:36,580
development of performance measurement and like how we use those to drive improvement.

217
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:42,250
The U.S. does that very well. Some would argue probably too well because there are so many quality measures now.

218
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:47,680
But that does help us to get to very specific things about like get if someone has a heart attack,

219
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:54,740
get them to the hospital, get them on medication as soon as possible in E.R. and even within the ambulance at time.

220
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,830
So those are things that we don't do very well at others.

221
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:07,690
You can. I'm more worried about my family. And I think overall, just going off brain is what we do.

222
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:14,290
Do a good job at prehospital care, the role and the training and how many people we do have out on the roads and the ambulances

223
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:20,770
and things like that are pretty good in this country in terms of response times in others.

224
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,660
I think we do a pretty good job with a lot of procedures.

225
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,780
I know that there's a lot of controversy around that, that we do too many.

226
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:36,330
But for example, like with the outcomes, we have problems in this country, especially for joint replacement.

227
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:42,620
Yeah, absolutely. I think acute care is something that we we often do well in many cases.

228
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,959
It's kind of related what Lawrence said and also just our success with innovation.

229
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:57,150
But generally, you can rely on having access to like tumbling technology if something happens to you,

230
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:11,190
even if the cost isn't great for you or there are other systematic failures, you can kind of assume that you have devices to take off some care.

231
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,069
Yeah.

232
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:21,090
And I think that's often the case with, you know, many kind of procedure based things where I think someone had mentioned last week about wait times,

233
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:26,040
like wait times in the U.S. are pretty good, particularly for really advanced technologies.

234
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:32,729
And, you know, there are certainly some things in the cardiovascular space that I'm aware of that very few people have access to.

235
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,920
And to get access to it, you have to go through a number of steps.

236
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:43,930
And it's kind of very, as, you know, not a select group, but a very narrow kind of group of people that meet certain criteria are really good.

237
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:48,900
That is, spending money more than any other countries.

238
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:54,020
That's something. Yeah, that's expensive. We know. We know it's expensive.

239
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,660
Probably spending a lot of money that is and know all about it.

240
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:02,250
And I think you'll see in in other countries, you know, they have very, you know,

241
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:08,850
I think a kind of criticism of many like single payer systems and whatnot is they spend so

242
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:15,749
much time on cost effectiveness that establishing whether a new therapy is cost effective,

243
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,770
that it can impede is kind of diffusion in the population here.

244
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:24,320
It's often like as soon as the clinical trials are out, there's like 500 hospitals offering it.

245
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:31,920
So that is one thing that, you know, for better or worse, we're really good at spending money and we it's kind of like throwing costs to the win.

246
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,290
Like, that's not the concern. We do make a lot of money doing it here.

247
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:38,310
We'll bring in a lot of patients and you can change a lot of lives for the better.

248
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:45,329
But yeah, it does kind of it costs me to more research on the side of the room.

249
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,570
It's been quieter here in certain jurors.

250
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:56,380
There are a lot of options. A lot of options in what way?

251
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:00,000
And everything that is there.

252
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:09,850
I think that is the ability to I think, you know, a good example that I had mentioned was the transcatheter aortic valve replacement in Michigan.

253
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:14,920
There are 33 hospitals that do that. In the U.K., there's like seven.

254
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,160
So in terms of where you want to go, there's a huge number of options to do that.

255
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:26,799
Yeah, probably as geriatric care and procedures as a lot of these surgeries.

256
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:31,840
And again, if you have access to the money, the elderly care.

257
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:41,259
Yeah. Yeah. I think the minimally invasive space for a lot of a lot of those kind of procedures are are have

258
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:45,549
been transformative for many folks that have been kind of traditionally unable to have perceived,

259
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,600
you know, traditional surgery in some ways. All right.

260
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:54,610
So let's turn to the not so great things.

261
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:04,870
First and foremost, high cost. We spend a lot a lot of money and it can be unsustainable and it isn't sustainable,

262
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:14,200
which is why we're seeing a lot of move towards value based care and then many other things like that, that looking into barriers to care access.

263
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:22,150
So this is a really key point of when you have a kind of private health insurance program and where things are tied,

264
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:29,680
you know, insurance and access are tied to things like employment can create a lot of access to care system fragmentation.

265
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:39,879
I think we talked a about this a little bit last time. How are doctors and facilities and hospitals working together is often unclear.

266
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,230
There's not a lot of it's rapidly changing all the time.

267
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:48,430
And so how and then you throw health I.T. on top of all that,

268
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:54,850
you have all sorts of issues of fragmentation and how things actually work together and related to barriers that care,

269
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:58,570
access, inequalities in care that we see within the system.

270
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:03,549
Okay. So going back to the rankings here, we saw we did really well in science technology.

271
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,170
We did really well in choice quality.

272
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:18,190
We do okay. Ranked 14 as we said, if we look here, measures of preventable disease, not quite as strong patient centered care.

273
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:28,630
We do pretty well infrastructure of challenging fiscal sustainability or almost dead last second to last year.

274
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:40,720
So again, not only are we spending a ton of money on really high cost things, we're not spending on public health, which is a whole lot of work here.

275
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:47,380
And the growth in health spending is also we're accelerating at a very rapid rates.

276
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:56,590
So if we look at kind of health expenditures as a proportion of our GDP back in the 1970s, we're about like everybody else,

277
00:27:56,590 --> 00:28:09,129
there wasn't a whole lot of difference on the higher end, but not 7% is near 18%, which is unfathomable for many countries where it's only 10%.

278
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:19,990
So we spend almost twice as much of our GDP on health care as at least comparable country in the world, not only in.

279
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:28,210
So if we think about, you know, where does that money come from, it comes out of us and how we pay.

280
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:35,140
And so what's to show here is you can see the blue line in terms of our household budget that's usually devoted to health care related spending,

281
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,240
you know, was about 5.6% of our total budgets and a house for health care.

282
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:47,769
So 8%. But if we break that down into like the two buckets here, going to pay a monthly premiums,

283
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:53,350
how much do you pay every month versus kind of out of pocket kind of you go spending?

284
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:55,570
The out-of-pocket has largely been the same.

285
00:28:55,930 --> 00:29:01,780
And so it doesn't look like we're using a lot of health care and spending more on kind of as we use it know basis.

286
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:08,860
But our premiums have shot through the roof and that's where we're spending a lot of our money is that is the monthly kind of

287
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:16,710
premium spending is going up every year because they're pulling more from the entire group to pay for these rising costs.

288
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,850
And so that's what we're seeing in the last 20 years or so.

289
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:30,000
We're spending similar to other countries in terms of public spending.

290
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,760
So this is not kind of health insurance spending that we think of, like where our spending is allocated.

291
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:43,650
We can kind of, you know, in terms of what we're spending on a kind of public service basis versus private spending, an out of pocket spending.

292
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,940
Our public spending is actually relatively similar in other countries.

293
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:53,970
So how much we invest is in the US related to public health care is very similar,

294
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:59,309
but you can see that that private spending makes up a huge addition on top of all of

295
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:03,389
that and in the out-of-pocket spending is largely kind of similar to other countries.

296
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:11,070
So we're spending kind of an out-of-pocket basis is not that different, but that private spending in the pocket is a massive increase for the U.S.

297
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:23,620
Because of this, Americans delay or avoid error more frequently than other countries, particularly those that are uninsured.

298
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:29,290
So, you know, I hear from from Kaiser. About 9% of patients delayed care.

299
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:33,340
8% did not get care and have both in some way.

300
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:37,180
And if we look at those compared to insured and uninsured, it's a huge difference.

301
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:43,000
So we look at either delayed or did not get care for those with insurance.

302
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,890
It's about that kind of seven, 8%.

303
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:53,140
But for those without insurance, it's almost 40% of people without insurance delay or avoid getting care because of that, because of cost concerns.

304
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:58,420
And so that's a huge issue when it comes to our health care system. And because of that, people are not getting care.

305
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,870
And that leads to all sorts of kind of snowballing effects of declining health,

306
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:06,520
co-morbidities, uncontrolled medical issues that ultimately costs more money.

307
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:15,700
So that would be what folks would say is that is a really important disadvantage of our system fragmentation.

308
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:19,060
Okay. So complex delivery systems often fail.

309
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,830
Complex systems often fail.

310
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,410
That's what I'm kind of organizational person to tell you is the more complicated your system gets, the more likely it is to go wrong.

311
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,700
Health care as people at all levels physicians, nurses, NPS pays are included.

312
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:37,300
The list goes on of those that are involved and the roles that they play.

313
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,340
For many patients, particularly those that are more complex,

314
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:47,590
care needs to be coordinated kind of within and across these organizations, which is really challenging.

315
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:55,239
So you have an individual that is multi-core co-morbid, they have diabetes and COPD that, you know,

316
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,430
they need to see a pulmonologist that is analogous to a cardiologist, a primary care physician, pharmacist.

317
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:04,000
The list goes on what what care an individual would need.

318
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:08,530
And often this fails because there's really no incentive for them to work together.

319
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,450
Their incentive is right in front of them. What do I do? How do I treat this patient that is in front of me today?

320
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,890
How do I get them treated? How do I get them better while they're in my office?

321
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,300
And there's really not much of an incentive for you to go above and beyond and get in touch with all their other providers that are often busy.

322
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:34,030
And so that's where the lack of kind of incentive or a reimbursement system for care coordination really kind of contributes to this fragmentation.

323
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:43,390
It's also difficult to share information health information exchanges, which I hope I can do to fix that.

324
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,370
It has worked and not worked. At the same time, it does allow people to share information.

325
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,570
Oftentimes that information is duplicative or it's repeated a million times.

326
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,639
I would need to find the paper.

327
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:05,670
And there was a research study that looked at kind of what percentage of a person's health record is filled with unique kind of observations.

328
00:33:06,090 --> 00:33:10,620
And it's a very small portion because so much of it is just copy, paste, copy, paste, copy, paste, complete piece.

329
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,430
And when you have this huge record, especially for someone that's medically complex,

330
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:21,030
the next person has to look at this record and try to sift through all of it and figure out what are the meaningful things here.

331
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:26,340
And often that can lead to miscommunication. People are being treated for things that they're not really.

332
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:34,050
It was either resolved or it's not what you're here for. So again, that's where a kind of complex system fails.

333
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:42,750
And the lack of organized systems is also a challenge. It's it's interesting because that's what as we see kind of rapid consolidation,

334
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:48,510
that's what they often sell it as is we're going to create the system and everything within the system is going to work together.

335
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:55,870
Oftentimes, and I've had the opportunity to work with people that are within the same system and they've never even met each other.

336
00:33:55,890 --> 00:33:59,890
And so even though they have the same name and they're under the same, you know,

337
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:04,710
corporate identity, they often don't work together in very efficient ways.

338
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:10,700
There are models that people are trying to do to get at this better, but it's really hard to implement.

339
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,930
There's nothing and there's not really an incentive to do it.

340
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,020
And again, all of this is, you know, patients that, you know, anytime you have this complex delivery system,

341
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,970
the more times the patient interacts with it, the greater risk. And you are at that failing.

342
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:31,290
And so, you know, for for many of us that, you know, may see the doctor once a year or twice a year because of, you know,

343
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:37,260
just usual checkups or kind of minor things that may not impact us very much because we're, you know, very straightforward cases.

344
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:44,270
But for some of us that have medical needs and, you know, abilities or chronic diseases and those kind of compounded each other,

345
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:48,150
the more times you are likely to interface with the health care system, the more likely it is to fail you.

346
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:52,410
And so that's where the system really often fails patients.

347
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:00,770
So social inequalities. So non-whites in this country are less likely to have health insurance coverage.

348
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,530
This has been known for years.

349
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:15,650
So if we look at the various kind of lines here, American Indians and Alaska natives, Hispanics, blacks and other other populations are just.

350
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,610
Their rates of uninsurance are so much higher across the board.

351
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,229
You can see the big dip here,

352
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:30,380
which is when a lot of states passed Medicaid expansion and people were more able to get access to to insurance through Medicaid expansion.

353
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Again, Medicaid expansion was a state by state decision.

354
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:39,770
So it didn't solve all the problems. It helped many of those without insurance in those.

355
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:43,219
So that's why we see kind of this kind of precipitous drop off here.

356
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:51,700
But again, since that kind of large, you know, 2013, 14, 15, when many states sort of pass those, not many have continued to expand.

357
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:56,600
So that's why we see the second plateauing or not. There's not many changes beyond them.

358
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:05,629
Yeah. Greenwald And it's unclear what kind of those are Native Hawaiians and other

359
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:11,750
Pacific Islanders and the top 1 million American Indians and Alaska Natives.

360
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:27,140
And so the other part is that life expectancy, as we know within the country, is is much higher when you are at higher levels of income.

361
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:33,270
And there are differences both in across men and women.

362
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:42,290
So to break this down a little bit. So those in the kind of the blue line here are those at the lowest quartile of income,

363
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:47,240
those in the yellow line, the highest quartile of incomes, all the ones are increasing, which is good.

364
00:36:47,690 --> 00:36:51,200
But the gap between those two is actually widening, which is the problem.

365
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:54,260
And that is actually worse in women.

366
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:06,470
And so this is something where, you know, as especially as the income disparity in this country grows, those those changes are getting wider.

367
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,979
Disparities are growing. Even though everyone's getting a little better.

368
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:17,810
Some are getting a lot better faster than others. And so that is an issue that how has that changed since the life expectancy has gone down?

369
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:22,240
That's a great question. I don't know if I have a good answer for that. I know that that's been kind of universal.

370
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:26,329
Seeing obviously the impact of COVID has varied also by race and income levels.

371
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:32,479
So my hypothesis would be that those in lower income quartiles or, you know,

372
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:37,460
vulnerable populations probably had a greater decrease in life expectancy because they were the ones,

373
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:42,170
particularly earlier in the pandemic, that were hit the hardest. So that would be my guess.

374
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:49,129
I don't know that every that, but I think life expectancy started to decline before the pandemic, mostly related to opioid overdoses.

375
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:54,650
And yeah, that and I think that impacts, you know, different socioeconomic factors.

376
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:01,550
I think it affects higher income socioeconomic groups as much as it does lower income earners.

377
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:10,400
Right. Which is that that JAMA paper kind of talked a little bit about that there was this big gap in particular in middle aged folks.

378
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:19,280
That was a huge impact on life expectancy. I think it had recovered a little bit since people started to kind of deal with opioids a little more.

379
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:26,720
But I suspect that more will come out and how COVID really impacted.

380
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:30,620
You know, life expectancy is no more. And there's probably many papers out there.

381
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:38,660
I haven't seen them, but it's like it dropped down for years and had for some people what it was.

382
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,230
And I think the U.S. had the largest decline.

383
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:48,590
Yeah, I think that relative to other countries that experienced COVID, the U.S. had the largest drop in life expectancy, I think.

384
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:54,259
And I think because like opioids, where it was more middle aged folks,

385
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:00,760
I think COVID had a very disproportionate effect of the U.S. on them and those in the Middle Ages rather than, you know, the older populations.

386
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,890
And so I think that that contributed a lot to that decline.

387
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:16,330
Okay. So we talked about expanding access, fragmentation, social inequalities.

388
00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:31,570
What else would we say is not so good either related to this or interdependencies with that for people to be looking into that, right?

389
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:44,570
Yeah, it is. Yeah. The access also that someone had mentioned last week, the medical kind of understanding of like where do I go?

390
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:51,940
How we can start to feel like, you know, we have a lot of illegal immigrants that even though they're not that easy,

391
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:58,000
facilitate, go and visit can be different. So because of the fear of people and all that one bit.

392
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:05,110
So you don't go in and maybe try to give just money for medication, which on this one, yeah.

393
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:14,710
Having coverage doesn't necessarily mean you can access care ultimately, particularly about Medicaid.

394
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:18,040
I recently had a change in insurance and in Washtenaw County,

395
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:25,240
it's six months to see a dermatologist that takes Medicaid and over eight months to see a dentist that takes Medicaid.

396
00:40:27,190 --> 00:40:32,950
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Then pass it back that way. Yeah, I think that's that's certainly is a huge issue.

397
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:39,249
And, you know, I think like the physician supply thing we saw, like, you know, we talk about like the wait times.

398
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:45,760
Wait times is average pretty good. But I mean, it's so variable in terms of what insurance you have abroad is your network.

399
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,120
There are certainly narrow network plans that limit you to a very specific group.

400
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:52,570
Doctors like Medicaid is a perfect example of that.

401
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,730
Yeah, there's some specific health outcomes that are pretty poor, like maternal mortality and cervical cancer are pretty bad.

402
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:05,830
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I got one behind me and then we'll come up here.

403
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:13,209
Oh, I know. She said, like, in some areas, preventative care is like a good thing about our health care.

404
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:22,210
But I think overall, like we're bad care specialty, like we usually treat like damaging things or like trying to expand that.

405
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:29,410
That's already happened. Like right now you're like a lot of people are under the influence of unhealthy in general

406
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,930
and they ended up treating like once a diabetic when they can like fix it before that.

407
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:41,130
Yeah. No, I absolutely I think I had an example I had a run in with this recently my aunt.

408
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,890
We have a long history of heart disease in my family. My father had to go on statins recently and he's just like, Why do I have to go on this?

409
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:51,340
It's like, Would you like me to go through with you?

410
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:58,000
Yeah, I think that certainly is the case. Yeah, I think another problem is just how inconsistent our healthcare is.

411
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,049
Like piggybacking on things like just because you have good insurance doesn't mean that you're going to get quality care.

412
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,990
And then even if you look at hospitals that are in the same area,

413
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:13,310
like in terms of quality or like patient outcomes, things of that nature, they're vastly different.

414
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:19,389
Yeah, we've been studying variation in care for almost two decades and there's not a really

415
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:22,930
great answer for it because it's so specific into a specific thing that we're looking at.

416
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:31,930
But yeah, absolutely the variance, the variability we see in the country is while I don't have anything, I can go on all the way back here.

417
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:40,689
I think there's like a culture of overtreatment in the US rather than like focusing on the value based care,

418
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:44,010
which is something that the article stated. Yeah.

419
00:42:44,410 --> 00:42:51,280
Overuse it. Yeah.

420
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:07,030
Okay. So we listed the problems. Um, so what I want to do now is, you know, identify these problems.

421
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:12,490
And what I would like to come up with is maybe three ways that we can, four ways we can figure out how these are all related.

422
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:18,340
So high cost fragmentation versus access and quality, some of the other things we talked about.

423
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:24,850
So these are not problems in isolation and these problems often contribute to each other.

424
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,460
So what I'd like to do is kind of find small groups around yourselves.

425
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,500
Talk for 5 minutes or so, someone can like jot down notes.

426
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:40,090
And what I'd like to do is just go through the groups and kind of figure out how we're how do these things interplay.

427
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:43,660
Because that's really these these problems are not in isolation.

428
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:48,010
They don't occur by themselves. It's not like high spending just happens because we do it.

429
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:52,180
They're a combination of these things. So we'll take a few minutes here.

430
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,740
Just kind of be groups together, someone write down and then we'll go through here.

431
00:43:58,390 --> 00:44:05,140
So I guess I had a succession.

432
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:16,430
I like. I felt like one of those things.

433
00:44:20,370 --> 00:44:23,730
I know. I know you're going to do things that I like to do it.

434
00:44:34,980 --> 00:45:02,830
I like other things, like areas like the more times, like international news.

435
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:09,390
Know, I think there's a line in the sand.

436
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:17,910
Really? Yeah.

437
00:45:18,810 --> 00:45:25,990
So I really like it.

438
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:36,900
I guess I was happy about that.

439
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:41,160
Yeah, that's all.

440
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:52,240
There is no way.

441
00:45:53,910 --> 00:46:13,970
So. Yeah, so I have my wife and I don't, I don't know how much longer all this.

442
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:26,920
Yeah, I, I'm sitting right there and so there's no doubt about it.

443
00:46:28,350 --> 00:46:34,640
That's what I was like.

444
00:46:35,370 --> 00:46:50,729
Oh, yeah. So what's your take on doctors?

445
00:46:50,730 --> 00:47:21,830
Are they want to stop? But I think a lot of times I also think that I think I'm only going to show one overall the first time.

446
00:47:34,200 --> 00:48:02,010
I don't think I think I suppose I want the money, isn't it?

447
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:35,700
I don't know how you can say that there aren't you know, like I was like, oh, my God, oh, my God.

448
00:48:38,560 --> 00:49:07,260
This day I think I have areas like every single us that I grew up listening to is one of those stuff like that, like.

449
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:45,660
They're lazy. Like, it's not like, you know, it's not that's not trying to cover the cardio hours away from other services that are there.

450
00:49:48,110 --> 00:50:24,230
It's hard to explain why they're like this for you guys when you say something like,

451
00:50:25,690 --> 00:51:27,320
I think it's a very high bar and it was a last minute, the first time I heard about something like something like that.

452
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,690
Like. But yeah.

453
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:55,850
But then I didn't really get involved in that kind of thing.

454
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:14,810
Yeah, I don't. I don't think so.

455
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:43,030
Yeah. So there might be something that I don't know.

456
00:52:44,160 --> 00:53:20,210
I mean, I think I just felt like I'd like something like, you know, I'm so glad that I'm doing all right.

457
00:53:21,590 --> 00:53:24,990
I don't. We start bringing our groups together.

458
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:33,200
Yeah, that's. What does it say?

459
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:37,640
All right, let's. Let's get back together here.

460
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:41,810
So we're going to we're going to go kind of around somebody that's going to be hanging up the microphone.

461
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:50,210
And then if one of you wants to volunteer to, it's maybe one of your best ideas and then line and we'll kind of try to get all.

462
00:53:52,430 --> 00:54:06,340
And so we discussed about how close to half the people that we can be.

463
00:54:06,350 --> 00:54:11,249
Do you test because it's like. Reliable and hard to study your X, Y, Z.

464
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:16,920
So that's just increasing us use overall for the entire for the duration,

465
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:23,790
for the short of the other thing I actually have here is information which is like

466
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:29,100
you have nursing care 30 days prior for discharge and then your benefit comes out.

467
00:54:29,460 --> 00:54:38,060
So then the miscues between physicians and patients do just get readmitted again to the E.R. there to again get, he said, the benefit of 30 days.

468
00:54:38,060 --> 00:54:46,740
So just knowing what you have and knowing what you don't have overall comes up with, you know, increasing costs for everyone around.

469
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:52,570
So that's what he does. That's great. But the next group on the other.

470
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:58,459
Moseley discusses the privatization of how we think.

471
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:03,300
It's kind of the core of the rest of those problems that are so centrally planned and signing about it.

472
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:10,070
Barriers to access because there's so many different types of insurance providers that creates barriers

473
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:15,810
to their access and that also leads to those inequalities that some people have access to care,

474
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:16,490
people don't.

475
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:26,690
And the costs, because there's so many administrative costs that have to do with system fragmentation in addition to just like trying to drive profit,

476
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,720
even in a not for profit, like you have to be sustainable. So.

477
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:36,650
So system fragmentation is the root of all evil. Yeah.

478
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,710
We have a quite. Well we'll come back around here.

479
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:51,320
Yes. But no we're talking about like of there's of if you have a better insurance, then maybe you can have a better treatment.

480
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:57,430
So it's like you won't miss your interest one time.

481
00:55:57,740 --> 00:56:03,530
Then if you miss them, maybe you have maybe a higher cost because of the years off your assets.

482
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:10,129
And in a group up here that wants to go next and then we'll come back.

483
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:18,620
Now we can talk about the lack of health education because you find the patient because a lot people don't have like that in and out of network,

484
00:56:18,830 --> 00:56:25,950
which can also be a barrier to access. Yeah. So it's a challenging system to navigate on here.

485
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:33,469
We kind of talk about the low value care cascades and how you can be investigating one thing with a patient and find a bunch of other

486
00:56:33,470 --> 00:56:40,730
things that kind of let you down a rabbit hole that spends a lot of money and also maybe capitalizing on the system fragmentation.

487
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:47,329
If you're bouncing the patient around with different departments and everybody's just constantly cracking up enough patient and nothing good.

488
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:48,800
Solve. Yeah, exactly.

489
00:56:51,740 --> 00:57:00,020
I guess talking about top of that and top ranking of costs because there's like different H.R. systems and billing systems that are,

490
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:04,219
you know, different across different hospitals that will add to technical costs.

491
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:09,290
And again, it's just increasing costs for everyone across the board.

492
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:21,910
I think we're going to piggyback on what a lot of people say. Just hitting on regulation, I think is the root of all evil.

493
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:28,700
There are a lot of disease states and health conditions where there are overlapping conditions.

494
00:57:28,750 --> 00:57:30,970
Women's health is the one that comes to mind for me.

495
00:57:31,790 --> 00:57:39,520
So there are things like endocrine function and breast cancer surgery and fertility and obesity that are all related.

496
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:45,820
And so a woman may go to one person to address her breast cancer and go to an endocrinologist.

497
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:49,460
And in OB-GYN and other places, they repeat a lot of tests.

498
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:54,630
There's not a lot of integration, and they get confusing and conflicting advice.

499
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,049
Whereas I think you had integrated centers related to these disease states and conditions where

500
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:04,200
there are a lot of interrelated things that kind of transcend traditional medical specialties.

501
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:08,650
You can get a lot of cost efficiency and improve health, etc.

502
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:18,549
I have talked a lot about various to care access and then having to maybe go to the E.R. to receive care,

503
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:24,250
which then leads to the higher costs for the patients, which ultimately leads into inequalities.

504
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:33,040
We also talked about how we, while some of us were in a group and looked at having to get MRI's done and

505
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:37,719
the system fragmentation with having to maybe get an MRI done at one place,

506
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:45,280
but you have to get it redone and retested like maybe through Michigan medicine just because they want it done within their health care system.

507
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:49,860
And that, again, leads to high costs and back to the inequalities. So it's a never ending cycle.

508
00:58:49,870 --> 00:58:57,220
And certainly I've seen that are too many times where people get referred, especially when it's referral to a larger center.

509
00:58:57,760 --> 00:59:01,210
Oftentimes people are like, oh, this isn't good enough. I need to have my own.

510
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:12,650
Yeah, absolutely. I know that drives people crazy. You talk a lot about any in this group.

511
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:21,540
So we came to the conclusion that it kind of like was what started everything, and that began when we started tying insurance and finance.

512
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:28,379
So that kind of created like this system of inequality where if you were unemployed, you couldn't get health insurance and it just snowballed.

513
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,950
And so like barriers to care access, which led to system fragmentation,

514
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:35,969
which led to high costs, and then that kind of feeds in and exacerbates everything.

515
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:43,080
That's absolutely. Yeah. So so one one group is saying, which I enjoy, which is that system fragmentation is not the root of all evil.

516
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:46,890
It's actually the result of. So yes.

517
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:52,410
So I had the words stolen out of my mouth at the time.

518
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:59,549
Health insurance to two jobs. I was going to say it was kind of a barrier to access for those obviously who don't who are unemployed

519
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:03,330
or don't have access to good of health insurance plans to get employment and things like that.

520
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:09,450
And that leads to a lot of antibodies. And I'm also going to mention system fragmentation, both internal and external,

521
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:12,740
to health care systems like your switching health care system when you're trying to get care.

522
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:19,540
Huge barrier to access and even internal. And I remember going to a cardiology appointment once and talking to a friend that's person.

523
01:00:19,710 --> 01:00:23,550
Like we got an appointment and then I talked to the next front desk person.

524
01:00:23,550 --> 01:00:28,080
They're like, Oh yeah, we got you. How does this work?

525
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:30,030
So anyways, yeah, this.

526
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:43,040
So we were saying that people who do not have insurance have a more difficult time attaining care, especially in a timely manner.

527
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:48,420
So if they have a pressing issue or a condition that their life expectancy could be compromised.

528
01:00:48,420 --> 01:01:01,380
And so that's an example of a social inequality where we talk mostly about fragmentation and about how

529
01:01:01,950 --> 01:01:08,490
the reason why we have great wait times and quick access to care is because we have fragmentation.

530
01:01:08,850 --> 01:01:14,489
So finding that balance between making sure that we have this efficient system,

531
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:20,400
but also keeping the costs low so that we can address inequalities, is going to be extremely difficult.

532
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:28,229
But because of that efficiency, because it takes away some of that burden off of each health care work that we're already dealing with right now,

533
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:33,740
we don't add more to it because of all of that we end up running into like.

534
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:41,960
Sorry. Not. Fragmentation.

535
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:46,390
That's great. Yeah.

536
01:01:46,410 --> 01:01:53,580
So, I mean, I think the lesson here is you can pick one of these and point to a subsequent issue in the other.

537
01:01:54,120 --> 01:02:02,670
So I'm sure if we started with high costs, you could weave a story that would go from high cost to system fragmentation to barriers to inequalities.

538
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:10,280
You could you could work example of how inequalities contributes to fragmentation, which at increased costs, which reduces access.

539
01:02:10,290 --> 01:02:17,759
So I think, you know, ultimately these things, you know, there is no single starting point for all of this.

540
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:23,790
And I think, you know, there are certainly things as we go into it, you know, you can look at the history and say,

541
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:27,299
you know, there are certain things that contributed to the cascading issues that we see today.

542
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:32,670
And the decisions that were made like employment and tie insurance and employment leads to all these kind of other issues.

543
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:39,149
And, you know, there are probably decision points earlier which we'll try to get into about how decisions there affect,

544
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,290
you know, kind of how we are here.

545
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:47,040
But I think, you know, I think the exercise is that, you know, it's it's kind of like, you know, trying to hold on to jello.

546
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,849
It just no matter where you squeeze it, it's going to go somewhere else. There's always going to be a problem somewhere else.

547
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:54,210
But that ultimately this that these are all interrelated issues.

548
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:59,820
And you can it's hard to pinpoint one problem, which is kind of the consumer here.

549
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:05,970
The health care is not solving it and figuring it out. And, you know, if we spend a lot of time trying to deal with fragmentation,

550
01:03:06,510 --> 01:03:12,959
we may be missing out on other opportunities to improve here or other ways or by addressing certain issues of fragmentation,

551
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:16,290
we may be addressing issues of error, we may be addressing issues of inequality.

552
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:21,440
And so and I think hopefully that that that JAMA paper showed that, like,

553
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:26,850
there's not one single cause to make changes in life expectancy, that this may account for some of those,

554
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:31,919
you know, opioids or or, you know, rising suicide rates may account for some of those,

555
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:35,700
but there is not one single magic bullet that will help us to figure this out.

556
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,820
So these are these are kind of interrelated issues.

557
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:49,830
So the next lecture, we're going to talk a little bit about how we can kind of specifically evaluate quality within specific domains of health care.

558
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:56,010
When you say how do you measure quality, it's kind of a complicated question because it's what specifically are you trying to measure?

559
01:03:56,010 --> 01:04:00,360
I mean, it's a really hard thing to kind of, again, like this. How do you figure out the problems with health care?

560
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:03,780
How do you measure quality effectively? Know what domains can we do it?

561
01:04:04,410 --> 01:04:13,050
That's what we're going to focus on in the next lecture. Are there any remaining kind of comments or thoughts related to what we talked about today?

562
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:22,980
Yeah. Can you speak to what it was like or health care was tied to your employment status?

563
01:04:24,330 --> 01:04:30,330
Yeah. So what was what how was health care before it was tied to employment or private insurance?

564
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:38,700
So. I'm not a medical historian, but I think we'll talk a little bit about the kind of trajectory when we talk about payment systems,

565
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:45,960
we'll get into a little bit of that. You know, we go further, you go back, it's more I pay the doctor with money and the doctor helps me.

566
01:04:46,770 --> 01:04:55,270
Then as we got into things like Medicare and creating those systems for the elderly, that's kind of where it didn't work out.

567
01:04:55,350 --> 01:05:02,370
Comprehensive system. If you look at like the United Kingdom, they went to a single payer universal health care system after World War Two.

568
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:08,220
And so it where all the health care employees are employees of the state, essentially.

569
01:05:08,610 --> 01:05:16,440
So there's a lot of ways to answer that. But I think it essentially went from a kind of very individual doctor relationship to now.

570
01:05:19,940 --> 01:05:23,360
Any other questions? Comments, thoughts, observations.

571
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:35,990
So Thursday grade planning assignment due by the end of the day to come will be a Culture Survey Hour.

572
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,740
Hopefully, we'll have that completed by the end of the week. Some more information on Tuesday.

573
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:45,230
Any other questions about the class in general? You were having issues with candidates.

574
01:05:45,230 --> 01:05:50,660
My apologies to those that were trying to access it. I am newbie to it, so I'm very much remembered for it.

575
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:55,819
So if you find that things are not on campus, that should be the as would be.

576
01:05:55,820 --> 01:06:02,479
I probably move somewhere so much longer.

577
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:34,400
30 minutes. I said to him, But you want to see the blood?
