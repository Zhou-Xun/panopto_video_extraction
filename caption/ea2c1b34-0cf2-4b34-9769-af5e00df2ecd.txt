1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,960
It's inevitable. All right. Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:08,840
Re-imagining A Beautiful Mind is really the hot.

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:14,550
Welcome back. I'm excited. We have our first meeting today.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:22,410
Just a really quick heads up here at the top. Thanks to both groups for sharing your debate slides.

5
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,370
They are up here as a separate browser window.

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,350
So when you come up, just click on whichever one is yours and you will be all set and ready to go.

7
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,340
But before we get to that, we do have a short lecture planned for today.

8
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:48,720
And I will be absolutely mindful of time so that I can get the material as quickly as possible so that we leave as much time as we can for the debate.

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,470
All right. Really quick announcement. With apologies for how long it took, I finally finished grading the proposals yesterday.

10
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:00,750
We posted the scores to canvas last evening.

11
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:04,160
Hopefully you can see those. Please let me know if you can.

12
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,790
You can't. Overall, I know folks are interested in like a mean score.

13
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:17,310
The main score on the proposal was a 93. So overall, I was really happy with all the work that everyone did a great job.

14
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,600
If you have questions or would like to chat more about your own proposal, please just reach out to me.

15
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,210
If you grab me after class or send me an email, I'd be happy to meet and discuss any aspects of it.

16
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:39,270
All right, so let's get going on our topic for today. And again, I think I mentioned as class was ending last week.

17
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:46,080
The last couple of topics are ones that are important but don't easily fit into kind of that exposure science framework.

18
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:53,320
These aspects of climate change and impact of today.

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:59,860
It's focusing on indoor air quality, quite a bit about outdoor air pollution and its impact on health.

20
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:08,319
You have a short lecture on indoor air quality and really a lot of it focused on on residential kind of

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:16,590
an emerging really big challenge with with terrible impacts on health that we're managing presently.

22
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:27,970
All right. So in terms of our objectives, talk a little bit about the history of indoor air quality and what some of those primary contributors are.

23
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:36,790
We'll start talking about kind of like office settings, some more workplace oriented, and then shift into more residential settings.

24
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,020
What are some of the common sources of that pollution?

25
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:49,050
And then appreciate some of these more recently quantified trends and threats to health on a global scale,

26
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:58,450
much of it coming back to, you know, getting back to fossil fuels and the use of solid fuels in indoor confined spaces.

27
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:04,210
All right. So with that, let's start with a little bit of that history.

28
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,170
This is going back to the 1780s.

29
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:12,310
Benjamin Franklin, I'm going to go ahead and just read the quote here.

30
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,229
I considered fresh air an enemy and closed with extreme care.

31
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:23,500
Every crevice and race I inhabited experience has convinced me of my error and persuaded that

32
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:29,660
no common air from without is so unwholesome as the air within a closed room that has been

33
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:36,879
breathed in not changes you physicians have of late discovered after a contrary opinion had prevailed

34
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:43,420
some ages that a fresh and cool air does good to persons in the smallpox and other fevers.

35
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:51,010
It is to be hoped that in another century or two we may find out that it is not even for people in health.

36
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:58,930
I think he might have been on to something. Right. So kudos to Mr. Franklin for that observation.

37
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:04,060
And I wouldn't it be cool if people still wrote that way like that is so fine.

38
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,350
I actually read it word for word. I don't know.

39
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:15,790
It's so different, right? It's not that long ago, relatively speaking, but it's kind of a different time in history.

40
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,420
But yeah, so this is not something that we've, you know, certainly with the pandemic, right?

41
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:27,650
These issues have come to the forefront. We talked quite a bit in the class about, you know,

42
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:37,180
ventilation and its role both in workplace settings as well as in our classroom and certainly within residential spaces as well.

43
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:48,610
Fast forward about 100 years or so. Uh, this is, this is a perfect time to talk about it right after the big game that just happened on Saturday,

44
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:55,330
we can focus in on the errors of Columbus, Ohio, going back in history.

45
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:09,550
Around 1876, there was a term, uh, called State House Malaria that had been coined at the Ohio the state of Ohio State Capitol Building.

46
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:16,509
And it was the earliest case of something that we now call building related illness.

47
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:24,219
So people that actually spent time working in this building or otherwise were developing these these really bad symptoms and illness.

48
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,350
And it was very easily, uh, associated with the time spent in the building.

49
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,900
And it's, you can follow the, the link here, the really nice history if you're interested in reading it,

50
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:41,290
uh, for the gist of the story goes is that, uh, I can remember my history.

51
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:50,620
There was only I think one restroom at the time. And so they decided to build separate restrooms for men and women.

52
00:05:51,250 --> 00:06:01,270
And as part of an overall renovation, uh, after the renovation was done was when all of these building related illnesses became quite apparent.

53
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:13,300
And it turns out after some investigating is that when they did the expansion, somehow, uh, the waste ducts got tied into the ventilation ducts.

54
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:22,840
Don't ask me how that happens, but yeah, so all of the waste from the restrooms was going into the ventilation ducts of the building.

55
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,040
So obviously. Right. This is what people are breathing, uh, or all of their time spent in that building.

56
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:37,270
It's being distributed purposely through ventilation. And yeah, that the story goes that they did a 50 or 100 things,

57
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:45,489
150 barrels of just solid waste that was hauled out of the ventilation system that had built up over this area.

58
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:49,809
The good news is that they finally realized. That's what the problem was and fixed it.

59
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:56,200
But, you know, large scale building, lots of pretty high profile people that work there, you know,

60
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:03,009
experiencing these these well-documented illnesses related to their time spent in the building and

61
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:11,380
eventually figured it out fast forwarding another 100 years ago or so is brings us to the 1960s.

62
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:19,300
And so this was when radon actually became to be understood and recognized.

63
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:26,310
It was an issue or continues to be an issue because it's not seen or smelled right.

64
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:31,270
So you don't really detect levels of radon with your senses within an indoor space.

65
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:40,270
Wasn't really perceived as a problem because of that. But as we kind of touched on in class through kind of the physical hazards characterization,

66
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:49,660
it remains a major environmental exposure risk in the 1970s with a lot of the new materials used for construction,

67
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:56,320
primarily formaldehyde, that came into play for insulation, resins, binders.

68
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:59,860
A lot of that particle board that you see, right, it's not real wood.

69
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:05,710
It's some sort of manufactured material, high levels of formaldehyde in it.

70
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:17,770
Uh, combined with we'll talk about low ventilation rates at the time and why led to a lot of irritation in people within these indoor settings.

71
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,880
On the positive side, it did leave museum industry standards and some opportunities for restricted use.

72
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:31,300
Uh, as we went into the 1980s, we began to learn more about sick building syndrome,

73
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:37,270
building related symptoms that people would experience and could pretty easily tie

74
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:42,669
or associate with their time spent in these specific indoor spaces leading to,

75
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:50,920
you know, all different types of symptoms, or importantly those being acute and again associated with occupancy in the space.

76
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:58,329
Moving into the from the eighties into the nineties, molds became to be very much more recognized uh,

77
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:06,250
and within indoor spaces as an indoor air quality issue and associated with a variety of symptoms and disease.

78
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:16,030
Recounting that timeline a little bit, but putting into the context of energy trends in the 1960s, everything was good.

79
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,260
There was all this new technology coming on, ways to heat and cool.

80
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:24,580
Uh, prices were low and the cost of energy was low.

81
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:28,060
There was a lot of economic expansion occurring.

82
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:40,540
And so there were the expansive HPC systems and offices in apartments, really high ventilation rates, uh, because the cost was relatively low.

83
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,310
There was a bit of an energy crisis as we went into the 1970s.

84
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:55,569
Suddenly the cost of energy went up a lot. So there was a huge amount of focus on, uh, reducing those costs and becoming more energy efficient, right?

85
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:01,600
So a lot more insulation was put into place, uh, for like wintertime heating,

86
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:11,080
maybe lowering temperature on thermostats or that indoor temperature lowering the ventilation rate because the more fresh air you bring in,

87
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:16,780
the more energy it takes to to warm it up in the winter or cool off in the summer.

88
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:24,130
And so a lot more of that internal air was just being recirculated and instead of bringing in fresh air.

89
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:30,310
This also played a role in the levels of pollutants within that indoor space.

90
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:39,060
And then moving into the 1980s. Uh, no, we're talking about indoor air quality, but there was also a, the,

91
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:46,899
the country of the Western world had experienced a pretty strong movement in environmentalism in general, right?

92
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:51,160
So things like acid rain, the stratospheric ozone depletion,

93
00:10:52,150 --> 00:11:02,110
global warming had actually wasn't officially on the radar at that point and leading to additional efforts on energy conservation,

94
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,839
but that that in general awareness, uh, shifted into the indoor environment as well.

95
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:15,550
So people became aware of environmental tobacco, smoke, secondhand exposures, radon got more attention.

96
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,870
Asbestos, uh, which was used everywhere as part of any type of renovation or disturbance,

97
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:30,400
was an issue for sick building syndrome and mold and so forth, really started to be addressed in that time frame.

98
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,650
So, you know, when we talk about indoor air pollutants, what's their significance?

99
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:41,570
And a lot of it here, it's useful to compare it or in the context of outdoor air, right.

100
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:46,929
We've talked about outdoor air quality quite a bit in this class, but a lot of statistics to it.

101
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,120
Right. We looked. That global burden of disease.

102
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:58,360
It's 4 million premature deaths, right, each year that are associated with exposure to pollutants in the outdoor environment.

103
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,340
The indoor basically matches that. And it's something that's been realized much more recently.

104
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,830
You know, over the last decade, we've really been able to begin to characterize those numbers.

105
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:21,670
So it's an important things just because of ventilation or the lack of opportunity for it compared to the outdoor environment.

106
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:29,280
Many pollutants greatly exceed the levels that exist in outdoor environments compared to indoors, right?

107
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:36,670
So things like same types of pollutants, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, a lot of these volatile organic compounds.

108
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:43,540
Bio aerosols, of course, as the site of our health tobacco smoke combined with our,

109
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:50,180
our time activity, our behavior, uh, we spend the bulk of our time with the indoor environments.

110
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:58,750
So the combination of higher levels of pollutants in general within indoor spaces combined with that's where we're spending most of our time.

111
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:04,300
It's not a surprise that it is such a an exposure issue and a threat to health.

112
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,830
And then as we, you know,

113
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:16,350
just kind of started to convene on increased pollution levels over the last several decades due to these energy conservation measures.

114
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:23,110
Right. Energy is no longer cheap. We don't keep the windows open while we have the heat on or the air conditioning on.

115
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:32,320
Right. We don't have that fresh air introduction and we have much more recirculated air through ventilation systems.

116
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,270
And then we've had some emerging. Right. Has been kind of touched on in this class earlier this semester,

117
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:44,530
some emerging pollutants, more of these synthetic materials also aimed at efficiencies.

118
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:53,440
But the flame retardants that we talked about earlier in terms of a chemical characterization there in so many consumer products.

119
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,380
Right. And are distributed widely.

120
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:04,330
And this is part of our in our indoor space now, electronic materials, building materials, home furnishings and so forth.

121
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:12,330
Putting some numbers to this and beginning to shift from, you know,

122
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:22,370
talking about kind of office spaces or public buildings or even public residential buildings to specifically residences in individual households.

123
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:29,990
And shifting with a focus from maybe high income countries over time to low and middle income countries.

124
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:34,190
So we've got about 3 billion people.

125
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,720
Right. So I think we Google this at some point earlier in the semester and there are 8 billion people.

126
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:48,740
Right. Roughly in terms of the Earth's population. So 3 billion out of a billion still cook and heat their homes using solid fuels.

127
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:57,290
So solid fuels meaning wood, crop waste, charcoal dung and in open fires.

128
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:04,730
Right. Importantly, and even if they're contained, they're usually in some sort of, you know, leaky stove.

129
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:13,879
And these inefficient fuels and technologies result in really high levels of pollution within indoor environments,

130
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,730
in very close proximity, confined spaces.

131
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:24,320
And there's a number of pollutants, and they end up being the same ones that we're concerned about in the outdoor environment.

132
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,639
Right. We talk about, you know, fossil fuel combustion, high temperature processes,

133
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,050
creating all the particles that are responsible for probably three quarters

134
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:38,120
of those premature deaths or outdoor air pollution within the indoor space.

135
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,100
It's the same culprits that we're we're worried about. PPM is one of the biggest drivers.

136
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:53,600
So it's smoke that's generated from the burning of these fossil solid fuels combined with poor ventilation and so forth, went within confined spaces.

137
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,640
So more numbers.

138
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:05,330
This is kind of just, you know, geographically looking at a percentage of the population using solid fuels within indoor environments.

139
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:11,719
Right. So starting with maybe up here in the US, we are at less than 5%.

140
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:17,840
And then contrast that with countries and maybe Central Africa where it's, you know, greater than 95%.

141
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:26,060
Right. So a really high percentage. And sub-Saharan Africa and then also Southeast Asia.

142
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:35,459
With regards to exposure. Right. We have. Just like we have concerns in the outdoor environment.

143
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:42,450
For what? Who are the vulnerable populations? Some populations within this setting,

144
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:49,439
it's women and young children that are the most vulnerable because they're the ones that end up

145
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,590
spending the most time within the close proximity of that solid fuel combustion right within the home.

146
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:03,780
So near the domestic hearth, the woman generally being the one doing the cooking, but also as part of child rearing.

147
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:09,420
Right. Kind of like in the photo here, young children are often nearby as well.

148
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:23,030
So, uh, I should have had this back to back. So just, you know, take a mental picture here of subsaharan Africa and maybe into South Asia,

149
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:30,380
have solid fuel use and then overlay that with disability adjusted life years,

150
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:38,450
which is a measure of impact on how these dailies, which is easier to say than the entire mouthful,

151
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,870
are specifically attributed to household air pollution.

152
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:52,450
And again, you know, not by coincidence, you see the highest adverse impact in sub-Saharan Africa and moving into South Asia.

153
00:17:54,580 --> 00:18:02,240
If the little brat thought that he'd be in the Caribbean, I don't think I can see it very well on my screen, but probably.

154
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,500
It's just interesting, given that that island is just literally divided in one.

155
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:13,930
Yeah, no, you're right. A great case study, and I think it is right.

156
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:19,440
Or at least orange. Yeah.

157
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:28,239
So getting back to the numbers, uh, the current estimates are that it's equivalent to outdoor air pollution in terms of its impact on health,

158
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,010
in terms of the impact on mortality.

159
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:41,200
About 4 million people die prematurely each year due to illnesses that are attributed to exposure to air pollutants within the indoor environment.

160
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,510
And again, almost all of it is driven by this use of solid fuels within residential spaces.

161
00:18:50,260 --> 00:19:00,730
Just to give an impact of how this is distributed across disease, how about 12% are due to pneumonia as a result of the pollution exposure.

162
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:12,010
34% from stroke, 26% from heart disease, 42% from COPD, and a smaller about 6% attributed to lung.

163
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:21,919
Uh, yeah, we started to talk about, you know, most vulnerable women, pregnant women, young children, and then, you know,

164
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,380
like pretty much all environmental exposures,

165
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:31,280
anyone who's immunosuppressed or is living with some sort of chronic especially respiratory disease, right.

166
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,150
In this case, because we're concerned about inhalation is the route of exposure.

167
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,000
And then, you know, at the end of that life stage, elderly folks as well for children.

168
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:50,870
Uh, couple of statistics here. Over half of all deaths from acute lower respiratory infections is attributed to PPM

169
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:56,840
particulate matter that's inhaled as a result of these solid fuel cooking emissions.

170
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:02,060
Asthma is absolutely exacerbated due to these exposures.

171
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,610
And we just went through this, these diseases associated in adults.

172
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:19,550
There are also a lot of studies associating low birth weight in infants, as well as stillbirths in relation to this indoor exposure as well.

173
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:30,170
So going from, you know, just the residential space itself and looking slightly broader,

174
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:35,840
taking a step out, there's actually X aspects of this that impact communities.

175
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:44,600
So we've got emissions from that solid fuel use combustion that are in the home, but they're not very well contained.

176
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:52,430
So this actually makes sense, right? If you're indoors and you have this close proximity source emission, you want to ventilate.

177
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:59,090
Okay. So you have windows open and you're trying to move it out of the indoor space.

178
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,460
Well, uh, it can actually reenter the house, uh, or it can affect nearby, uh, neighbors.

179
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:14,900
So, you know, collectively as a community and there's some, you know, some images here to help kind of illustrate this concept.

180
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:22,500
Emissions from households can make an important contribution to that very localized outdoor pollution exposure.

181
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:26,780
Right. So you're in the indoor environment, you say, hey, I got to get out here to get some fresh air.

182
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:34,040
And, you know, you exit the home and the air is perhaps slightly improved, but but not to a huge extent,

183
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:38,860
because you have all these localized emissions from all of the homes that are just

184
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:45,500
simply increasing the immediate outdoor air concentration within the local community,

185
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:55,130
some indirect but but related impacts, again, specifically vulnerabilities for women and children.

186
00:21:55,700 --> 00:22:01,760
So the solid fuel that's used is primarily collected by women.

187
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:06,380
It can take a lot of time to collect this fuel.

188
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:13,400
And as part of that exposes them to other dangers unrelated to air pollution exposure,

189
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:20,030
such as sexual violence in terms of older children, it might be helping in this process.

190
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:24,560
You know, it's taking away from their time spent on schooling and so forth.

191
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:36,270
Some summary points here. And this is probably goes without saying, but no time frames.

192
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:44,819
We we looked at those old videos right earlier in the semester about, uh, your quality in Los Angeles, Southern California.

193
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,940
Right back in the 1950s, we've understood that air quality in the outdoor environment is unhealthy.

194
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:56,250
We've studied it on, you know, we've known about it for 50 years.

195
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:05,610
Uh, the indoor environment has received much less focus and it's only much more recently, especially in the low and middle income country setting.

196
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,090
How big of an impact it is, both in terms of impact on morbidity and mortality.

197
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:17,519
You know, some statements here without substantial change in policy that the number of people

198
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:22,620
relying on solid fuels isn't going to change a whole lot in the coming decades.

199
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:31,439
Uh, in addition to that, the use of these polluting fuels also imposes a major burden on sustainable development.

200
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:40,019
Right? We just finished talking about climate change and impacts on how you take 3 billion people using these solid fuels, burning them every day.

201
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:48,899
Right, for heating, for cooking and so forth. And this is just contributing to those, those global emissions, uh, and the rest of it.

202
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,360
Yeah. Oh, actually want maybe one point down here to make on the, at the bottom, uh,

203
00:23:53,400 --> 00:24:00,990
the lack of access to widespread kind of modern sources of electricity for at least a billion people.

204
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:08,850
Still, many of whom use things like kerosene lamps for lighting, creates other health risks.

205
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,459
So. So burns injuries, uh, poisonings from fuel ingestion.

206
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:23,640
This is a problem in children. The sources of the fuel, like something like kerosene, are often not stored in a clearly marked bottle.

207
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:29,190
This label of kerosene, right, is just kind of whatever was easy to grab and to use that to fill.

208
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,970
And so, uh, accidental ingestion of it.

209
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:42,450
Uh, so kind of again indirect, but it's still significant and related impacts on health.

210
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,050
Um, time. Okay, uh, let's shift a little bit,

211
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:57,570
but still staying on the topic of solid fuel use from lower income setting to high income countries, is that a problem?

212
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:06,540
So as you might know, there are a lot of, you know, kind of rural, more rural oriented mountain, you know,

213
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:16,710
northern climate communities that experience cold winters and used wood as a primary source of heating or at least a secondary source of heating.

214
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:27,239
And it's you know, it's not uncommon for there to be older and poorer quality stoves that continue to be used.

215
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,230
Right, especially in low income setting. Hey, the wood burns just fine.

216
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:42,870
Uh, warms the home just fine. We don't have money to buy a new stove, so that old leaky stove might continue to be used and emit pollutants,

217
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:45,960
you know, within that near field environment inside the home.

218
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:52,370
Even where we have, you know, more modern wood burning stoves.

219
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:56,270
Right. That that are tightly sealed aren't leaky.

220
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:03,650
The emissions make their way up the chimney. You know, now we're back to contributing to the ambient air pollution.

221
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:08,900
Right. Wood being burned and very large amounts collectively.

222
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:19,400
And this is also continues to be common because people that live in a rural environment that have would be a level of a resource nearby,

223
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:29,720
it can be much more cost effective as a means of heating compared to increased fuel costs of other fossil fuel sources.

224
00:26:32,670 --> 00:26:41,729
And then even within within, you know, high income countries, this is also a problem contributing to more community wide pollution.

225
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:46,320
Right. So solid fuel woodstoves vented to the outside.

226
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:56,700
In addition to just reentering the home, they can result in, you know, more widespread outdoor air quality concentrations within communities.

227
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,760
And then especially. Right, this image here is kind of getting us back to those topographical considerations.

228
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,460
We've got a community living in a valley.

229
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,919
If we have a temperature inversion in place.

230
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:17,340
Right, we can have that that vertical effective cap on mixing and keeps those emissions that are emitted very at a very low altitude.

231
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:23,730
Right, right at the surface and keep them low again where all the people are allowing concentrations to increase.

232
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,210
I didn't actually I showed this slide, you know, a couple of weeks back. It wasn't totally by chance, actually.

233
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,249
It ties into this lecture.

234
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:39,930
So this is that image we looked at of Salt Lake City, right during a temperature inversion where all of the emissions within the city,

235
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:46,080
which is, you know, down below here in the valley, are being trapped by this inversion layer.

236
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:51,690
Uh, and it turns out that this is, this is an ongoing issue, right?

237
00:27:51,690 --> 00:28:01,080
So with the Clean Air Act and meeting air quality standards, it's upon the city to come up with a plan.

238
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:06,630
The air quality standards aren't being met. So the state of Utah.

239
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:12,270
Right, who is responsible for the air quality in Salt Lake City, are coming out with a plan to improve.

240
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:19,320
The air quality has for several years now. It recognizes the very large contribution that wood burning,

241
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:28,260
that residential wood burning makes to that local air quality concentration and the outdoors environment and has considered bands.

242
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:33,480
Right. And if you're going to make an impact when you have the ban, you have the ban in the winter, right?

243
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:39,510
When there's the demand for wood burning, for heating. So as you can imagine, very controversial.

244
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,120
And this is also an interesting one to to share.

245
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:54,060
You know, locally speaking, here we are in Michigan, but in terms of wood stove emissions from residential wood burning,

246
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,850
Michigan is actually very highly rated in terms of the total emissions.

247
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:05,730
And then even per capita is one of the top states for wood burning.

248
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:12,070
All right. And I think I've actually made it in pretty good time.

249
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:20,620
Here's a summary. We've got about 3 billion people that still rely on solid fuels within their homes on a global basis.

250
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:27,340
Well, 4 million premature deaths each year attributed to increased pollution,

251
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:35,380
which is roughly equivalent to the 4 million and follow from outdoor air quality exposures.

252
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:40,740
About half of premature deaths among children under five are due to pneumonia

253
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:47,170
caused by inhalation of the PM particulate matter within household air pollution.

254
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:52,990
And then yes, across the disease spectrum stroke, ischemic heart disease,

255
00:29:52,990 --> 00:30:00,220
COPD and lung cancer being the primary diseases where these deaths are manifesting.

256
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:07,810
I think I'm asking and right now, are there any questions or comments?

257
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:15,760
Yes, this is more of a comment. When you were talking about sick building syndrome, I thought about like hauntings and spooky ghost stuff.

258
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,159
And I actually found a paper that went through like all of this literature and found

259
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:26,940
that air quality is one of the things that is likely suggested to be an explanation of,

260
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:32,170
like, ghost stories and hauntings. Very cool.

261
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:36,030
Unrelated. But I thought it was. Would you mind sharing that with me?

262
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:39,820
Send me like a link over email or something. Yeah, I would. I'll post there for the clock.

263
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,920
We're a couple weeks behind from Halloween. That would have been totally appropriate.

264
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:51,190
But nonetheless, thank you for sharing that and the other questions or comments you.

265
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:07,600
I think the other day I heard someone talking about how we proposed these like really huge,

266
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:14,950
like international, like multi-country changes or policies to address climate change.

267
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:24,970
They don't often come to fruition because they're like really large plans and if one thing fosters and the whole thing falls through.

268
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,670
But the indoor air pollution in low income countries,

269
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:41,560
like if you were to give all of these people access to modern energy sources and they didn't have to burn solid fuel inside their homes,

270
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:51,160
not only would you be saving millions of lives, like for billions of lives like children, and you'd be reducing.

271
00:31:54,040 --> 00:32:02,920
More bit more in me as well. But also, like you would solve a lot of the a big chunk of the climate change issue.

272
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:09,160
Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I know. Thank you. Thank you for making that point.

273
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:16,270
As I was rushing to finish the last lecture on climate change and health, that was one of the points that I didn't get to make,

274
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:25,060
which was back to that slide that had like all of those major air quality issues and they kind of all tied to fossil fuel emissions.

275
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:28,630
Yeah. In terms of co-benefits of policy. Right.

276
00:32:29,170 --> 00:32:38,440
If you are within a policy forum aimed at solving climate change, if you're in a policy forum aimed at solving outdoor air pollution exposures,

277
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:44,200
if you're in a policy forum aimed at reducing mercury exposures in fish.

278
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:50,610
A single policy that aimed at drastically reducing fossil fuel emissions.

279
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:56,940
Addresses all of those right. Which are generally viewed as kind of independent threats to help.

280
00:32:57,930 --> 00:33:02,700
But they have a common, you know, single source. So with the policy, there are major programs.

281
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,740
Thank you so much, Kitty. Yeah, I think the one thing I would add to that, though,

282
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:15,149
is that a lot of those lower middle income countries are saying we need to increase use of fossil fuels

283
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:21,510
in order to prevent things like biomass burning and increase indoor air quality and reduce deaths.

284
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:29,370
And that's a big argument on the international climate negotiation scale of why

285
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:33,560
they should act to reduce emissions while the US should be reducing emissions.

286
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:45,180
And so. And yeah, that gets to a whole thing about equity and historical emissions versus what's happening now.

287
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:54,210
But there are a lot of programs though that are trying to bring like solar panels to or light and small scale,

288
00:33:54,420 --> 00:34:00,720
like trying to figure out how to do like small scale, really cheap renewable energies to solve some of those issues.

289
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:07,650
And I somebody from Europe and my parents actually coming down to Guatemala to

290
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:14,430
do a solar panel installation and small solar panel lights for people's houses.

291
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:22,290
Yeah, very cool thing. But you have to like increase the use of renewable energy for sure.

292
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:33,690
And to your first point, that was also another one I got. I wasn't able to kind of wrap up at the end the slide where we looked at that energy ladder.

293
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:43,030
Right. And that with socioeconomic development, you kind of regions, countries go through those stages.

294
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:50,309
Right. So solid fuels is down at the bottom and it's still getting to, you know, to widespread electricity.

295
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:55,950
Access still is going through. Right. Widespread fossil fuel use, natural gas, coal.

296
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:04,290
And it's not until that development is very far along that economically, at least historically,

297
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:11,840
that the options for nuclear and then into renewables becomes, you know, becomes apparent.

298
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:22,950
And so, yeah, so the point that Kate made is a really big one where the last class we had the plot to look at greenhouse gas emissions by country.

299
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,000
Right. That's kind of like present day. What was it?

300
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:33,840
Going back 50, 60, 70 years ago when what is now what we consider to be high income developed countries,

301
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,520
we're moving along that that socioeconomic development, that energy ladder.

302
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:41,370
And so the bigger question is,

303
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:51,100
why shouldn't countries that are currently lower middle income are not allowed to develop and follow that same ladder that that other countries?

304
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,810
It's a lot of equity issues.

305
00:35:53,970 --> 00:36:01,440
The other thing is that we're not sharing our technology with because of patents and they could skip that energy ladder and go

306
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:10,920
straight to renewables if we actually shared technology instead of making them buy them from us or at least speed up the process.

307
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:18,930
Right. Yeah, it's your point. I will say, though, excuse me, I took an energy justice class last year.

308
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:24,000
And unfortunately, in a lot of countries in the Global South,

309
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:31,050
even when we do bring the technology or give them an opportunity to use like just regular electricity or gas,

310
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:36,060
a lot of people just aren't willing to use them because it's you know,

311
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:39,629
you've been ingrained in that this is how you cook and this is your culture for so long.

312
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:45,000
And it's hard to make that transition. So even when it is available, people still are using them.

313
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:53,250
So there are so many very understandable and very justified challenges to it, one being simply cultural acceptance.

314
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,690
Right? This is what we've done. Trusting, right.

315
00:36:56,970 --> 00:37:05,820
Who is it that's coming into the community in the first place? So many issues that end up preventing it being an easy solution.

316
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:11,430
All right. I'm really mindful of our time. I expect our debate groups are ready to get at it.

317
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,710
So I'm going to go ahead and retire my cell phone quickly here.

318
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:28,020
Pretend like a word group or the pro group to come up and forward is your.

319
00:37:51,120 --> 00:38:03,110
The ultimate. Yeah.

320
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:13,550
You guys are ready. All right. Maybe this good lunch here.

321
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:17,710
I just mean. All right. Good morning, everybody.

322
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:26,110
We are a group one. We're here to tell you all about urban farming and how it should be permitted and heavily industrialized cities like Detroit.

323
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,559
And so as we go through our discussion today,

324
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:36,400
we're going to talk about why cities like Detroit should have urban gardens for reasons like food insecurity and health disparities.

325
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:44,500
The benefits of having urban gardens in the community, like boosting local economy, the addition of green spaces, an increased sense of community.

326
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:49,360
And we're also going to address some of the possible complications of urban gardens and how we can get around them.

327
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:53,110
Things like gentrification and environmental contaminants.

328
00:38:53,830 --> 00:39:00,190
So to start off, we're going to look at food access and health and how this is an issue and why urban gardens can help out with it.

329
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:08,200
In particular, we see a lot of low income or African-American neighborhoods have fewer supermarkets, especially full service supermarkets.

330
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:13,810
So they have a lot of liquor stores, convenience stores, things that offer fewer healthy food options,

331
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:18,340
things that are lower quality, higher in calories and less nutrient dense.

332
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:25,749
And you often need access to a car, which, again, in a big city, a lot of people don't have access to many of these issues,

333
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:31,860
particularly dealing with the types of stores that are available stemming from economic disinvestment and white flight.

334
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:42,070
That's particularly important in Detroit. And there's also a connection between how close you live to a supermarket and your quality of health.

335
00:39:42,430 --> 00:39:47,259
So Lawson noted that if you're closer to a supermarket, you have lower risk of obesity.

336
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:53,800
But there are also options of things like cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other health disparities there, too.

337
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:03,340
But let's look at Detroit as a particular case study. 40% of residents in Detroit are food insecure, meaning that they have lower access to food.

338
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:07,480
And if we compare that to Ann Arbor, we can see that.

339
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:12,130
We know Ann Arbor has lots and lots of grocery stores. Everywhere you turn, you find one.

340
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:20,620
If we compare the populations of Detroit in Ann Arbor, Detroit has about 5.2 higher of a population.

341
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:27,190
But as far as we know, from 2022, Detroit has 62 full service grocery stores.

342
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:32,830
And the latest information we can find about Ann Arbor was 2015, which had 20 full service grocery stores.

343
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:41,560
So if we compare the 20 and adjust for population, we would expect Detroit to have 104 stores to compete with us.

344
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:45,850
And that's not the case. Plus, more stores have closed down due to the pandemic.

345
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:56,590
So urban farms will help address food access, food security and health disparities by providing better quality products and healthy options.

346
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:00,389
Moving on to the economic side of urban farms.

347
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:06,720
We know that 30% of Detroit residents are below the poverty line, which is well above the Michigan national average.

348
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:16,400
So we're always looking for economic opportunity among this group, and we can use urban farm opportunity, vacant lot specifically.

349
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:21,230
So if you look at the map on the right, you'll see the concentration of poverty with the Detroit neighborhoods,

350
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:26,400
red areas depicting areas that are persistently poor from 1980 2018.

351
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,640
The map on the left shows the number of vacant lots in Detroit with dark green having a high number of vacant lots.

352
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:38,160
If you were to overlay the two maps to the fact that there's a lot of vacant lots of areas that are persistently poor,

353
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:43,440
which suggests that we may use vacant lots and put urban farms there to spur the economic opportunity.

354
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:52,660
The specific economic benefits related to urban agriculture are as job creation, which we may have the potential to generate 5000 jobs in Detroit.

355
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:57,220
Additionally, we've seen success in similar markets in Philadelphia and Ohio.

356
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:01,960
The urban farmers may expect to make 68000 to $90000 per acre.

357
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,670
There's a high return on investment with every $1 invested, yielding $6 for the crops.

358
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,600
And the market value of Detroit is expected to be around $200 million.

359
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:15,310
A concern with urban farms may be maybe gentrification.

360
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:20,200
However, a recent study from Sees found that there's no correlation between gentrification and urban farms.

361
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:29,649
And if you look at the map on the right, you'll see that it shows the potential for gentrification with dark blue and light blue being lowest at low

362
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:34,780
likelihood of gentrification and yellow and orange being high and highest likelihood of gentrification.

363
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:39,310
The map on the left shows the existing number of community gardens.

364
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:44,620
If you're overlay the two, you would find that there's the most community gardens in areas that have the lowest or low likelihood of gentrification.

365
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:54,769
Further proving this point. So the next benefit of urban farming is their beautification is improving.

366
00:42:54,770 --> 00:43:02,690
The appearance of neighborhoods has been shown to have a positive impact on social factors such as crime and mental health and white men.

367
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:11,930
A study they found that integrating natural landscaping and increase in greenspace was correlational and linked to decreases in violent crime,

368
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:20,630
especially decreases in gun violence and especially decreases in gun violence in areas like parks and open spaces.

369
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:30,050
Another study done in 2022 in this year, and a link between air pollution and hospitalizations for mental disorders.

370
00:43:30,470 --> 00:43:41,090
The study found that green spaces had a modifying effect on this relationship so that green spaces lower the amount

371
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:50,780
of two that was in the air and therefore were related to lower hospital admissions for mental health disorders.

372
00:43:52,490 --> 00:44:01,640
So placing urban farms in industrialized areas would likely have a positive impact on crime and mental health.

373
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,409
I just want to take a moment to talk about some of the risk of exposure to pollutants,

374
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:12,080
because that is a very real issue, which a lot of the team will talk about.

375
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,330
That said, there are guidelines for safe urban gardening practices and best practices for reducing exposure.

376
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:28,220
So I just want to go over a couple of those. Generally, you can just be strategic about selecting where you put your garden and the gardening design.

377
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:35,180
So considering previous the soil testing the soil, depending on your levels, you could do like a full scale remediation,

378
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:41,540
which is a little more expensive, but if it's a project that could be worth it, or there are just very feasible best practices that you can use.

379
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:47,030
And the big thing to know as well is that the biggest source or pathway of

380
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:51,139
exposure is through contact with the soil and then the root of soil ingestion,

381
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:54,260
not actual uptake into plants and eating the produce.

382
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:59,450
USDA research found that most metals that you find as well, but all of those started soluble.

383
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:05,420
And then because they strongly attach to soil particles, they tend not to reach the actual edible portions of the produce.

384
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:11,840
And that means a lot of the best practices are just ways to reduce contact between the farmer and the soil.

385
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:23,000
So this is just a couple of resources that are out there from the EPA drawing on some of their programs, looking at reusing the soil.

386
00:45:24,620 --> 00:45:28,360
And so just these best practices that guide select low risk sites,

387
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:31,790
the sites that had previous residential and recreational use as opposed to like a

388
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:36,319
heavily industrialized site and then just build away from that known contamination

389
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:42,500
storage like a road or buildings or peeling paint and then adding a thick organic

390
00:45:42,550 --> 00:45:47,330
layer composter mulch to separate again from that potentially contaminated soil.

391
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:51,409
And research has shown that this can significantly dilute contaminant levels to a

392
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:55,610
point that they're not really a huge health risk and then avoiding soil ingestion,

393
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:58,730
like washing your hands, watching the produce.

394
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:07,280
And there are also ways to select products that are produced that are more appropriate for potentially added soil.

395
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,310
So lots of fruiting bodies as opposed to like a tuber that grows in the ground or something with big leafy greens that you're going to eat.

396
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:17,549
And as well, if you're really, really concerned,

397
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:23,810
then you can use an engineering solution like a raised bed, or you could build like a container garden.

398
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:29,420
And so this is just like an example of what that would look like to use one of these raised beds.

399
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:36,469
And an overall comment would be that there is significant literature suggesting that the benefits do outweigh the risks,

400
00:46:36,470 --> 00:46:44,030
especially because if there is a risk, there are so many feasible ways to address it, better economic and effective.

401
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:51,280
So in conclusion, we want to say yes to urban farms and yes to urban gardens.

402
00:46:51,290 --> 00:46:58,940
Make sure you add them to your heavily industrialized trees, essentially, just to kind of go back over what we talked about.

403
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:04,520
Industrialized cities are often segregated and lead to greater health disparities for minority populations.

404
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:09,230
There's often a lack of healthy, affordable and culturally appropriate foods.

405
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:14,600
But having an urban garden could help address some of these issues.

406
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:19,310
There is evidence for economic opportunity, but then impoverished neighborhoods of vacant lots.

407
00:47:19,310 --> 00:47:22,380
And there's also potential for economic benefits from urban farming.

408
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:29,950
There's no correlation to gentrification. And just in general, while there is a risk of exposure to contamination.

409
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,720
There are very visible best practices you can take. Response.

410
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:37,830
Such collective efforts involving ignorance to vote yes.

411
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:51,030
Yeah. Yeah. Right. Excellent start to the debate from the pro group.

412
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:56,420
So now the against group is invited to come up and make their case.

413
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:07,630
You know, I think it is.

414
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:21,080
But I just, you know, just like.

415
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,069
Yeah. All right.

416
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:35,990
So we're here to tell you exactly why everything they just said is wrong and should definitely not be allowed in heavily industrialized cities.

417
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:42,080
So they mention that urban agriculture mostly is thought of as community gardens and vertical farms.

418
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:49,340
But it's also very important to remember that livestock in cities is also something that is found in many different countries.

419
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,010
Nonprofit organizations and community groups are often participating in urban agriculture,

420
00:48:55,190 --> 00:49:00,740
and they're supported by the government through giving government owned property or lower prices on vacant lots.

421
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:08,660
So a lot of the negatives that are related to urban farming come from high exposure risks to both chemical and biological hazards,

422
00:49:08,930 --> 00:49:13,730
environmental impacts on both the crops that are being grown and on the city itself.

423
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:20,840
And then there's also socio socioeconomic issues that are real, such as gentrification and increased food insecurity.

424
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:28,400
So in industrial cities, urban agriculture can increase the risk of chemical and biological exposure risks.

425
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:35,690
Some of the chemical and biological risks include from vehicles, urban runoff, industrial facilities or building materials.

426
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,670
And some of the most dangerous are pets, which are potentially toxic elements.

427
00:49:41,090 --> 00:49:46,910
These are source of contamination due to human activities that have been accumulated in soil for a long period of time.

428
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:51,740
And they mostly include deposition of metal containing compounds,

429
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:57,290
fence of our nearby roads and in rooftop gardens are proven to have higher contamination levels,

430
00:49:57,590 --> 00:50:06,560
and the lack of true cover to block air pollution in rooftop gardens pose an increased risk to deposition of pollution from the air and the rain.

431
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:13,500
Thus, plants can accumulate these hazardous doses of particles from the contaminated growing media.

432
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,090
SLED was mentioned as a potentially toxic element.

433
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:25,080
And in urban areas, the lead in soil levels are up to 20 times higher than in rural areas where most of the farming is done.

434
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:31,020
So a lot of cities are implementing soil remediation strategies, such as putting down clay or something,

435
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:36,420
but those are extremely costly and would not be beneficial to many poor income communities.

436
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:45,209
In other places are using phosphorus based fertilizers, but you need to use such high doses of it that it causes an initial spike in light absorption

437
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:49,890
levels and then will also lead to runoff issues and eutrophication of water sources.

438
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:56,400
And these issues are highest mostly in older areas of cities, which tend to be the poorer areas of cities as well.

439
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:05,380
An additional source of pollution that is extremely toxic is polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and these mostly come from industry sources.

440
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:12,120
So in a place like Detroit, you're going to have much higher levels of these than in cities that are not heavily industrialized.

441
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:18,120
So this is a quote from a survey done about urban agriculture in Detroit.

442
00:51:18,390 --> 00:51:19,380
And a mother said,

443
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:25,439
I don't know if I would let my son eat the vegetables from there with the contaminants that I know are in the soils here in Detroit,

444
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:30,210
everything is considered a brownfield pretty much because of what happened in the past 20, 30 years.

445
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,860
So it's toxic and dangerous.

446
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:39,030
So there's this fear in the community that even if we have urban agriculture, maybe it won't even be utilized because of the historical pollution.

447
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:45,809
So we also want to consider the risk to both farmers and the communities working on these actual urban gardens,

448
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:54,150
like in there, starting them and not keeping them. LUDDEN Pages which discuss previously have been found within a soil in Detroit.

449
00:51:55,470 --> 00:52:05,040
Farmers working in Detroit may be exposed to these directly to let me just on a regular basis also not to mention the air of pollution.

450
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:11,490
Both farmers in the community suffer with the current air quality in Detroit. It can fluctuate between good and less than desirable levels.

451
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:19,050
When I Googled the air quality index, it was actually 102 on November 23rd, which is labeled as unhealthy for sensitive groups.

452
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:22,740
It lists 2.5, and nitrogen dioxide is high.

453
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:27,240
So historically, we know Detroit's air quality contains like medium to high levels of pollutants,

454
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:31,140
repetitive exposures, while working literally in the soil all day long.

455
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:36,090
Trying to maintain these gardens would be really harmful to farmers and those volunteering,

456
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:40,499
not to mention whatever pesticides or fertilizers are being used.

457
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:47,639
Those are also direct exposures and also within it would increase semi-truck traffic.

458
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:53,340
So, you know, peddling these goods between locations in Detroit would also be harmful because Detroit

459
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:57,720
has a major semi-truck issue with the pollutants that they are currently releasing.

460
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:03,390
Then also, urban runoff combined with agricultural runoff would damage the water system.

461
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:09,810
Farming, pesticides and fertilizers used in larger amounts in cities are just too obviously is detrimental.

462
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:17,220
It can further pollute waterways and soil. Increasing fertilizer usage can also lead to beautification possible drinking water contamination.

463
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:19,469
Algae blooms are already an existing problem.

464
00:53:19,470 --> 00:53:24,450
We talked about Lake Erie, but they've also been documented in the Detroit River as well as Lake St Clair,

465
00:53:24,990 --> 00:53:28,050
both which are water sources for drinking water for Detroit residents.

466
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:35,010
Cyanobacteria, algae blooms can actually be toxic and aerosolize, which is not great to be breathing.

467
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:43,410
And obviously so livestock such as cows and chickens and industrial cities considers because it can increase the biological risk.

468
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:51,959
Animal waste in cities can lead to water contamination of sewage and eventually spread pathogens and antibiotic use in small scale food.

469
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:58,860
Animal production creates opportunity for antibiotic resistance, development and spread in animal waste.

470
00:53:59,130 --> 00:54:03,930
Outbreaks of salmonella have increased as background backyard chicken ownership has increased as well.

471
00:54:04,410 --> 00:54:12,990
And for agriculture workers, there's a higher risk of zoonotic diseases like Campylobacter for blue Lou flu, bird flu,

472
00:54:13,650 --> 00:54:22,040
swine flu and hepatitis E with the increased number of livestock in highly populated urban areas, there is more likely for the disease.

473
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:26,970
Diseases spread much easily, whether it is from animal to animal, animal to human or human to human transmission.

474
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:36,290
So right now, urban agriculture only represents a small amount of produce eating in cities like Detroit.

475
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:40,690
In order for urban agriculture to meet food demands, it must be scaled up.

476
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:43,880
But right now, the way it's done is economically unsustainable.

477
00:54:44,870 --> 00:54:51,170
Many urban gardens are on vacant city land that's rented at a low cost without property taxes.

478
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,060
The first problem with this approach is that it's often inequitable. For example,

479
00:54:56,330 --> 00:55:05,150
the City of Detroit's land bank has been accused of favoring wealthier white newcomers over long term black residents in their leasing programs.

480
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:09,710
The second problem with this approach is that it can't go on indefinitely.

481
00:55:10,010 --> 00:55:17,600
Cities view urban agriculture as temporary land use because eventually they do have to profit from their vacant land.

482
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,800
But because of high land and water costs,

483
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:31,040
only wealthy for profit developers can afford the market prices for the land in order to buy enough land to grow substantial amounts of food.

484
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:42,290
So for profit development can lead to lots of harm for communities, including gentrification and harm by the developers themselves.

485
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,960
Despite the one study that showed a lack of association with gentrification in Detroit,

486
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:53,810
many other studies showed that urban agriculture and green spaces leads to higher

487
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:58,370
rents and property values in other cities like Philadelphia and New York.

488
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,780
And also for profit developers.

489
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:12,490
For profit development of urban farming could mean that cities will prioritize money rather than public health in these decisions.

490
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:20,860
For example, 450 acres of land was purchased by Hantz Farms in 2019 for tree nurseries,

491
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:29,200
but they ended up selling a lot of the land Fiat-Chrysler for automobile manufacturing, which is highly polluting and a risk to public health.

492
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:37,780
So deals like that represent the tradeoff between nonprofit community growing and for profit large scale urban agriculture.

493
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:45,630
So another major issue is that urban agriculture is not doing anything that the pro group actually said it is going to do.

494
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:49,200
And they said that it's mostly going to help with food security.

495
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:56,820
So I found that the food insecurity in Detroit is actually roughly 70%, which is higher than the other groups stated.

496
00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:02,580
So there's more people that actually would need access to urban agricultural products.

497
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,690
But if you look at what both cities are producing through urban agriculture, fruits,

498
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:11,970
vegetables and herbs, which this chart shows only supply like 15 to 20 or 30 calories per serving.

499
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,570
But if you're someone who is in need of food, you're not going to turn to a cucumber.

500
00:57:15,570 --> 00:57:20,070
You're going to turn to something that will actually fill you up and provide more calories.

501
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:28,080
So another caveat of that is most urban agricultural companies are needing to make specialty goods such as organic produce

502
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:34,290
or value added products in order to meet those high profit margins that the four groups suggested people could reach.

503
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:42,120
So that leads to urban agricultural initiatives like Keep Growing Detroit to sell a cabbage at $3 per lb.

504
00:57:42,390 --> 00:57:47,100
But at a local grocery store such as Kroger, you can get it at $0.79 per pound.

505
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:52,440
Another example of this is a place like Love and Fresh Flowers in Philadelphia is using

506
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:57,990
up two acres of city space to grow flowers that are then being sold at $255 per week.

507
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:04,590
So this is not something at all that people in low income communities need in order to not be hungry.

508
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,230
Yeah.

509
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:16,150
So a quote from a former farmer in Detroit sums up the problem with promoting urban agriculture as a one size fits all solution to food security.

510
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,979
Neo colonial projects like the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative demonstrate that

511
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:25,000
while intent is not enough to address stomach issues around food security and poverty,

512
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:31,280
food security and poverty have less to do with access and more to do with structural and historical disparities around power.

513
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:37,240
And as long as we only address the symptoms of insecurity and poverty, we also perpetuate disparities of power that create them.

514
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:44,140
So if urban agriculture doesn't mean meaningfully address food insecurity, and it also has all these exposure risks.

515
00:58:44,410 --> 00:58:53,290
Cities should not allow. All right.

516
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:03,540
Okay. So for the bottle, I'm going to suggest that the group go out this door.

517
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:07,170
Right, and just kind of convene towards the cafe.

518
00:59:07,410 --> 00:59:16,290
You got 2 minutes and then the again group go out the other door and hang a left and just kind of find a little spot and maybe near the entrance,

519
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:26,610
kind of huddle up and you've got 2 minutes. I will come and give you about a 32nd 1 to 2 minutes and you've got 2 minutes that can.

520
00:59:30,180 --> 00:59:34,500
It's great to have you.

521
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:39,130
He's trying to cut through the exhibit.

522
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:45,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But I don't think that's an economic team.

523
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:54,899
It's like. Yeah, cause we were like, oh, you can make so much money off of it, but then that makes it not affordable.

524
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,370
Oh, right, right. And so it's interesting.

525
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:11,310
Like, I think some of the pros and cons of like, like we were looking for something like that really to tell you about their experience.

526
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:16,450
Yeah. Yeah. Earthworks do town. I think that there's a very satisfactory answer.

527
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:20,740
Yeah, that's Earthworks. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. See, what about you?

528
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:30,880
Yeah, I think that you could include the Detroit through the Policy Council as a resource to have or quotes about that.

529
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:51,250
But, you know, if you turn for the first time you might find different policy issues will be the surrounding community does not care for Thanksgiving.

530
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,910
So I gave it to her but a lot of people from a different area of the state.

531
01:00:57,130 --> 01:01:00,730
Yeah. That are like running it, like working on it.

532
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:05,430
And then there's also an international to Utah.

533
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:18,450
Yeah, yeah. Because it's right by the center because it's like because the people, you know.

534
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:25,600
Yeah. Like became like a nuisance. But the people like literally in my neighborhood next to it, I like, you know.

535
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:28,390
But then we don't. Yeah, yeah.

536
01:01:28,390 --> 01:01:42,910
Because I mean that's and still the other six of food stamps not something I think part of us for most people who are below the poverty level,

537
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:53,920
that's our argument for anything to be alive. Yeah, I still think it's an evil that goes on.

538
01:01:57,360 --> 01:02:09,120
Yeah. That was one of the big things that I mean, that was writers ago, but that was one that you just got a little bit of creativity goes a long way.

539
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:22,030
Exactly. That's what, you know, that was nostalgic, that super cool stuff here, if I remember now.

540
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:32,050
Oh, that's fine. But I said if I were like all the players started driving, right?

541
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:51,880
I do not rotate well while driving I you like I think all of us are actually really surprised that that's going to be.

542
01:02:51,910 --> 01:03:11,080
But I think you might be over thinking overthinking the coaches because there are just like a whole range in her life.

543
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:26,290
Like she's got a she's got to that's just like you guys.

544
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:39,510
It's like there are other things I like to say, you know?

545
01:03:40,770 --> 01:03:43,870
I mean, I think part of the same file. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

546
01:03:45,310 --> 01:03:50,050
So the format is the pro group is going to have to go in there.

547
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:57,130
You're like, but usually the against group will have 10 minutes to give their rebuttal.

548
01:03:57,790 --> 01:04:00,970
And the group whenever you are ready.

549
01:04:02,020 --> 01:04:04,540
All right. Well, 2 minutes is not a lot of time, but here we go.

550
01:04:05,380 --> 01:04:10,750
First of all, we're talking about just permitting urban farms, not necessarily that they're going to fix everything.

551
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:13,630
We know it's not a one size fits all type of thing.

552
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:23,530
As far as things like eutrophication and use of fertilizers, Town is a perfect example of a huge farm in Detroit that uses regenerative practices.

553
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,720
And as far as things like air pollution, we know that green spaces can help mitigate that.

554
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:34,990
As for their argument of trophic increase, we're not talking about urban farms as things that can.

555
01:04:35,050 --> 01:04:38,860
We used to like go across the country into other stores.

556
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:41,560
It's something that would be community based.

557
01:04:42,490 --> 01:04:48,970
Higher green areas also means less impervious surfaces, which could help mitigate some of the runoff issues.

558
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:56,679
As far as the land being leased to white people, we have, for example, detail,

559
01:04:56,680 --> 01:05:05,650
and we also have the Georges Street Community Collective, which is 17 acres of land and owned by I started by a black man.

560
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:11,110
As far as the things of being cheaper at Kroger.

561
01:05:11,890 --> 01:05:17,290
That's great. That makes sense. However, Kroger is one store that is not available in Detroit.

562
01:05:17,410 --> 01:05:19,600
Out of those 62 stores, there is no Kroger.

563
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:26,040
There's things like Whole Foods, which is obviously going to be more expensive and harder to access for everyone there.

564
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:32,050
But the points about gentrification, so I understand other cities, it's an issue, however, in Detroit,

565
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:37,000
Detroit has its own unique city, and so in Detroit proved that it is not a concern or issue.

566
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:44,950
Also, we're talking about keeping it community based. So we're suggesting these urban farms to build social community cohesion so that

567
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:48,790
they can increase social capital and potentially purchase those lands themselves,

568
01:05:48,790 --> 01:05:53,800
keeping it within the community so that it doesn't move outside and promote gentrification.

569
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:56,980
I think that's our biggest thing is first thing. It should be permanent.

570
01:05:57,070 --> 01:06:01,840
It's not been done perfectly in the past and it's been used in the various items that it's harmed communities for sure,

571
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:06,910
but to a lot of space where we can back and explore different models and keep them in the community.

572
01:06:09,250 --> 01:06:15,340
All right, thanks very much. Progress. Now the against group, you have 2 minutes for your rebuttal.

573
01:06:15,940 --> 01:06:18,580
Okay. So regarding the gentrification,

574
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:28,660
this the study that they're referring to that showed that gentrification is not an issue in Detroit did show that even though it wasn't an issue,

575
01:06:29,050 --> 01:06:32,200
the urban farming and greenspaces are still unequal.

576
01:06:32,830 --> 01:06:39,069
The gardens and things like beautification benefit primarily wealthier, whiter neighborhoods.

577
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:43,150
So it's an issue in other cities and it's unequal in Detroit.

578
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:55,300
And then also regarding like soil pollution being an issue for vegetables, lead uptake is an issue for things like vegetables and leafy greens,

579
01:06:55,600 --> 01:07:00,190
which are more nutritious than things like fruits, which do provide less calories.

580
01:07:00,190 --> 01:07:08,410
So the worse benefit is in the foods that will provide the most calories and benefit for food security.

581
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:12,940
So they were talking about vacant lots are perfect spot vacant lots.

582
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:17,200
Unfortunately, a lot of times in southeast Detroit, like they're around the industrial sites.

583
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:23,709
So these are very polluted areas. And there's a and I took a trip down there for the bridge tour inquiry and like we had trouble breathing.

584
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,900
Like it was hard on the bus, like even to breathe.

585
01:07:25,900 --> 01:07:31,840
So like working in those there's a reason that they're vacant lots is because know they're not good spaces to use and if

586
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:37,180
we're using the storage container I feel like they're talking about that's not really helping the water permeate you know,

587
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:41,739
like we're trying to do urban farming to help the soil and help decrease urban runoff and stuff.

588
01:07:41,740 --> 01:07:47,110
And just having those containers sitting there, that's not really the best, you know what I'm saying?

589
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:54,610
Like we want to increase the probability of soil and surfaces in Detroit and those storage containers just don't cut it.

590
01:07:54,880 --> 01:08:04,780
So also regarding the community based aspect of it, so the quote quote that we mentioned at the end was a criticism,

591
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:15,579
a criticism of the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative, which is a nonprofit farming initiative that has been accused of disrupting actual,

592
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:24,520
like, community grown farms by coming from the outside as a nonprofit and like just giving away free produce which which outcompete other farmers,

593
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:29,350
like black farmers who are needing to make a profit from their from their work.

594
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:36,220
So it's not even like nonprofit farms don't necessarily improve community cohesion.

595
01:08:37,530 --> 01:08:41,520
All right. Thanks very much to the against group and just a round of applause for both.

596
01:08:44,310 --> 01:08:49,470
You can take your seats and we have a few minutes for for some discussion.

597
01:08:55,050 --> 01:09:01,379
So I just want to say excellent job. I think that like setting the bar right for the next two debates.

598
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:05,760
So the rest of you that are still yet to go, there's your task.

599
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,890
All right. So a couple of votes just by show of hands.

600
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:19,230
Okay. So not about the topic, but about the effectiveness of the debate and making their case.

601
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:25,919
And the debate teams can you can vote for yourself or I guess you can vote for the other team if you are by a show of hands.

602
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:34,350
Who thinks that the pro group won the debate? You know, by a show of hands?

603
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:38,570
Who thinks the against group won the debate? Okay.

604
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:42,299
Are there some people not voting who is not who is not sure, really?

605
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:46,220
Well, they both said it was very great. That's fantastic.

606
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:55,050
Fantastic. Now a second vote, this one specific to the topic, who is in favor of urban farming?

607
01:09:57,900 --> 01:10:05,250
A man who is against the German army. Is there anyone who didn't vote and is unsure?

608
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:11,219
Okay. Interesting. All right. So, yeah. So now let's go ahead and open it up.

609
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:14,490
We've got 8 minutes left in the class period.

610
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:24,870
You know, what do folks, uh, think about this? Yeah, clearly there are initiatives, but it's not taking off as much as it could have.

611
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:32,670
You know, maybe I can look to the debate team to actually start the discussion, but I want others to weigh in.

612
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:39,150
Or actually, if others have questions for the debate teams, this would be a great time to ask.

613
01:10:41,930 --> 01:10:44,270
And it's going up all over the place. I start in the back first.

614
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:50,479
I just thought it was it was pretty clear that it's not a one size fits all issue situation.

615
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:56,120
And it really depends on the specific community in Detroit as a whole is pretty large.

616
01:10:56,120 --> 01:11:00,559
So what might work for one neighborhood might not may not work for another neighborhood.

617
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:05,880
So I just thought that both groups did a really good job with explaining that base.

618
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:11,190
I saw your hand. I also think both groups did a great job.

619
01:11:11,820 --> 01:11:20,220
I had a question for the pro team. I was wondering why they decided to focus in on African-American communities.

620
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:26,940
And as far as like them being under-resourced, I guess, was the message,

621
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:32,310
because there are other racial communities that are struggling with that issue as well.

622
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:40,700
I'm just wondering why that focus was there. Are we trying to improve the situation specifically for black people, or was it just kind of like a.

623
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:46,060
Just like we didn't mention the other, you know, groups.

624
01:11:47,230 --> 01:11:54,340
Yeah, yeah. Good question. Yeah. Out of curiosity, does the program cover and I can speak to that since that was my part.

625
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:01,660
There was nothing particular about like honing in on one sort of like racial profile.

626
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:08,829
That being said, most of the examples that we came up with were started by black people.

627
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:13,690
And so it was kind of about showing like, hey, you can take back the land, you can use this.

628
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:21,820
And also a lot of the research that we found was particularly about African-Americans, but also just low economic communities.

629
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:28,630
It didn't have to be. Excuse me. And I.

630
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:39,700
I saw your hand as well. Yeah. I'm curious. There wasn't a ton of discussion about, like, remediation and, like, bioremediation,

631
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:44,890
particularly because I know, like, you can use plants to get rid of metals and soils.

632
01:12:46,780 --> 01:12:50,260
And I was just wondering what either group read about that.

633
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:54,070
Maybe you didn't have time to talk about that. 10 minutes is not a lot.

634
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:59,559
No. Yeah, but then I also was interested.

635
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:04,750
I also wanted to point out that a lot of the vacant lots in Detroit are green spaces.

636
01:13:04,990 --> 01:13:11,830
A lot of them have trees that are overgrown with plants. And so I did think one thing on the pro side that was a little bit of a weak

637
01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:16,090
argument was that your argument was to turn vacant lots into green spaces,

638
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:25,360
but they already kind of are. And a lot of it I can speak to that because I was like, okay, so there are a lot of vacant homes that are overgrown.

639
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:27,730
And so they're like, they're green spaces already.

640
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:36,250
And uh, however, there are a lot of places in Detroit where like there are abandoned homes and they haven't been torn down yet.

641
01:13:36,670 --> 01:13:43,870
And so I had thought mostly about these areas that if the city had, for example,

642
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:53,079
sold these lights at a at a low cost to people who wanted to open urban farms and had business plans to, like,

643
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:59,110
tear down the houses and things, not only would that be really good because abandoned houses and like I grew up in Detroit,

644
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:04,690
some of that things happen when spaces are abandoned like that.

645
01:14:05,230 --> 01:14:09,340
Um, and so would getting rid of those.

646
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:14,080
But also that's going to beautify the neighborhood because those places are not being taken care of.

647
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:19,660
Right? So that's what mostly what I had in mind when I was talking about that and.

648
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:29,740
So the against teams are built like the vacant lots were because they're just not good areas and that's not the case.

649
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:33,350
It has to do with like the white flight and the disinvestment in the community.

650
01:14:33,650 --> 01:14:41,150
So a lot of people were leaving as industry, as industries were going more towards the suburbs and people were following the jobs.

651
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:46,190
So it was more like abandoned homes then just like, oh, this is a bad area, we shouldn't be here.

652
01:14:49,550 --> 01:14:52,640
I don't think we mean to say that they were like bad areas.

653
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:57,680
It was more so like the air quality and stuff like that, but that's not why.

654
01:14:58,070 --> 01:15:03,260
So it wasn't like, you know, we're saying that they're scary neighborhoods or something like that.

655
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:08,870
And I think when we did that Gordie Howe Bridge tour, it was really like, if you guys ever have a chance to go, you should go.

656
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,450
Oh, you were there. It was great.

657
01:15:11,990 --> 01:15:20,390
And then talking about like them offering people money to leave the area, that's they're called, what are they called, swaps or something like that.

658
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:25,190
People were still like, nope, we're going to there were people who wanted to stay in the community.

659
01:15:26,180 --> 01:15:31,670
And I think that speaks to it too. So these people are really are those the people who are going to like take over those?

660
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:38,629
Because dumping is a big issue, too, they were talking about on the tour. So if we can prevent that and turn those into usable spaces, that's great.

661
01:15:38,630 --> 01:15:45,110
It just sounded like there's a lot more issues where we can be funneling money instead of that.

662
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:50,420
So that's that's how I think when doing the research, it was kind of like, okay, well, like, how can we like clean up the air quality down there?

663
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:53,090
How can we like best serve the community?

664
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:58,549
Like for those people who are literally living there right now, like do they need this money for these things and stuff like that?

665
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:08,600
So that's how I felt about that. I will say again, you talked about that there are better ways there are better ways to use money.

666
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:18,400
I do believe that. I think that it would just be better for some kind of incentive program for grocery store chains to just like open grocery stores.

667
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:29,820
That's a lot less work. Right. And I think that your cost benefit ratio would be way better because in people it's a whole grocery store.

668
01:16:29,830 --> 01:16:33,930
They can have everything that you would get at a myer, a Walmart or something.

669
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:41,790
I think the urban farming honestly is like a little bit of a ascetic kind of.

670
01:16:41,790 --> 01:16:47,500
It just feels good and it looks good, but I don't know that it's like the best thing even.

671
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:57,780
My point in the presentation about the beautification of like vacant lots and abandoned houses that can really just be done if you just like plant,

672
01:16:58,050 --> 01:17:04,890
if you just tear down houses and plant things there that are just supposed to be just to look nice, you could just do that.

673
01:17:04,890 --> 01:17:09,870
And then you would leave. You could leave them and that would be fine, you know?

674
01:17:11,310 --> 01:17:16,590
And you think that just building grocery stores in low income areas is a smarter choice?

675
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:24,479
This is a question I thought Amy's and then I'm trying to like kind of formulate my thoughts.

676
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:31,559
But I think that the just kind of a comment, it was really nice for me to see like Malik and Shane up there because I've been able

677
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:35,760
to work with both of them through Earthworks and Detailer and some things I've done.

678
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:46,589
And I just I guess I wish the program really had taken some quotes from the the urban agriculturists and in Detroit itself, especially Malik,

679
01:17:46,590 --> 01:17:52,260
who has so much beautiful stuff to say about like reclaiming their community and like,

680
01:17:52,530 --> 01:17:57,480
like all these, all these amazing things for what the community actually wants.

681
01:17:57,810 --> 01:17:58,139
And like,

682
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:05,459
if you look at the Detroit Food Policy Council and different things like that that were just I think it's a I know you only have 10 minutes, right?

683
01:18:05,460 --> 01:18:09,120
We're all we're all like, how can we say everything we want to say in 10 minutes?

684
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:14,969
So I like to have the program quotes from people also.

685
01:18:14,970 --> 01:18:21,930
Shane working at Earthworks, I know what he's talking about is not like it is not why I think the pro group was focusing

686
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:27,479
on about what that would look like for Urban or the second group sorry would look like.

687
01:18:27,480 --> 01:18:37,920
And no, the no no no the what Shane site in the group was was did not describe what the program was saying urban agriculture would look like.

688
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:44,100
According to him, it was more big industry came in and kind of took over what they already had.

689
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:48,060
That was very community based. So that's just my I don't know.

690
01:18:48,070 --> 01:18:58,889
Mike just something to say. I think that there's so much richness to be gathered from, from hearing the voices within the community itself or why.

691
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:05,490
It's a process that I just have to call to say, no, thanks so much.

692
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:16,340
Or at the end. I do want to note there is research that really promotes the benefits of a kind of community wellness, community connectivity, right?

693
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:20,339
Aside from the, you know, the nutritional aspect, certification aspects.

694
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:24,210
But, you know, there's really a sense of wellness and togetherness.

695
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:28,350
Um, thanks so much to both groups. Have a great day.

696
01:19:28,710 --> 01:19:36,030
Shakira Tyler gets a new lecture at FIU and she is the president of the board of the Trade Practitioners Security Network.

697
01:19:36,990 --> 01:19:42,300
And if you're interested in the issue, you should take some classes with her teaching a black agrarian class.

698
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:53,670
Yeah. I mean, I read all about this initiative. Right now, Tyler has a corporate.
