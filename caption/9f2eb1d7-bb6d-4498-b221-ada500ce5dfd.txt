1
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:17,100
Hey, good morning, everyone. So we're going to kind of continue our theme of introduction to, you know, classifications of exposures.

2
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:24,000
We went through chemical exposure last week. On Tuesday, we covered physical exposures.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,140
Today, we're going to go ahead and move on to biological exposures.

4
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:36,300
And we're also really fortunate to have a guest speaker, a topical expert, Professor John Meeker,

5
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:42,330
who is also a professor in environmental health sciences, as well as a professor of global public health.

6
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,340
He also served as our senior associate dean for research here at the school.

7
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:55,200
And John has graciously agreed to actually come back a little bit later in the semester to talk specifically about biomarkers and

8
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:03,940
biological monitoring and hopefully be able to talk a little bit about his research and his going on utilizing those aspects.

9
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:09,690
But today he's going to be giving an introduction to biological exposures.

10
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:18,310
John, thank you so much. Ever use this one?

11
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,990
I don't. I think it's coming through exclusively. All right.

12
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:28,810
Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me OK? In the back, OK. You don't know at the mass.

13
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:36,470
I've tried a bunch of different ones. These ones seem to what the the sound through, but hopefully not the aerosols.

14
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:42,790
Right. Right, right. Which is relevant to today's topic, which is biological exposures.

15
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:53,980
So you know what, this lecture, obviously, we're in the midst of one of the biggest biological exposure events in recent history.

16
00:01:53,980 --> 00:02:03,730
So because we're still in the middle of it and the jury's out still on what the, you know, conclusions and fallout and everything else is going to be,

17
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,330
I don't have a lot of specific slides related to covid here,

18
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:15,790
but I will refer to it as we go through as far as its relevance to some of the basics will be covered.

19
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:23,830
So for today, we want the class to be able to understand basic types of biological hazards as well as rules of exposure and be

20
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:29,980
familiar with examples of some of these hazards in both occupational and community or environmental settings.

21
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,090
And there can be quite a bit of overlap in those as well.

22
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:42,580
So first, a question for all of you. What animal do you think kills the most humans globally each year?

23
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:52,270
What type of animal? So we're talking biological exposures or to what sort of animal or deer out there?

24
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:59,180
Yeah, yeah. Especially in the northern states up could be.

25
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:04,300
So that's that's a good guess as well.

26
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:13,790
Maybe a little difficult to calculate if, you know, they set off an infectious disease that then is transferred human to human beings.

27
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:18,100
And I can say these are allergies. That's another good example.

28
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:25,540
Um, a lot of people are allergic to bee stings. To mosquitoes is also a good guess.

29
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,900
So OK, no grizzly bears or sharks or anything like that.

30
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:36,040
Snakes, spiders. All right. Let's see. Some mosquitoes is the correct answer.

31
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,370
This data, obviously, you know,

32
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:49,150
a lot of the data I'll present today is somewhat old because it's always lagging several years by the time we get aggregate data on something.

33
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:59,110
But in general, you see mosquitoes down there at the bottom, and that's due to vector borne diseases that we we have humans,

34
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:11,530
unfortunately, snakes, dogs, some bugs, some, you know, parasites and, you know, sharks.

35
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:18,280
We down here at the top at about 10 lions, you know, the big scary animals are way down there.

36
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:25,420
But, yeah, it's mosquitoes. And, uh, around here, mosquitoes have been even worse this year than usual because of all the big rain events.

37
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,640
We've had a lot of standing water, et cetera. So, yeah, good job.

38
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,880
But in any event, mosquitoes can be quite dangerous.

39
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:44,980
So that's why we see a lot of pictures like this in our field of environmental health sciences, um, more from the chemical exposure perspective.

40
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:53,200
So this is an example of somebody being doused with DDT, which we know now is as a toxic pesticide.

41
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:59,410
But it had a very meaningful purpose back in World War Two because it is very effective

42
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,720
against mosquitoes and it's still used in places where malaria is still a big problem.

43
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,740
But they don't for the most part, they don't apply like this anymore.

44
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:15,940
It's much more targeted, much more controlled. Hopefully people are trained in how to do that.

45
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:21,010
What about other types of animals? Uh, what about goats or baby goats?

46
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:25,300
Here's a kid just kind of playing with a goat. Maybe go to the petting zoo.

47
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,290
I'm taking my kids to the petting zoo before we go out there. Yeah.

48
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:38,510
So, you know, animals produce excrement like we do, and it's full of bacteria and things with goats in particular.

49
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,320
Uh, they could be a source of what's called Q fever.

50
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:49,840
So there's a lot of weird diseases that you may not have heard of that can be spread from animals to humans.

51
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,730
A lot of them do have similar symptoms, you know, has Q fever.

52
00:05:54,730 --> 00:06:04,510
So it's got a lot of the same symptoms you might see with other things, but they are distinct as you can measure them.

53
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:12,310
Who has pets here? Anyone? I have pets maybe against my will, but I won't go into that.

54
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:21,980
So not to freak anybody out. So this entire lecture is kind of freaky, kind of gross, but as far as, you know, animals we bring into our homes,

55
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:29,720
you know, if you have an outdoor cat, you just want to make sure you keep some somewhat of a handle on where it's going.

56
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:37,670
Dogs as well. You know, they go outside, interact with other animals potentially and come back in the house or engage with with humans.

57
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:44,840
But they can be vehicles for biological hazards, livestock as well.

58
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:52,040
Cattle, as we see with food quality. That's another example of biological hazards.

59
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,730
We'll talk about later today, poultry snakes. And then you have wild animals.

60
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:08,690
That was mentioned earlier sort of at the center of a lot of the speculation and and research into how sars-cov-2 got into humans.

61
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:14,240
Birds, mammals, rodents is a big one. Historically in large cities.

62
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:25,340
Before they were good at hygiene and sanitation. Rodents really were a big player in spreading disease, particularly plague.

63
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:30,890
We don't see plague as much anymore. Usually a few cases you hear about out west in the US.

64
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:37,670
But you know what? Animals tend to tend to carry that these days and that usually leaves another animal.

65
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:45,680
Or it could be a lot of times they trace it back to prairie dogs and other small mammals like that.

66
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:49,350
But yeah, you don't think about the plague much anymore.

67
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:55,540
You read about it in like a medieval type setting, but it's still around.

68
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:03,850
So for today, we're going to set some some definitions, so biohazard is an organism or a product of an organism that presents risk to humans and

69
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:10,630
organisms living things that can have multiple parts can be complex or fairly simple.

70
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:15,070
A microorganism is a very small organism, as you might tell by the name.

71
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,740
And there we're referring to things like bacteria, viruses and fungus.

72
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:27,790
And then we have products of organisms. So this is where you can the organism itself may not be dangerous,

73
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:35,390
but it might be something it's it's giving off or a product or how it interacts with with something else.

74
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:43,210
So we'll talk about biomarkers later in the semester, as Professor Debauch mentioned, where we humans have blood, bodily fluids,

75
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:52,630
but even certain types of bacteria and mold might create chemical volatile organic compounds that might be toxic, the gas.

76
00:08:52,630 --> 00:09:04,300
So there's a lot of examples of products and organisms. So you've, uh, last week, you guys talked about chemical hazards and physical hazards,

77
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,810
which each have their their own nuances as far as how you go about measuring them, assessing the risks.

78
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:15,400
So biological agents in some ways can be a bit simpler.

79
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,970
If you think about, you know, a snake, you kind of you know what it is.

80
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,900
You know that the venom is there as long as you stay away from the teeth.

81
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:27,550
Right. But in other ways, it can be extremely complicated.

82
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:35,080
Again, as we're seeing with covered a lot of social factors involved in trying to get a grasp of how it how it spreads and how to prevent it.

83
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:40,000
So in some ways, it can be simpler, some ways can be much more complicated.

84
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,360
But one way is one way in which it's more difficult is, you know,

85
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,640
with with physical hazard in particular, there's good data on what's considered safe.

86
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,670
How much harm do you get from a certain amount of exposure? That's pretty well defined in physical hazards, chemicals.

87
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:59,030
It's a little more complicated once you get to biological for a specific age.

88
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:04,630
And it might be well defined for, you know, and then a snake venom, for example,

89
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:10,000
but for other things that could be very complicated because there's a lot of host factors involved,

90
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,160
like the, you know, how the body responds to a virus or something.

91
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:21,430
So that makes it hard to to come up with permissible exposure limits like we do with other hazards.

92
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:28,690
Another reason is because it can be quite distinct where the source is, right.

93
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:31,930
If you're talking about the flu, the sources, other people,

94
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:38,050
how are you going to attach a value to how much you could be exposed to other people in a way that we deal with with other agents?

95
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:48,930
So that's not really feasible. And then, you know, our immune systems, obviously, when they're responding to a biological agent,

96
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:56,880
there's tons of person-to-person variability there, which makes it tough as well.

97
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,080
And then the host and the environment interact with one another. So, again, that's that's social factors.

98
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,590
We talk about, you know,

99
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:15,000
the way transmissible virus is going to behave is much different if everyone's in lock down versus if everyone's carrying on like normal.

100
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,710
So there's a concept called the epidemiological triad that we think about with with transmissible pathogens.

101
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:27,220
So we have the host. That's where it needs to reside.

102
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:33,010
You have the pathogen itself, which causes the adverse health effects, and then you have the environment.

103
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:36,660
So the pathogen typically can't live on its own.

104
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:43,410
And how we think about this for a lot of biological agents, so it needs that host, but it can't just stay in one host.

105
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,520
It wants to replicate and and get into other hosts.

106
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,210
So it has to be able to do that through some sort of medium or environment. Could be the air, could be bodily fluids, et cetera.

107
00:11:54,210 --> 00:12:02,070
So that's how we how we think about that. So for illness to occur, the agent a must must be pathogenic.

108
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,180
There must be a reservoir, a sufficient number or else the your immune system,

109
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,480
hopefully you can take care of it, must be able to escape that reservoir,

110
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:17,400
as I mentioned, in the environment, and be able to be viable in that medium for long enough to go from one place to another.

111
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,250
So there are agents out there that once it hits the air,

112
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:33,420
it might die or gets exposed to up as it is sometimes an effective way to reduce the viability of a pathogen,

113
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:42,300
it must be able to get into another host and then the other host must be susceptible to that, that pathogen as well.

114
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:48,870
So a lot of things have to occur for that. And then that's just kind of assuming person to person.

115
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:59,390
When you think about species, the species jumping, it can become more complex.

116
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:04,670
So some factors that affect the exposure to biological agents and the outcome.

117
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:10,940
So you have that mode of transmission as we'll talk about the different ways you can get into

118
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:19,310
the body that really dictate how much how serious that might be from a population standpoint,

119
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:28,430
but also how you might go about preventing or reducing the chance of that happening routes of entry as well.

120
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:36,140
So you've talked about similar routes as chemical exposures, yet your ingestion, inhalation skin.

121
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:39,680
I mean, once infectious dose.

122
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,930
So this gets overlooked a lot.

123
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:54,200
And there's been some studies, you know, with with covid still there, studies coming out every day and some are well, well done and others are not.

124
00:13:54,200 --> 00:14:01,190
But there is some suggestive evidence showing that perhaps the amount, the viral load, they call it,

125
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:08,390
that someone gets might result in more serious infection versus somebody who might be exposed to just a little bit.

126
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,640
And that's part of the reason they think maps are particularly effective at at least, if nothing else,

127
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:22,340
reducing that viral load, if not completely eliminating exposure, viability and virulence.

128
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:28,970
Survivability is that ability to replicate. So if it's unable to replicate, it's not going to last very long.

129
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,180
It's just going to die off with whatever host it is currently in.

130
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:43,370
So that ability to to reproduce and spread and then virulence is sort of akin to when we talk about chemicals that toxicity, how potent is it?

131
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:51,740
How much disease can it cause? So in biological agents, we proven that a lot less virulent.

132
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,920
And then again, we have a lot of susceptibility factors.

133
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:01,970
We see this in chemical exposures as well, but it's much more pronounced, I think, in biological agents.

134
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:11,660
So, again, with flu killed it, whatever it might be, some people obviously react much more negatively than others.

135
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:18,550
Again, some of that could be due to viral load, but a lot of it does also have to do with how susceptibility.

136
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:25,240
Any questions so far? Very.

137
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:35,800
I'm not used to teaching this early this year. OK, so how do we how do we signify biological hazards?

138
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,360
You may have seen has anybody seen this figure before? This this logo.

139
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,750
So there's a bit of a back story to this, which I think is kind of interesting.

140
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:53,980
It actually appeared in a nineteen sixty seven issue of Science magazine or something about how they went about creating this this symbol.

141
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:58,810
But they knew they needed something that was kind of striking in appearance,

142
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:05,790
but something that people would be able to recognize that it means something and hopefully tie it to something dangerous.

143
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:13,180
So if you have a package is being delivered and it has a dangerous virus and it needs to be labeled.

144
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:18,190
Right, that's the law. So they wanted to come up with a way to do that effectively.

145
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:25,510
And back then, it was it was done by by Dow Chemical for their own internal purposes.

146
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:31,990
But it's since become more universal. And they wanted something that's easy to draw.

147
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:37,300
So if you're on the fly and you're, you know, transferring something that's dangerous,

148
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,760
you don't have to go out and order off Amazon that in the 60s, but you know what I mean.

149
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,380
So, you know, you could be able to draw it on a box if needed or something like that.

150
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:54,280
So. So it would be fairly easy to replicate this, just a free hand or with a stencil.

151
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:59,560
So what they did was they had a panel and they did a little study where they had a group of folks

152
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:06,610
come in and look at different symbols and try to kind of rate them on their identifiability,

153
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:10,810
recognition, things like that, and what each one meant.

154
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:16,090
So they had a bunch that were nonsense, a bunch that were potential biohazard symbols,

155
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:24,370
and then a bunch that were just kind of brand recognizable things that you have some oil companies, you got Mr. Peanut here, things like that.

156
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:27,730
So they had people kind of look through those. And again,

157
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:33,700
the ones that they're considering because biohazard and then they looked at the results and then a while later they

158
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:40,570
had the same people come back and most people remembered this orange and black symbol that they had come up with.

159
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:51,160
So that's part of how they ended up with that. So there was a little bit of science behind it with with a group of study participants.

160
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:59,230
OK, so let's go in a bit more detail on these types of biological hazards.

161
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,820
So these are the main types of bacteria, E. coli, as an example there,

162
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:16,030
fungi aspergillus is a very common type of mold or fungi that's in indoor settings, parasite's technology,

163
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:22,210
hypnosis, other types of food borne things, arbo viruses, as we talked about,

164
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:27,830
mosquitoes, spiders, other things that could spread disease, other viruses.

165
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:33,910
That's where you get influenza, coronaviruses, et cetera. And then finally, pyo prions that we'll discuss.

166
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:38,860
Those are proteins that are quite serious.

167
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:47,110
OK, so if you're looking for any holiday gifts ever, birthday gifts, you can actually order stuffed animals of some of these microorganisms.

168
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:54,270
Very kind of kind of funny that somebody actually did this, but they are available if anyone's interested.

169
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:59,470
But so I just have one example for each of these here.

170
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:07,250
So the first one is bacteria. So these are simple one celled organisms and this is E. coli under a microscope.

171
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,810
And this is what it looks like as a cuddly toy.

172
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:18,610
So there's three different subcategories in the way the category is that is based on their shape or morphology.

173
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:26,420
So here we have Coxie Misalliance Gorilla, and you can see under this microscope images, they do look quite different.

174
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,020
So this Coxie is more of a round shape.

175
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:38,050
These are more of the bacilli, is more of a rod shaped and then spiral, as you might guess, from the name, kind of a spiral shape.

176
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:43,030
So that's one way they classify different types of bacteria.

177
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:48,430
So bacteria, there's there's just so many different types of bacteria. Some are harmful.

178
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:53,650
We think about, you know, maybe with indoor air quality, things like that in our field.

179
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:57,970
Many are just they're they're harmless and then some are even useful.

180
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:05,620
So what's you might think of examples of bacteria that are useful, like bacteria?

181
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:10,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

182
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,840
So bioremediation is a big use of of different types of bacteria, gut microbes.

183
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,540
You know, in some types of food you might like. Yogurt has some bacteria in there.

184
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:33,030
So, yeah, there's there's a lot of. Of good bacteria, but some bacteria like E. coli can be can be deadly great.

185
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:40,290
So bacteria, E. coli ingestions a big concern, but skin to other types of bacteria.

186
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:45,720
You know, every couple of years there's a news article about the flesh eating bacteria in Florida.

187
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,570
That's because it's able to get into broken skin.

188
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:54,380
It's a rare bacteria, but it's out there and just the wrong place at the wrong time, it gets through.

189
00:20:54,380 --> 00:21:02,070
Broken skin is very bad. Next one is fungi.

190
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:08,520
So this one is considered the broadest spectrum of different species.

191
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:19,620
Within this, you take an air sample of any indoor outdoor space, you can you can measure a lot of or grow a lot of fungi from that.

192
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:28,650
They're just all around us. These can be acidic, meaning they get their nourishment from a living organism or they can be what's called sacrificially,

193
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:33,420
which means they get their nourishment from decaying that sort of like anybody do mushroom

194
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:39,210
hunting in the spring from their own mushrooms that be kind of more of a decaying matter.

195
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,330
Certain type of trees, dead trees they like to grow under.

196
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:49,370
And I've been trying to get into I haven't had much luck yet, but it's hard to identify trees when they're dead.

197
00:21:49,370 --> 00:22:00,780
Yeah. And you get better at that anyway. So a lot of people do develop allergies to certain types of airborne fungi.

198
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:11,800
So that can lead to hypersensitivity, allergic response. There's also some skin based fungal diseases, athlete's foot.

199
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:18,220
Which is what this little guy is, and ringworm, things like that.

200
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:24,820
So a big, broad range of different types of fungi out there, again, might be harmful, might might be harmless.

201
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:39,730
Some might even be edible intelligence. The next group is parasites, so things that need to live within other organisms or parasitic.

202
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:44,350
So this includes malaria, which, as was touched on earlier,

203
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:56,530
is still endemic and quite serious in certain parts of the world with a mosquito vector borne issue, how to control things like that.

204
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:06,380
There's other blood ingi infections that are parasitic. So roundworm tapeworms, things like that.

205
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:14,720
There's also skin based ones, mites, et cetera, so parasites quite serious,

206
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:22,780
but maybe a smaller list and total of different types that that we're concerned about.

207
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:29,830
The next is arbovirus, so this word always reminds me of Ann Arbor, but not related.

208
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:33,790
This is named after arthropod borne virus.

209
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,720
So that's where they get our through arbovirus virus.

210
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:47,530
So an arthropod is like a mosquito. Arachnids sort of.

211
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:55,360
Those types of organisms, harbor viruses, can be very serious.

212
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:05,290
Again, this is a vector borne type of infection, so dengue fever, fever, this got here, yellow fever, Rift Valley fever.

213
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:11,080
There's a lot of specialized regional names for things that are viruses.

214
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:19,790
So West Nile and we'll cover some of these as we go through today.

215
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:29,210
And then other types of viruses, so viruses, small unknown organisms, but, you know, they can't really live out in the open on their own.

216
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:35,680
So, again, they need that host to to be able to survive.

217
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:46,060
So, you know, these, again, can be a concern occupationally or environmentally, so pox viruses, norovirus every year, that's an issue.

218
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:53,350
Influenza, of course, that's an coronaviruses. And then Ebola is another example.

219
00:24:53,350 --> 00:25:04,170
This is a picture of people under a microscope. So a pretty broad range of other viruses that that can be a concern.

220
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,580
And the last group is prions, so where do they get that name?

221
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:19,350
So this is a protein that causes infection. So, again, the parts from the protein and then the iron is from infection.

222
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:24,330
These are rare, but can be quite scary.

223
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:28,350
So one is bovine spongiform encephalopathy. It looks like this.

224
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:31,460
Anybody know the common term for that? Right.

225
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:44,640
Mad cow disease from from eating tainted meat where the livestock is fed the wrong thing, for example, other dead cows brains.

226
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:51,100
That's how that can that can start to form. So this was a big issue, I think, in the UK for a while.

227
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:56,070
Still growing at issue here.

228
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:02,070
Yes. Yes, it could be. Which obviously is a concern around here as well.

229
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:07,200
So, you know, once it gets in the body, it can be similar to a viral infection.

230
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:16,050
It's caused the protein folding, which then can lead to very serious consequences in the nervous system.

231
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:23,040
So it affects the structure of the brain and neural tissues and is pretty much 100 percent fatal once you get it.

232
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,200
So it's very serious, but still luckily pretty rare.

233
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:35,100
And they but for example, the the meat industry has gotten it pretty well under control as far as beef.

234
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:41,430
But if it's in other animals that people are hunting for and not really that don't really go through the food processing system,

235
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:48,760
it's got some quality control testing and things like that, then it could be the big issue.

236
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:56,380
And it's resistant to some of the decontamination you can do so, you know, it's not like you can get rid of it in the processing stuff.

237
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:06,300
It's more about testing for it and trying to find sources of it because it can usually be tracked back to what the animals are eating.

238
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:14,160
So that's the basic breakdown of the different types of biohazards we think about.

239
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:22,980
So, again, a lot of settings where people can be exposed who might be more likely to be exposed, this could be occupationally or or environmentally.

240
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:27,690
So some occupational ones, health care facilities. Of course,

241
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:33,300
you have people there because of the biological hazard or it might be around or

242
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:40,080
otherwise research facilities might actually be working with some of these.

243
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:47,340
You know, that's why we take extreme care and containing viruses, bacteria that are harmful.

244
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:54,900
And we have different biosafety levels in the lab, um, different requirements for how to take care of those.

245
00:27:54,900 --> 00:28:02,550
If you've seen any movies, I guess, any movies about pandemics where they go into the lab and they get all suited up with the air,

246
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:06,150
that's like a level four where you don't want any contact.

247
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:14,880
You have to decontaminate before you go in. When you come out of a lot of lock out, you know, hardly anybody can get in things like that.

248
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,340
So but there are breaches that occur.

249
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:28,110
So that's got to be kept in mind. Agriculture is a big one. So farmers, farm workers exposed to a lot of different things could be a plant based,

250
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:36,240
animal based, soil based, all that talked about zoonotic diseases.

251
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:44,040
So anybody working with animals, veterinary clinics, things like that, biotech facilities, forestry,

252
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:54,510
any time you're out in the woods, there's a lot of bugs and critters that you want to worry about child care facilities.

253
00:28:54,510 --> 00:29:03,690
I go further and say elementary schools are just a petri dish of germs, right where the kids interact.

254
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:12,390
They're not concerned with hygiene at all. So you can have pretty good spread of various things.

255
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:20,690
And then sewage contains this or anything along the lines of that could be a risk.

256
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:28,130
OK, so usually there's there's quite a few or at least a handful of nurses and other people that work in health care settings in this class.

257
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:34,130
So just a little bit more on that. So you have community acquired.

258
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:37,760
So, you know, as an employee at a health care facility,

259
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,810
you have to be concerned about people who are coming in with the flu or whatever

260
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:48,980
transmissible disease it might be then you have occupationally acquired.

261
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:57,680
So, again, with covid last year after the initial lockdown, there is a lot of concern about back to work.

262
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:03,470
Front line workers are still at super high risk, even especially now.

263
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:08,010
You've got good for a while with vaccine. And now there's questions about, you know, boosters and all that.

264
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:18,040
So, you know, they're really right there on the front lines with regard to occupationally acquired.

265
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:23,270
Disease, and then you have going the other direction, nosocomial, they call it,

266
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:28,390
that's where a patient might get an infection from being at the hospital.

267
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:37,290
And this can happen, you know, with surgery. You have sterilization issues, things like that.

268
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,600
So this data, you know, it's old and kind of general, but the cause, they say, is unknown,

269
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,420
about 80 percent of hospital and lab infections, it's a lot of times hard to trace back.

270
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:55,860
But of those that they were able to do a good investigation on there,

271
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:02,610
they think that 80 percent were caused by human error and maybe 20 percent of equipment here.

272
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:07,690
We'll talk a little bit more about that in a little bit.

273
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:16,090
Look, any questions or comments thus far the that just cause right now is a kind of just thing?

274
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:22,320
I mean, this is obviously in a hospital and this is kind of the state line that is.

275
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,060
Yeah. Yeah. That could be you know, maybe they weren't trying that hard.

276
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:31,840
It could be a big part of that or because it might take a while for it to show up.

277
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:36,790
Maybe there's just you know, it's hard to trace back everything they did for the past month, right.

278
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:41,560
Day to day who they interacted with so that that might be another piece.

279
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:47,620
So there's there's a range of reasons why that might be. And it depends on what the the infection is, too.

280
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:52,600
Right. So we'll talk a little bit later about needle sticks is a big one.

281
00:31:52,600 --> 00:32:04,720
So hopefully people can remember that. But, you know, if the needle was small enough, maybe it did occur without somebody really knowing it.

282
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,830
So now we're going to move to routes of exposure.

283
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:13,480
So you guys have been introduced this and the previous lectures in this course.

284
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:20,050
But now we're going to talk about it in the context of the biological agents.

285
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:28,450
So you have percutaneous meaning going through the skin. So that's like the needlestick injury that is mentioned, nonpoor, cutaneous,

286
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:37,120
could be something on the skin or otherwise available to interact with mucous membranes and get into the body inhalation.

287
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:46,000
So obviously, why we're all wearing masks right now is to prevent the inhalation hazard and also prevent the source.

288
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:56,530
So it's a to a twofold reason we wear masks, one, to to keep the things in and then one, for preventing things to to get it from someone else.

289
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:02,470
And then finally, we have ingestion. So, uh, contaminated water with biological agents is a big concern.

290
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,310
Food. So that's the final round of exposure.

291
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:11,260
And we'll go through each one of these somewhat briefly.

292
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:21,100
So one way to illustrate this, different amounts of exposure, how things might differ even within the same agent is with anthrax.

293
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:31,510
So anthrax is a very serious bacteria, bacillus anthracis, but it is present in agricultural settings,

294
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:36,010
again, with certain types of animals might be carriers, but it can occur.

295
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:42,370
Infection can occur through multiple rounds of exposure. So through skin inhalation and and ingestion.

296
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:47,400
So it covers the three main ones.

297
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:59,850
So talking about skin, so this is the most common, naturally occurring infection with regards to anthrax, luckily the other two are rare.

298
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:06,810
So this is if you're working with animals, you have a break in your skin, a cut in your skin, comes into contact with that bacteria.

299
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:14,160
Then you might have an infection of the skin and has an incubation period of one to 12 days.

300
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:20,940
So, again, you know, 12 days later, you're like, I don't even know what I was doing 12 days ago and you don't know how many days ago it was.

301
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,820
So, again, tracing some of these kids could get could get difficult.

302
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:32,130
So, you know, you get a it looks bad headache, fever, things like that.

303
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:37,830
But it's it's typically not super serious. It should be treatable.

304
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:42,370
So it's with the skin exposure when you go to inhalation exposure.

305
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:47,700
This is where things get elevated. This is the most lethal form of anthrax.

306
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:53,480
A lot of you probably are old enough, but a lot of coverage of 9/11 last week.

307
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,210
Great. Something that happened in the month following 9/11.

308
00:34:57,210 --> 00:35:03,810
This picture here, there was a rash of various issues with anthrax,

309
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:14,790
very finely powdered form of anthrax that people are sending through the mail to senators and Congress men, things like that as a bioterrorism act.

310
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:18,960
So that shut down a lot of post offices, congressional buildings, things like that,

311
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:26,400
while they had to investigate because somebody had found a way to weaponize the anthrax,

312
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:35,730
to make it in such a small particle form that it could be aerosolized and breathe, which then would be much more serious than just skin exposure.

313
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:39,090
So if it's breathed, then has an incubation period of, you know,

314
00:35:39,090 --> 00:35:46,750
one to seven days or possibly two months, and it's highly variable, kind of hard to study in humans.

315
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,140
Don't get a lot of willing participants to take a look at this.

316
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:55,170
So it's hard to piece together what this might look like if that makes sense.

317
00:35:55,170 --> 00:36:05,190
You know, they do the best they can to investigate things like this, but that's the best estimate they have for incubation period.

318
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,190
The symptoms involve sore throat fever, muscle aches,

319
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:17,430
and then ultimately respiratory failure and shock and hospital in about three of three or four cases.

320
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:18,990
So luckily, naturally occurring.

321
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:26,880
A lot of times the anthrax isn't able to get aerosolized in such a manner that it gets breathed in a way that's going to be harmful.

322
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:38,040
But again, there is that concern for people with more sinister goals to to process that in a way that could happen.

323
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:49,440
Luckily, we haven't seen that recently. As far as I know, in the third round of exposure for anthrax is through the GI tract or ingestion.

324
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,980
So contaminated meat that's undercooked.

325
00:36:52,980 --> 00:37:00,060
Here we have an incubation period of a day to a week and sore throat fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting.

326
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,930
So even the symptoms might look a little different depending on the amount of exposure.

327
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:10,560
And this one is not as deadly as the inhalation, but still, you know, 25 to 50 percent of cases,

328
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:19,980
we may die so much more serious than the skin exposure, but not as serious as the information.

329
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:29,880
So, again, that was to illustrate differences and and root through the same the same age some more a little bit more on the percutaneous route.

330
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:38,790
So I mentioned Sharp, so we didn't cover this one for anthrax, but for other things, we have the sharps injuries, animal bites.

331
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:47,490
So, you know, FedEx, Amazon delivery people, animal control people that clinics again and then bug bites,

332
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:52,450
anything that's vector borne or venom related there.

333
00:37:52,450 --> 00:38:00,890
And these are just arrows to different types of populations that might be at risk. So first is needlestick injury.

334
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:07,020
So, again, these data might be a little bit outdated, but they're aggregated over time.

335
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:15,200
So the CDC estimates three hundred eighty five thousand music and other Sharpes related injuries in US hospitals per year.

336
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:24,650
That's more than a thousand per day nationwide. So it's an issue, but they think maybe half of these go unreported.

337
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:29,120
Do you have any thoughts as to why that might be?

338
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:38,120
There is one I'm embarrassed, maybe they feel like they they did something wrong with their work practices, but the paperwork, paperwork,

339
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:44,810
they don't want to be burdened with filling out forms and reporting structures, anything else,

340
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:53,480
even legal reasons they might get into trouble if they feel like they did something incorrectly or something.

341
00:38:53,480 --> 00:39:04,430
All right. Those are good. Good. So some people these days, hopefully it's untrained, ingrained in the training.

342
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:10,940
But, you know, years ago, people may not have realized it was a hazard.

343
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:15,770
But now with OSHA bloodborne pathogens as a thrust area the past couple of decades,

344
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:22,730
hopefully people know that if you get stuck by a needle, it's serious. You need to need to report it.

345
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:31,280
People thinking it's no big deal. It must happen all the time. The reporting burden which was mentioned and then the fear of punishment, you know,

346
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:40,340
they don't want to lose their job because they may have made a mistake or the may think that their employer sees it as a liability, whatever.

347
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:48,920
It might be so important to make sure it's known that it's an issue and to properly report

348
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:56,390
some of the main concerns with needlestick injuries involve HIV and then hepatitis B or C.

349
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:03,740
So if you have an infected patient, those old needles, you're disposing of them, otherwise working with them.

350
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,180
And you could have that accidental percutaneous entry.

351
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:17,750
Of course, in a community setting, IV drug use is a big way that these get these get transferred.

352
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:25,460
So it's not just hospitals, but within the hospital who's most susceptible or most at risk.

353
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:38,840
Almost half of all of these injuries are with nurses, much less for other types of technologies, housekeepers, MDS, surgery attendants, etc.

354
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:48,990
So nurses bear most of the brunt with this this risk.

355
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,820
When is this occurring?

356
00:40:50,820 --> 00:41:04,230
So according to these data from CDC, about half the time during the use of the of the of the sharp object, about 30 percent after use before disposal,

357
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:12,570
11 percent disposal related and then other types of activities that might be going on, trying to replace a cap, whatever it is.

358
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:22,350
And then with what? So you have a suture needle here, disposable syringe and other types of thin catheters, scalpels, et cetera.

359
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:32,240
So again, it's mostly needles of some sort, but other other sharps as well could be possible.

360
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:44,340
I think so that's Sharpes in the hospital. I think you might come back to this when you talk about exposure controls later in the semester.

361
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:54,480
Some other percutaneously exposure examples, so you have various types of venom, also allergic response is possible to some of these as well.

362
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,230
Based on that, so spiders, snakes, scorpions, the great outdoors.

363
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,670
And some of these are regional, of course. So what? We don't have scorpions here.

364
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:11,790
We don't have a ton of venomous snakes. There is a rattlesnake that's native to Michigan.

365
00:42:11,790 --> 00:42:19,380
It's not as venomous as some of the other types of rattlesnakes, but they're they're pretty rare around here.

366
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:27,630
Spiders, I think the UVM library had some brown recluses last year, made the news as big time news stories.

367
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:43,420
So you just never know. OK, so that's percutaneous Sanon percutaneously, we're talking about mucous membranes, not InTech skin, skin breaks.

368
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:51,890
So one prime example here is Ebola. So this was, you know, it's always a threat.

369
00:42:51,890 --> 00:43:09,040
And every once in a while you have an outbreak. So the last big outbreak was 12, 14 to 16 down in Sierra Leone and Liberia, that area of Africa and.

370
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:14,320
All said and done for that particular outbreak, they were looking at twenty eight thousand suspected cases,

371
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:20,500
about fifteen thousand confirmed cases, and of those fifteen thousand confirmed cases, over eleven thousand deaths.

372
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:28,840
So extremely serious when you get it, fatality rate is quite high.

373
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:36,220
But the one thing that makes it I don't want to say easy, but that's unique about it is is how it spread,

374
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:41,530
which then is how you approach treating and controlling the spread.

375
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:55,850
So it is spread based on, you know, somebody gets infected, they get in a really bad way and basically start bleeding from the inside and.

376
00:43:55,850 --> 00:44:04,690
You know, vomiting, diarrhea, all that is then infected material that then needs to get into another human through mucous membranes.

377
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:09,850
So as long as you have, that's why you see when people are responding to these outbreaks, they're all suited up.

378
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:21,760
Decontamination is is extremely important. All those hygienic controls need to be in place to prevent that spread, but it can be done.

379
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,610
So the one good thing about Ebola is it's are not value. That's this what we call a reproduction.

380
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:31,870
No, infectious disease epidemiology is quite low.

381
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:36,310
So for every person that's infected, they typically only infect one or two other people.

382
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:41,260
Now, that's going to be a much greater number early on, probably in an outbreak when people don't know what it is,

383
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:46,750
they've got to care for somebody not suited up or anything, then you could have a lot more spread.

384
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:54,610
But once they identify where it is, you can be a lot more careful about containing that.

385
00:44:54,610 --> 00:45:00,910
So this are not. No, depends on the duration of contagiousness or infectivity,

386
00:45:00,910 --> 00:45:05,770
the infectiousness of the agent that we talked about before and then or the viability

387
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:09,790
we talked about and then the number of susceptible people who might be in contact.

388
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:15,220
So something that spreads through non percutaneously tend to luckily be a little less reproduction.

389
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:21,310
No, you see, these ones with a larger reproduction number tend to be more airborne.

390
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:28,630
So something that can get out in the air and then breathe by other people, you're going to potentially infect a lot more.

391
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:39,190
Has anybody seen a reproduction number for sars-cov-2 or covid virus where you seem to think it was original?

392
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:44,110
Pretty yellow somewhere around three? Yeah, yeah. I've seen anywhere from three to five.

393
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:47,470
And, you know, it's really a function of control as well.

394
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:51,910
Right. So it's kind of a lagging indicator where, you know, pretty locked down.

395
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:55,840
It's going to be high during lock down, you'd see that reproduction number probably go way down.

396
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:01,300
But then once people go out and go about their lives again, you're going to see that reproduction number jobs.

397
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:11,870
So it's it's not necessarily I mean, it's related to the virus itself, but it also has some social factors, too, if it's not a variable rate.

398
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:16,720
So the measles quite high, 12 to 18.

399
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:25,410
So that's what we went out there with, with with coronavirus.

400
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:31,910
So that's nonpoor, continuous onto inhalation Sunways, so we're concerned about what we call bio aerosols.

401
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:40,450
So these are things in the air that are living or they're byproducts. So you might have I mentioned aspergillus.

402
00:46:40,450 --> 00:46:47,100
That's one type of fungi in the air that you can measure quite readily which bacteria could be in the air.

403
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:56,530
Obviously, viruses in the air, dead microorganisms can also cause allergic problems.

404
00:46:56,530 --> 00:47:00,790
Other things, fragments of pollen allergies.

405
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:11,210
That's a big deal. Toxin's aflatoxin is something that can develop quite, quite dangerous,

406
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:17,870
and the toxin is another one from gram negative bacteria and that's common in agriculture.

407
00:47:17,870 --> 00:47:30,160
So you can have like grains, hay or something and a being stored and if you have some some growth and then that could give off some some endotoxin.

408
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:42,420
Of particular wastes, so another indoor air quality issues, it's things like dust mites, cockroach waste, other things, and then finally vapor.

409
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:49,940
So a certain bacteria or molds might put off chemicals actually in their life cycle.

410
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:59,840
That might be dangerous. I mentioned aflatoxin, so this is one type of aspergillus,

411
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:06,980
aspergillus is a very broad family, some toxic, some not, this one happens to be quite toxic.

412
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:11,420
It's known as the most carcinogenic, naturally occurring compound, actually.

413
00:48:11,420 --> 00:48:18,800
And there's some cases of outbreaks that have happened, again, with grain storage, improper grain storage and then spreading.

414
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,950
In this case, it was airborne and infected a lot of livestock.

415
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:33,440
Turkeys in this case, but it can be found on peanuts and so there is some risk with eating moldy peanuts, uh,

416
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:40,100
the food supply here in the US is pretty good about preventing that from getting into the peanut supply.

417
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:53,730
But, you know, as more locally sourced things, which is great, but, you know, you just want to watch out for peanuts in particular.

418
00:48:53,730 --> 00:49:03,960
Another or airborne, one of bacteria in this case is Legionella. So this dates back to nineteen seventy six at an American Legion conference.

419
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:08,130
That's where the name actually comes from.

420
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:18,150
Two thousand people there in this hotel, the Bellevue Stratford Hotel, and a whole bunch of the people attending the conference got sick.

421
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:27,930
Twenty five of them died. And it turned out to be this bacteria in the cooling tower of the hotel that resulted in the aerosolized.

422
00:49:27,930 --> 00:49:31,140
Sometimes it can be a water fountain that have bacteria,

423
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:38,790
this particular bacteria growing in the cooling tower and it makes its way to a lobby fountain,

424
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:46,470
something like that or or through the water gets aerosolized when using your faucet, whatever it might be.

425
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:51,150
It happened here. And there are some other cases as well that have happened elsewhere.

426
00:49:51,150 --> 00:49:54,450
It has been a big deal in hospitals sometimes.

427
00:49:54,450 --> 00:50:04,110
Again, any place with a cooling tower and recirculating water, you just want to look for those conditions.

428
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:13,540
Another airborne inhalation one, this is a different coronavirus from six years ago,

429
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:20,940
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Merz was the disease caused by this particular coronavirus.

430
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,330
This was in the Middle East, as you might guess, from the name.

431
00:50:24,330 --> 00:50:30,300
But luckily, in this in this event and these popping up all the time.

432
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:36,480
And when I first heard of sars-cov-2, I'm like, OK, I hope this turns out to be like the Commerz.

433
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,340
You know, it's a very bad but they actually were able to contain it.

434
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:48,700
So here they had about fifteen hundred cases, but about a third of those died.

435
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:54,840
However, they were able to prevent it from spreading more. That could be due to a lot of things, policies.

436
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,640
Sometimes the virus might burn itself out, things like that.

437
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:11,520
But with international travel these days, you know, containment becomes very tricky, as we've said, even domestically, very difficult to contain.

438
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:19,410
So, yeah, I'm here next year and we're still wearing masks, start questioning our ability to do things effectively.

439
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:26,840
So that's worse. So that's some examples of inhalation. Any questions on that?

440
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:43,180
Concerns. OK, pathway is also an important thing, so we're still talking about sars-cov-2 recovered, you have airborn is very important.

441
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:47,650
It took a while for people to recognize the airborne piece.

442
00:51:47,650 --> 00:51:53,440
But you also have early on, a lot of people were concerned about what we call fomites right where it surfaces.

443
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:00,850
But the data does suggest that it's most likely more of the airborne than the surface.

444
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:08,920
It's not saying that surfaces can't happen. But, you know, personally, I stopped wiping down my groceries when I bring home stuff like that,

445
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:15,190
because you haven't heard a lot of case reports of that being the source of an outbreak.

446
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:23,470
You hear much more about social gatherings, which which tends to be more airborne related.

447
00:52:23,470 --> 00:52:32,870
Don't get me wrong, I still wash my hands extremely frequently and sanitizer, especially around eating animal contact, stuff like that.

448
00:52:32,870 --> 00:52:43,130
OK, so we move on to ingestion, so here I mentioned for my could lead to ingestion inadvertently, but when we talk about ingestion,

449
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:52,210
we're usually primarily more about food and water that might be contaminated with a biological hazard.

450
00:52:52,210 --> 00:53:00,760
So, again, this is sort of lagging data, but for food here in the US, we have among the world's safest food supplies,

451
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:07,240
but we still have an estimated forty eight million cases of food poisoning.

452
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:14,740
And that leads to hundreds of thousands of hospitalizations and a couple thousand deaths each year from food borne illness.

453
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:22,660
So we have a lot of quality control in place for food supply, but still can happen,

454
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:30,880
especially when you get into the preparation of that's an important component. There's some variability there.

455
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:36,140
Here's just a few examples, so I remember I still remember this from when I was a kid,

456
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:41,680
early 90s E. coli outbreak, and they don't have these around here.

457
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,440
But the anybody from the west here, they still have Jack in the box.

458
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:55,150
Yeah. So you're not at risk.

459
00:53:55,150 --> 00:54:02,710
So this is at a Jack in the Box franchise. I can't remember just one store if it is multiple.

460
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:11,500
I think it was multiple outlets, but six hundred twenty three people were infected and there was a handful of deaths from this,

461
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,250
from undercooked meat that was contaminated.

462
00:54:15,250 --> 00:54:19,930
So that's why, you know, at restaurants, every time you look at the menu, at the bottom, there's the fine print.

463
00:54:19,930 --> 00:54:28,030
It says eating undercooked fish and meat, it could be a risk that's for their for their own liability.

464
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:36,130
I guess so. But, you know, I still order a steak, medium rare steak.

465
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,050
You know, the surface is intact.

466
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:45,370
So my thinking is the inside of it isn't going to be contaminated E. coli from touching various surfaces and people handling it.

467
00:54:45,370 --> 00:54:48,080
Where you get that is more of a ground beef. Right.

468
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:55,900
That's got that surface that might be have been come in contact with contamination, might be somewhere in the middle because it's ground up.

469
00:54:55,900 --> 00:55:03,490
Right. So that's where you're getting like a hammer. You want to make sure it's at least medium, if not not more.

470
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:09,970
So there's that this one's I don't want to say funny, but nobody died.

471
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:13,480
So this was one of my former students.

472
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,930
His his wife worked at NSF International here in Ann Arbor.

473
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:21,850
They do a lot of certification for water filters, a lot of food safety stuff.

474
00:55:21,850 --> 00:55:27,400
So she worked for them and she was at this food safety conference in Baltimore and turned out it was

475
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:34,060
a big outbreak of food poisoning that was linked to contaminated chicken marsala that was served.

476
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:41,230
So, again, fortunately, it wasn't super serious. But we like to call this deliciously ironic because they're all there for a food

477
00:55:41,230 --> 00:55:47,620
safety conference and a bunch of them got sick due to lack of food safety.

478
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:52,180
This one is strange. So this is probably before everyone's time.

479
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,810
Has anyone heard of this? Yeah. Yeah. Are you from the West?

480
00:55:55,810 --> 00:56:03,280
You can go and watch the documentary, OK. Was that what the documentary called you?

481
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:09,260
Well, what it serves is that Netflix or those on that.

482
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:16,480
OK, I might look out for that one. But anyway, there's a Wikipedia page on this as well.

483
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,940
But it's interesting. But so it's Rajneeshee group.

484
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:30,700
So it was kind of a religious group that had a strong presence in Oregon back in the 80s.

485
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:40,150
I followed this guy and they wanted to get into local politics so they could impose some of their thinking in there.

486
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:47,860
Um, you know, one of the things to go the way they believed, so they started running for office locally.

487
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:56,260
And instead of just trying to win the election, they tried to poison everybody so only their followers could vote on Election Day.

488
00:56:56,260 --> 00:57:06,610
So they went around to various salad bars and, uh, put salmonella in there and actually sickened seven hundred and fifty people.

489
00:57:06,610 --> 00:57:11,640
But they were ultimately caught and got in big trouble. So but yeah.

490
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:17,050
Is kind of a really wild story. Yeah. It was kind of wild, wild country.

491
00:57:17,050 --> 00:57:24,790
OK, on Netflix. So look for that one next time I get a minute.

492
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:29,170
So that's a couple of examples of food poisoning. But, you know, very common.

493
00:57:29,170 --> 00:57:35,140
I'm sure many of you have experienced, you know, somebody that's been impacted by that.

494
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:43,300
And again, it can be difficult to trace. So, you know, because the symptoms might look a lot like something else, it can be very difficult.

495
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:48,400
But way they do it sometimes is, you know, a lot of these examples, you have hundreds of people.

496
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:55,030
So if you have a lot of people coming back, then you could trace it to a single restaurant or event or same type of food.

497
00:57:55,030 --> 00:58:01,090
That's how these tend to come about. And then you have a lot recalls.

498
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:08,410
See these all the time. They don't advertise them that well. A lot of times it's buried in the news where they're recalling, you know,

499
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:14,440
a million tons of chicken from Tyson or something that you that I don't know.

500
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:23,040
I feel like they need to do a better job of getting the word out because. It's usually buried anyhow.

501
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:28,980
OK, so that's food, drinking water, so kind of like with food in the United States has among the world's safest water supplies.

502
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:33,030
But, you know, this is, again, some lagging data.

503
00:58:33,030 --> 00:58:45,720
But there might be a thousand cases of illness, several dozen hospitalizations and a handful of deaths on any given year based on contaminated water.

504
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:54,000
This was a much bigger deal back in the old days before they knew how to treat water effectively to disinfect it.

505
00:58:54,000 --> 00:59:03,030
But it can still be an issue. One example in nineteen ninety three, same as the Jack in the Box here, the banner year for biohazardous I guess.

506
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:07,600
But this is in Milwaukee. Anybody here from Wisconsin.

507
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:15,330
Milwaukee. But this is the largest ever outbreak with a public water source in the US.

508
00:59:15,330 --> 00:59:18,580
They have private wells are their own thing, right.

509
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:26,250
If you have a public municipal water source these days, they go to great lengths to disinfect the water to make sure it's safe.

510
00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:35,490
However, in this particular case, they're using chlorination, which turned out to not be effective against this cryptosporidium contamination.

511
00:59:35,490 --> 00:59:40,380
So it ended up in 400000 residents being exposed and over one hundred deaths from

512
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:45,510
this from this happening there that basically shut everything down and investigate.

513
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:52,710
And they found out it was this particular iridium and their treatment wasn't effective.

514
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:58,840
So they had to change the type of water treatment, which is extremely expensive to do.

515
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:05,990
That's one example. Luckily, there's not a lot of other examples here in the US of of outbreaks,

516
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:15,010
but globally, of course, clean water is still a big struggle in many countries.

517
01:00:15,010 --> 01:00:21,130
So how do we assess biological hazards, so this is a combination of things, again,

518
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:26,080
maybe not as straightforward as as your physical hazards or chemical hazards.

519
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:31,180
You know, we're thinking it's going to vary depending on what the actual agent is in the scenario.

520
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:39,330
But I'm going to think about what's the infectious dose? How much of something is going to be dangerous, that route exposure or infection?

521
01:00:39,330 --> 01:00:44,500
Talk about the pathogenesis and virulence for the viability and virulence the range.

522
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:54,940
Again, that airborne versus other modes of transmission vectors, mosquitos, very, very efficient vectors,

523
01:00:54,940 --> 01:01:01,570
prairie dogs, maybe not as much disease incidence and severity, prevention and treatment.

524
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:11,620
How serious is that disease? How much, uh, how invasive do you want to be in the prevention efforts if it's something that's not very serious,

525
01:01:11,620 --> 01:01:15,880
you know, like bee stings for most people aren't allergic.

526
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,230
Right. So they don't go around killing all the bees because bees serve a purpose.

527
01:01:20,230 --> 01:01:27,490
But for other things that are more serious, we'd go to more lengths to try to prevent that.

528
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:31,540
And then other non-human affects plants, animals, fish.

529
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:38,350
There are outbreaks of fish all the time, various diseases on other animals.

530
01:01:38,350 --> 01:01:48,770
Deer mentioned that wasting disease is another one that could be related to the prions.

531
01:01:48,770 --> 01:01:54,520
OK, so vector borne diseases back to back to these mosquitoes again, one,

532
01:01:54,520 --> 01:02:06,890
your primary vectors for malaria plague we talked about could be more small mammals, yellow fever, dengue fever, West Nile, Rift Valley fever.

533
01:02:06,890 --> 01:02:14,660
I mean, there's there's so many different ones. And there there's new ones that come about every once in a while and Zika a few years ago.

534
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:21,290
So I have a study done in Puerto Rico. Zika virus was hit there pretty hard.

535
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:33,420
So we're keeping a close eye on that. Chikungunya is another one that they have outbreaks down there every once in a while as well.

536
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:39,330
Global deaths from vector borne diseases, so this is something the average American may not think about much,

537
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:52,350
but again, where you have climate is conducive to Vector's hygiene issues and other factors.

538
01:02:52,350 --> 01:03:03,360
You do see very high rates in Africa and some other places, vector borne disease deaths.

539
01:03:03,360 --> 01:03:09,150
And you guys have come back to this in maybe your year end of semester debates talking

540
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:15,840
about various interventions that might the pros and cons to trying to get out of this.

541
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:27,850
Here's another one. Dengue fever from the time of the fifties to the mid 20s, very rapid increase in dengue fever cases.

542
01:03:27,850 --> 01:03:33,670
West Nile virus, again, it varies quite a bit by region and by year,

543
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:39,190
so you can see this is just an example from this is from a National Academies report that came out a few years ago.

544
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,900
So that's why the data is a little old.

545
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:54,460
But I think interesting nonetheless, that some years you see nothing and then other years you see various areas of outbreak with West Nile.

546
01:03:54,460 --> 01:04:01,630
And again, there's a lot of post susceptibility factors at play here, so West Nile for some people is just a mild fever.

547
01:04:01,630 --> 01:04:14,910
Other people that can can be fatal more regionally here ticks how to tick this summer on a couple.

548
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:20,140
Yeah, yeah, me too. And luckily I got fell in line before it dug in.

549
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:25,450
My son had one last year. I pulled off his skeleton's like stretch his skin.

550
01:04:25,450 --> 01:04:32,630
But, you know, I was checking him every day after that for the target appearance of a rash.

551
01:04:32,630 --> 01:04:38,860
That's one sign of an infected tick bite for for Lyme disease.

552
01:04:38,860 --> 01:04:46,030
But yeah, this, unfortunately, is something with climate change as well as mosquitoes,

553
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:49,690
of course, and other vector borne disease in this in this region.

554
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:57,850
So if the mosquitoes we might see more tropical type diseases in Michigan so that when Zika, the Zika outbreak happened, that was mostly in the south.

555
01:04:57,850 --> 01:05:06,100
Right. As the climate change that's going to keep creeping further and further north, perhaps the same with with ticks,

556
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:12,070
tick season might be extended and then you might see more tick related diseases.

557
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:15,940
So, you know, in any given year, you can go in and look at these data.

558
01:05:15,940 --> 01:05:29,320
But there is has been quite an increase and these tick borne illnesses as well in recent years related to climate and and other factors.

559
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:36,310
Some more current issues in the last few years, so Flindt, everyone talks about the lead,

560
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:40,720
but there was also a Legionnaires outbreak at the same time that they're trying to

561
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:46,210
trace either to the water supply or the hospitals where people were being treated.

562
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:51,790
But there were a handful of deaths from Legionnaires disease at that same time.

563
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:58,410
I mentioned labs work with a lot of nasty things.

564
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:06,630
You know, this is at the center of the whole investigation of where Kobe came from, but, you know, it happens and every time this happens,

565
01:06:06,630 --> 01:06:12,810
then people like me who do lab research and Professor Devine, it makes more rules for us,

566
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:17,880
more red tape for the one incident that happens where somebody didn't follow the rules.

567
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:22,800
That leads to a whole host of things.

568
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,230
I mentioned, Zeca,

569
01:06:25,230 --> 01:06:37,740
that one was interesting because the facts seem to be more for unborn fetuses that is causing microcephaly under growth of the skull,

570
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:46,440
under development of the skull and the brain. So, you know, a lot of emerging issues all the time.

571
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:54,900
This is what I like to mention, because this year or every year at this time of year locally, you'll see it just just check local news.

572
01:06:54,900 --> 01:07:03,990
Usually between now and in October, you'll see an article like this for Eastern Equine Encephalitis.

573
01:07:03,990 --> 01:07:10,390
So it's quite rare, but there's usually just a handful of cases in southeast Michigan every year.

574
01:07:10,390 --> 01:07:17,370
So it's something related to horses and carried by mosquitoes and unfortunately can be fatal.

575
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:24,060
But luckily, it is quite rare. So protect yourself from mosquitoes this time of year.

576
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:28,920
You know, you have to be outside at dawn or dusk.

577
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:37,720
Long sleeves help. DEET is less toxic than pesticides because it's not aimed to kill them.

578
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:43,320
So they is it's quite effective at keeping mosquitoes away.

579
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:48,270
I don't do the thing where I spend my entire yard with pesticides to kill all the mosquitoes.

580
01:07:48,270 --> 01:07:53,100
I have kids and pets and I do want to kill them too.

581
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:56,250
So there's just another article. Like I said, keep an eye out.

582
01:07:56,250 --> 01:08:05,850
Almost every year for the past five or so years, there's been articles like this and just some some resources for you all, if you like.

583
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:12,040
So that's all I have. Any questions or comments at this point?

584
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:20,140
Personal questions, and so a lot of our viewers and like any reading I do and a lot of reading, you're like a couple of years old.

585
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:26,380
They all seem to be kind of like quite a lot of work can be really bad or like the magic and I guess.

586
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:34,490
What was your reaction to kind of becoming a thing and really surprised got this big or you kind of just watch?

587
01:08:34,490 --> 01:08:41,470
I guess so, yeah. At the school we have we have other people who work more in infectious disease

588
01:08:41,470 --> 01:08:45,760
that I think they were a little bit more in the know when it was coming out.

589
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:51,670
And, you know, I was watching the news when it was over in China. I was like, OK, I hope they get that under control.

590
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:56,140
We've seen this with SARS when we see the lemurs where it's a concern,

591
01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:04,030
but it doesn't really, you know, as far as us in America hadn't really impact us.

592
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:11,650
So probably naively hopeful. But then I would talk to some of our infectious disease experts here and they were like, no, this is this is coming.

593
01:09:11,650 --> 01:09:19,970
Whether we like it or not, it's the cat's out of the bag. So so the people who who do this day in and day out, we're we're quite concerned early on.

594
01:09:19,970 --> 01:09:24,640
But of course, the response to it was too little, too late.

595
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,180
And, you know, you could probably still say that.

596
01:09:28,180 --> 01:09:34,470
So it's it's it'll be interesting to see, you know, hopefully we can look back on this and learn from it,

597
01:09:34,470 --> 01:09:43,840
never make it out and see exactly what could have been done, when and how that could have made it not so bad.

598
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:48,120
But that's a really good question. Was there another one? Yeah.

599
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:56,440
What do you what you know, what approach you take with the West Nile and mosquitoes against some of those?

600
01:09:56,440 --> 01:10:04,150
Just basic advice as far as, you know, mosquitoes like the early morning time in the evening.

601
01:10:04,150 --> 01:10:10,720
So if you're out at those times or if you notice them during the day, you cover up if you can.

602
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:17,560
But if it's in the summer, that's uncomfortable. So, again, it's effective.

603
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:25,270
Other integrated pest management approaches, so standing water, birdbaths, things like that.

604
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:30,010
If you have a heavy rain, you have a bucket out and it's full of water. That's just what they want to reproduce.

605
01:10:30,010 --> 01:10:35,560
So getting rid of standing water and some of those other practices can can help but,

606
01:10:35,560 --> 01:10:41,770
you know, bring in bats, a bat house in my backyard that I'm trying to.

607
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:45,250
But then, you know, hopefully I'm not introducing another.

608
01:10:45,250 --> 01:10:50,380
Bats, for the most part, are minding our business unless they get rabies or something, which is rare.

609
01:10:50,380 --> 01:11:03,130
Was there another area of to this this year in Africa where they obviously would reduce the amount of

610
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:13,750
males in the population of the whole population and see if I can get in an attempt to curb the disease?

611
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:18,880
Hey, how are they after that? And if that's the case.

612
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:23,920
Yeah. So the question was genetically modified mosquitoes. Great question.

613
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:29,890
And maybe a good Segway. I think they might be used as one of the debates at the end of semester two class or

614
01:11:29,890 --> 01:11:33,880
one of the groups will be able to look into it in more depth and report out on it.

615
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:45,040
But yeah, I think it is used not on a grand scale, but I think it has been used with some success kind of in pilot testing and and more recently.

616
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:50,470
But, you know, any time you throw out the words genetically modified, that freaks people out and they're like, oh,

617
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:56,860
we're going to have, you know, dragon mosquitoes out there that are, you know, big teeth and stuff like that.

618
01:11:56,860 --> 01:12:04,510
So I think it still holds some promise. And, you know, you have different species of mosquitoes that might be more or less effective.

619
01:12:04,510 --> 01:12:09,550
But, yeah, I think it's it's an intriguing idea that that could, in the long run, help.

620
01:12:09,550 --> 01:12:16,990
But there are some issues that you guys can work out in your debates later on.

621
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:25,510
All right, well, thank you all for your attention. Hope you have a good day and I'll see you later in the semester.

622
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:31,940
Thank you. Thanks very much, John. No problem.
