1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:04,690
I passed out. Yeah. Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:11,440
Morning. How are we doing? That's good.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,860
Okay. I'm not working today, so hopefully the exam was not too painful.

4
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:28,340
My opinion is the most difficult exam in this class, so we got that behind us.

5
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,310
I'm hoping I have a working with a great year this year, which is great.

6
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:36,120
We'll have those within a week or so, probably sooner.

7
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,790
But just on first glance, things look really good. I'm really excited about.

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:52,210
So admittedly, today and Tuesday, we cover something called the nutrition care process.

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,800
Have any of you heard of this? And does anybody have like have you practice with NCP?

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:08,889
So a little bit. Admittedly, this is my least favorite thing for a variety of reasons.

11
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:14,230
We do have to cover it. It will come in handy, especially when you if you go on to do an internship.

12
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:23,440
This is just a standardized process for dietitians in terms of how we document our care plans for our patients.

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:30,950
So you do have to know how to do it. We are not using NCP currently, like in the outpatient setting.

14
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,320
Since COVID started, we just had a much more streamlined approach to our charting.

15
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:44,770
So it's still important and you guys will use it, but it's kind of finicky like, well, you'll see.

16
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:53,530
Like we'll talk about like the standardized protocol and I am not like the best MCP I can get sometimes kind of lazy

17
00:01:53,530 --> 00:02:01,689
with this process because I have similar to a patient population that I tend to like see very similar diagnoses.

18
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:05,589
So I have like my people kind of thing. So this is my teaching.

19
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:11,070
This class is helping me get better and see what I want to.

20
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,989
Today we're going to go over our nutrition diagnosis. So we do have nutrition diagnoses.

21
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:26,740
These are going to be different than medical diagnoses. We do not diagnose medical conditions as dieticians, but we do have nutrition diagnoses.

22
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:36,730
And that's going to kind of guide our care plan in terms of our diagnosis is really the priority concern for our patients.

23
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:42,760
Like our patients are going to have lots of things going on both medically and nutritionally.

24
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:52,630
But in terms of what we are going to directly impact in the time that we're with our patients should be kind of identified in our diagnosis.

25
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:57,850
That's going to be the most important issue and the one that we're going to actually have interventions for.

26
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,610
So we're going to spend most of our time working on this diagnosis process.

27
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:10,989
And then throughout the rest of the semester, when we do case studies exams, you are going to be writing nutrition diagnoses.

28
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:18,940
So today it's a little bit we're getting just more into that,

29
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:26,680
into this how to actually write your statement in terms of the actual structure of the statement, because there is a whole kind of process to that.

30
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,600
So bear with me through this.

31
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:39,010
I think I think you'll you'll take something from this and you'll definitely be able to competently write these interesting diagnoses.

32
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,060
And that'll be important once you do go on to an internship.

33
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:55,269
Okay. So what I want you to do, for starters, is on our course page for today, you'll see down here this nutrition diagnostic term.

34
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:00,880
She has this open because we're going to use this today.

35
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:13,749
Download it. So I have one as well. We have to use very specific terminology for our diagnoses.

36
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:20,050
So it has to come from this sheath in terms of the very first part of our diagnostic statement.

37
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:25,490
So you'll always want to have this available, like maybe even just print it out and bring it to class,

38
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:35,409
have it ready when you take exams or do case studies. So have this available and then will will watch a short video on this nutrition diagnosis

39
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:40,330
process and then we'll go through some examples together in practice putting together.

40
00:04:48,920 --> 00:05:00,230
So I do want to start with a video. This is about 15 minutes long.

41
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,230
It continually reinforces the how the statement is set up,

42
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,220
which I think we need in the beginning to see you guys have an understanding of how we do this.

43
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:17,600
So hopefully have some coffee because it can get a little dry.

44
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,229
But we're we're in this together. Okay. So this is about 15 minutes.

45
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:58,400
Then we'll we'll practice these. Everybody that.

46
00:06:35,100 --> 00:18:56,419
It. Okay.

47
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:04,270
Just briefly with this example. Can the RV resolve disordered eating pattern?

48
00:19:05,290 --> 00:19:09,099
Probably not. This is a lot of these are more outpatient examples.

49
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:16,440
So this one and I think the next one are not great, but they're good because they allow us to have some discussion.

50
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:20,169
So I think that's maybe simplifying this diagnosis.

51
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:25,270
That's a that's a process that sometimes never gets resolved, but at least it's managed.

52
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,690
So just keep that in mind with this particular example.

53
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:53,890
So then I go back. Okay.

54
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:04,780
So this example, this is a terrible example for a train swallowing difficulty, arguably is a medical diagnosis.

55
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,680
You see, if somebody has swallowing difficulty, if they have this stage of following a stroke,

56
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,380
which we'll talk about next Thursday, they also have an intake issue.

57
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:22,570
So, like to look at the signs and symptoms of choking during meal times, it affects their ability to eat.

58
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:33,790
So did everybody understand what when he was saying when possible, choose the diagnosis in the intake domain?

59
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,540
Or is that like are you connecting with that at all?

60
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:47,080
We'll look at that together. So this is a good example to let's look at our diagnostic terminology sheet here.

61
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:54,950
So there's these domains up top and then within them are problems.

62
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:59,740
So that very first kind of language used in our diagnosis,

63
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:07,190
the majority of your diagnoses are going to be in this intake because most of

64
00:24:07,190 --> 00:24:12,019
our patients are going to have a problem eating or getting enough nutrition,

65
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,330
and that usually falls within the intake for me.

66
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:21,530
So when and usually we have interventions that can directly affect staff like help them improve their intake.

67
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,170
So whenever it is.

68
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:36,650
Most appropriate use a diagnosis from this infidelity because that's most often the type of diagnosis that will be relevant to our patients.

69
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:44,720
So the reason I go back to swallowing difficulty, where arguably that's more of a medical diagnosis that we are not going to be able to resolve.

70
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:52,160
If somebody is having difficulty swallowing, they probably also have inadequate.

71
00:24:53,560 --> 00:25:00,460
It to some degree, like they're not able to eat well because they're choking or they're having aspiration.

72
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:10,150
So you have to modify their diet, of course. But in that particular example, an intake diagnosis is almost always present.

73
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:16,170
So I would use that in place of. This swallowing difficulty here.

74
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:23,910
So we would use an intake diagnosis and then I would then use this swallowing difficulty terminology as the etiology.

75
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,160
So inadequate protein energy intake related to swallowing difficulty.

76
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:38,160
Does that make sense? So the way I approach my diagnostic statements a lot is that I use some other

77
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:42,460
terminology from our sheet as the etiology sometimes because that makes the.

78
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:50,010
And your statement. So whenever possible or if it is present,

79
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:57,989
we are going to prioritize an intake diagnosis because usually that's something we can directly affect or impact our patients,

80
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,110
especially in the hospital.

81
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:11,069
So I don't I'm not saying you can't you've found difficulty, but I what it means is that probably especially in this class,

82
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:19,060
if I give you a case study where there is following difficulty happening, I want to see you investigate a little further.

83
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:24,330
There's probably an intake diagnosis there. Okay.

84
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:30,250
So let's have this sheet out, as I mentioned, and we'll go through some examples.

85
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:37,239
So did everybody pick up on that problem, part of our diagnosis statement or PTSD?

86
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:48,840
But those are the same thing. That first statement, like the P part has to be from this sheet and it has to be as written here and standardized.

87
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,530
So if you know your patient is not consuming enough protein,

88
00:26:53,890 --> 00:27:01,480
you don't just say poor protein and say you do inadequate protein and then use it from the sheet.

89
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,799
Okay. So it takes some practice to get used to,

90
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,910
but just know that very first part of your statement is going to come from this

91
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:16,800
terminology sheet and then the etiology or that related to part will be based on you.

92
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:23,560
There will be free text. So whatever you determine is the most appropriate analogy and then the signs and symptoms as

93
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:29,350
well will be nothing from a sheet that definitely what you take from your assessment data.

94
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:35,930
Any questions before we do some practice? Yeah.

95
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:51,330
All right. So our goal is always to resolve or close the loop on diagnoses.

96
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:56,819
So let's say your patient, you identify they have an adequate protein intake.

97
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:07,470
I'll give you a really simple example. Maybe they're on annual nutrition and they were ordered to be on like a lower protein enteral formula.

98
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:16,379
And maybe they have a wound that's not feeling so. You have inadequate protein intake may be related to increased nutrient needs for protein,

99
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:22,920
as evidenced by current regimen only providing whatever percent of absolute needs in particular.

100
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,790
If that's the example, those are your that's your evidence of.

101
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:35,200
Well, we could do things to change the amount of protein we're delivering to that patient.

102
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:39,690
And maybe a week later, there now have had several deals done,

103
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:47,290
getting 100% of the protein and maybe they're showing signs of wounding that would be part of that,

104
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:56,600
but that you could resolve that like this problem, this diagnosis has evolved as evidenced by patients now meeting 100%.

105
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,760
So if the idea is always to resolve our diagnoses, that doesn't always happen.

106
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:06,519
But at least we're addressing them.

107
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:13,680
And we're going to monitor and make sure that our interventions are at least addressing that with the hope that we will resolve them.

108
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:20,940
Sometimes it might be as simple as starting a patient on the appropriate vitamin and mineral supplements

109
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:27,840
because they have increased needs or how important is by getting the appropriate amount for.

110
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:35,170
Something that probably can't be resolved. We talked a lot about diagnosing malnutrition.

111
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,200
Are we going to be able to resolve malnutrition? Probably in maybe the week that our patient is hospitalized?

112
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:46,870
No, but that is always going to be our priority diagnosis if malnutrition is present.

113
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,950
You have that sheet to determine the criteria for a patient is malnourished.

114
00:29:50,950 --> 00:29:59,020
According to our criteria, we will always diagnose and that will be our priority diagnosis regardless of whatever else is going on.

115
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:06,460
That's really going to encompass if they have poor intake that's captured essentially that malnutrition diagnosis.

116
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:14,260
So that is one that we probably aren't able to resolve. Same with like something like swallowing difficulty that's really difficult to resolve.

117
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:21,820
So the idea is always going to be we want to close the loop on our diagnoses, but sometimes it's not going to be.

118
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:26,860
Feasible to deal. Any other questions?

119
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,560
Yeah. So there are things that are not associated of.

120
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,740
Yes. So there's exhibition, but. Oh, yeah.

121
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:41,569
How would that be? Well, are some examples. A lot of finger eating and pottery determined.

122
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:47,590
They're taking in enough nutrition, but maybe there's some capacity issue.

123
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:58,520
So there's different different diagnoses that would be appropriate for that that may still fall under this intake domain, but maybe not.

124
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:02,510
So we'll we'll go through some examples of that because it's not always intake.

125
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:09,260
Usually in the hospital, our patients are not eating well. So we usually have an intake diagnosis, outpatient, not always the case.

126
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,500
And sometimes in an inpatient not it's not always the case.

127
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:26,030
So your slides are kind of barebones today for a reason because we're going to go through some examples and then I'll post my slides so you can see.

128
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:35,570
See what you come up with. Okay.

129
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:40,760
So have your sheet ready. Let's say we get a council that our patient has lost weight.

130
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:48,979
Not that they need to lose weight, but that, you know, this patient has experienced weight loss, very generic information.

131
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:53,450
But that's a lot of times what will get dietician referral weight loss course.

132
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,069
We're going to do our nutrition assessment, gather all that data, but without any of that information,

133
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:07,100
look on your terminology sheet and I want you to maybe come up with 2 to 3 potential nutrition diagnosis,

134
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:14,480
just that problem statement from the sheet that may coincide with someone experiencing weight loss.

135
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:21,350
Okay. Given that we have no other information, just what diagnoses may make sense for somebody that has experienced weight loss?

136
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:27,360
Yeah. Great, inadequate energy intake.

137
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:31,980
And we'll talk about that. Specifically, what else might work?

138
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,420
Yeah, inadequate oral intake.

139
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:47,190
Those are great because those are we need to be very intentional with whether we use inadequate energy intake or inadequate intake.

140
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,050
Anybody think of anything else? Yeah.

141
00:32:53,680 --> 00:33:01,180
We're going to take something limited food acceptance and we'll just maybe think it's an example of why that might be happening.

142
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:14,080
He says it might be excessive fiber intake potentially because sometimes we encourage high fiber all we want to be more.

143
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,840
So is that it has already increased.

144
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:32,979
Yeah. So they have increased the burning calories.

145
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:40,430
More so increase expenditure. That's a pretty good start.

146
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,360
Let's talk about a couple of these so often.

147
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:51,139
This is where we would potentially start and you guys get on the phone and put everything together.

148
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:59,240
But all I'm saying then there's inadequate protein energy intake if you have evidence to support both overall energy and protein.

149
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,990
We talked about some others, so just know that all of these are from that cheap.

150
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,750
So increased nutrient needs that might be related to somebody that is, by our estimates,

151
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:16,230
consuming enough, but they have maybe some absorptive issues, whether they're increased.

152
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:22,240
Look at food acceptance. We talked about unintended weight loss.

153
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:27,890
Again, not one not one of my favorites. I would say they're very rare situations where.

154
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:36,130
Use this. Usually there's something else going on that's leading to that unintended weight loss, but that is a potential diagnosis.

155
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:46,150
We have a disordered eating pattern kind of activity, so there's lots of potential diagnoses for this type of crime.

156
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:50,990
And it would really depend on what we got from our patient assessment in talking to them.

157
00:34:51,010 --> 00:35:07,170
Yeah. Would you want to have? I think it could be an inadequate food intake.

158
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:14,040
Maybe not, not personally much, but yeah, I mean, that would be a very specific type.

159
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,820
If you had evidence of that. But then use that for.

160
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:28,980
Okay. So think about so if these are like our potential diagnoses, let's talk about what these signs and symptoms.

161
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,620
So this is essentially the evidence to support using that diagnosis.

162
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:43,230
So I want to differentiate the energy intake versus oral intake because you will need, again, need to be intentional with which one you use.

163
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:54,380
I hope this makes sense. I think it will find the symptoms in terms of when there is like a weight loss issue.

164
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:59,150
Huge. This has similar to like our malnutrition guidelines.

165
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,120
I always like to provide what percentage of weight loss the patient has experienced over what time.

166
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:13,480
So something measurable. So, Ed, you know, inadequate energy intake related to whatever that may be,

167
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:20,330
as evidenced by patient exhibiting this percentage of weight loss over the last six months.

168
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:30,820
Now, this this the part we need to differentiate. If we're going to say patient has inadequate energy,

169
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:42,879
what type of specific information do you think we need to support that diagnosis versus just more calorie information for inadequate energy?

170
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,940
And yes, it's very clear that we need specific Calgary information,

171
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:53,229
meaning we have to either do a calorie count or they needed to provide us with

172
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:57,910
like a food diary where we actually estimated how their average caloric intake.

173
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,000
So that's a level of detailed information that we would need to support that energy.

174
00:37:04,010 --> 00:37:08,379
And then we also can use this if a patient is on nutrition support.

175
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:12,490
So if we're delivering enteral insertion, we know how many calories are being delivered.

176
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,310
We have record of how much has been improved.

177
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:25,839
So we can actually say, well, they've gotten 50% of their estimated needs over the last month or whatever versus an adequate oral intake.

178
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:32,620
This is less specific, right? So we can still use percentage of weight loss over that time period.

179
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:38,080
But this is basically you can have evidence to support an adequate oral intake or

180
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:43,569
just an estimate of how much they've been eating compared to their usual intake.

181
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:52,780
So patient report of eating 50% of your full amount of meals or when we're in the hospital,

182
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:59,349
nursing staff well off to right now how much of their training they consume.

183
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:06,370
So like sometimes we'll just write bites or they'll consume half of what they always look back on what they were.

184
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:11,949
So that's like easier information to obtain when you go talk to them.

185
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,930
You talk to the nursing staff, okay? They're eating like half of what they're being given.

186
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:21,520
So that evidence to support that diagnosis,

187
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:29,100
we wouldn't be able to use that type of evidence to support an inadequate energy intake

188
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:34,270
diagnosis because this isn't telling us anything about the amount of energy they're consuming.

189
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,069
Does that make sense?

190
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:47,650
I know this is like kind of nit picking, but that's an important distinction to make sure you have the correct evidence to support whatever diagnosis.

191
00:38:53,950 --> 00:39:02,470
I deal with the advocate and take with me the strength of the Constellation.

192
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:10,630
Remember how we practice estimating calories. We would have to estimate the patients calorie needs in order to determine a current.

193
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,280
A myth. Yes. Usually we always get to that.

194
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:25,479
Okay. So then protein energy intake used to be used as either calorie count data author on

195
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,100
internal or friendship nutrition where we actually know that how much calories and protein.

196
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:37,090
Then we would have evidence about. What percentage of calories and protein they've received to support that.

197
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:47,780
All right. Let's look at some other examples here. We talked a little bit about increased nutrient needs.

198
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:59,390
What do you think these might be related to? So it could be weight loss greater than expected or desired despite food intake.

199
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,680
This isn't really like a great ideology this week.

200
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:12,360
Usually when there's something like this, the etiology is usually like a medical diagnosis, which is fine.

201
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:15,719
Your etiology can be a medical diagnosis.

202
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:19,780
Like, maybe they've had to have surgery and they have. Sure.

203
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:30,430
And they could have, but, um, potential signs and symptoms or evidence for something like that.

204
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:35,290
They've experienced this percentage of weight loss despite report or evidence,

205
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:42,730
really adequate calories, and they might have anything that makes them more prone to.

206
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:48,589
Having increased. Limited food acceptance.

207
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:55,010
This could be related to a disordered eating pattern of self feeding difficulty.

208
00:40:56,930 --> 00:41:04,170
It raises a lot of kids because we have a lot of really picky eaters and it's only selective.

209
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:09,520
So sometimes it's things they're doing fine, maybe weight wise,

210
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,550
and they're still growing and even nutritionally they're doing okay, but they have very limited foods that they'll eat.

211
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:16,930
So I use this diet.

212
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:29,459
And so some signs and symptoms there may be refusal to eat this number of meals a week for these, you know, only this kind of type of food.

213
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:34,240
Like have some food that only like crunchy food for like specific texture.

214
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:43,149
So any evidence I can provide to support that diagnosis. You know something depending on what's going on,

215
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:50,530
if they have difficulty feeding themselves or they have a lot of cheating, that makes it very difficult to self feed.

216
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:56,830
And therefore, they're usually when this is happening, they probably have an opinion take as well, but they don't.

217
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,580
Unintended, unintended weight loss. Or either way, I don't like these diagnoses.

218
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,399
Usually there's something else going on. It's a better choice.

219
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:18,219
But can you send me a you percentage of weight loss over time and then maybe provide energy evidence

220
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:23,620
of energy intake as president to make sure that they're getting enough energy but still losing weight.

221
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:36,580
We use excessive physical activity and that would probably be more like an outpatient setting where we have that maybe the evidence would be.

222
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,450
Getting some specific information on how much they're exercising and what degree of weight loss is.

223
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,590
So this is again specific to weight loss.

224
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:55,900
We always would probably want to have what percentage of weight loss over what amount of time as part of our.

225
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:05,240
Does that make sense? So let's move on from weight loss.

226
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:11,969
Let's say we get a cancer because our patient has a wound present or a pressure ulcer.

227
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:19,110
That may be. Is it healing? I know we haven't really got into specifics on how we would intervene with this,

228
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:28,710
but look on your feet and think of like you get two or three potential diagnoses that may work for someone with a poorly hair healing wound.

229
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:40,030
Yeah. Adequate protein and adequate protein intake could work.

230
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:44,650
What else might? To kind of, like, mirror that a little bit.

231
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:49,410
What else might work? But.

232
00:43:52,860 --> 00:44:03,880
Yeah. The. The types of. It could be if you wanted to, like, promote a specific type of amino acid for wound healing.

233
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:19,760
And you mentioned specific, maybe five. So what diagnosis statement would you use if you think the.

234
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:29,200
Inadequate vitamin intake. And then we would specify in our segment which one specifically.

235
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,640
I would say increased nutrient needs. Yes.

236
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:40,200
So like we talked about inadequate protein intake that could work,

237
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:46,080
but also increase nutrient needs maybe for protein specifically that would actually work as well.

238
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:54,960
So let's look at some of these. These are like the most common presence in the protein intake.

239
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:59,670
Maybe they're just not consuming enough to support that womb feeling.

240
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:05,010
Maybe they are, but they just have increased demand because of this.

241
00:45:05,310 --> 00:45:10,320
So maybe this might be more appropriate and you would determine that based on your assessment.

242
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:19,470
Do they have actual an adequate intake or do they have this maybe since it has the orientation and the energy intake.

243
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:27,750
So for these increased nutrient needs, this was something where we could get really specific with the vitamin and mineral.

244
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:38,950
You have to specify which nutrient and you can only have one nutrient or vitamin mineral per diagnosis.

245
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:47,080
So sometimes every year this happens, students will say increased nutrient needs and they'll put in their ire and violence.

246
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:55,360
Unfortunately, although that may be true, you have to write a specific diagnosis for each one because the evidence,

247
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,380
the etiology and interventions may be different depending on the treatment.

248
00:45:59,830 --> 00:46:04,720
So just keep that in mind. You have to have a separate diagnosis for each.

249
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:14,880
For inadequate vitamin intake inadequate now and taking to specified in parentheses

250
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:21,480
again a little tricky but just identify like if three you know we talk about like.

251
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:32,530
Increased need for these for vitamin D related to patients living in a nursing home, lack of access to sun,

252
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:41,210
not eating fortified foods as evidenced by 25 HD from a blind patient report of minimal sun exposure you don't like.

253
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:49,360
So that would be specific to vitamin D, the intervention to address vitamin D and sometimes you'll have multiple.

254
00:46:49,370 --> 00:46:52,710
So it's okay to have. Lots of diagnoses.

255
00:46:54,950 --> 00:47:00,370
Okay. Let's look at another one. Let's say we get a consultant.

256
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:06,190
The patient is experienced weight gain. What?

257
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:10,750
Knowing nothing of what might make sense from that terminology sheet.

258
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:20,360
Yes. Excessive energy intake, yet consuming more than they require, can result in weight gain.

259
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:25,340
What? Excessive oral intake.

260
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:33,210
So maybe we don't have that specifically evidence to support that they have excessive energy intake, but we know that.

261
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:42,930
How much do they tell us they're eating at meals? Yeah. Yeah.

262
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:48,700
So that's like not in that intake domain. Not ready for diet, lifestyle change.

263
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,680
Sometimes on an outpatient level, we'll use that.

264
00:47:54,710 --> 00:48:00,530
Like if we go through our counseling visit, we have these interventions and some patients will just immediately say,

265
00:48:00,530 --> 00:48:05,569
I'm not ready to overhaul my diet yet, just or you kind of get that impression.

266
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:11,280
So that might make sense. And then you would have different interventions if that was your main diagnosis.

267
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:18,330
Let's see what else? Let's take a look. So excessive energy intake.

268
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:28,160
Maybe it's physical inactivity. Maybe there's something maybe they're really physically active or that they want

269
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:32,890
like a stress fracture and now they can't can't be as active in their eating.

270
00:48:32,890 --> 00:48:36,690
Hasn't changed. Again, not my favorite.

271
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:40,329
I wouldn't recommend using that. That is an option.

272
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:46,330
But again, usually something else going on too, pleading for them to talk about their diet,

273
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:55,000
lifestyle change, undesirable food choices, limited adherence to nutrition related recommendations.

274
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,750
There may be disordered eating pattern as well. These are just, again, some examples.

275
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:09,350
Okay. What about a low hemoglobin or hematocrit?

276
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:20,000
See, that's the reason we got a tell. Of course we do.

277
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,070
Some of. But what? What matters?

278
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:28,320
Yeah. The.

279
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:36,370
Etiology could be related to. Yeah.

280
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:49,220
So let's say we could do an adequate mineral intake baby and specifically related to and then we would determine, you know, what is it?

281
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,750
What's the main cause of this inadequate general intake?

282
00:49:54,710 --> 00:50:04,910
That could be highly variable. It could be disease related. Or maybe they just have increased nutrient needs for iron.

283
00:50:04,910 --> 00:50:14,660
So these are more like you can argue if somebody has increased needs, they would also have inadequate intake based on those increased.

284
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:19,610
So just kind of pick and choose when it seems more appropriate to use one or the other.

285
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:27,770
W. What about just abnormal lab values?

286
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:32,030
Times will get that abnormal nutrition labs or.

287
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:44,840
Yes. It could be.

288
00:50:44,890 --> 00:50:48,490
Yeah, we know that. While the lab values are influenced by fluid status.

289
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:55,010
Intake of types of fats inconsistent with his or.

290
00:50:55,490 --> 00:51:03,020
I was just looking under the fat and cholesterol thinking about well yeah, let's say their LDL cholesterol is really high.

291
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:09,290
That LDL is maybe more influenced by saturated fat intake than other fats.

292
00:51:09,290 --> 00:51:16,700
So that that would be appropriate there. That's a good example.

293
00:51:16,710 --> 00:51:21,790
So it could be related to increased need making, but increasing trade.

294
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:27,290
Yet the reality is what about impaired nutrient utilization?

295
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:33,019
I actually use this diagnostic statement a lot and the etiology for some of my patients.

296
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:42,220
So maybe they have increased nutrient needs for whatever related to impaired nutrient utilization.

297
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:49,910
Maybe they have an underlying condition as evidenced by, you know, usually by evidence or like a lab value.

298
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:54,920
As we know, nutrition related labs aren't like usually directly interpretable.

299
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:59,990
So you can use the lab value of interest in your evidence,

300
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:10,570
but also something else to support that maybe from their diet recall evidence that they have too much or too little in their diet or whatever.

301
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,890
So don't just always lean on the lab values.

302
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:19,200
Um, all four nutrition related lab values.

303
00:52:20,250 --> 00:52:28,650
This is kind of like a catch all. I, I would think that's a lot, but maybe, you know, inadequate or excessive vitamin k.

304
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:33,920
Doesn't specify specifically which one.

305
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:39,750
Okay. Just a couple more. All right. Constipation.

306
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:43,260
We'll have a whole session on constipation.

307
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:46,740
Big problem in hospitalized patients. Yes. Adequate?

308
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:50,970
Yeah, that would be a great one. Inadequate fluid intake, usually.

309
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:54,240
That's a big reason why people are constipated. What else?

310
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:57,690
Inadequate fiber and adequate fiber intake. Yeah.

311
00:52:57,930 --> 00:53:01,340
What else? Yes.

312
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:06,050
Could be, definitely. That maybe that's the main issue.

313
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:17,270
Those are all really good. So inadequate fiber intake, inadequate food intake, maybe we're saying increased nutrient needs for fiber.

314
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:23,930
So these are very similar. So just kind of based on your assessment and determine which is more appropriate.

315
00:53:25,010 --> 00:53:28,370
And then there's plenty other we can use for for constipation.

316
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:35,250
All right. So let's do a couple of case studies together and try and write some diagnoses.

317
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:47,690
Okay. So nutrition assessment. And thankful that they didn't try to control we just see that due to length of stay.

318
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:50,790
So many times you see otherwise that they've been there for a week.

319
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:53,400
We have to just go to check in on them.

320
00:53:54,360 --> 00:54:04,170
So this is a 72 year old male admitted for an acute exacerbation of heart failure with a medical history of moderate mitral regurgitation,

321
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:12,209
acute and chronic systolic heart failure, third degree heart plaque and iron deficiency anemia currently being diary.

322
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:15,780
So on dire diabetic medications because of the heart failure.

323
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:17,790
So a lot of medical lingo there.

324
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:23,370
But this is these are all like real quick study so just kind of leave them as you could see how many things are reported.

325
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:33,750
Okay. So the diet history, we go into our assessment, the patient reports variable appetite and intake says he has good days and bad days.

326
00:54:34,050 --> 00:54:39,690
He says he likes to graze throughout the day rather than eat large meals reports.

327
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:46,410
His weight fluctuates due to his fluid status, and it's not uncommon for his weight to go up and down £5 from day to day,

328
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:54,870
he's noted, to be eating a varied amount from his meals 25 to 75% of meals per the nursing fellowship.

329
00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:00,180
And he has been missing meals due to tests and procedures while being in the hospital.

330
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:10,480
Okay. So here's his anthropometric data. We see his current weight compared to his admission weight.

331
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:16,990
His usual weight is in pounds. And we've seen a 2% weight loss over the past week.

332
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:21,430
Remember, this patient is being diary suicide, heart failure. He has heart failure.

333
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:25,840
He probably has fluid retention. So they're trying to get off some of that excess.

334
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:36,820
And there's this dialog. So based on that information, let's write a statement for this patient.

335
00:55:36,850 --> 00:55:46,960
So let's take about like three or 4 minutes and just kind of come up with what you think may be a reasonable diagnosis for him.

336
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:32,960
Remember, we'll focus on the the most important problem that we can impact based on the information that we have.

337
00:56:34,030 --> 00:59:00,640
Which is not a lot. Okay.

338
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:04,990
Does anybody want to share their P statement for this patient?

339
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:11,830
Yeah. Right. I put to the problem.

340
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:20,950
Inadequate. 25.

341
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:29,260
Okay. So what is your first part of the iron deficiency anemia?

342
00:59:29,950 --> 00:59:35,610
Is that from the diagnostic terminology sheet? So I would swap.

343
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,020
I think your etiology was right. Increased. Um.

344
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:44,520
What did you have as your etiology but inadequate?

345
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:48,360
So use that as your diagnosis statement.

346
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:57,380
Great. Related to it could be history of iron deficiency anemia as evidenced by.

347
00:59:57,390 --> 01:00:01,230
Yes. Patient consuming. What percentage of meals?

348
01:00:03,410 --> 01:00:10,610
Since we don't have data to show actual like laboratory evidence of a current iron deficiency,

349
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:17,870
that could work, but it would be best if we actually have data to support that.

350
01:00:17,870 --> 01:00:22,489
That's an active problem, even though that was in the history. But I like I like that process.

351
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:25,640
That's good. Anybody else want to share?

352
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:35,590
Thank you for sharing. Just remember that this happens all the time.

353
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:40,350
That very first part is the only thing that has to come from that standardized.

354
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:49,050
Yeah. Inadequate morale related to.

355
01:00:50,490 --> 01:00:55,950
And I know this has. 25%.

356
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:10,060
Great. Great. So that's that's that fits that kind of statement how we need to set up our statement.

357
01:01:10,070 --> 01:01:14,660
Your evidence supports the diagnosis statement of inadequate oral intake.

358
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:24,139
And to our best knowledge, we have like what's causing this inadequate oral intake, poor appetite, missing meals to the, to testing procedures.

359
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:30,209
So that works great. I have something similar.

360
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:35,910
So we don't have a lot of information on this patient, but we I think we do have evidence support.

361
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:40,050
Inadequate oral intake is not really eating well in the hospital.

362
01:01:40,710 --> 01:01:49,170
I have related to decreased appetite missing meals due to medical procedure as a by what he tells us and what we get from the nursing home,

363
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:54,330
he's considering 75% meal one class of meals over the last week.

364
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:59,250
So anytime you can make this pleasurable, do that.

365
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:07,910
Don't just say as evidenced by patient reporting, poor intake and give like some data to really support that.

366
01:02:07,920 --> 01:02:14,340
So 75% or less or 25 to 75% of meals, according to the report.

367
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:19,409
Nursing Policy. I like how you added tendency to phrase.

368
01:02:19,410 --> 01:02:21,870
So he's telling us that he's more of a flavor.

369
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:32,190
We know he said this is that I feel like lot seven procedures so I think we have adequate information in terms of what's causing this or inadequate.

370
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:37,080
And evidence to support it. So there could be other ones, too.

371
01:02:37,080 --> 01:02:43,080
Did anybody else have anything else? We don't have a lot of information on this case yet.

372
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:46,760
I have a question for that. Can you also include.

373
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:56,150
90% or so because this specific delivery here that yes.

374
01:02:56,170 --> 01:03:03,730
The signs and symptoms what about including the 2% weight loss over the last week as further evidence of this inadequate intake.

375
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:11,550
Because this case specifically said that we think that is due to fluid fluctuations.

376
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:17,980
I probably wouldn't. But if we didn't have that information that it we think it was really to food.

377
01:03:17,990 --> 01:03:22,010
Yes. I would add that to support that. Yeah.

378
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:30,520
Yes. That's important.

379
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:41,400
Possibly, but we would need other evidence of that.

380
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:47,340
That's a good thought. So. Okay.

381
01:03:47,340 --> 01:03:54,990
Great. Let's do let's do another one. This was our little friend we talked about last week.

382
01:03:55,710 --> 01:04:04,050
So this is our 17 month old male who presents consultation regarding feeding difficulties and reflux.

383
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:13,100
This is a long kind of history here, but this patient has a food allergic condition that does limit his ability to have certain.

384
01:04:14,890 --> 01:04:20,310
We? So I won't read this again, but.

385
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:27,580
This patient is on Zantac. He is on a limited diet.

386
01:04:27,880 --> 01:04:32,790
Does have some massive. And that has improved.

387
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:36,540
But he's struggled with intolerance in most new food introductions.

388
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,860
So these are the current safe foods and that I've highlighted here.

389
01:04:41,010 --> 01:04:45,060
The ones that maybe contain that are tend to be more iron rich.

390
01:04:47,130 --> 01:04:53,340
We have his lab results. Remember, we talked about what we thought was what's going on with this patient.

391
01:04:54,030 --> 01:05:00,150
So given all that information, I want you to write two nutrition diagnoses for this patient.

392
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:08,530
And you can scroll back through and read that history just to get a little bit better information.

393
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:13,869
But we'll take about 5 minutes on this one to come up with two diagnoses.

394
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:19,390
Yes, there may be many more, but let's let's try and select the two most important problems.

395
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:38,460
Does anybody want to share one of their diagnoses?

396
01:10:40,170 --> 01:10:45,960
This patient potentially has a lot. But what do you think may be most important?

397
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:56,960
Yes. I mean, I wrote inadequate or unsafe or limited food acceptance.

398
01:10:58,580 --> 01:11:02,020
Sure. Yeah. I think we have evidence of that. Either one of those.

399
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:06,350
Right. What did you have as the etiology?

400
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:17,089
Um, I wasn't sure what to fight for. Like, um, food allergies, and then I didn't know if it was like.

401
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:24,379
It means this diarrhea could be the allergy or about the symptoms, but it could be both.

402
01:11:24,380 --> 01:11:34,459
So, like, I do think in this case, probably the etiology is the medical diagnosis.

403
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:39,800
So this has this child has food allergies, which is limiting dietary options.

404
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:49,280
There's also, if you look on your diagnostic term sheet, you'll see a diagnosis of altered GI function.

405
01:11:49,970 --> 01:11:54,860
I never use that as my diagnosis, but I use that terminology a lot as the etiology.

406
01:11:54,860 --> 01:12:00,739
So whatever related to altering GI function that applied to a lot of our patients,

407
01:12:00,740 --> 01:12:07,170
a lot of our patients that are not eating well that we see in the hospital usually have or often have GI items.

408
01:12:07,190 --> 01:12:11,300
And so that's like a good etiology potentially.

409
01:12:12,530 --> 01:12:20,480
And then the the evidence could be, you know, the number of foods or whatever it may be if there's weight loss.

410
01:12:21,020 --> 01:12:28,970
Um, possibly. Possibly the presence of a family could also be a sign.

411
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:36,950
What else do you mean? Something different? We see this?

412
01:12:40,250 --> 01:12:47,930
The stories could be heard. Yes.

413
01:12:47,930 --> 01:12:52,370
We could look at it. You could have a diagnosis for.

414
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:57,260
Remember, we talked about this patient probably through the name of your physician.

415
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:06,620
So you could be selective in what kind of. So let's maybe look at a couple examples.

416
01:13:07,730 --> 01:13:12,650
This would be specific to the the iron deficiency that we think we we determine.

417
01:13:12,730 --> 01:13:21,860
So an adequate mineral intake for iron now and this is for we're saying that this child does not have adequate consumption of iron.

418
01:13:23,590 --> 01:13:33,420
So see, here are five related to all three that function food allergic condition causing restricted diet similar to what we have.

419
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:38,860
This reality is evidenced by laboratory evidence consistent with iron deficiency anemia.

420
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:42,810
Now you can even go beyond that and provide some specific lab.

421
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:47,050
There to support that for me, that's fine.

422
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:56,240
But if you want wanted to really be specific, then you can give like that and see all those things if you wanted.

423
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:03,100
We could do, like altered nutrition related lab values.

424
01:14:03,460 --> 01:14:10,720
Now, this is one situation where I kind of love for fun because the etiology,

425
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,890
the intervention for signs and symptoms for all of these will be related.

426
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:19,270
But I would love to write these with vitamin D.

427
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:27,950
So prior to the. So altered intentionally left is not my favorite diagnosis, but it could work.

428
01:14:28,310 --> 01:14:32,160
So transparent saturation in the hemoglobin.

429
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:40,010
That's it. And even sweeter. And relating that to inadequate nutrient limitation.

430
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:44,420
A very lucrative motivational why that is evidenced by lab work that is consistent with.

431
01:14:47,790 --> 01:14:57,420
So if we kind of go by our rule of what diagnosis, we can impact them both as dietitian, which one would be better?

432
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:08,780
However we out of inadequate. Yes.

433
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:15,970
If we have something in that intake domain, choose that because we can.

434
01:15:18,310 --> 01:15:23,010
Specifically have interventions to address their power consumption.

435
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:33,359
Maybe where we talk about average foods, we want to look right, incorporate the IS and higher supplement and then we get that that on board.

436
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:38,969
We put up all of that where the lab values, yes, we can resolve that with similar interventions.

437
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:44,730
But this is just more kind of in tune with what we do as dietitians in my.

438
01:15:45,150 --> 01:16:07,320
Yes. You don't. You would want to investigate if those were for safety at the hospital level or you wouldn't just automatically.

439
01:16:09,460 --> 01:16:17,760
Okay. So what about impaired nutrient utilization for iron?

440
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:30,040
I would say I think I would probably specify that for related to prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors of function as evidenced by laboratory value.

441
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:42,160
Five. So this is a little bit different than an adequate intake because I'm saying, well,

442
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:51,159
there's actually a therapeutic utilization because this child has been on an acid essentially.

443
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:59,260
So an acid suppressing medication, which is a proton pump inhibitors that prevents that that lowers the amount of acid production in the stomach,

444
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:09,010
which is necessary for optimal ion absorption. So you guys that we haven't gone over this yet, but that could also be the maybe the main problem.

445
01:17:10,240 --> 01:17:17,340
But again, if this patient has to stay on the Zantac, are we going to resolve that?

446
01:17:19,970 --> 01:17:26,530
Probably not. I mean, we can give more items to kind of surpass that,

447
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:34,070
but then that would maybe be more appropriate to like an adequate intake or an increased nutrient needs for iron.

448
01:17:34,310 --> 01:17:44,060
So that would be so here's a different one. Increase nutrients related to iron ore for iron related to this compared with Asian.

449
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:54,430
Also restricted diet is an antibiotic free evidence consistent with our education, visa and dietary quality have limited items.

450
01:17:57,210 --> 01:18:04,080
So you can see how this is more of like than is hate, in my opinion, even though it's not like it.

451
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:11,940
Diagnosis in the terminology, but this is related to intake and utilization.

452
01:18:11,940 --> 01:18:18,580
So this diagnosis and of the seasonality there, I think this needs to be a little bit more than.

453
01:18:21,160 --> 01:18:26,500
Because we can specifically address that by offering supplementation recommendations.

454
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:33,659
Then I also put on here limited food acceptance related to food allergic condition,

455
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:40,770
all through the assumption that ultimately our function kind of captures the nausea,

456
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:47,730
the diarrhea, as evidenced by patients tolerating less than 15 foods at 17 months of age.

457
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:56,770
So we would expect maybe a broader diet like that for. Yeah, it sounds like.

458
01:18:56,880 --> 01:19:06,990
No. So I just put these in here so that if you wanted to see where that was, those numbers coincide to that terminology sheet, you don't have to.

459
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:11,910
And I would say don't impact that.

460
01:19:11,910 --> 01:19:20,219
You don't have any. So does anybody have like people going to choose who diagnoses to write for this patient in our chart

461
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:28,110
which do you think maybe best capture what's going on and what we as a dietitian can directly address?

462
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:40,540
You have a perfect. There's no right answer. Yes, but the first.

463
01:19:45,770 --> 01:19:53,150
Yeah, I think so. I would think definitely one of these is we have evidence that this patient has a deficiency anemia.

464
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:59,690
We have evidence of diet and is limited in the iron foods.

465
01:19:59,690 --> 01:20:08,389
And we know that they've been prepared. So either one of these is probably going to result in the same type of intervention.

466
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:12,800
So we're going to try and get more iron in the diet looking for food.

467
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:16,940
Um, both are kind of similar.

468
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,710
I think either one could work.

469
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:28,280
This child's not getting enough iron, but also probably has increased needs for iron given some of the underlying issues.

470
01:20:28,280 --> 01:20:37,730
So you know what we're finding, um, that we might want to, you know, touch on the limited diet this patient has.

471
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:45,590
This is not something like this resolved quickly, but it is something that we can monitor the effectiveness like.

472
01:20:45,680 --> 01:20:46,879
So maybe a follow up.

473
01:20:46,880 --> 01:20:56,209
We see diet has expanded now to over 20, you know, whatever it may be, that could be like a sign that we're something measurable,

474
01:20:56,210 --> 01:21:01,340
that we can see that now we have this list we've added to more idea rich foods that are tolerated.

475
01:21:03,230 --> 01:21:09,680
So on and so forth. So these ones I probably although these would work.

476
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:14,120
My personal preference is that either one of them.

477
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:23,459
Okay. That's it. We're a little bit over time. Does anybody have any questions?

478
01:21:23,460 --> 01:21:31,470
And I'll post the slides. You have them. And then we're going to be writing lots of different diagnoses the rest of the semester and semester.

479
01:21:31,470 --> 01:21:35,760
So kind of you're up for that. Okay, you guys have a good weekend.

480
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:36,960
I'll see you and Tuesday.
