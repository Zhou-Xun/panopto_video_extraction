00:00:00,015 --> 00:00:03,729
So today we're gonna talk about the Pitfalls of Quality Measurement.

2
00:00:03,729 --> 00:00:08,194
Which is a lecture that sounds should, it seems just like what it sounds,

3
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:10,511
quality measurement is ubiquitous.

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:14,372
Now everybody's doing it, it's been a very,

5
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:17,951
very hot area for the last Decade and a half.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,014
But there clearly are some issues and doing quality measurement and

7
00:00:24,014 --> 00:00:29,637
you need to sorta approach it with a sorta nuanced and sophisticated approach.

8
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:35,802
Even more than that, there's actually now starting to be some pushback

9
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:40,974
against all this measurement, and not just in healthcare.

10
00:00:40,974 --> 00:00:44,416
Education has been faced with a lot of measurement to sorta look at

11
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,054
the progression of students.

12
00:00:46,054 --> 00:00:50,618
And a lot of criticism has been levelled based on those measurements and

13
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:53,740
you're starting to see some pushback.

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:57,418
Not because people say they shouldn't be measured, but

15
00:00:57,418 --> 00:01:02,243
because they feel like the measurements don't actually measure what it is

16
00:01:02,243 --> 00:01:05,842
that they feel that they're doing for their students or

17
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:10,309
capture the full breadth of the things that they're supposed to do.

18
00:01:10,309 --> 00:01:15,269
So, then this is an Op Ed piece by Bob Wachter who's actually the acting chair of

19
00:01:15,269 --> 00:01:17,280
medicine at UCSF at the moment.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,528
He's the person who invented the term hospitalist and

21
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:26,236
in some sense, the field when UCSF first started dedicating

22
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:31,222
internists to hospital medicine rather than the older method of

23
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:36,505
sorta having people handle both outpatient and inpatient duties.

24
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:40,303
And this piece which was published last weekend,

25
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:45,556
basically sorta recounts the sorta push back against measurement.

26
00:01:45,556 --> 00:01:48,068
And that the kinda risks of these push backs and

27
00:01:48,068 --> 00:01:52,385
of talking endlessly about pitfall and the measurement is that, you go home and

28
00:01:52,385 --> 00:01:55,943
you say, well, geez, maybe I should just give up on this stuff.

29
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:59,758
And I think that's very definitely not the message I want you to get

30
00:01:59,758 --> 00:02:00,996
out of this lecture.

31
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:05,570
We're gonna go through a lot of ways that measurement can go wrong, but

32
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,157
it's not part of making an argument that one shouldn't be measuring.

33
00:02:10,157 --> 00:02:13,597
I actually believed pretty passionately in measurement as a tool for

34
00:02:13,597 --> 00:02:15,940
helping to improve what we're doing.

35
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,782
But it has to be done in a sophisticated way and particularly for people who are in

36
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:25,477
healthcare, who are managers in health care, who have to know how to use it,

37
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:29,480
just the way doctors, we have to know how to use our medications.

38
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,799
They can be very powerful, but

39
00:02:30,799 --> 00:02:34,540
they can also cause a lot of bad effects if they're used carelessly.

40
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,080
So, and one of the biggest problems is this kinda attitude.

41
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,740
So it's missing.

42
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:43,116
Although I'm, like most people, kinda a fan of Churchill.

43
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:46,663
In most cases, this is the sorta only slightly tongue in

44
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:50,441
cheek statement about what he thought about measurement.

45
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:56,040
He says the first lesson and this is to some junior member of Parliament.

46
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,984
We're supposed to be getting his health ministry, saying the first lesson that you

47
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:01,651
must learn is when I call for statistics about the rate of infant mortality.

48
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:04,981
What I want is proof that fewer babies died when I was prime minister than when

49
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:06,451
anyone else was prime minister.

50
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,797
And that unfortunately is often becomes the agenda and

51
00:03:11,797 --> 00:03:14,385
particularly on management side.

52
00:03:14,385 --> 00:03:19,385
Is that the goal is to have good measurements more than even to do what

53
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:24,150
you need to do to get the good measurements, right?

54
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,940
And that is obviously an intensely corrupt sorta of attitude.

55
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:35,492
But, I have had managers in a large health system in which I work.

56
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:39,776
One of them, I working two, tell me that if it's not one of

57
00:03:39,776 --> 00:03:44,529
the performance indicators, it does not matter.

58
00:03:44,529 --> 00:03:48,510
Which just completely defeats the whole purpose of doing measurement and

59
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,234
show the basic attitude [INAUDIBLE] will make any kinda measurement,

60
00:03:52,234 --> 00:03:56,360
no matter how sophisticated do, worthless in terms of improving the system
