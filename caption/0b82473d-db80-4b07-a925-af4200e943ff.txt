1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:03,630
I don't want to go. I'm officially closing down.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:12,960
You're not okay.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,320
I don't think that she and her sisters are having these problems.

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,470
Oh, I do. I mean, everybody doing this for me.

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:32,190
Yeah, I think that probably has for the main,

6
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:39,750
it's not as far from a place where these things don't happen very often and is a bit freaked out by the world right now.

7
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:47,130
Okay. Of where I lived in the UK for a long time in South-East London was pretty for me.

8
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:52,680
So I'm pretty used to it. I know there's a stereotype about British weather being poppy all the time.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:00,360
It really isn't. But in some of the places where I lived, it definitely wasn't something.

10
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:11,030
Not to bother, but I know that some people have been that we're getting to the point where Paul is wrong again.

11
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:19,070
So here we are, lucky faces. The first housekeeping thing I want to talk about and we're going to talk about assignments

12
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:26,840
just a little bit because this column is if you go to canvas and you go here to the people tab,

13
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,650
please, everyone meet your classmates. But you can find that very type already.

14
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:39,410
If you click on policy challenge groups, you may take your group.

15
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:46,309
And this is going to to my point, I know everyone's concentrating on policy and to right now I just want you to make a decision.

16
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:52,160
Hence it's free choice. You can have five or six people in a group would be my recommendation.

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,520
So you really get unbalanced in some group has three people.

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:02,059
I might ask some folks to move to change group, so that sounds a little bit more, but feel free to work with them.

19
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:10,190
You like I think you might want to take a little bit of policy challenge assignment directions first of those.

20
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,920
Now we'll go over those and get more exposed things.

21
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:20,989
But for now, you might want to think about what kind of group you want to be in the last four weeks of the semester in this class.

22
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,470
Or you will have a teaching team here.

23
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:34,070
That means me. And yes, I gotten the GSI, but hopefully all three of us at once, we're trying to do a lot more like one on one,

24
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:40,100
chatting with you, talking with your teams, and trying to give you some advice about how to formulate this assignment.

25
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:47,060
The idea is it's like a mini capstone, if you like, so you're going to be practicing some things that you can use throughout the semester.

26
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:56,050
Also, it's a bit more of ownership for you, so people normally enjoy it and we're going to do our best to do the group work in this classroom.

27
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:02,450
You don't have to be here present while we are in those sessions, but this is where your teachers are going to be.

28
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,500
So if you need our help and advice, we show up.

29
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,479
So I think we'll go into that a bit more later on.

30
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,379
I just wanted to let you know that these groups are open, that they're and you can start signing up.

31
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:26,750
Okay. And I wanted to clarify some of the things and talk a bit more if you have any more questions about in too, which is the most one memorable?

32
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,240
So we weren't having this conversation 60 times with each person.

33
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:44,370
I think if you've had a conversation with some first things first, you can't get the targeting particularly wrong.

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,270
At this moment, that targeting becomes a lot easier.

35
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:54,480
We've already selected opportunities for you, so you're wanting to an agency.

36
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:00,320
We don't particularly care whether that sometimes these documents that inform

37
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,240
the public comment opportunities have a named person and an email address.

38
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:10,050
I don't really care if you pick that person or you just write FDA.

39
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:18,430
We're targeting different for this assignment. It's a little bit more about asking something of that agency that they can actually do.

40
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,830
So we're going to look to see whether or not you're doing that.

41
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:30,300
So, for example, you might be suggest making suggestions about how the agency can improve its proposed regulation.

42
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,799
Probably some suggestions that would fall out of scope for an agency like the FDA or anything that

43
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:44,760
involves like outreach or education or big spending programs that really regulating the products.

44
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,980
They're about authorization. They're about definitions and wording in the regulations.

45
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:58,360
So those things would be in scope and on target. If you suggest something else that's way outside what the agency can actually do with its powers.

46
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:04,320
That's definitely not on topic. Okay. So that's how that piece of that we wouldn't have a question about that.

47
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,220
That is so sickening.

48
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:15,650
Once you read all of this documentation and I do it that way, it's very well documented.

49
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:24,290
Each one, I think the documentation provided by the agency, the request is always very long and contains multiple parties.

50
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:30,200
The reason for that is they try to appeal to a wide range of groups.

51
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,360
Some government agencies, regulatory bodies need this feedback.

52
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,370
They need this feedback because they want regulations that work, believe it or not.

53
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:47,750
And they quite often do not have the expertise or don't know what's going on in industry, in communities.

54
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:58,760
So one of this is an opportunity for them to gather information. For that reason, the request for information is going to be framed in Broadway.

55
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,810
You don't have to respond to everything that's in that document.

56
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:09,320
Be strategic thinking about because we're asking you to do this as a real person in the real world,

57
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:15,440
and you're going to submit this to the agency in real time. Think about who you are and your experiences.

58
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:19,610
We've got a diversity of experiences in different parts of the health care sector in the room.

59
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,140
Some of you, this is your first experience and your media identity is closer to being a public health student in this regard.

60
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:35,540
That's totally fine. Think about what your angle is and select some aspects of the large document

61
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:40,490
to respond to it that make sense but don't feel you have to cover everything.

62
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,210
Part of this assignment is trying to make a coherent argument.

63
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:51,080
You could say yes. In general, I support this this change in the definition of healthy.

64
00:06:51,350 --> 00:07:00,980
Here are some things I support. Why this evidence? You can also say there are some things that should be considered when reformulating this guidance.

65
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:06,260
So you can partially agree, you can completely hate the idea.

66
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:14,720
That's also fine. So we want to know why we want an argument when we want evidence in exactly the same way that we did in the previous memo.

67
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,220
Why you start with the template that was provided for the first one?

68
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:29,270
I feel like the first policy memo was some people really, really, really, really, really stuck to the template very strongly.

69
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:33,120
You don't have to stick to it as strongly as some of you did.

70
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:38,299
There was a lot of discussion of like, does the first paragraph have to include national data?

71
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,530
And then you can only introduce state data in the second paragraph and you just following the example very closely.

72
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:51,200
If you're doing that for this second memo. Feel free to play a bit faster and looser with the structure.

73
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:58,970
But I would say still start at that same starting point. I think it is still good to include things like counterarguments.

74
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:05,270
With every argument that you make, you're going to find you need a little bit more data,

75
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:11,030
a little bit more granularity because you're talking about regulations where the details really matter.

76
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:15,170
You're not talking about a piece of legislation and your audience is different.

77
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:22,760
It's a regulatory, official, non-elected person in these agencies, not an elected legislator.

78
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:29,150
So the tone might change a little bit. Anybody have questions about what to do?

79
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,110
Is it okay to like combining Section one?

80
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:38,510
Do you think because you got some folks who are not really.

81
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:45,080
Is it okay to combine the sections and maybe remove a have you look maybe I don't want a paragraph that's rewrite the status quo.

82
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,900
Yeah, I think that's fine. Anybody else.

83
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,630
So we're taking the training wheels off a little bit here. Okay. Don't freak out.

84
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,860
But and you've already done this once before, it's the same basic principles.

85
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:07,270
We're going to have the policy sound today. Today would be a great time of the class.

86
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,059
If you have more individualized questions, if you started working on this, if you haven't started working on this,

87
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:19,870
which is also totally fine, like do think about whether you can take opportunity with me.

88
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,470
I'll be here for an hour and a half of the task and move.

89
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:29,450
Can you talk about that assignment before I move on? Okay.

90
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,280
Had one more question here. I'm sorry, but I was thinking about that.

91
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:41,400
Thank you. Thank you. My question is, are we about to get more?

92
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:47,460
I think we should be more technical with this one if I say yes.

93
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,600
I think it's just naturally it will come out that way.

94
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:54,310
They're asking the question is much more detailed.

95
00:09:54,330 --> 00:10:01,860
They're asking for some specific points that we're going to be responding to a little bit more detail this time.

96
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:08,010
The language, therefore, and the tone is going to be a bit more technical. I think about it's about friendship with your audience.

97
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:16,320
So I think the FDA officials is going to know much more about this policy area because they just let me go.

98
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:24,240
So it's not quite the same as responding to a legislator when it's no guarantee at all that they have any any experience.

99
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,710
Yes. All right.

100
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:38,070
So to continue this, we you talk about evaluation today and using the case of reforms.

101
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,110
Which are you speaking? Which.

102
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:55,890
What do you do? Housekeeping. I'm going to do a little bit of good work today, a little bit of back and forth.

103
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,900
So let's start with what policy evaluation is and then think about what it isn't.

104
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:09,090
And I talked a little bit about policies before someone like Mrs. Loving.

105
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,760
You should read the CDC examination of marital significance of an object.

106
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:24,180
Well, in this case, we're trying to understand the work, merit or significance of a policy, health policy.

107
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:32,310
And so you've been doing that the whole time in this class. Well, we're going to ask you some specific time when doing that.

108
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:39,629
What good things to think about, because it's my job to help you think critically about everything that goes on in health policy.

109
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:44,640
Space policy evaluation is not external to the policy policies.

110
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:51,359
You may see a little bit different from what they use phrases like pure research or things like that.

111
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,810
But some research is for the sake of research, right?

112
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:57,780
The agenda is controlled by the individual researcher.

113
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:06,900
And we want to create knowledge, hopefully about something interesting in the world when we're doing this kind of policy evaluation.

114
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,630
There's a different power dynamic.

115
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:20,040
So the evaluator is, as a researcher, doing something only the gender of the funded agency, which in many cases is the government.

116
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:29,430
And there's a lot of interest from policymakers, both elected officials and elected officials, and lots of key interest groups.

117
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,500
There's a lot of interest in the outcomes of policy evaluation. It's a very political activity.

118
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:40,770
Sometimes it's controversial and sometimes you write an evaluation report and people

119
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:45,060
disagree with it for their own reasons because of their own interest in this.

120
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:55,710
Some objectivity is hard to maintain when doing this kind of evaluation, and it's also hopefully not very one short activity.

121
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,070
If you look at any of the main companies that push for quality evaluation, better policy evaluation,

122
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:07,110
one of the things they're always recommending is don't just evaluate at one point.

123
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:13,770
They should be ongoing evaluation as the policy has been implemented and afterwards.

124
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,000
And that is a key problem because policy changes fast.

125
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:22,890
So in health care, we see changes every year.

126
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:31,500
We've had some major pieces of legislation that I'm going to talk about in a minute and things getting more and more complicated over time.

127
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,870
So trying to keep up with that while doing evaluation of these policies and programs is pretty difficult.

128
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:47,130
Nevertheless, I would say 90% of everything, quite an agency, faculty, some kind of policy.

129
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:55,770
So the thing I'm not I don't see you in this class because it would take me several degrees to prove this.

130
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:03,680
You can see the wide range of analytic methods. Can we use colleagues of mine to do things like policy teams, randomized controlled trials,

131
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:08,820
a difference in difference evaluation, cost benefit analysis, cost effectiveness analysis.

132
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:12,419
We have a whole class on that. Systematic reviews, things like that.

133
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:20,550
Meta analysis. I do comparative qualitative analysis and process tracing, and then other colleagues of mine do things like simulation modeling.

134
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:25,979
So this is thought of ways you can approach this if you want to do so.

135
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,930
In any case, come see me. We can suggest some policies for entering the program.

136
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,680
What gets evaluated? The CDC is quite clear here for evaluation.

137
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,980
You can see the content of the policy itself.

138
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:47,150
So is it clear? Does it make sense if you've been following among the people?

139
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:51,420
Probably finds that actually all the time.

140
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:56,940
That undermines logic, is not clear and goes on to object because it's coming from a political process.

141
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,460
So a lot of the evaluation that I would do would be in that vein or implementation.

142
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:11,040
So we've been talking about implementation in several of these classes so we can evaluate to see whether the policy

143
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:18,059
was actually implemented and whether that matches the goals of public policy even to the various implementation,

144
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,470
which is often really important.

145
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:30,150
Evaluating goals is something that I wish we did thoroughly any time with no emphasis between the the implementation part,

146
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,530
as I said in the last month, often gets small and you can have a at impact.

147
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:44,280
So it's where you want to ideally identify any outcomes that you're looking for before you even implement policy.

148
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,700
Track them over time and figure out whether those outcomes change before and after.

149
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:59,219
So you can see why you need so many different methods potentially to evaluate a policy and not have to reevaluate.

150
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,580
And we'll talk to all of these things. I'm just trying to give you some different approaches.

151
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:19,500
Please. So is this just a way of categorizing the different things that you can evaluate, or do you want to take a little bit from each category?

152
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:25,950
What do you think? I feel like there is certainly value of taking a little bit from each category,

153
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:36,000
but I think it also depends on what you're evaluating and it hasn't been content might be more applicable to like in new new policy.

154
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:40,080
For example, you can't really look at impact accurately, for example.

155
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:46,710
But yeah, I can see value in taking from all three whenever necessary.

156
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,580
I would say so. And this is like a CDC model.

157
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,800
There's a ton of materials on the CDC website should you care to read them.

158
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:03,240
But they have. This is a common way, like in just introducing the kinds of things you could do.

159
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:09,750
I'm going to say most evaluations in practice are going to be in these sometimes as much less emphasis on the content.

160
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:16,680
But then you kind of need to know what the goals are in order to maintain fragmentation, in order to evaluate the outcomes.

161
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:25,560
So is there any is there any category about the above the goals themselves?

162
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:36,990
There's content about how the goals are articulated. But what about the can you criticize the claim that the goals themselves cleaning by.

163
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:45,540
I think this is terrible. Well that's what I do, but not in the context of policy evaluation, because no one's going to pay me to do that.

164
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:52,050
But I think that we all shouldn't consistently try to criticize the goal.

165
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:58,060
That's why I said this question that anyone else know.

166
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,350
I just want to say, I mean, this is is the model.

167
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:07,480
All of them have slightly different things. But isn't this largely guided by whoever is funding the.

168
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,550
So you may not necessarily follow an entire category of this?

169
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:19,680
No, but I think it's good to think about what would be the approaches, because this is getting something wrong.

170
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:27,870
All of these models have a sort of stakeholder engagement or interest group engagement process or audience engagement process,

171
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:34,080
depending on how you want to define it. So you are going to be one of the problems.

172
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:40,770
Policy evaluation is you are kind of beholden to what your audience wants or the client wants a little bit more be something as well.

173
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,410
So that is a constraint on you, the researcher. It doesn't mean you don't get some input.

174
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:52,680
So I think it's good to know some of these best practices and models, even if you write them into pieces,

175
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:58,050
knowing what they're doing and what you're not doing, why you're making those choices.

176
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:05,549
It's kind of my approach to research design in general, you know, to think about the justification for each of those research design choices.

177
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,840
Could you justify them to you as a researcher?

178
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,180
Even here, you should be saying, can I justify those choices to myself in terms of like just general professional integrity.

179
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:30,150
All right. So I'm saying here in Virginia, it's pretty interesting.

180
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:35,670
This is one of those times where I actually get to talk about the UK bureaucracy doing a good thing in the UK government,

181
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:41,010
working as it's sort of an internationally recognized guide, even though it's from the UK.

182
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:49,110
I would recommend, if you want to get into policy evaluation, reading this stuff at these levels and speaking of what each other is really.

183
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:59,630
Because I could just run around with this one stuff that I can just tell myself twice, which is very lonely.

184
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:06,980
All right. So what if what I wanted to show here is there are lots of different ways to approach evaluation.

185
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:13,250
Look how much of it has to happen before you actually get to the research and analysis part.

186
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:20,060
Right. You have to figure out one of the objectives of the policy were any outcomes you're interested in measuring.

187
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,340
You need to figure out this audience question like who are you serving with this evaluation?

188
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,330
How do you read this evaluation? Who has to be engaged?

189
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:39,050
But my advice for writing these things is always to even though you know your audience and even know you know who has to read this evaluation.

190
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:50,120
Write for the public audience. Or if any document that you write, any policy brief, any evaluation is going to be widely read on the Internet.

191
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:56,410
And so never think about what private audience always includes the public in your audience, too.

192
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:01,370
So you're going to select your approach. You're going to figure out what data requirements.

193
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:09,170
You're looking for resources and governance. And then you get to conduct the evaluation, which can take be very quick.

194
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:15,020
You could be asked to do something quite rapidly, or you could be evaluated in a much longer period.

195
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,420
Ideally, I think a lot of the people who promote best practice in this area would want to see longer

196
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:27,050
term evaluations with like key reports and checking points and findings on a regular basis.

197
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:31,360
And then you've got to disseminate. So.

198
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:38,530
These are the common problems of policy evaluation and how the CDC thinks you should address them.

199
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:43,420
But I hope that you can realize that there are a lot of things that can go wrong.

200
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:51,160
Sometimes we don't build in the idea of evaluation into all of our grant proposals.

201
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:58,030
Sometimes there is evaluation grants, something being proposed,

202
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:03,159
but you've got to figure out whether that's the costs of evaluation and implementation

203
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:11,410
into your assessment that sometimes leads to this terrible reading correctly identified.

204
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:17,590
Who you should be engaging with will do the evaluation. I guess I just haven't looked at the actual research.

205
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:26,019
Maybe you picked the wrong methods. Sometimes things go very wrong when people are trying to solve a battery and they say, Yes,

206
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:34,270
we should do this quasi experimental observational study and it's going to be over this many months and it's going to be incredibly ambitious.

207
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,710
We cannot interview everybody and collect all this quantitative data, and we're going to do this analysis.

208
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,890
So being a hard business in those circumstances and applying methods that you don't know how to use correctly is a.

209
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,550
I cannot emphasize enough how bad the data is for some of these things.

210
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:57,130
Maybe it's because I've been doing coke at work for a while. The competition is so bad.

211
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,600
So you have to think carefully about data quality if you're going to use preexisting things.

212
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,430
Yes. Do you have a question for me? Sorry, I don't.

213
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:14,920
Don't mind. When people talk while I'm talking, I get really distracted and I give a lecture.

214
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,270
But if you have a question, please, like, bring it to everyone. No.

215
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,120
Okay. So sometimes, as I said, policymakers do quickly.

216
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:31,050
So that's really difficult political scrutiny. So a colleague of mine for a while was evaluated in Healthy Michigan.

217
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:39,480
So the Healthy Michigan evaluation is a project that is pushed by the legislature and funded through appropriations.

218
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:47,730
That's a problem politically because you have to defend your the results of your evaluation in front of a political audience.

219
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:50,940
And I think that's quite a difficult thing to do,

220
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:57,150
especially when you have a partizan divide over people who support healthy Michigan and people who don't.

221
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,020
Right. So that kind of evaluation can be high profile, high conflict.

222
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,800
It might be exactly the kind of work that you want to do,

223
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:10,440
but you have to realize that you might have to defend this in front of a political audience who might not like 30 votes.

224
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:19,800
And in those cases, if you're working in a team of people, you've got to figure out how to pick people who are more junior than me.

225
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:26,960
How do I protect people who might be people with marginalized identities who are in my research team?

226
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:31,350
Right. Public scrutiny also.

227
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:34,830
And sometimes there are not there is not enough of it.

228
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,010
Conversely, in evaluations happen, but we don't really know that they're happening as a as a general public.

229
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:48,260
Finally the difficulty of comparison.

230
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:51,640
So this is something I work on quite a bit. But he what is more interested in it?

231
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:55,940
Let me know. How do you compare things that are not very comparable?

232
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:03,050
For example, I get asked to compare responses to COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions across countries.

233
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,720
How do you do that? How do you compare countries or cities or populations that might not be that might be lumpy?

234
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:14,180
When you've got that data? There are some ways to do that, both quantitative and qualitative approaches.

235
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,970
Getting to know those is good. Some of the classes in this school will help you do that,

236
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:27,290
but you really have to have a case selection strategy to understand what you are comparing before you start.

237
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:32,870
So that's all I'll say that that's an effort. If anybody is interested in that, come hit me up for a conversation.

238
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:41,620
So I want to try some of this discussion of devaluation into a discussion of value based payments and programs,

239
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:50,200
because anybody who's talking about health care reform will be talking about some of these value based payments,

240
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:56,590
insurance design programs that are very prevalent and all over different parts of the health care system.

241
00:25:57,190 --> 00:26:03,970
And it is not my job to exhaustively tell you about each of these models because you can be here for a long time.

242
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:11,900
But it's my job to help you think critically about where they sit from a policy perspective and a little bit from a political perspective.

243
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:17,740
And how does this relate to the evidence that we may have and the evaluations that you might have of some of these questions?

244
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:26,360
So you guys tell me what are some value based payments programs that exist in the US healthcare system?

245
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:31,790
What are they supposed to solve? What's the problem here?

246
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,200
That these market based designs are trying to solve sickness, solving?

247
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:43,470
And can we name some of them? Is so many. Oh, my gosh.

248
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:48,450
I'm going to go for training on Staples like me.

249
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:57,439
So they're aiming to reduce, like, low value care and like the defensive medicine that a lot of,

250
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,460
like, just doing has to like increase the cost for patients.

251
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,490
Yeah. So if you have a fee for service model, the idea is that that incentivizes greater volume.

252
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:14,479
Right. In theory. So in in these cases, you're trying to think about, well,

253
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:21,520
how can we move away from that bottom line based on what is somewhere where we're thinking more about quality and quality.

254
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,120
Care. And we're also thinking about costs when we're talking about.

255
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,980
What are the values that van based payments and programs are based on?

256
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:39,050
What about an important question? When we talk about value here, what how is value defined?

257
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:51,240
I'm accelerating the transmission before I do this.

258
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:05,780
I guess like an hourly quality, like, I guess in terms of my family's care, there are like quality metrics that organizations look to.

259
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:12,250
It's sort of like. Easy quantitative measures that you need to take to.

260
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:16,070
I guess qualitatively, I think that is a little harder to capture.

261
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:28,430
Yes, this is a strong emphasis. Yeah, I think I just want to ask that question because it's quite easy to go straight to that.

262
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,260
It's economic value. Yeah. Know, I was just going to say cost effective methods.

263
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:43,910
Yeah. Right. So it fits with certain amounts that of evaluation that we like to use, such as in the beginning cost effectiveness and that,

264
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:50,330
you know, cost effective businesses would be one cost benefit analysis would be another way of thinking about it.

265
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,290
A lot of ideas and values that reside in field of economics.

266
00:28:55,430 --> 00:29:02,130
And so one of the interesting things here is can these models be opened up to other values?

267
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:09,590
For example, there's a push at the moment to create more population based models in this space.

268
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,629
And there's also a discussion about what health equity needs in this space.

269
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:18,260
And they are using the phrase these agencies health equity.

270
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:22,970
They're talking about disadvantaged communities and they use the phrase health disparities.

271
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:30,200
But I don't think there's yet a great understanding of what we mean when we say you have to build one of those models,

272
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:35,450
how to incentivize the adoption because that they exist.

273
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:38,720
But the adoption is actually pretty poor across the country.

274
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:43,910
And I want us to think, well, seriously about why we're doing that to.

275
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:52,620
So just in case you were unsure how many different types of these programs.

276
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:57,760
Well, there's a lot of different ones. And I know some people I would recommend highly.

277
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:04,930
And you get a lot of these in other countries. But there's a Commonwealth Fund report that came out this year.

278
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:14,440
A group has a rundown of every every one of these things and then actually reviews the evidence and evaluation for each.

279
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:21,160
Um, I can post that on the, on the CAS website if anyone's interested.

280
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:24,640
But what we can see from that is, hey,

281
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:34,180
this is a pervasive idea as a policy idea is one of the most adopted ideas in the health sector over the last 15 years.

282
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:45,939
And this is the result, very fragmented set of programs, really complicated as anyone with any practice experience,

283
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:52,090
either medically or in terms of health management where you have conflict in some of these programs.

284
00:30:52,180 --> 00:31:07,020
What was that experience like? I mean, it only steps in to make sure it isn't difficult to.

285
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:16,750
So, yes, this past summer, I worked as an administrative intern in my college town back home.

286
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:19,870
And one of my projects was to examine, like,

287
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:26,379
the hospital radiation reduction program and see like where specifically you're having what communities were being affected,

288
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:31,570
like where like in Iowa City, those are being like Congo refugee.

289
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:36,250
And they were like our highest source of just like readmissions.

290
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:42,610
And then like my job more was to see like if we were coding those as observation studies and like what they were

291
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:49,570
doing to mitigate that risk basically as well as in a lot of the accountable care organization this past summer,

292
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,840
like one of the largest ones in the state of Iowa itself.

293
00:31:53,500 --> 00:32:01,580
Right. Thank you. Anyone else? Yeah.

294
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:06,100
So this is not like I said, I'm not going to go over these in detail.

295
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,550
Please note these across several major health programs.

296
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:13,810
So you've got Medicare and Medicaid chip in that.

297
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:21,759
And so that's also quite important because it's to do with care.

298
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,940
And then how is these reforms affecting people who have care?

299
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:34,390
But at least the care provided the patient population, the reimbursement varies a great deal across these different settings.

300
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,130
So you're going to get fragmentation and a patchwork one.

301
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:48,160
And the reason we have this patchwork, which I stole this graphic from the CNS website because it was such a group,

302
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,580
I was like, I don't think anybody made this graphic. I was trying to make one.

303
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:57,430
And then I thought, Actually, there is one right there. So the reason I like this is it tells me a little bit about my history.

304
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:04,569
So I'm on the top. We've got four major pieces of legislation, Medicare, which is the Medicare improvements to patients.

305
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,230
And why does that, which is about trying to get more people.

306
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:12,370
It's sort of an it has outreach incentives as well as payment.

307
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:22,600
So to try and improve enrollment in Medicare, particularly for low income people who are eligible for Medicare,

308
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,980
and then the ACA, which is the one that we're going to talk about the most,

309
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:34,930
because it's still the most significant piece of legislation will have a care in the U.S. How protecting

310
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:40,600
access to Medicare Act is very kind of similar actually to the goals of Medicare and that matter,

311
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:49,330
which was an entirely payment reform focused piece of legislation, the Medicare Access and Chip Re-authorization Act of 2015.

312
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:57,580
So they included this hopefully. So you can see the people created one program within their definition of value based programs.

313
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,830
ACA created full time, created one and created two.

314
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:10,990
And this so close together 2012, 2014, 2015, 2018, 2019.

315
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:16,450
And there's still implementation elements that are happening now.

316
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:20,350
Maybe it was just extended a bit, I think, till 2024.

317
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,720
So there's still things going on with implementation of each of these programs.

318
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,780
What's going to change in quite a short period of time?

319
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:43,900
And so it would be quite important, I think, to evaluate all of these things and that is indeed what the health research community has tried to do so.

320
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:55,780
What? I can't resist doing this, so you have to be kidding. I feel like these kinds of solutions, both value based payments and programs,

321
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:04,720
I'm not going into quite so much about built the insurance design, but public policy, the political science we talk about closed.

322
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,830
It's also actually where my help I students also actually have ideas and I see solutions but in

323
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:17,170
policy because it outlines a solution that's kind of complex little bit the goodness I guess,

324
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,810
and it's dead on top of the previous solutions. And so we talk about the US political system as a product.

325
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:30,940
It is a political system that creates these kind of policies which called complicated, fragmented.

326
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:40,750
Then they add on top of the last thing that we did. And so in an organization or as an individual trying to ensure organization of compliance,

327
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:44,469
trying to adopt this, trying to do this in terms of the impact,

328
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:49,060
maybe personally on your practice, whether you're a manager or a medical professional,

329
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,750
that Mary can be a problem and the complexity definitely a problem.

330
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,299
And I think there are a lot of implementation issues here, which I'll talk about in a minute,

331
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:05,320
which are the result of this is layering in the complexity of these kinds of programs.

332
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,079
So I want to go through the reasons why I don't receive too much.

333
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:19,239
But the idea is we have a political system that's really permeable to all kinds of interest groups with their people in the health sector or industry,

334
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,220
whether they different to other interest groups or whether they're quasi entrepreneurs.

335
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:33,310
A number of these things were created by people who were at Michigan or are extensively studied by people who are in Michigan.

336
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:39,850
So vivid based insurance design is an idea that originated here in that formulation

337
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:45,010
and then was put into the ACA through some lobbying by people like Michigan.

338
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:55,270
My tenure who used to work here and then now works at Harvard, is also very prominent in doing research on these kinds of reforms.

339
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:02,110
So I would say would be policy consistent.

340
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:07,060
We have a federalism where I don't need to go into why that causes fragmentation.

341
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:13,660
We have partizanship and we have a lot of courts and other actors use the courts to shape policy.

342
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:21,370
So we tend to get this kind of policy and it doesn't mean they can't be good and have value.

343
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:29,730
I just want you to think like, what are we doing this way? They're doing it differently and have that kind of policy imagination around that.

344
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:35,540
What is possible in this? Some really complicated set of programs.

345
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:39,840
There's a lot of diversity in their adoption, their effectiveness.

346
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:46,230
The evidence is very mixed. The population affected is what is the criteria for can you participate?

347
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:53,700
Can you be paid? And one of the problems here is that countries attract more clients.

348
00:37:54,060 --> 00:38:01,320
So the thinking at the moment is, as I said, pushing towards this status quo.

349
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:10,830
How can we make value based payments and programs more widely adopted, better implemented?

350
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:18,360
There's a push for program rationalization of these programs because so there's

351
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:21,990
a call to the agency to rationalize these programs because it's so complicated.

352
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:31,140
And then there's also a push towards incorporating social determinants of health on the one hand and discussions of equity.

353
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,879
And so, you know, these slides I put quotes around equity because sometimes I think what the

354
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,330
agency thinks is equity is not what I think of when I'm thinking about equity.

355
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,910
I'm probably not what my anti-racist Collins colleagues are thinking about when they think about equity, frankly.

356
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:52,980
So I think there's still some ambiguity about what platform, what should that work, which I'm going to do you think that.

357
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:59,760
So do you find great programs and components?

358
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:06,700
And I of want to know what's your impression so far?

359
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:13,630
And I think about these things in your other classes, how do you think that these are successful?

360
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:20,020
Other examples that you can point to where you think that's how do you think about when you think of.

361
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:33,650
I think it depends on the infrastructure that you set up. I have no security background.

362
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:41,839
And when we're building these workflows, a lot of times the emphasis is on quality managers and being able to report.

363
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:48,640
So you kind of get paid. And a lot of the work we do is highly customized in the system.

364
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:54,530
So I think from that perspective you just have to have a setup, right?

365
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:03,200
Which is a long process. I think if you're trying to make sure this is I would come at this from the point of view of implementation,

366
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,299
like what some of these results are clearly quite complex specific because

367
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,840
when you look at the evidence for some of these payment systems and programs,

368
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,160
some of the models produce a modest cost savings.

369
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:19,480
Some of them produce no cost in so many of them.

370
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:24,410
Some of them produce a quality improvement. It's not always clear what caused that.

371
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:33,260
So there's a huge problem of evidence, and a lot of it comes down to the content specific infrastructure and sorry,

372
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:38,510
am I missing anybody else's question? That's going to be a little bit tied to that.

373
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:46,610
I came from like patient access registration before I came here, and this is just an overall problem with our health care system.

374
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:54,079
But the complexities of the ACA insurance models and payers just it feels like it just continues to add layers to the

375
00:40:54,080 --> 00:41:00,180
administrative burden that's on hospitals and specifically on like the registration and billing and coding staff.

376
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:02,659
And so from my end,

377
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:12,290
it's like is further complicating the reimbursement and selling process going to solve the underlying issues that we're trying to build across?

378
00:41:13,130 --> 00:41:18,290
I'm not I'm not necessarily convinced that it does like it might do,

379
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:25,400
but I worry that complexity adds labor frustration, which is when, you know, labor is expensive.

380
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:32,510
So I can see again being a context specific thing that's going to vary a great deal

381
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,750
depending on which of these programs in which institution you're talking about.

382
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,870
I think amplifying what they said. Also,

383
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:48,620
my hospital is somewhere that really strong ACO and we would have we used artificial intelligence basically to take the burden off of the physician.

384
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:54,589
So for example, if like a patient had diabetes last year, then it would come up again.

385
00:41:54,590 --> 00:42:01,459
Software like the provider would just have to like you wouldn't have to go in and manually code every year.

386
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,500
They'd just like approve it basically.

387
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:10,159
So I think that is something that is ways and we do have the technology to get around that to make it more efficient.

388
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,340
But also another point is like my econ group is actually pretty simple, like the HHS, the HRP.

389
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:22,550
And I think that I saw even in my own hospital organization that a lot of the time is that like,

390
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,010
yes, the readmissions are going down as a result of the penalty.

391
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:35,329
But it's also, I think, like making the access harder for certain groups because hospitals and providers

392
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:40,730
are like not as incentivized to care for these socially disadvantaged groups.

393
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:48,600
And as a result, they're avoiding harm or just like coding them for observation stays and many other ways to work around this.

394
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:54,800
Yeah. And anybody else want to come in on this?

395
00:42:57,020 --> 00:43:01,490
The other thing I think is interesting is that we're talking about this and I just my health policy.

396
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:10,770
Right. I wanted to remind is always that we're talking about people and not everybody can benefit from this performance like.

397
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:18,900
And some of them have benefited more than others, which is one of the things that kind of concerns me.

398
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,800
So it's a mixed evidence.

399
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:30,770
And like I said, a lot of this is from the Commonwealth, which I think is pretty comprehensive and they've got my program study by study.

400
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:35,160
So if you have a specific interest, go and look at what the evidence is for the moment,

401
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:44,159
why they together are looking at CMI models so that if you go to their website,

402
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:51,590
they have a database of these models, you can knock yourself out looking at all these different things, the amounts, the trends.

403
00:43:51,690 --> 00:44:03,360
And they found that six of the 15 models launched one CMI in the ten years after the passage of the ACA to statistically significant savings,

404
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:07,550
which is less than you would think so.

405
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:14,540
And they also pointed out in that report that many models were not designed really to address health disparities.

406
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:16,380
So this goes back to the values question.

407
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:24,330
And most of that you did evaluate statements and the evaluations weren't really necessarily looking for those differences

408
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:32,250
across different demographics or parts of the population and explicitly both there and then in some other papers.

409
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:40,440
This is a nice journal article in Health Affairs by some do make a selection.

410
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:43,650
So this is an important part of doing an evaluation.

411
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,920
How do you know all the different what you're going to measure?

412
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,360
But then what is the measurement and what you choose to be?

413
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:55,260
The measurement and how you conduct that measurement is actually really important for the outcome.

414
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:04,680
And the thing we've got, we do have models for and the free sheets by the national quality for disparities, sensitive measures,

415
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:15,750
and all of those are good but disparity sensitive measures, there aren't very many validated equity measures being used in value based purchasing.

416
00:45:16,290 --> 00:45:21,329
So and I think that's important.

417
00:45:21,330 --> 00:45:26,620
We're not there yet. So this is an open question and I don't want to judge it too, too much.

418
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:31,860
Or do you want to what extent is this a question of implementation?

419
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:36,930
Implementation? He's very patchy. Some places have really gone all in.

420
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:46,770
And the place where you're working clearly that Mexico was like going all in on this and others are not adopting this as thoroughly.

421
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:55,950
And I'm not sure we always know why. And I think the thing to say is how I might express this question.

422
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:57,719
Are we expecting too much?

423
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:08,370
I think is another question that we should ask ourselves, because we've come a lot of expectations on these kinds of reforms to deliver big things.

424
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:11,520
And in part, I think that's sort of, again,

425
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:18,719
reflective of the political process where politicians and people who are lobbying them are incentivized to say,

426
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,720
yes, these kinds of reforms will revolutionize the sector.

427
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:28,410
These kinds of reforms will make great changes and great strides in cost savings quality.

428
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:34,290
And you can make a wide range of claims based on this policy idea at that stage.

429
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:43,709
And that tends to happen. I studied health right for a while and you see exactly the same thing that help i.t is treated as and health information

430
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:50,430
exchanges in particular were treated like a magic bullet to bit for some of the problems that we see in the health care system.

431
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:58,800
And there were big, big expectations hung on those. And as a result of changing the policy, there were some really important improvements,

432
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:05,160
but they can't match up to the expectations for that policy that was set up in those political discussions.

433
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,640
And you can go read the legislation quite often,

434
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:13,320
the rhetoric in the legislation about what this is going to do and what the aims of the law are always very expensive.

435
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:24,870
So I'm not judging these questions, but I want us to think about should we be trying to implement laws changing the model?

436
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:35,430
Should we be thinking about what the things in conjunction with these kinds of models that we're going to have a discussion about it?

437
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,630
I just wanted to show you how much of an implementation question this is.

438
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:49,110
So this is Rachel went to Harvard and then some colleagues and the person who's really on the ball on these issues.

439
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:53,760
And they did a white paper, which I quoted here.

440
00:47:54,180 --> 00:48:02,580
And I just want to highlight a couple of things for you. So first of all, they were asking for a clear vision.

441
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:07,830
So they want clarity and more clarity across across different agencies within government.

442
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,610
So there's clearly from an implementation and evaluation point of view,

443
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,480
already a problem with some of these initiatives not matching up across different government agencies.

444
00:48:19,770 --> 00:48:24,690
Simply, they asked physicians to dramatically simplify the care and value based payment landscape.

445
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:31,920
So they think that this is overly complex and that's creating implementation problems at the organizational level.

446
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:42,060
And furthermore, there's a lot of the adoption and implementation of adoption is very uneven across different providers.

447
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:47,590
Then they're saying if they're for this substance, they're already participating.

448
00:48:48,290 --> 00:48:55,770
We see a movement towards population based payment models, for example,

449
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:02,830
and trying to prevent the ability of providers to opt out of body based payments altogether.

450
00:49:02,850 --> 00:49:04,710
So this is this has to be the thing.

451
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:18,120
Then they also say, you must know, we tried CMS tried to attract providers or push them to advance the payment models,

452
00:49:18,120 --> 00:49:23,160
but then structure incentives to push providers away from the service payment.

453
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:33,360
This is a really important point and it might sound small to you guys, but now using the word incentives is about incentivization through payments.

454
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:40,320
This is a very American problem, very, very American formulation of the health policy problem.

455
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:45,210
And it's a solution that if you can just get the payment incentives correct,

456
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:50,910
you will get the assumption is you will get the behavior that you want to see within the health care sector.

457
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:59,700
Now, payment reforms are an idea that have is not just an American idea, but it has traveled to lots of countries around the world.

458
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:05,880
We do see some improvements in other countries that have submitted that have implemented payment reforms.

459
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:13,460
But there's something about the governance in some of those countries where I think they have a more centralized system.

460
00:50:13,470 --> 00:50:21,660
It's easier to implement this. They're not relying so much on incentives and they're relying more on directives for these kinds of reforms.

461
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:26,590
And so that's why I think some of those other countries have had successes in this area,

462
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:32,970
some successes that America has, not necessarily in some cases as well.

463
00:50:33,370 --> 00:50:44,310
Finally, Richard, anybody calling for achieving health equity and saying this must be a central feature and no translation pain?

464
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:58,670
It don't say a lot on how that works. But the equity equity core for health equity is and so this is what the policy entrepreneurs think is happening.

465
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,960
What we researchers who are working on this think it's happening, how they are evaluating the current progress.

466
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:11,130
Does anyone have questions about this? And I wanted to know,

467
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:21,500
I think I think equity one is just kind of like challenging based on some of the

468
00:51:21,510 --> 00:51:26,129
stuff in other places and looking at it from like a health data perspective.

469
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,690
Like we know that the data has so many racism,

470
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:37,230
like structural racism like built into it that it's really hard to look for it and help my team with the way that the data currently is.

471
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:43,320
And then I also was reading some stuff about, you know, if we're going to see something like widening social determinants of health,

472
00:51:43,770 --> 00:51:50,219
is it actually it's kind of not fully ethical to do that if we're not going to actually help the patient.

473
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:53,670
So if you're just like, you know, if you're going and see your doctor and they say,

474
00:51:53,670 --> 00:51:57,450
okay, tell us all about, you know, these social factors that are having an adverse,

475
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,299
you know, on your health and then just say, okay, great, thanks for letting us know and then not doing anything about it.

476
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,570
Like, you know, you're breaking that trust between patients.

477
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:10,880
So I don't know if they think from a policy angle that they're talking about.

478
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:18,959
Well, they don't talk about it in this report in a lot of detail. But I can tell you that some of the developments in that very reason,

479
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:24,660
like can we do a pilot program that provides for patients that don't have great access to food?

480
00:52:25,420 --> 00:52:29,010
There's other some other initiatives that can get counseling as well.

481
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:35,790
It's not clear how those are going to be generalizable across the country particularly, but they do exist.

482
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:38,280
And so the idea, I think,

483
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:47,530
and maybe the power of the idea is that you could include potentially these services and in a way that is connected to the health care system.

484
00:52:47,700 --> 00:53:00,240
And that my oh, my guess is more of a maybe I'm just being jurisdictional and petty, but public health is on here going, Oh, you could find us.

485
00:53:00,250 --> 00:53:08,190
We're we're pretty good at doing some of these things. And also, I think that most governments will also have more robust social policy programs.

486
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:14,520
I think we need to think about the ethics and operational effectiveness of doing this through the health system.

487
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:21,059
So I see some other avenue only doing this because of the reforms and things we've done before.

488
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:25,170
And so this is like a we would call this part dependency political science.

489
00:53:25,170 --> 00:53:30,690
So you're following a set path and not necessarily directing based on the decisions that you made before,

490
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:36,090
because the cost of deviating to another fault is actually quite great for some of the actors involved here.

491
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:42,990
I just want you to have that that thought process going on because I mean, you shouldn't try to do any of these.

492
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:46,880
Things aren't when we're thinking about how and why.

493
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:51,040
I think that's quite important. All right. Okay.

494
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:56,500
We're running out of time. So I'm going to just very quickly and then go to the evaluation.

495
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:06,980
So I think if we're going to think about this, one of the things we need to do is revamp how we do evaluations of these kinds of programs and models.

496
00:54:08,060 --> 00:54:16,340
So what my observations form the basis for these programs programs, and then how can we get there from here and what methods are needed?

497
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:21,180
That's one of the reasons why I assigned that one on in MILBANK,

498
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:29,059
where with the Christian colleagues indicating that when the payment reforms address

499
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:32,480
the social determinants of health and reflecting a little bit on why that is,

500
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:38,930
and then Ward and colleagues are also talking about the different kind of evaluation that's more of a community participatory model.

501
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:46,579
And I wonder what scope we can or imaginative ideas we can come up with around that community connection,

502
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:49,970
what that might mean for operationalizing some new models in that.

503
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:54,570
So I want you guys to get into some small groups.

504
00:54:55,790 --> 00:55:00,460
We're going to do this for about 15 minutes or only actually, maybe even a little less than that.

505
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:09,500
So I think that in this Ebola quick scan, if you haven't already at one of these papers.

506
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:17,329
And in general, I just want you to think about the questions that were asked today and what criteria might you use or should be used to evaluate these

507
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:27,440
kinds of systemic reforms if we are considering the social determinants of health or population health to return any opinion from,

508
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:30,940
these are the questions about and we should do more of this too.

509
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,170
I decided to stop doing this. The model is broken or anything else in between.

510
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:44,130
Okay. Yeah.

511
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:48,630
Know. All right.

512
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:57,920
So there's a lot of Americans. Sorts of social determinants of health.

513
00:56:03,410 --> 00:56:18,980
This stuff doesn't incentivize falling asleep and sincere incentivize, but you just get to see them and you're like, What changed?

514
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:31,280
Like, nothing happened because I liked the quality of the screen starting for nothing like that.

515
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:48,600
So I think smaller, more like the programs like identify high resolution and then like go out at least initially in good condition.

516
00:56:49,460 --> 00:57:01,400
You know, I think that of get housing resources and like all just starts quarter as part of that because like that looks like you have to use public

517
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:16,450
housing about these retired great adventure and ask because we weren't 1% is to save which I did and so I worked in Austin University,

518
00:57:16,550 --> 00:57:29,180
so I don't think we really did much and I think we just did things like, yeah, that's what a lot of people like us like instead of public health,

519
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:46,650
what should people be maybe a little less 26, 21 year old short attention span like such a short attention span for these types of things.

520
00:57:46,690 --> 00:57:53,810
I look up think it's just not and that's a lot of it.

521
00:57:54,790 --> 00:58:04,970
And just like sort of I can't let you go to school is kind of like seems like

522
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:15,260
kind of made it more broad so they can be a certain part of your community

523
00:58:15,260 --> 00:58:19,860
because they're so underfunded in this country that they will never think that

524
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:39,100
we're try to accommodate so many Xeroxing with small scale version of me.

525
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:52,930
Right? I think that's like a risk for the first couple years.

526
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:58,540
I think that's why I do want to resettle.

527
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:22,130
I think about all of this and I think it's like these guys are trying to do more by like right now and they're like,

528
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:43,150
Oh, like you're like my political class of people.

529
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,700
Like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

530
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:57,610
I think, I think that's fair.

531
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:12,320
I don't know how it puts.

532
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:29,990
People have done a lot of them because of political pressure, but I think they all have been saying this.

533
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:36,090
But they're doing this because they see it as like a private business or is controlled by the same side.

534
01:00:36,620 --> 01:01:02,600
But that's interesting because that's when every time I feel like it's like sweating it out.

535
01:01:04,830 --> 01:01:14,900
I just. I don't care. But I wrote once.

536
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:25,010
No, I don't think so.

537
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:32,910
So it's better. It's positive that one, the trans-Tasman scenario is running dry.

538
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:41,480
But you know, I think I probably take our picture.

539
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:48,560
I love you. Makeup up your.

540
01:01:50,150 --> 01:01:53,280
I know you were just talking about me.

541
01:01:54,560 --> 01:02:00,120
What's your opinion? To be deeply sorry.

542
01:02:01,610 --> 01:02:22,280
So there may also be other places they can survive like that.

543
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:29,510
I don't like the providers following up on it.

544
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:36,020
There's no way to watch it.

545
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:47,900
Like in the future service system. Like it's always, how can I see more than anything else I'd like to see more like last resort,

546
01:02:48,210 --> 01:03:24,800
even if the act like screening smoking admissions or not actually to get the house place tonight.

547
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:40,880
Eventually. I like the idea of how you use the machines or something like that.

548
01:03:44,780 --> 01:04:01,030
How do you feel about everything in other countries like Crimea?

549
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:08,980
Okay, that's probably going to be fine.

550
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:30,190
I don't know what you want to say that might be or something like that.

551
01:04:33,560 --> 01:05:03,420
I year old never wanted to the small ways I like to think about it.

552
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:12,440
I mean, like wanting to write everything down, like how to dress.

553
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:24,650
Not only have you have some place with their very best friends, you just need to support the next time, as I know, this has his back.

554
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,640
I think that's right.

555
01:05:31,010 --> 01:05:34,530
Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel of life.

556
01:05:34,630 --> 01:05:44,700
You just found out that all.

557
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:52,120
They got issue with me.

558
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:55,550
Sorry, we've got a bit of a futile discussion today, but I hope it's helpful.

559
01:05:57,640 --> 01:06:05,870
Five more minutes. I've been hearing quite a few things and I'm saying it's not going to get more opinions on these

560
01:06:06,190 --> 01:06:13,299
models or this specific question of can we do this pivot to social determinants of health?

561
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:23,930
And if so, how can we do it? That's one of some things that people are discussing with the other people, right?

562
01:06:25,330 --> 01:06:28,480
It's you know, I'll be in serious trouble if I lose a queue.

563
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:34,270
All right. Who wants to contribute? I'm skeptical.

564
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:43,480
You? I keep this guy running. All right, let's try it, because we're just talking about it.

565
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:50,110
We talk a lot about food insecurity and transportation as two specific issues that,

566
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:55,690
like underserved populations, frequently have issues with and that health systems might try to address.

567
01:06:55,690 --> 01:06:59,910
But what they're working with community partners and it's not super reliable and

568
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:04,540
fundamentally it's not addressing the underlying issue like lack of public transportation.

569
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,140
So we were just discussing like what is the health system's role?

570
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:16,870
How could they more effectively partner with an organization or address like the underlying issue rather than just like putting a Band-Aid on it?

571
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:24,670
Yeah, like we talked about in a lot of groups about like, oh, and how does that work exactly?

572
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:28,990
And how do you create a metric or measurement to show accountability?

573
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:38,760
Because when I think about how this works in the community based services or public health services, you're trying to get patients to an appointment.

574
01:07:38,770 --> 01:07:42,360
It's really a labor intensive thing. You got to figure out transportation.

575
01:07:42,370 --> 01:07:48,810
You got to figure out reminders. Then one of the things just going on in their life that make that impossible.

576
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:55,150
Right? And so how do you overcome that and how do you overcome that from the position that health system is currently in?

577
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:59,230
All right. What are some of the things that people want to bring out?

578
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,650
You go and see, you've got the cube now. It's good.

579
01:08:03,340 --> 01:08:14,620
We were talking about how we can count on companies to that any entity that's made to stay afloat or to make money,

580
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:20,919
to focus on social determinants of health and hope that will come as a side effect of what they're doing.

581
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:28,600
Whereas like, oh, if we fix this equitably, we'll get better health equity.

582
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:30,400
And as a side effect of what we're doing,

583
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:44,140
if we if if health equity is not the main concern of the government for an NGO and not for profit, then I don't think it will just happen.

584
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:54,690
That's the case with Nigeria. Security is its main issue is to lower health care costs for many reasons other than health and to bring Medicare.

585
01:08:54,710 --> 01:09:06,770
So maybe one way that it could help is if we get someone who is abusing the policy to abandon health care, and then we put a stop to that.

586
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:13,280
And we we open the way for people who don't have good access to care, to access that care,

587
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:19,540
then maybe that is one way we could help with that, but otherwise, not very often.

588
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:23,220
We'll just be addressing health equity. Right.

589
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:29,820
And it's really difficult because I talked about this with some other groups like equity might involve spending a lot.

590
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:39,560
And if the purpose of this will be programs or legislation that you might put in place is to save money.

591
01:09:40,520 --> 01:09:43,760
I mean, is that all this savings guaranteed? Maybe not.

592
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,000
Given the mixed evidence on some of these these models.

593
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,030
So, yeah, that worries me. Right.

594
01:09:50,100 --> 01:09:58,069
I think some of the things that we might be required to do to actually address the social determinants of health all the better done within this

595
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:09,110
framework or should they be done somewhere else and force or incentivize parts of the health care sector to connect with some of those other systems?

596
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:16,339
Is that if we're going to be effective because many of those systems are on funding fragmented single payer system,

597
01:10:16,340 --> 01:10:24,230
in fact, one of the problems was so I think it's madness and it will be fine despite the problems.

598
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:30,200
Okay. Let me take one more comment and then we will wrap this up, but we will be talking about this a bit more in the next session.

599
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:37,560
One more energetic, enthusiastic client. You? Yes.

600
01:10:38,130 --> 01:10:42,840
Oh, no. I don't know.

601
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,969
To. I was just going to ask, like, about the incentivizing thing.

602
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:51,720
I think that's a big area to explore more of.

603
01:10:51,720 --> 01:11:00,420
And I was reading a study actually for something else, but they were talking about the idea of a of like hearing instrumentation for a clinic,

604
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:04,229
like identifying the people who have had no show rates, contacting them, saying,

605
01:11:04,230 --> 01:11:08,400
we're going to send you a, you know, free ride essentially to this appointment.

606
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:10,889
And you show up. And they said, well,

607
01:11:10,890 --> 01:11:17,219
for three months while you do a study that they actually received more from the insurance company actually paying for

608
01:11:17,220 --> 01:11:22,500
that appointment than the person just now showing and the small amount of costs that they had to do for the patient.

609
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:28,920
So obviously to, you know, scale that up to something nationally, things will probably not be feasible.

610
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,309
But like some sort of initiatives like that where you're incentivizing like, hey,

611
01:11:32,310 --> 01:11:35,700
you're going to make a lot more when you can charge the insurance companies because they're actually

612
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:40,320
complete and then a $20 that you're going to make without actually getting the transportation.

613
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:46,650
Yeah. So you're reliant on the ability of those healthcare organizations to be musically that sort of musical sense of achievement.

614
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:50,579
And then it sounds good.

615
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:56,390
And I think that would be one, as you mentioned in some of the 20 minutes and very poorly is going to be in some other places.

616
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:58,200
Yeah, like I said, yeah,

617
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:04,139
like somewhere like Michigan medicine would be a lot easier to implement that compared to somewhere in the U.P. where there's maybe not a lot

618
01:12:04,140 --> 01:12:15,480
of transportation to that and they don't have someone that they can take to meet by this president when he saw the patients on this morning,

619
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:20,720
I don't even know that we're going to have the policy sound right now. So who I would.

620
01:12:21,590 --> 01:12:33,149
Yeah, well, you know, I feel like this is what people saying.

621
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:38,490
This is how you write in terms of your environment that.
