1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,530
Or did you just do a precaution to support another ex-partner?

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,320
I didn't know if we were just supposed to show the one that we chose. Both of guess I did both.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,720
So I just took, like, I just did. Cool. I need to change.

4
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:33,450
I'll send you the form. The first question was what incidence rate of.

5
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:53,690
You know. Good. She wished to go because we saw it right here.

6
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,920
She's like she's like, that's how I roll. Like, you mean like some kind of.

7
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,390
Yeah, I just. Oh, boy.

8
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:32,610
Does everybody. Oh, well, it's kind of empty. Oh, maybe.

9
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,420
Maybe they're all here. Maybe. Maybe this is where I start the these.

10
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,770
He's coming, right? I don't know. I hope not.

11
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,590
You know, I was thinking, like, if you're going to make a five hour midterm, it's only fair to cancel class.

12
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,959
That's what we were just talking about. Tell us where he was like on Tuesday.

13
00:01:51,960 --> 00:02:03,710
Maybe he left because he was confused about what it was about the magazine, right?

14
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,890
Yeah. How would you break it to us again?

15
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,450
But you do not. You ignore the 3 hours.

16
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:21,210
Right. How do you go through it? Oh, okay.

17
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,180
Yeah, I think that experience. Yeah, this is good experience. It sounds like you got around.

18
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,440
It was good. And then we got great feedback.

19
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:40,860
They said they didn't want me to call him on this one, but they said we have the best solution.

20
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:46,650
So from the get the graph, this was a great day and better than great.

21
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:53,729
So that's really sure. But I was like, well, that's not really my issue.

22
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,180
Like, who wants to sit down with something?

23
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,130
Because nobody's really I don't really want anything like you got me back on.

24
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,489
That never happens. Like Social Security conference was on the edge, was fine.

25
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,970
I can see that. So that's great alumni.

26
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,900
Oh, I think so much on LinkedIn about it.

27
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,370
So I was like, Surprise yourself.

28
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:23,570
I got to say yes.

29
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:30,120
Okay. Which for you, how was your cover?

30
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,320
The hikes? Fun. Picturesque.

31
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,600
It was beautiful. I mean, yeah, yeah.

32
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:45,590
It was gorgeous with that because I think it it's not the drive so stressful stressful.

33
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:50,610
Yeah I was really struck just because they re getting back to their beauty not.

34
00:03:51,440 --> 00:04:00,599
Yeah. I was like yeah. And it was like it was big, you know, like there were just a lot of I was on target and television, so it was really great.

35
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:11,280
It was good, like mad because like, I should look like I should have said it better to be good for everybody.

36
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:26,669
I like the recipes. Yeah. I mean, I didn't do enough, really wanted to do one, but it was like it's like one or two people have to pay extra $15.

37
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:33,550
It's just really good.

38
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:40,020
So I had an hour to ask what I thought of the term poverty.

39
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,520
So I was finance village guard.

40
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,420
So you sure I'm defending?

41
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:59,820
Like, I think that if I look at it like, I can never get it.

42
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:06,200
Oh, that's crazy.

43
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:10,890
And you're like, oh, my God, you you're going to get the Internet if I get it.

44
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:18,930
Okay, that is like that's why should you lose or should you buy what you want?

45
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:27,479
Like homework assignments. I do like that. I like for the 60 seconds and stuff,

46
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:40,020
but I have an Excel super using what is controlled by content or something that means not like through like triplicate or anything like that.

47
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,280
It would mean it's like, how would you have that? But then when that was the case, sure.

48
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,370
So they actually like to start doing a transition.

49
00:05:48,370 --> 00:06:01,090
Yeah, maybe, like I said, this huge spreadsheets and but you actually have to calculate it just happen.

50
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:13,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And like other places can look at your cell phones and say person like yeah.

51
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:19,260
So that was, that was so computers. I just want to sit here.

52
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:23,790
Yeah, but like, not for the books. I have like ten.

53
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:32,299
No. No. Yeah. I had someone close to you.

54
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:40,670
Glass told me stuff, so. Oh, great. Okay, well, you can talk about it.

55
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:48,470
I don't want to take up too much time, and so I want you to experience what I was told me to do.

56
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,610
So I can't go through what they're like all the time and like we do, really?

57
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:03,350
Just to continue to see you work.

58
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,140
Yeah. Yeah, I was just talking to you.

59
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,710
I never mind that it is actually for you. Yeah, because, like.

60
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,970
And she knows. I understand. But that's what we do is crash your team with the.

61
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,740
Yeah. Yeah. Oh yeah.

62
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,540
I mean, that is actually. Yeah. No, I'm not saying that.

63
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:37,460
I thought she was going to do that. Yeah, but I kind of like leanings like that, so I just felt like to say to the students.

64
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:45,140
Yeah. I mean, I think, you know. Yeah, just like values I really admire.

65
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:59,510
I think it's teaching, recording and progress behavior as a way to make people happy.

66
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:07,240
You know, I think I think that was pretty cool.

67
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:32,890
He told me that I was like, Come on now, I'm not listening to this any more intimidating than anyone else.

68
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,520
No, no, that's okay. Yeah, I know.

69
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,160
Me too. Well, okay, good.

70
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:47,350
Because. I have this dilemma with.

71
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,049
Okay. I have two questions you're trying to get answered.

72
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:04,200
Keep your answers as concise as possible. Really?

73
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:10,070
Oh, my gosh. Really. It's so annoying.

74
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,469
I hate that so much. I know it's like the word and it was like all your photos to your account because,

75
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:28,830
you know, really, it's like four years later, Cornell was like storage.

76
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:32,490
You have now and now you have like.

77
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:44,950
And so yeah. Yeah, it's the quality gets weird because I know how to do it.

78
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:54,060
Sorry. So I was doing.

79
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:07,479
As part of your mortgage stop.

80
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:23,380
It's finally that she can be adamant that she couldn't ask us to let her know she would like to actually work for us.

81
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,960
And the thing to watch, well, don't think too much about it.

82
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:37,710
She's still been listening to my calculations there, but she sounds like a much better.

83
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,900
And I'm like one of you.

84
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,750
I saw music playing. Okay. Good morning, everybody.

85
00:10:47,780 --> 00:11:01,530
Sorry I'm late. That was. The plane arrived late last night, so a little bit discombobulated this morning.

86
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,670
So any questions about the death?

87
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:13,950
When it says for like questions two through five, I think we got a chance to.

88
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:19,760
Like try to answer a question using either of these two methods are using it.

89
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:26,729
Compare these two methods. Do you want us to do the both of the methods and then compare the results or pick the

90
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:32,760
method that makes more sense based on the data and not make more sense of the data.

91
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,100
So we have an analytic way to to to find out.

92
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:45,240
Means that the means square error. Right. So do it and then compare them based on those categories and see how in a forecast.

93
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:51,780
Okay, that's great. Do we have to include graphs?

94
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:08,300
If you want to. Yeah that that's so the graph is not going to tell you what to do is going to, you know, you you have an idea of of what's going on.

95
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:16,320
But, you know, the graph will tell you whether it's stationary or non stationary seasonality or not.

96
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,570
Right. That's that I told you in advance.

97
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:29,990
So it doesn't appear to have such finality. It doesn't really have appeared to appear to be to have trends and so on.

98
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,030
So, so yeah. So you can take that out.

99
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:43,430
But what I'm looking is at the if you told me I am going to forecast with this method,

100
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:49,370
I am going to focus on this method because you have the lower it means whereas in the trial.

101
00:12:49,400 --> 00:13:01,640
Right. So you just you're going to use one method to forecast, but you are going to try both methods up to the point at which you have data, you know,

102
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:15,730
to see how they the method perform, as I said, and then decide that on their own the one with the smaller means,

103
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:23,030
whereas is the one that I'm going to use this one. Okay.

104
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,450
Any other question? It's it's not too bad, right?

105
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:48,390
All right. So I'm going to continue today talking about the cesium tree and how.

106
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:58,080
You know how we are going to be so decision tree and decision trees in general.

107
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:04,470
So that the whole idea of our decision tree is and I'm going to.

108
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:21,860
So finally. I said.

109
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:39,310
You can just click the little excel. Oh, yeah. Thank you. So let's see.

110
00:14:50,680 --> 00:15:00,100
So as we were talking last night, the Decision three is a graphical representation of the decision problem writing,

111
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:07,450
which you have shows and states of nature and state of nature, which are ones that you don't know.

112
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:16,300
You know what what what decision, what the state of nature is going to be realized in the future.

113
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:28,839
For example, in our decision trees, we are going to denote the point at which either you make decisions or make your decision made.

114
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:37,330
Note. There are two types of nodes. One is what we call the decision node, and that is, you know, this square, right.

115
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,760
And at that point in time, you either make a decision or nature makes a decision.

116
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,780
Right. And then they say they knew you quite well.

117
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,080
In this case, you make a decision, this is this way.

118
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:58,450
Right. And then how many options do you have depending on the branches that come out of the decision node?

119
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:06,820
So they say that you have two possible decisions to make based on that decision.

120
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:15,140
You might have another decision to make right away, or you might wait for a state of nature and a state of nature.

121
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,970
Let's say that is the state of nature are represented by circles.

122
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:33,040
This is where your opponent nature makes a decision and you don't know which decision nature is going to take.

123
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:38,079
But let's say that they are similar possibility. State of nature one a state of nature.

124
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:45,460
Two of the State of nature three. And in this case, let's say that they are just two possibilities state of nature, one and two.

125
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:54,129
And then after that, maybe there is nothing that you cannot do if this happened, nothing that you can do to resolve it.

126
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,570
But there is a decision that you have to make these happen.

127
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:09,280
And then, you know, they say that you have two decisions and that those decisions, you know, will make you make the decision.

128
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,390
And then something some state of nature happens.

129
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:18,160
Right. And then you are done.

130
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:22,370
And then let's say that this is this is all big game.

131
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:25,980
This is all the decision. All the decision points.

132
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:36,000
So how are you going to evaluate the decision so that the decision tree, you just build that from left to right in chronological order?

133
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:42,210
I'm saying I can make a decision here now and then make sure you do something.

134
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:46,660
I present the state if make your proceedings a state one or a state.

135
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:55,330
Do I have nothing to do? That's all is nature percent the state of nature three Then I have a decision to make.

136
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:59,530
And for each decision I am a state of nature.

137
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:06,030
One or 2 to 2. You know, to the old ways.

138
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:14,400
And the same thing happened if you take decision to the nature of the state one or two, and that's it.

139
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:27,310
So now something like that can be in a decision tree and it can be your, you know, your whole game.

140
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:31,000
Right now, the question is, what are you going to do with that?

141
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,249
You're going to evaluate.

142
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:45,110
What you need to do is evaluate each one of those notes and evaluation of each one of those nodes is represents the value to you.

143
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:50,010
If you at any point happened to be at that, you know,

144
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:57,720
if in the decision process you happen to be at that node, then that's the value of the game to you.

145
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,240
That's how you evaluate how well you are or how badly you are, right?

146
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:15,880
So on how the way we evaluate Daniel Well the so the first thing you need to do is evaluate the final nodes, right?

147
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:26,580
And the final nodes is the total body of the totality of that you will pick that you will make if you get at the very end of those nodes.

148
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:35,459
So if you are if you complete the game and happen to be here, then you get $250,000 in.

149
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,450
You will play the game, you hear? You lose 30,000.

150
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:47,670
That's right. So at the very final note, you will evaluate what is the value to you of the whole game.

151
00:19:48,600 --> 00:20:00,690
Okay. Then you say, let's see, let's let's assume that if I get to this point,

152
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:18,720
I got 800 and this here will be 200 and these here will be -100 and here will be 500 and here will be a thousand.

153
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:24,120
And here is going to be -200.

154
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,800
Then. 4000.

155
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:37,620
Zero. Those are my final notes.

156
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:48,430
And so once I evaluate my final note, when I know these values or if I am if I complete the game and I'm here, then I get it.

157
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:53,050
I complete the decision process and I'm here. I get to handle it.

158
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,650
If you get yourself at that point,

159
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:08,440
then what we're going to know to do is evaluate every node in the game or every note in the decision process from right to left.

160
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:22,270
And we are going to put the values of these intermediate nodes, the facade, the decision nodes, or the state of nature of node,

161
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:31,809
and then we'll figure out the whole value of that game to you and what is the best path to go for and to

162
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:40,000
achieve your aim to maximize your respective value or minimize your impulse control or something like that.

163
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:45,610
Right now is so hopping that you don't know.

164
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:50,470
You probably know which decision you would make right from.

165
00:21:51,160 --> 00:22:00,340
But, you know, figuring out what you see in front of you, but you don't know which decision nature is going to take.

166
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:10,090
You don't know which node nature is going to pick when when nature has to pick either one or two or three.

167
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:16,930
But what you can know is the probabilities that are assigned to each of those nodes.

168
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:27,830
You know, they they how likely is nature to take this state of nature one or state of nature to their nature three So let's put those probability in.

169
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:36,490
So every for every single event, no chance of rain or a chance?

170
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:45,040
No. We have probabilities emanating through that node or all the branches and the probabilities both 0 to 1.

171
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:53,320
This is the probability conditioned conditioning on being at this point, conditioning of the of this point, conditioning of being on this point.

172
00:22:53,650 --> 00:23:00,670
So let's say that the probabilities will be, in this case, 0.3.

173
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:08,270
2.3 and here 0.7.

174
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:21,990
Here is the 0.5. And then I think this one, let's say that is.

175
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,520
.1.9.

176
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:39,820
And I just need one more. Right. So this is point to point three.

177
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:52,610
Point five. So what I'm going to do now is evaluate this note from right to left.

178
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,269
You know, I build the decision tree from left to right in chronological order that this

179
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:05,270
happens then and nature can do this then I can do that right from left to right.

180
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:13,160
And now I'm going to evaluate that node. The tree went over to each node and they're in the tree from right to left.

181
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,260
And so how do I evaluate chance nodes?

182
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:28,849
I'm going to evaluate chance nodes with this monitoring value, all the branches that emanate from that change.

183
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:33,350
Note, for example, what is the value of that node?

184
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:36,050
The value of this knowing here will be,

185
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:47,479
I don't know if nature is going to take these 4000 or is going to take this path or table beyond zero, but is 5050 chance.

186
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:55,040
Right. So I'm going to take the expected value of this out of these nine just so it's going to be force out sometimes

187
00:24:55,040 --> 00:25:03,800
only 5.5 times zero so as to solve until the value of these node here for me is going to be two sounds.

188
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:14,730
So actually, let me put these these values in red so we can actually distinguish them.

189
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,840
Right. So this is.

190
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:25,680
So we have a 2000 value here. Then let's evaluate these other nodes.

191
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:38,259
So there's going to be a thousand, 10.3, 300, 300 minus -140.

192
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,379
Right. 300 -140.

193
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:48,030
That's 160, right. To you.

194
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:54,290
Okay. So we have to, you know.

195
00:25:55,680 --> 00:26:01,919
You know, values because of two of these nodes evaluating this is a to solve some of

196
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:10,170
them this is one system and let me evaluate these other node here this chance,

197
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:16,290
though, that I can evaluate. So this is going to be 509.9.

198
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:19,500
That's for 50 minus ten.

199
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:23,910
That's for 40. Right. So we have four point.

200
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:35,350
Now. Okay. Now, this is and this is, you know, how the way you evaluate the decision.

201
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:41,870
So I look at the in this case, I don't have any probabilities because I am going to make the decision.

202
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,260
I am going to make the decision that benefits me.

203
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:54,110
Right. So I'm looking, I'm looking I'm in this square node and I am looking at what are the possibilities.

204
00:26:54,110 --> 00:27:00,830
And I say, if I go for this decision, for this branch, I'm going on expectation to get 160.

205
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:05,480
If I go for this decision, I get a notification to be 2000.

206
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,130
Then I get to the outside of this petition, which one I'm going to get. I'm going to get the maximum right.

207
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,600
I'm going to go for the best. For the best, for me.

208
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,670
So. So I take the maximum in this case because I'm maximizing profit.

209
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:25,700
So in this case, I would say between one 62,000, I'm going for 2000.

210
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,110
I'm going to order this each year. So go into 2000.

211
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:36,919
Right? And now I can evaluate this node, right?

212
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:41,100
Because I have the value of this node, the value of this node on the value of these notes.

213
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,559
So this is going to be 2,000.5.

214
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:51,470
That's a thousand. It's now sometimes 160, right?

215
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:57,500
So 1000 to 1. This is 1160.

216
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:04,280
These is going to be like, yeah, so it's 63.

217
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:13,370
And so this is 2000 and this is 63,000.

218
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:18,620
61. And then this is 20, right?

219
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:22,909
So 60. 20, 80 is how so?

220
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:30,350
That's 1080. Right. So this is $1,080.

221
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:36,110
Okay. And then you say, okay, now I have to make a decision.

222
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:40,189
Do I go for one 1080 or go for for 40?

223
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:44,530
Of course I'm going to go for number one. That is the maximum.

224
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,970
So the overall game is 1080.

225
00:28:50,980 --> 00:29:03,760
So once you have all these nodes evaluated, then that's your decision that your decision tree is ready to give you answers about what to do.

226
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:12,910
So while the optimal path is okay, I should go for this decision because of expectation.

227
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:16,240
I get 180 if I get there.

228
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:25,240
Nature comparisons, a state of nature one and I get to a hundred statements or two and I get 200.

229
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:29,949
So the initial one, I get 100 and it's they don't need to do that.

230
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:36,550
I get 200 or a state of nature three that I get 2000.

231
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:43,150
Okay. So if nature presents a state of nature three, right,

232
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:54,460
I should go for these decision because that's a you know, it will give me instead of 160 will give me 2000.

233
00:29:54,790 --> 00:30:05,410
So the optimal strategy in this case is go for branch number one here, let's say branch.

234
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:18,879
And then if I make your percent one of these days, it's nature percent of, you know, this this date, that's if they can set this date, that's it.

235
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,900
You don't have anything to do is make your percent the state number three.

236
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:29,409
Then you would go for these branch B because of expectation.

237
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:33,190
You get 2000, you can get 4000 or you can't get zero.

238
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:39,380
But that's, that's the evaluation. Yeah, I'm kind of confused.

239
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,030
So we start by, we start going from right to left.

240
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:48,880
So we evaluate the end nodes and we get to 160 and 2000.

241
00:30:49,540 --> 00:31:00,640
And then the reason why we don't have probability for like squares, what you're going to have probability for the squares.

242
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:07,570
Yeah. So that's because like there's no because you are going to make a decision there.

243
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:12,670
So probabilities is that I don't know what nature is going to give me,

244
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:20,500
but I know the probability of nature is going to give me for the point that you are going to make a decision.

245
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:25,330
There is no chance at all. You are going to make the decision that is best for you.

246
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:40,190
Okay. I think I understand. So you when you get to the 2000 square, the reason why it says 2000 is because the best decision is to go with branch B,

247
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:46,640
it is to go to branch B, you'll never take branch these branch.

248
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:54,600
Right. Because you are looking and say, I can get 2000 here or I can get 160.

249
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:58,000
Why wouldn't I go for 165? Not get to sell?

250
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:06,480
Okay. And so then we've made the decision to do the 2000 branch and so then we write 2000.

251
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:11,690
We go back, we go right to left and we write 2000 on the decision square.

252
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:25,280
And then from that 2000 decision, we do 2000 times point five, 200 times quite three, 100 times two to get to the one 82010.5 to 210.3 110.2.

253
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:31,790
That's the one they were making. And then because we choose 180, we put that on the very four square.

254
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:37,420
Yeah. Okay. So it's back. It's all back. Okay, thanks.

255
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:43,160
All right. So that's the whole thing about the decision.

256
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,610
Decision trees. Right. It's no mystery.

257
00:32:47,480 --> 00:33:02,690
Yes. They you know, the the difficulty is in structuring the tree to draw in the tree and so, too, to know which which thing comes first.

258
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:09,860
Right. So you Bill first from left to right in chronological order.

259
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,209
I can do this first and then nature can present this.

260
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,270
And based on what nature country said, they can do that and so on.

261
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,520
But then you evaluate from right to left after you.

262
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:31,930
The first thing you evaluate is that I now know, okay, if I go through all these are what is my payoff at the very end.

263
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:37,240
And then you can evaluate the nodes from right to left, right.

264
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,520
And then because you evaluate that node from right to left,

265
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:48,620
you will know what is the best path for you, the path that gave you the maximum expectation.

266
00:33:51,670 --> 00:34:05,560
Now you'll see in the decision trees that too in order for us to evaluate to get this I not know these zero these 4000 these -200 these hundred.

267
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:13,889
So we sometimes what what we do is we put intermediate values in the prime,

268
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:20,980
which is below the prime, just so we can actually make a easier computation.

269
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:30,430
Let's say that if I if I take this branch, I'm going to get it just by taking this branch.

270
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,820
I'm spending $100.

271
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,820
Maybe this is a serving. Right.

272
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:50,020
And I spent the $800 with this RV. And then if I get these if I get this, you know, this state of nature, I'm going to get a zero value of it.

273
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:56,230
And if I get this state of nature, I'm going to get a 600 a value added.

274
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:06,360
Right. And then you use these, you just add all the intermediate points and say -100, 600 that I get.

275
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:15,219
Then the final note is a 4500. And here you say -100 plus zero is -100.

276
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:21,940
So you add the intermediate values of the branches that are, you know,

277
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:35,800
as you go from left to right and that give you the overall the overall value of the node of the terminal node at the very end of the gate.

278
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:41,799
Right. So it's a lot of numbers, but just easy computation.

279
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:56,830
So let's let's do that right now, you know, a simple decision tree and let's see see how it goes.

280
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:30,560
So you. It is. You find?

281
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:31,170
Okay. So I am going to make this available to you.

282
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:41,880
That's going to be part of our homework. So that's why, you know, it will be will be useful to have.

283
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:53,670
So what so let me let me actually read the problem first and then I am going to, you know, put it in a place where you can you can reach it.

284
00:37:54,180 --> 00:38:03,570
And it reads, The school corporation is negotiating a contract to borrow $300,000 to be repaid in a lump sum at the end of nine years.

285
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,590
Interest payments will be made on the loan at the end of each year.

286
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:11,540
The company is considering the following three financing arrangements.

287
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:19,770
The company can borrow the money using a fixed rate loan that requires interest payments of 9% per year.

288
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:28,559
The company can borrow the money using an adjustable rate loan that requires interest payments of 6% at the end of the year.

289
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,879
Of the first of the first five years, at the beginning of the six years,

290
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:43,920
the interest rate of the loan on the loan could be could change to 7%, 9% or 11% with probabilities .1. 25, 1.65, respectively.

291
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:49,889
The company can borrow the money using an adjustable rate loan that requires

292
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:55,860
interest payment of 404 percent at the end of each year of the first five years.

293
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:08,550
At the beginning of the first year, the interest rate of the loan will change to 6%, 8% and 10%, with probabilities of 5%, 30% and 65%, respectively.

294
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:16,860
At the beginning of the seven year, the interest rate will decrease by one percentage point with probability of point one increase by one

295
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:23,339
percentage point with probability a point do or increase by three percentage point with probability 0.73.

296
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:29,459
The decision tree for this problem comparing the total interest paid under each possible scenario

297
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:37,410
in which decision should the company make if you want to minimize expected total interest payment?

298
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:50,550
Okay, so we are going to compute the we are going to make decision three out of this and we are going to compute the path.

299
00:39:51,030 --> 00:40:00,360
We are going to actually figure it out. What's the best decision to make if we want to minimize this, the total interest paid?

300
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:13,469
Okay. So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to make this available to you in point 17.

301
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:17,070
So I am going to put this.

302
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:29,620
I don't want more sick. So it's going to be one of many.

303
00:40:30,310 --> 00:40:33,350
But I'm going to make a quick home run.

304
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:43,250
Number six here. And then when I changed the one.

305
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:20,260
It is in 20. And so is making 1027 so and then I had two more options and simply going to put their Glasgow file here on.

306
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:04,940
Okay. You should have that now as soon as you download it.

307
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:12,950
And then we'll we're going to going to start thinking more into those.

308
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:19,270
And I'm going to open. But you should treat.

309
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:41,000
Then close it and then go back and.

310
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:58,750
Okay. So this is how it reads.

311
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:01,770
The Bad News Corporation.

312
00:43:01,930 --> 00:43:15,760
We know the company can borrow the money using a fixed rate loan that requires interest payment of the, you know, oh, 9% per year.

313
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:19,059
So how many options do we have?

314
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:24,790
So when you start a decision tree, I'm going to start a decision tree here.

315
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:43,420
How many options do I have? So we're going to start a decision tree and I'm going to call that problem.

316
00:43:56,430 --> 00:44:11,510
1570. So I have probably 15, 17 and remember that I want to minimize that total interest payment rate.

317
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:21,170
And if I want to minimize the total interest payment, I'll go into the calculation and the calculation instead of the being the maximum payoff.

318
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:30,440
If I want to minimize the interest paid paid, then I want to minimize the payoff.

319
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:40,610
So I'm going to get the minimum payoff. So the only thing that that that is going to change is that when you when you are on a decision note,

320
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:50,900
instead of taking the maximum payment, you take the minimum rate because you are minimizing your interest rate.

321
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:54,170
So you are looking at two numbers and those are bad for you.

322
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:59,240
You are taking the mean instead of looking at two numbers from your decision note

323
00:44:59,540 --> 00:45:07,770
and taking the maximum because it's good for you in case things are costly.

324
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:11,840
So we don't want to put any negative or simply minimize the cost.

325
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:19,580
So what he says the optimal path is going to be the minimum pay of the probabilities.

326
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:23,170
Those are 2 to 100%.

327
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:36,290
They are all around 6.01%. So in case your probabilities don't want add exactly to what it's worth, you know, using impositions in the calculation.

328
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:48,230
So oh rounding error then we, we have some tolerance here so you don't get an error in inventory.

329
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:53,209
So we are going to we're dealing with money, right?

330
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:57,680
So see, $300,000 to be repaid.

331
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:09,950
Okay. So let's if we are dealing with money unless four months is the calculated values are going to be

332
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:27,620
currency with the one any decimal and yes it the calculated probabilities let's say percentages and.

333
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:35,150
One decimal 9.1% or.

334
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:49,510
The input values are going to be the same, right?

335
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:54,100
They improve. Values are currency.

336
00:46:57,150 --> 00:47:14,050
It's not that simple. No sense. And they calculate their input probabilities to be also percentages with one decimal formatting and.

337
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:24,600
Right. So where they are. So if, if you want to see there's another function here in that we're not going to use right now,

338
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:29,250
but in position three that you can put the exponential utility function there.

339
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:36,270
So instead of making decision on the expected monetary value or expected video, you can say,

340
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:43,880
okay, I want to use utilities that I'm going to use the exponential utility functions with.

341
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:50,990
And then you put the R value that you you think for that specific decision maker.

342
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,510
So I'm going to click okay and we are not using this potential utility function.

343
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:09,690
So this is my my first element, you know, my first branch.

344
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:21,809
I'm going to make it as large as possible so you can see that you want.

345
00:48:21,810 --> 00:48:30,780
This is. Hi, Facebook.

346
00:48:32,130 --> 00:48:38,660
This is two things I'm going to do now.

347
00:48:38,670 --> 00:49:02,140
Make it a little bigger. Okay.

348
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:05,389
So this is this is a fine.

349
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:09,620
I know, but I have to substitute what is the first thing I need to do in this problem?

350
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:18,220
The way they confront this issue or a state of nature right away.

351
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:29,870
What is that I need to decide on? Maybe if you borrow the money or use the cash.

352
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:34,190
I don't think that's right. No. So you're going to borrow the money, right?

353
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:40,010
So, so? So so what?

354
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:45,290
What are the possibilities? A fixed rate or adjustable rate?

355
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,380
Mm hmm. And how many types of adjustable rate?

356
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,620
You have to say the company can borrow the money using their fixed rate loan.

357
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:58,610
The company can borrow the money using an adjustable rate loan.

358
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:07,730
You know that that those days and the company can borrow the money using an arrow there and just above the rate loan that requires interest.

359
00:50:08,090 --> 00:50:13,340
Of course, I was 4% at the end of each year for the first three years.

360
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:18,010
So we have three potential 3 to 3 possible positions.

361
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:22,290
I can go for the position one using the fixed rate loan.

362
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:27,700
I can or I can have two adjustable rate loans that I can choose from.

363
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,069
Right. So that there are three decisions.

364
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:43,310
So I am simply going to go here and add decisions and then I add one more branch and I have three decisions.

365
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:53,000
And the three decisions would be. Okay.

366
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:59,509
Then I'm going to call that fixed rate.

367
00:50:59,510 --> 00:51:09,740
Loan rate, then they fixed rate loan is how much.

368
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:25,120
99%. 9%. Okay. And this is no compound interest.

369
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:36,650
So this is great interest. So we're going to do the whole thing and then we have a loan of $300,000, right?

370
00:51:52,400 --> 00:52:00,550
So my loan, $300,000 I'm going to call this loan is to make it easy and sell.

371
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:16,810
Okay. So what is going to be my if I go for the fixed rate loan, what is going to be my interest payment at the end of the nine years?

372
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:30,550
It's nine years, right? So the company in question 9% per year,

373
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:41,830
the company is at the end of the company is negotiating a contract to voluntary offers a lump sum at the end of nine years.

374
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:52,070
So it's nine years, 9%. Right. So. So it's a lump sum of the total interest that I'm going to pay.

375
00:52:52,430 --> 00:53:09,020
This is going to be equal to loan times the interest rate that is 9%.

376
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:19,690
Right. And then times the number of years, which is nine.

377
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:28,950
So that's what I'm going to be paying an interest if I go for a fixed rate loan of 9%.

378
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:41,410
So $243,000. So what happens is it puts $233,000 here because that's that's the that's the cost of the of the branch.

379
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:44,640
And immediately you're added because this is a terminal.

380
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:54,310
No, that said, 243 plot nothing out. 243,000 So is it really.

381
00:53:54,430 --> 00:53:59,500
243 B, it costs you $243,000 to borrow $300,000.

382
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:04,509
It says this is 9% for nine years.

383
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:13,510
Right. So well hence the borrowed money is 9%.

384
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:24,520
So. Those of those with mortgages will know that it's seminal.

385
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:33,180
But this is this is no let's say this is a loan sum up the end of nine years.

386
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:46,850
Usually you have loans that if you are paying, you are paying you you are getting your, you know, the amount of money that.

387
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:54,930
So you are applying your interest to a lower amount of money because you are paying either way.

388
00:54:54,940 --> 00:54:58,950
But this this says no. Okay. I gave you 300,000.

389
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:02,940
You pay me at the end of 99 years.

390
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,370
The 9% does. So.

391
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:23,500
All right. So. Let's see what happened with with idea of adjustable rate loan.

392
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:31,290
Number one, the company can borrow the money using the adjustable rate loan that requires interest payments of 6%.

393
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:39,460
At the end of this, of each of the first five years, at the beginning of the six year,

394
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:44,260
the interest rate of the loan would change to seven, nine or 11%.

395
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:53,290
Okay. So I can. The first one is six and then seven, nine or 11%.

396
00:55:53,860 --> 00:56:10,120
So here. Okay. This is 6% for five years.

397
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:20,530
Just it does this branch and then at the end of the five years, then you have a chance.

398
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:29,050
No, you have three possibilities. You don't know which one you're going to get, but there are three and the three are that.

399
00:56:29,950 --> 00:56:33,070
Number one could be that you get.

400
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:41,460
You get. You get here is seven, nine or 11, right?

401
00:56:44,690 --> 00:57:00,100
Seven nine over 11. So.

402
00:57:08,950 --> 00:57:16,330
So it is seven person or seven.

403
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:33,380
For 40 years. In.

404
00:57:36,730 --> 00:57:50,990
9%. Thoughts or years.

405
00:58:03,590 --> 00:58:08,690
11% for.

406
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:16,630
Four years. Okay.

407
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:36,730
So that can happen. So you start with 6% for five years and then you pay 7%, 9% or 11% for the rest of the nine years or for four years.

408
00:58:37,270 --> 00:58:40,270
And here, let's see.

409
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:49,770
The probabilities are. .1. 25.

410
00:58:49,770 --> 00:58:54,330
1.65. 2.1.

411
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:02,580
Five. Point 65.

412
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,040
Okay. So let's put the numbers here.

413
00:59:09,430 --> 00:59:18,640
So how many and you know, how much interest do you pay at the end of five years that's going to be equal to the loan?

414
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:26,420
Times. Then 6%.

415
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:45,250
For five years. So $90,000 here, you're going to pay for two alone times.

416
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:52,030
7% will buy four years.

417
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:59,180
Are you going to pay the loan?

418
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:10,360
Times. 29%.

419
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:22,500
Times. Four years.

420
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:40,660
This is equal to the Roman times 11%.

421
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:50,690
I'm. Or are you?

422
01:00:54,230 --> 01:01:08,810
So. So the total interest payment for adjustable rate loan to will be 90,000 for the first five years and then it can go to 84,000,

423
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:22,220
a118 or 132 with these probabilities show they happened since you ever the notes at the very end and this one is 74.

424
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:25,730
This one is 198. This one is 222.

425
01:01:26,060 --> 01:01:30,139
And then you used to go to 22 times point 65 plus one.

426
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:37,700
98.25 goes 174 times point and and then that's 211,000.

427
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:52,960
So that is that if you go if you go for these options, then you pay 243,000.

428
01:01:52,970 --> 01:02:04,350
If you go for these, option on expectation is going to be 211,000 211,002.

429
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:08,120
Right. Let's go. The third one.

430
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:13,410
You see the third one. Is this true? That's the best part, because we're paying zero right now.

431
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:17,670
Right. We haven't computed that yet. So let's see what happened.

432
01:02:18,830 --> 01:02:38,309
The third one is. The company can borrow the money using a variable that requires an interest payment of 4% at the end of the three three years.

433
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:42,050
So let's go for 4% for three years.

434
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:50,890
So we start 4%. Or perhaps.

435
01:02:54,060 --> 01:03:00,990
Or. Three. Hey.

436
01:03:00,990 --> 01:03:09,090
And then I can find. I can do the is equal to loan times.

437
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:19,020
Three years. Okay.

438
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:22,610
So the 36,000 or so after dad. What can happen?

439
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:38,220
He can happen, Dad. At the beginning of the fourth year, the interest rate of the law would change to six, eight or ten.

440
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:50,999
Okay. So and that's going to be the beginning of the fourth year for five and six because the seven is going to change.

441
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:55,680
So for three years. So we're talking about six, eight or ten for three years.

442
01:03:59,790 --> 01:04:13,210
See one more right here. Now we've got 6%.

443
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:36,360
Three years. It.

444
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:45,240
She said it opens a.

445
01:04:49,730 --> 01:04:53,390
They're saying three years.

446
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:07,090
8%. For three years.

447
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:22,780
It seeing eight or ten for three years.

448
01:05:22,780 --> 01:05:26,950
So let me do the computations here. So this is going to be a long.

449
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:37,340
Sometimes. 6% for three years.

450
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:47,030
This is low times.

451
01:05:49,970 --> 01:05:55,240
8%. Three years.

452
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:08,350
And loan lines 10%.

453
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:19,410
Two and three years. Okay.

454
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:24,480
So I have. What probabilities are those?

455
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:33,180
It's out. Well, you know, 5.3, 1.65.

456
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:42,190
So you're the only five.

457
01:06:45,830 --> 01:06:51,890
3.1. 5.3 8.65.

458
01:06:56,370 --> 01:07:04,140
Hey, we've got the probabilities. And then finally, what can happen to these numbers?

459
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:14,430
At the beginning of the seventh year, the interest rate could go a decrease by 1%,

460
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:22,230
with probability point one increase by 1%, with probability 2.2 or increase by 3%.

461
01:07:22,470 --> 01:07:31,650
Probability point said so. Decrease by one, increase by one or increase by two.

462
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:37,170
But the probabilities are point one, .2.7.

463
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:43,860
Right? So let's actually give the opportunity for these branches.

464
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:55,020
So I am going to. Get a chance, though, because there are three possibilities right in.

465
01:07:58,100 --> 01:08:01,520
I know that the probabilities are going to be point one.

466
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:09,660
.3.7. Right. Three.

467
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:17,170
What he said. And then I can.

468
01:08:17,590 --> 01:08:22,120
Then the same thing happens with the second branch of the same thing happens with the third branch.

469
01:08:22,630 --> 01:08:33,700
Well, you know, it's going to be 7.1, 1.7.

470
01:08:36,090 --> 01:08:47,230
To. And then I am going to copy this note, right?

471
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:51,340
And then right click here and then and put up face to subtree.

472
01:08:54,070 --> 01:08:59,470
So I don't have to repeat the probabilities. Right. And then right click here and pieces of three.

473
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:07,440
Wait. How did you copy? Right. How did you.

474
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:17,120
Copy. Oh, yeah. So you go to the first branch, the first note you want to order the subtree that you want to copy,

475
01:09:17,270 --> 01:09:24,739
and then just right click and then copy subtree and then go to the terminal

476
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:29,960
node that was here and then use right click and then you save Facebook tree.

477
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:41,520
Got it. Thanks. And then this one is it's going to be close.

478
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:48,330
One loss is is plus one, minus one plus one and plus two.

479
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:54,120
So this is going to be if it is five, then is.

480
01:09:57,100 --> 01:10:04,830
These are 6%. So it's 5%. Times.

481
01:10:11,270 --> 01:10:18,200
You know, 5% for three years.

482
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:28,600
Right. This one is going to be one more.

483
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:34,780
So seven, 7% or three.

484
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,960
And then this is going to lead to war.

485
01:10:45,980 --> 01:10:51,860
So this 8% war.

486
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:09,940
These. Then I go to the computations.

487
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:15,640
This is the sequel to The Anomaly. Times.

488
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:24,670
I understand. I'm three years.

489
01:11:29,330 --> 01:11:34,100
The long times.

490
01:11:39,820 --> 01:11:43,420
7% in three years.

491
01:11:47,020 --> 01:12:03,230
No. I'm interested to hear that.

492
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:08,430
That's interesting.

493
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:28,420
In 2016, I. In 2017.

494
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,259
And this is what I want to do.

495
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:46,600
And this is what I did it to.

496
01:12:54,500 --> 01:13:00,710
8%. I didn't really like.

497
01:13:06,440 --> 01:13:14,290
So let's go to this one. It's going to be minus one.

498
01:13:14,310 --> 01:13:19,730
So 7% in three years.

499
01:13:27,540 --> 01:13:33,390
She's going to be in two one 9%.

500
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:46,290
For three years. This is going to be one more 10%.

501
01:13:51,400 --> 01:14:13,890
For three. In the computations here, it is equal to two times 7% per year.

502
01:14:16,930 --> 01:14:28,480
Issue is known. 9% in three years.

503
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:37,730
And finally, this is the. Times.

504
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:46,430
This is definitely 10%. I'm 30 years.

505
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:58,129
And finally, this is going to be minus one.

506
01:14:58,130 --> 01:15:20,970
So 9% for three years. This is going to be in 11% for three years.

507
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:37,420
And this is going to be.

508
01:15:49,590 --> 01:16:01,520
For three years. Okay.

509
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:05,840
And then we go into the computation.

510
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:09,679
So this is too long.

511
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:24,020
Nine three. This is going to be lonely.

512
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:39,510
Level three. And this is.

513
01:16:46,670 --> 01:16:54,080
Well. Okay.

514
01:16:54,530 --> 01:16:57,920
And then I think we have to 2950.

515
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:06,140
And so what it is, if I go for a just a little long three,

516
01:17:06,680 --> 01:17:32,360
then I get 215,100 of in in interest and then I pay 211,200 if I go for a very long one and I pay 243,000 if I go for it rate things are very low.

517
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:36,320
And so which one would I take? And that's going to be.

518
01:17:37,270 --> 01:17:45,370
On to this, the first adjustable rate loan that is this 6% for five years.

519
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:51,010
And then you can you can change to seven, nine or 11 for the rest of the time.

520
01:17:51,280 --> 01:17:54,520
We provide eight point 10.25, 1.65.

521
01:17:55,000 --> 01:18:02,170
So you see that entry. They evaluated everything from right to left.

522
01:18:02,170 --> 01:18:14,980
So we were putting that the individual contributions to to the to the interest rate and each step of the of the process.

523
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:23,680
And then for example here the decision tree added 36,000 was 54,000 plus 45,000.

524
01:18:24,010 --> 01:18:27,459
It's 133, 35,000.

525
01:18:27,460 --> 01:18:30,550
And the same thing for this branch of this branch.

526
01:18:30,550 --> 01:18:43,520
And that's why it took it got here 153 135 153 and 162 and 135 19% and one 5310 20%,

527
01:18:43,570 --> 01:18:53,709
162 70% that is 157 500 and then did the same thing with the other two notes and say, okay,

528
01:18:53,710 --> 01:19:17,620
157 193 here and 229 with probabilities 530 65% then that keep me to 15 260,100 and then another way to the other two and said,

529
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:24,850
okay, this is 243, this is 211 200 and this is 215 100.

530
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:30,820
I'm going to be the smallest of the three, which is 211,200.

531
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,410
This is what I'm going to say. That is the optimal is three.

532
01:19:34,420 --> 01:19:40,450
That's what you see. You see. True. So every scene in decision tree,

533
01:19:40,450 --> 01:19:45,489
everything every time you see of this he should note the decision note will give you

534
01:19:45,490 --> 01:19:53,260
the the optimal path by reporting it to through the branch that you should think.

535
01:19:53,770 --> 01:20:05,200
So in this case he's telling you, okay, you should take these adjustable rate loan because on his dictation he will give you 211,200,

536
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:09,880
which is the smallest of the order of the of the options you have.

537
01:20:11,050 --> 01:20:16,660
That's why this is the value of opening the decision tree 211,002.

538
01:20:18,890 --> 01:20:25,830
And if you want to know how it looks like. That's supreme.

539
01:20:31,710 --> 01:20:36,210
So we're going to use decision trees for you know,

540
01:20:36,210 --> 01:20:47,900
not just straightforward computational like these going a be more sophisticated things but evaluating their value whatever or evaluating information.

541
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:54,239
How much would you be should be paying for perfect information like we did that, but what imperfect information,

542
01:20:54,240 --> 01:21:05,100
how much you should be pay for getting information that is perfect and how to evaluate imperfect information.

543
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:20,520
Right. So, you know, how much would you be willing to pay for vaccine development versus $0.93 pending if you have if you have unlimited resources?

544
01:21:21,030 --> 01:21:26,430
So I think it's time to go do something else.

545
01:21:29,060 --> 01:21:36,260
Yeah, I think I will see do it because I do think it's just.

546
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:47,379
Remember you have questions about the exam, but, you know,

547
01:21:47,380 --> 01:22:41,440
you can you can you can keep track of time so that I can show you what I see so central to the first lady that we see this type of what?

548
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:47,290
How was your trip? That's virtual as well. Yes, it was. Or was it, you see.

549
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:56,800
Oh, yes, I think so. Yeah, I think so.

550
01:22:57,580 --> 01:23:17,270
Dangerous. Yeah, yeah. Yes. I think the word is that somebody is probably going to go, oh, yeah.

551
01:23:20,910 --> 01:23:26,860
