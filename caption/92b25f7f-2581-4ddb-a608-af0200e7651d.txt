1
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:13,310
I'm definitely more. I don't know.

2
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,010
Oh, my God.

3
00:00:34,340 --> 00:01:01,970
So I'm hoping that, you know, you recognize that, you know.

4
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:10,430
I think it's. Yeah.

5
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:28,730
Yeah. Well, this is.

6
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:45,290
I think it's things, but. Okay.

7
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:50,960
All right. Come get your snacks if you haven't yet. Help yourself through the hour.

8
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:03,090
Who pays? Anybody. Who? Overpaid.

9
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,960
Well, maybe you could join me there.

10
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:17,380
Oh, I don't have a problem here.

11
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:22,690
All right, let's go through the groups. Where's Group one?

12
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:29,680
Oh, group one is over there. All right, where is group two?

13
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,080
Is group two anywhere? No group cells in the back.

14
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,979
There is group two in the back. Okay, group three.

15
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:48,520
Where are you with two? Group three, if you're working with them.

16
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,080
Whereas group four back there.

17
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,450
Group five down here. Right there.

18
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:01,510
Good, good. Showing. Group five, you could six just.

19
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,649
We have one. Group six. Right. Group six. Group and then group seven.

20
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:15,760
So six and seven are together six, seven and eight. Right? Group nine, nine, ten.

21
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,770
Oh, there's a couple of group ten kind of scattered about. There you are.

22
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,550
Okay, half enough then. Group 11.

23
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,540
All right. What do you all together? Perfect. Very good. Group 12.

24
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,750
Okay, good. 13 and 14.

25
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,980
And 15. Oh, good. There you go.

26
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,870
Okay. I know this is really hard to do in this room. I thought about actually making signs or something.

27
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:48,280
I know you're forming your groups anyway. The point is for you to just be together.

28
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,399
And in this workshop, you know, class, we can, you know, help each other.

29
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,920
So I want you to reach out to your peers. Okay, so we're going to get started.

30
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:02,100
I hope you're all having a good day week. Help yourself to the cider and donuts if you haven't already.

31
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,320
And you'll have time throughout the hour. Yeah.

32
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:14,140
Okay. Okay. All right.

33
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:24,310
So this is what we're doing today. Here's the plan for rearranging.

34
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:37,930
Turn it off. All right, so here's the plan today.

35
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,880
First, we're just going to do a kind of a quick overview of sort of APEC's timeline and assignments,

36
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,800
just to kind of make sure we're all on the same page. Try to answer any general questions.

37
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,650
Some of you actually really heard a lot of this before, but we're just sort of going through it again just to make sure on the same page

38
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:58,330
that we're going to be in your groups and basically kind of workshopping together.

39
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,839
Well, Dominique and I will come around also to try to help answer questions.

40
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,640
So we're hoping that you will together kind of share where you're at, share your experiences,

41
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,569
hopefully just connecting with your peers and then also kind of help each other problem

42
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:14,770
solve because you're all in different places like reviewing the proposal if I mean,

43
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:18,430
we can see I think you can all learn a lot from each other, see where you're each at,

44
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,870
help each other, kind of figure things out for the Apex Commission itself.

45
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,280
And then we'll see how that goes and how much time it takes to do that.

46
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,609
And then we'd like you to just ask for feedback on wherever you're at with the apex process, and I'll give you some more guidance.

47
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:36,960
But that's the plan for today, right? Okay.

48
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:40,150
So we're hoping to get your questions answered and help you feel good.

49
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,780
So first, just a quick reminder of the timeline and where we've been and where we're going just for the fall semester.

50
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,459
We're hoping for most of you that you will be able to submit the apex.

51
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:54,130
The assignment is due December 16th.

52
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:01,780
I suspect there will be some special circumstances and things like that, but in general, we want everyone to turn this in as best you can.

53
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,330
By December 16th, we're working you there.

54
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:11,469
We started with that sort of intermediate product assignment, which was the proposal that was due last I was just a week ago.

55
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:18,879
Right, just last week. So the point of that was to see what your plans are and then let us review your proposal and give you feedback.

56
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,060
And I think we've been able to get through many of them, through all of them.

57
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,790
So I think you're like, okay, yeah, we got through all of them.

58
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:31,600
So I think they're, you know, you can look at comments and things and we try to give you feedback on where you're at.

59
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:34,150
And I'll talk a little more about that in a second.

60
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:40,120
But that was the purpose of that, was to just have you tell us what you're planning to do, where you're at, and let us give you feedback.

61
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:45,729
You know, if we have questions about that, that's okay. That's the whole point of it is that we want to have this back and forth now as

62
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:50,410
opposed to at the end of the semester when you feel stressed and you're like, I don't have time to change anything.

63
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:55,240
So we reviewed the apex two weeks ago.

64
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:00,100
Today we're doing the workshop class. So really it's just, you know, going through together, trying to.

65
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:07,820
Help each other. And then we'll have one more workshop too, in this class where we'll be a little bit closer to the due date for the assignment.

66
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:15,860
I think we'll be more zeroed in on filling out that final worksheet so we can use that as a time to help answer questions as well.

67
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:22,100
So I'm just I'm trying to lay out for you the plan so that you can see where you have sort of structured resources and structured time.

68
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:28,460
And then you can also, you know, you can always reach out to us for questions to questions about the timeline.

69
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:38,839
Okay. All right. So I wanna make sure you know what's coming. All right, so just briefly about the assignment that you all turned in last weekend.

70
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,990
We have now reviewed all. If you've turned something in, we've reviewed it.

71
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,670
So, one, I'd say, I think in general, we were pretty impressed.

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,860
Very right. With the proposal. I mean, I think it was really neat to see all the things you're working on from the proposal.

73
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:59,180
There might be some questions that we had and a lot of times this is just some

74
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,280
clarification for us to understand what you were thinking or how you might talk about it.

75
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,680
And so this is really this was the opportunity for us to try to ask you those questions so that you can

76
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:16,310
try to clarify them as you go forward and so that you are prepared to turn in the final assignment.

77
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:22,280
So there's comments and canvas. We can talk about them today here, too, as we're moving around.

78
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:30,830
You can also respond to us through the through canvas or email to help us understand and make sure things are on the right track.

79
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,790
So we really want to get your questions answered today and review everything.

80
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:39,259
So you probably are you can zero looking in there take a look in in canvas just to

81
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:43,310
see if you have any if you got any feedback and if there's any questions you have.

82
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:51,649
Okay. So that was that assignment. What I notice on this is you guys can help me know if I missed any,

83
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:58,010
but what seem to be the trends or things that came out of the questions we still like a lot of you from that proposal assignment were like,

84
00:08:58,010 --> 00:09:02,450
okay, does this count? That was the whole purpose of that assignment. So hopefully we help answer that.

85
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,060
Like I said, we did need some clarifications for a few.

86
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:10,520
There were things that some of you asked about, like writing resources or tips with, working with practice partners,

87
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:16,760
looking at previous practice products, which will show you thinking about the competencies selection,

88
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,509
which we'll talk a little bit about today, but also focus on even more detail at that next workshop class you had some of you had

89
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:28,370
questions about what to do if a product had intellectual property or confidential information.

90
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:35,120
We tried to give some suggestions for that and then and I'll try to answer some of these, I guess, in a minute here, too.

91
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:41,719
But other questions are what am I product design to use by the practice partner in reality like that like it was intended to be maybe,

92
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,950
but doesn't actually end up in circulation or out there as you thought it would.

93
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,510
Timeline of submission and how to submit the products.

94
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:55,040
I think before I go on, I'll try to answer a couple with some of these maybe resources that I'm hoping you can all share with each other.

95
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:02,239
Like if you have know, what are some writing resources or tips that you found or one of your experiences been working with practice partners?

96
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,969
What's gone well, what hasn't gone well? There's trends.

97
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,770
I tend to hear about one when I hear about students experiences working with outside partners.

98
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:17,570
One thing I want to point out is the two bullets, they're about handling the intellectual property and or confidential.

99
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:25,549
You know, you might have, like some of you did, did internships with like industry and like whatever you work on,

100
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,510
you're not a lot like you can't put it out there yet. It's not approved for public consumption.

101
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,760
So yeah. And same thing to confidential stuff like maybe you have personal health

102
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,780
information or something that was intended for an internal audience and is not,

103
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,320
you know, should be it shouldn't be sent out to me or Dominic or the class.

104
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:49,220
So really, I think two options were flexible. I think it kind of whatever makes the most sense in your situation.

105
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:52,700
One is you end up is writing a description of what you actually did.

106
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:58,069
So it's not the actual product, but it's a, you know, so we can get an understanding of what you did.

107
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,660
But it's a written description, so maybe a paragraph or so in describing what you did.

108
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:08,629
And we worked with that with some students in the past. Another option, depending on how easy this is for you,

109
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:14,660
is to just delete that part so that we know this is an edited version and not the actual the actual product.

110
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:19,700
That's kind of how we worked it in the past so we can be flexible and whatever makes sense for your situation.

111
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,280
The other one I wanted to mention was What if my product doesn't get used by the practice partner?

112
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:34,820
That's okay. I think, you know, a lot of times what we the idea that it was created with the intention to assist a practice partner in some way,

113
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:39,560
so maybe they took it and whatever, it didn't work into their plans at that moment.

114
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,129
Maybe they modified it further. That's okay.

115
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:51,260
The intention of this is that you created something that was meeting a need for them, even if it's not the very final product that is that is.

116
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:55,339
Okay, okay. Does that make sense? And it happens a lot.

117
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:59,059
We see that like I made this infographic, but then they ended up doing this and that and the other.

118
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:02,210
And at that point, you know, you can only control so much, right?

119
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,310
You're kind of meeting the intention. So that's fine. Okay.

120
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:15,920
Any other we'll come around and answer all your detailed questions, but just any questions or comments first, I'll get into the submission part next.

121
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:25,100
When you add anything down. I think that the one about if it was going to be huge this week.

122
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,929
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. That one. Would it get used by a practice partner.

123
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,040
It came up a couple of times.

124
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:38,740
So I think as long as you can say like you created this with a practice partner, it was meeting some kind of need or some in some shape or form.

125
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,360
I think that's okay. Okay. So how to submit? Well, that's like the final assignment.

126
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,220
So as a review and I've showed you these slides before, but I'm just going to bring them here again to kind of remind you,

127
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:55,959
that's the final assignment, the Apex practice product submission due December 16th in canvas.

128
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:00,370
That's how you're meeting the apex requirement for graduation and everything through that assignment.

129
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:08,379
The due date is December 16th and again, it's just uploading the that worksheet that I'll show you and the products or some

130
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:12,640
version of your products that they're like top secret or something like that. Okay.

131
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,890
So you've seen this.

132
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:22,120
If you go to the canvas page on the worksheet that you download, this is sort of the part that you'll be filling out and you're asked.

133
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,679
It's a little bit different than the one you filled out for the proposal. It's based on the competencies.

134
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,460
So you list the five competencies, the practice partner.

135
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:38,649
Again, because we're interested to know this, if it was associated with your internship or not, there's no does it matter if it was or wasn't?

136
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,200
It's more data gathering for us.

137
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:48,760
The big part and the part I think you'll be focused on for this and we will workshop at the next class you can start talking about now if you wanted.

138
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:56,860
Is the activities, the individual actions that you did to show how you met that competency, what did you actually do?

139
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:00,399
How would you describe that in your own words? What if it was a group project?

140
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,450
What were your activities that you did? So that's where you'll have a little more detail.

141
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,770
And then the practice product itself, you'll have some reflection as well.

142
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:14,290
Okay. So. I'll show you an example in a second.

143
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:18,040
But just as a reminder, there's the rubric. It's basically it's pretty straightforward.

144
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,900
Is it did you have these requirements and did you answer the questions?

145
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,780
That's the rubric.

146
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:31,180
It's more about, I think where it gets probably the part I think we'll all be focused on is like the application of activities and the competencies.

147
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,870
Again, how are you showing that what you did is with that competency?

148
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:38,320
A lot of it is how you talk about it. Like I said, we're here.

149
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,820
We want it like we're open, we want you. It's more just hearing you be able to talk about it.

150
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:52,750
So, okay, you've seen these, but I'm actually open to class, but you have access to these on the canvas page and through these slides.

151
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:59,170
So first is an example and can you see it okay.

152
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:04,870
Big enough? So as a reminder, here's one example.

153
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:09,570
So this will be what you're working towards is how you fill this out.

154
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:13,170
So in this example, we have five competencies. They're each listed separately.

155
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:19,590
So this one was three for 21 and G five and 18.

156
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:27,360
So there are four foundational and one in my training is the concentration, competency in this person's assignment.

157
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:37,889
And they, you know, as you know, you can match up like it doesn't matter to us how many competences match with which product.

158
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:42,330
So you could have one product that has four competences matched by one has one.

159
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,980
So there's any number of matches that it just depends on what you did.

160
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,969
So whatever makes sense for you. So then we're looking, you know, we'll look through.

161
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:54,780
Okay, we're there five different competencies. Who are the practice partners?

162
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,800
That's where we have a lot of questions sometimes is okay, tell me more. Was this a practice partner?

163
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:04,040
And then when we start to question that a bit further, we're like, okay, if it's a little bit nebulous, well,

164
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:09,030
how is this being used to help us understand how this is meeting the need and sometimes it's just how you talk about it.

165
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:13,020
We'll help you. And then the actions part.

166
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:19,080
Like, what did you actually do? And I suspect you can look at these examples a little bit further as you start filling this out yourself.

167
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:26,639
But here, for example, this person says in order to the actions they did to show how the surveillance system

168
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:32,640
evaluates report linked with competency number for interpreting results of data analysis,

169
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,859
they said they created a summary of important findings from the data analysis.

170
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,249
They categorize the findings, they prioritize action items.

171
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,250
So what are the things that you did?

172
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:50,520
It doesn't have to be every single step, but I think just giving us a summary, something that makes sense, something that that you can kind of.

173
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,910
So what did you actually do to create this?

174
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:58,020
Sometimes many people are working on one product and you might have done a lot of different things.

175
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:03,390
Okay. So that's what that's what we want it to look like in the end.

176
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:10,720
And I guess I will spend more time on this. Our next workshop is meant to help really think through the activities.

177
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,929
So I think that's where a lot of you are also focused on is like,

178
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:20,440
how can I make sure that my competencies match up with a product and that will be okay.

179
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:26,260
So to me, to see that link gets through those actions, which you have a lot of range and how you describe that.

180
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,650
Okay. Okay. I think that's all I want.

181
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,130
And then there's the reflection there so you can see how that was answered.

182
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,240
You can to do a better job, I hope. I wrote some of this that you can do a better job than I did.

183
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,650
So. Okay. I was inspired by someone else, but I kind of did that.

184
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,569
All right. Oh, yeah. And then the example of practice products.

185
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:55,649
So here are some these are examples we've kind of been using for a while now from some of our previous students.

186
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:01,460
But you can take a peek at these. They're also in the canvas page, you know, but there's a lot of things like.

187
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:08,790
You know, infographics, graphics, brochures that people made a lesson plan.

188
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,150
Qualtrics survey. So it's a lot of different things.

189
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:23,340
An interview guy that was used. So honestly, a lot of different things can work as an apex.

190
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,560
Again, it's just how you're linking it to how it was used. So take a closer look at those.

191
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,230
But those are. Going to make sure he knows what they're. Okay.

192
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:38,290
So we are we're going to move into the group portion now. You're all sitting somehow in your groups, you've all got your treats.

193
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:44,199
You can come and get more if you need them. But I want you and I'll give you a chance to ask questions to the large group.

194
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:49,479
But just so you see what's coming, that's what we want. We want you to think about together right now,

195
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:54,790
just within your group or your sort of group that you have or whoever sitting around you right now at this point,

196
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,720
just provide an update, you know, share with each other where you're at.

197
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:04,600
I know from reviewing your proposals that some of you are all set to submit some of your still trying to figure out your practice partners,

198
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,250
so help each other if you know, what is it that you're worried about and talk about it together.

199
00:19:09,670 --> 00:19:16,360
So I want you all to kind of give an update to your team members, where are you at and then ask for some kind of input.

200
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,050
Share, you know, share something you're worried about. Share what you think your next step is.

201
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:28,000
Share if you're still trying to find a practice partner or, you know, if you or many of you ask a lot of questions about like, can you tell me more?

202
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,680
That's really how is this a practice product? I think that was a common question out there for many of you.

203
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:36,070
Maybe talk about that together and then we'll come around and help you with that too.

204
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,659
There's the Google doc.

205
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:46,180
It's in your canvas page and on here that's just informally to help keep track of things and also to help your colleagues who aren't here right now.

206
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,570
Kind of see some of the stuff that you thought about after class.

207
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,649
Questions. So we're going to start with that.

208
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,790
And the next you'll be maybe zeroing in on this specific product.

209
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:03,110
Okay. I want to come around and answer questions. Okay.

210
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:19,640
Go for it. Why don't you go inside our.

211
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:03,090
It seems like you're having a discussion and I have a feeling you're just kind of naturally flowing in your discussion.

212
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:11,160
But if you need something else to talk about, the next thing could be actually getting feedback about a product you're working on.

213
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:18,419
I have a feeling you might already be doing this, so you might just continue your conversations, but you could really dig in to one product.

214
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:25,680
If you want to talk about how is going with that practice partner, maybe look at the product itself or start thinking about competency selection.

215
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:30,240
And I will give you a little more time for discussion and then we'll wrap up.

216
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:44,220
Okay. Thank you. Yeah, I.

217
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:05,320
I think that.

218
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:32,950
Yeah. Do you know?

219
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:43,720
Right, right, right.

220
00:41:44,650 --> 00:41:57,050
Yeah. Yes, but.

221
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:07,130
Oh, yeah.

222
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:39,060
You have a liability for asking are the ones that are experiencing, oh, well, it's going to be like this.

223
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:49,830
I want to was.

224
00:42:52,770 --> 00:43:14,690
What thought that was like having a direct companies I like to do.

225
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:41,350
Yes. I got to be. Things are.

226
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:55,960
Well, you asked me if I ever had skills.

227
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,950
No, no, no. I'm not going to.

228
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:15,680
Call me, but they're telling me I to.

229
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:30,250
Yeah. I have a. Right.

230
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:43,020
Said. That's.

231
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:06,150
I. So.

232
00:45:09,620 --> 00:45:25,890
Sometimes. Yeah.

233
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:42,580
I. It's kind of like.

234
00:45:44,300 --> 00:46:17,340
Thank you. I want to let you down. On the first day of learning.

235
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:57,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

236
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:10,920
Yeah. Yeah.

237
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:25,420
Okay. Okay.

238
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:32,530
I'm appreciating all the really nice conversation that everyone's having and all the questions and you know, everyone's in different phases.

239
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,990
But I can see that you're helping each other and thinking through stuff.

240
00:47:36,010 --> 00:47:42,160
So thank you for the questions and everything. One question that I did here, I wanted to make sure and I forget one thing.

241
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:47,440
I think I skipped this. I guess this was a comment I meant to say and forgot to say earlier.

242
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:51,520
A lot of you were asking about like, when can I turn it in and when will I get feedback?

243
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:56,050
So the assignment is open. You can technically submit your apex at any time.

244
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:04,090
We've been trying to kind of step you through it so you feel prepared. I have a suggestion that you could consider starting the final look.

245
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:09,700
If you're ready. If you're the person who's ready to submit, go into the assignment, start filling out the worksheet.

246
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:17,590
Maybe come, you know, come to our November 15th class where we're going to focus in on that worksheet and the activities and competencies.

247
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:18,699
Check it out with your peers.

248
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:23,950
Have someone else read it, make sure it makes sense, because that's kind of how Dominique and I will be reviewing that, too.

249
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:27,610
And then if you feel good after that for a minute, you don't have to wait for that.

250
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:29,079
You could just go ahead and submit it if you want.

251
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:34,900
But if that's helpful to you and it might be helpful to me if like all your questions are getting answered in that class and then we don't,

252
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,540
you know, that might be the most systematic way to do it,

253
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:44,680
but it is open your you can submit it at any time and then we'll start looking at it on a rolling basis so that you,

254
00:48:44,680 --> 00:48:47,710
you know, if it's complete, you know, in November, great, you're done.

255
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,610
Move on and think about your IOU and other stuff. So that's the timeline.

256
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,940
I think we did our we tried to answer a lot of questions,

257
00:48:54,940 --> 00:49:00,460
but are there any burning questions or feelings or comments about Apex that you want to ask us?

258
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:06,990
Okay. Did you get some questions answered today? Was this at least somewhat helpful?

259
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:10,280
A little bit. Okay. Some of you. Okay.

260
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:14,209
I hope so. All right. So just what's coming up next?

261
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:18,070
So next week, we'll be doing one of the classes where we're exploring different careers.

262
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,649
We have Vivian KURTZ joining us. She works at Michigan Medicine.

263
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:25,730
She's an epidemiologist. She graduated, I wanna say, about ten years ago.

264
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:30,770
So she's going to come here in person and she's going to just tell us about her career journey.

265
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:34,940
She's worked at Henry Ford Hospital. I actually crossed paths with her way back at Henry Ford.

266
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:39,979
Then she moved to Michigan Medicine. She's change her job a couple of times, so she'll just kind of share her career.

267
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:44,209
And then we'll encourage you to ask questions and kind of find out like, what was the job process like?

268
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:49,880
What is it like being an epidemiologist in health system? And I want to put this reminder out.

269
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:55,130
You probably saw this email, but our alumni group was asking us to kind of promote this out.

270
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:59,420
So if you if you got this email and like deleted it or didn't look at it, I'm just.
