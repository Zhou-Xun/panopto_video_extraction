1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:08,520
Any announcements today. All right.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:22,000
Where we are from the announcement. So I had a feeling you want to start off with the announcement.

3
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,590
So your journals are over here? I think I'll take them up.

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,610
I'll bring them again on Thursday. For those folks who are here today before the journals.

5
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:35,410
They look pretty good. A couple of notes that I have is for a couple of them.

6
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,490
I couldn't find your name on the journal, so just make sure it's very clear.

7
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:46,839
Like whose journal for the next edition, because this submission wasn't great and I'm going to actually assign a grade at the end of the semester.

8
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,710
We just want it to, like, get a feel and like check your progress. So just make sure your name is clearly written.

9
00:00:52,990 --> 00:01:00,280
And then also I know we use our computers for like everything, but try to write a little feeder for you.

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:08,919
It was hard to read a few of them. I was nervous, but I did want to mention that I'm not going to take off point for that or anything,

11
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,829
but I wanted to just share that reminder and yeah, that's about it.

12
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:21,580
So and then also since we talked about how we extend the deadline for the last that mission that we're supposed to get journal for today.

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,159
We talked a few weeks ago about how basically at the end of the semester you'll have 19 entries instead of 20.

14
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,770
So if you're if you are short in your journal, I didn't you know, I'm not judging that or anything like that.

15
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,880
So like there were a couple people who didn't have all ten. That's totally fine.

16
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:40,690
Just make sure you're caught up by the 19 by the end of the semester. Yeah.

17
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:47,169
I went into canvas and redid all the numbers for the journal entries, so yeah.

18
00:01:47,170 --> 00:01:52,930
So that's probably also for the upcoming assignment.

19
00:01:54,370 --> 00:02:00,820
So there are a couple of questions that folks had. One was about the page length.

20
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:07,120
So we didn't really put a page length, but we did give you like approximate number of bullets under different sections.

21
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:15,370
Part of why I typically don't do that with this assignment is that people will say things differently sometimes,

22
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:21,550
you know, you like incense and things like that. So it's hard to say exactly this many pages.

23
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:26,920
So follow the bullets. This is just a number of bullets more than anything else.

24
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:33,610
If you're like just dying, you have to have a page limit or you like pass out.

25
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:39,250
We were talking, we'd say 4 to 6 is the range.

26
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,950
But again, you can have a totally stupendous assignment.

27
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,820
That's three and a half pages are really [INAUDIBLE] one that's six pages.

28
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:55,870
So it's more about the content than how many pages I am.

29
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:01,180
Also, some people were confused about the difference between like the description and the rationale.

30
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,170
So in the description part you basically just describing.

31
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:10,960
So you're telling us, you know what it is that you're going to do the rationales why you did it.

32
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:18,640
So again, with this assignment, like a lot of what we do in here and especially your final assignment, there's no right or wrong answer.

33
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:29,440
So it's all about your creative use of what you learned in the class about power, oppression,

34
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:37,210
criticality, intersectionality, all those things, and how you apply it to real world situations.

35
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,980
So let's say that you you decide to have let's say you're working with older

36
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,680
adults and you're trying to do something to increase their physical activity.

37
00:03:52,240 --> 00:04:04,719
One thing you might say is you're going to hold this maybe silver sneaker walking about that's actually already a name that Medicare covers.

38
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,770
So I didn't just make that snazzy name up on the fly.

39
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,990
But let's say you're adopting the silver sneaker and you're going to while you walk,

40
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:22,630
you're also going to be talking about things like connectedness and loneliness and deal with like mental health and physical health.

41
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:30,250
And let's say you're going to do that once a week for a month.

42
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,230
The rationale behind that could be I mean, there's so many different reasons you can talk about that.

43
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,650
One is that you could talk about it in terms of by what you know,

44
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:50,470
I'm combining mental health and walking because that something that would really accomplish two goals with one activity,

45
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:55,690
you can say we're doing it weekly because you're working maybe in a senior center and

46
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:01,720
they have a boss that comes from senior living communities to the center once a week.

47
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,530
So you're going to combine it with, you know, when the bus comes.

48
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:12,879
So think about things like, you know, accessibility and accessibility isn't just physical accessibility.

49
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,450
Can I get. There, but one time there.

50
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:25,740
Do I have the assistance I might need in terms of mobility, or do I have hopefully appropriate interventions, things like that?

51
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:28,020
So that's what we're looking for really to see.

52
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:38,610
Have you really thought through your population, your health issue and really gone into detail about what you did?

53
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,849
So, you know, and other times you might be like, Oh,

54
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:54,000
we're going to develop a healthy eating program for families that's going to cover the FDA approved regulations for food intake.

55
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,830
And that's it. That doesn't really tell us much about how you're going to do it,

56
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:07,440
why you're going to maybe choose certain things given the cultural background of the population and think about all the different aspects.

57
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:13,620
One thing I always tell people when when we're developing interventions is I want you to think like

58
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:21,000
you're a participant and think about what it would be like to participate in your intervention.

59
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:26,750
Now, these are more advanced grant pathways to teach grant interventions.

60
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:34,469
I would actually make people go to the sites where they're working, and if their participants take the bus,

61
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:41,220
they have to take the bus because the participants have to ride in a van for people with mobility issues, they have to ride in the van.

62
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:49,650
So I want people to experience what it's like because there's so many programs out there that really don't think about social determinants of health.

63
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,520
They don't really don't think about what it's like, you know?

64
00:06:52,530 --> 00:07:02,190
So if you were living in that particular neighborhood and most of the people in that community speak a particular language,

65
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:12,120
your program needs to use that language in order to capture people in their own environment and to be able to address them.

66
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,990
That all make sense. So again, we really were pushing you to go to the next level,

67
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:28,620
not just eat healthy food or walk or have social support, but thinking about your particular population.

68
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,970
What's going to make people actually engage in an intervention?

69
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:40,030
And the beauty of it is that we're going to have two people that have like bipolar opposite interventions.

70
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:46,570
But if you give a good rationale, then that's great because a lot of what we do in public health isn't regimented.

71
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:52,810
It isn't like, okay, I'm going to go to community and we're going to do diabetes prevention work.

72
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,700
And so here's the protocol that I follow. What would be wrong with that?

73
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:06,180
You should know this by that point. What would be wrong if we just had, like a standard CDC approved protocol for.

74
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,680
This is how I always do diabetes prevention. What's wrong with that?

75
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,750
Yeah. Working with different populations that are different needs. Exactly.

76
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,969
Exactly. Anything else wrong with it? Should we just, like, go to.

77
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,590
Like. I'll help Emanuel and which some people want to.

78
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,120
Yes, it lacks cultural humility. Bingo. Exactly.

79
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:30,090
So. And what does that mean? I'm going to push. It's a lifelong process.

80
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:36,510
It's always learning from the community. The community knows more than the individual that's coming into it.

81
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:46,740
Right. So we have like a standard curriculum for diabetes prevention that might work with one population but might do nothing at all with another.

82
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,180
And actually, I haven't categorized my word this semester yet.

83
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:57,860
Does anyone know what Adaptogenic effects are? You do.

84
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:02,360
So perhaps not the pressure on you or anything.

85
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,550
I think it's basically like typically negative things that results from getting medical treatment.

86
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:13,190
Like an example would be like if you contract a staph infection while you're in a hospital getting treated for a broken leg.

87
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:16,910
You know, I took a class about it's called childbirth culture.

88
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:20,180
We talked about it. Oh, cool. You're absolutely right.

89
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:24,690
But that's the medical side. We're public health, so.

90
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:34,100
But very similar. So an androgenic effect is a potential negative effect based on your public health intervention.

91
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:43,219
Right. So a classic example that when I when I was a post-doc in California,

92
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:49,640
San Francisco worked with a woman who early in the HIV epidemic had developed an

93
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:57,980
intervention for immigrant and Spanish speaking women around HIV prevention.

94
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:05,960
And what they did is they were not very culturally humble, but they did not really consultant involve the community.

95
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:14,390
And they were telling these women to go home and be assertive about condom use with their male partners.

96
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,070
This was not culturally appropriate at all.

97
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:29,210
And so what happened is that the rates of intimate partner violence skyrocketed because these women were going home and all empowered with,

98
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:39,500
you know, all these things. I'm going to do this, I believe this, and I'm going to use this very western, white, heteronormative, cisgender,

99
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:49,400
kind of more upperclass language about, you know, this is how I feel about this and, you know, which and some places my work.

100
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,540
But it did not work for well.

101
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:57,770
And so there was they had to actually terminate the program because all these women were coming back with reports of IPV.

102
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:08,510
So that's an example of how people who may be goodwill and good meaning can actually do negative things now make sense.

103
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:15,739
Yeah. So that's a problem is if we if we don't tailor our programs, which cure will be talked about?

104
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:20,630
You have a couple of biases. We can actually do a lot more harm.

105
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:25,580
So that's why we want to see your rationale, your thinking,

106
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:33,110
so that we can really hear and no one understands how you're thinking about all the different parts of what you do.

107
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:38,600
That was a really long and that's a really short question. Any other questions about the assignment?

108
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:49,170
Hey, it's a little chatty today. All right, so last class, what were we talking about at the end?

109
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,120
Remember some of the other stars like right now? Like a little scribble note or something?

110
00:11:54,510 --> 00:12:05,790
We were dealing with some kind of framework. You want to remember to go back to the date, then to come on your.

111
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:10,690
Of. Rob Long.

112
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:14,960
Now, let's say you go see I'm do it. All right.

113
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:19,330
This is the inside, right? So this.

114
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:33,100
Right. So we were talking about this health problem analysis and then we talked a little bit about with this example,

115
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:40,149
thinking about the different types of interventions that can occur and again, showing the complexity.

116
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,920
And part of why I love working in public health is there's no one way to do it.

117
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,270
There's no right answer.

118
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:55,450
So when we're thinking about interventions we could target here, about accessibility to alcohol and that could impact HIV infection,

119
00:12:55,870 --> 00:13:00,490
we could talk about substance use before sex that could impact and things like that.

120
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:10,780
Now, one thing to keep in mind when you you go lower on the totem pole, say that that's terrible when you go lower on the pyramid.

121
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:20,559
And I think someone brought this up, Camille, you brought up right about what you asked about something about can you intervene in your intervention?

122
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:28,690
Can your intervention be at the pyramid? And you're like, okay, for my tracking, everything is the same.

123
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:36,160
But for these interventions, these are going to have broader effects, right?

124
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:44,740
So if we're doing an intervention and we're trying to change media images glamorizing alcohol and sex,

125
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,450
that's going to impact HIV, but it's also going to impact substance use.

126
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:59,080
It's probably going to impact intimate partner violence, given the way that it's often portrayed, is probably going to impact the pregnancy.

127
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,220
As we get closer to the specific health issue, we have a more narrow effect.

128
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:09,670
So that's something you want to think about, too, in developing your intervention.

129
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:17,140
You want to have a broader effect or do you want to have a more specific effect?

130
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:30,960
Do you remember this now? Not coming back. I know one weekend probably had all kinds of wild parties and did lots of homework and all that stuff.

131
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,499
So now what we're going to do is we're going to do a group activity.

132
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,440
I know it's not Thursday, but we're going to break into the group from the last year.

133
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:50,610
I sort of want you to turn all that up and then we're going to do an interactive activity where you work together in your group.

134
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:55,560
So with that, I turn it over to you to get people in their groups.

135
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:18,920
And when you're ready to start from the beginning, I start thinking, oh, lots of ground over from the green room for the front row.

136
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:27,170
All right. Right in there. You remember when you couldn't even remember all the drawing right by a broom?

137
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,550
I understand. And if you forget your name, just turn your nameplate around.

138
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:37,980
And in my opinion, the only thing to do.

139
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:43,610
So you're so big. What is it like to think you're recognized?

140
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:53,720
Now we try to make it as easy as possible for you. Yeah, yeah, I know I can.

141
00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:02,320
A lot of people understand that this. We're going to be in your house.

142
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:18,010
Like, I just remember it, and I don't really know how to make that really.

143
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:30,220
You write down the knowledge that is the hammer that is inside.

144
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:41,670
And, you know, these things make noise. Yeah. So you set it up a little.

145
00:16:42,350 --> 00:17:12,900
Actually, I learned what it's like to see nothing in action where I don't know exactly what's different, because I think it's just the two of you.

146
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:25,070
Is that normal? This is actually a two part activity.

147
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:32,300
So as a group decide what's in these two health issues you want to work with.

148
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:39,050
One health issue is alcohol use disorder and severe alcohol use disorder.

149
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:44,840
That's the DSM diagnosis among young adults ages 18 to 25 in Michigan.

150
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:56,450
If you want to give further detail to it, like a specific ethnic racial group, a part of Michigan, the U.P. or Southeast Michigan, you can do that.

151
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:04,250
The other one is type two diabetes among Mexican-American adults, ages 35 to 55 and Michigan.

152
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,360
And again, you can further you could make it gender specific.

153
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:11,060
You can make it more geographic.

154
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:21,650
And what you need to do is find out have one person be your scribe, because then the next part of the activity, you'll need this.

155
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:29,389
What what are the determinants or risk factors here? I'm just giving you one, you know, one chain.

156
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:31,790
But typically when you do it, it looks like this.

157
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:41,600
Are this so you can have museums at least start with two different risk factors and then they branch off from there.

158
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,650
And actually you can do one or two risk factors.

159
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,850
All you have that that choice,

160
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:58,220
that autonomy and then from that come up with what are some of the direct contributing factors to that risk factor determinant?

161
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,230
And then for that direct contributing factor, one or two interacts.

162
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:12,320
All right, now make sense. Let's just have you do pick one of the two issues and only do one refactor to make it more manageable,

163
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:17,750
because then we're going to think the next step and start developing interventions which will hopefully help before your time.

164
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:30,310
And once you are, you must set up your own by yourself now and then.

165
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:34,610
I guess this time I just have any questions.

166
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:41,780
First one again, like you and I can come by your notes if you don't know what some of the risk factors are doing,

167
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:55,940
the first that you're doing on your phone or tablet or something, I remember I don't know what happened.

168
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:01,870
I feel like. So I think it's all about the mission.

169
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:10,800
Everything there, just about what media cameras and keeping us that we could see it right now.

170
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:47,990
So just so I be the college is going to be this is sort of like the first of all, let me say to you so I'm sorry, but I can easily go.

171
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:54,850
But I feel like. Yes, and I take it you to like you start off.

172
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:59,580
I guess you got it.

173
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:10,190
Yeah. I want to spend the entire school like this.

174
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:25,219
Like I'd be hard to find out which is a better environment, because I think we're all gonna be okay.

175
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,870
I know you feel like.

176
00:21:28,550 --> 00:22:07,080
You feel like you just tell me where I'll get my money directly now, because your family could be the reason I don't do that right now.

177
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:10,730
That's not like I just. I don't know.

178
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:27,650
I like the way where it was like, yeah, I think this something that's going to make me like that.

179
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:37,600
Everyone thinks that's like the material for especially women because you know

180
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:54,120
it's a for us in my not even talking right now are you saying it's also.

181
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:01,280
I guess so.

182
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:08,899
But I think that would be I don't want to work for it.

183
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:31,200
And I know that maybe maybe I was still trying to think about other direct like mental health issues, obviously to tell.

184
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:39,450
I could be kind of like that.

185
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,920
Like what I thought was funny.

186
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:51,070
I don't think I'm going to do something like this.

187
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:58,460
So something like that.

188
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:06,460
What's the answer?

189
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:16,100
Yeah, yeah, I start. So I was like, I see what you're saying.

190
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:31,820
Like, like like I'm like, oh, Josh, trust is the direct like this is using happening.

191
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:43,230
Yeah. We used to regulate high quality.

192
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:52,730
You are starting to get that right.

193
00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:03,770
You know, I'll be right there.

194
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:09,570
You know, it's good.

195
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:20,450
Yeah. Questions are going on.

196
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:31,760
It's like. Like I feel like ours are more applied to like they we change the demographic.

197
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:43,490
Like I've done this like stress grant.

198
00:25:45,550 --> 00:26:01,610
I didn't get trauma. I don't like to be a 25 year old, but I mean, it can be very inexpensive, like working.

199
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:05,550
I work at a bar. Help with that. Really like that.

200
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:13,410
I'm not taking anything but just sitting on.

201
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:28,740
You know who likes interviews to like more?

202
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:57,960
Yeah, that's how I would frame it. I'm sorry that we have to talk about the way I would reframe that one of probably 25 years when it was so funny.

203
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:13,270
I don't really know why I was around in an environment where like you've got to be where like the recession would be around 14.

204
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:20,100
And so I'm hearing you say that exactly.

205
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:34,890
So it depends on how, you know, you have seen it.

206
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,840
You know, the respect you must endure.

207
00:27:41,280 --> 00:28:05,760
I like to lose my job, but sometimes whatever comes out, there should always be some sort of directly risk factor.

208
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:14,649
I know. So it has to be after that.

209
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:22,850
What's that mean? It's like, oh, my God.

210
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,510
Yes. Yeah.

211
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:38,950
I mean, that mask works very specific, so I got nothing to about.

212
00:28:40,770 --> 00:29:02,400
So I was like, we put that down because that's like, you know, I mean, whatever I have to say.

213
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:08,550
Yeah. Yeah. And like, like, if you were right.

214
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:18,989
You know what it means to you.

215
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:37,440
And I was like, I don't feel like this is a character that somebody would like to make that diagnosis.

216
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:54,800
So the fact that I can see that inbox issues of behavior because it's hard to understand when they actually want you with all these,

217
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:07,890
you know, not to be the next one is actually.

218
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:22,150
So I was like, like here, man, I was afraid I can't be that you're not close for 10 minutes.

219
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:39,360
But I noticed how happy I was that that kind of thing was happening.

220
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:50,040
But they're not. You're like looking at something like I think there's like so many things.

221
00:30:50,280 --> 00:31:14,160
I look at things around almost like, sure, like just like technically right now and obviously that stuff.

222
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,870
Right. I think that's fine.

223
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:34,510
Having said that, I don't think I want to say your words real quick.

224
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:44,020
Just a you don't. So this is a lot harder when you actually do it for real, right.

225
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,420
Than maybe you watch enough to do it.

226
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:51,970
But couple of things to think about, because I've talked to some of the groups and they came up with really good ideas.

227
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:59,020
So a lot of these ideas are not mine. I will give it to your classmates in your learning community.

228
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:09,180
So keep in mind that the risk factor, the determinant is a direct cause for the health issue.

229
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:13,240
So there is alcohol. You want to think about what directly causes it.

230
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,360
It's like one thing with alcohol use we know is genetics.

231
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:24,310
If you have genetics, though, you stop there because you can't really change someone's genetics.

232
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,940
Another is poor coping ability.

233
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:36,640
So if you don't know how to engage in healthy and adaptive coping and maladaptive coping, maybe substance abuse.

234
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:44,290
So with one of the group guys talking to over here, they're thinking about the determinant as this is more individual level.

235
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:53,470
Right. And the things as you're closer to the to the top of this, they're going to be more specific, more direct.

236
00:32:54,310 --> 00:33:03,820
And one thing that I often do and work with community groups is say, okay, well, when we're at the risk factor, let's say maladaptive coping.

237
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:11,470
Why do people have maladaptive coping? Then the direct contributing factors lead to the maladaptive coping.

238
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:27,160
Right. And so if one of the risk factors, some maladaptive coping might be an environment could be high levels of stress.

239
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,810
All right. So it's like what causes that? What causes that? So that's something to think about.

240
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,310
Now, one thing, if you if you chose this one, you chose the harder one,

241
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:46,090
because mental health and substance use disorders are much more difficult because there's so much we don't know.

242
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,690
And it's not easy over here. It's a lot easier.

243
00:33:50,710 --> 00:33:56,770
So if we're talking about type two diabetes. We know that food is a direct contributing factor.

244
00:33:56,950 --> 00:34:02,769
We know diet is a direct contributing factor. We know exercise is a direct contributing factor.

245
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:08,350
So this one's much easier because we say, okay, well then why aren't people exercising?

246
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:14,890
It might be things like no access to facilities or not safe environments, things like that.

247
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:22,600
So if you chose this one and you're struggling a little bit, that's a good thing because it's a lot harder.

248
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:27,759
And I did this on purpose to have one bit more mental health and substance use and the other one,

249
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,600
a traditional public health issue, which is diabetes.

250
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:35,680
There's been a ton of kind of research. Is that helpful?

251
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:42,459
Because I know these things are hard when you actually have to sit down and figure it out and sometimes easier when people are showing you're like,

252
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,750
Oh, that makes sense. That makes sense.

253
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:50,710
But then when you have to actually think through it and think about your population, I think they get more complex questions on that.

254
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:56,140
How much more time do people need? Are groups done?

255
00:34:57,670 --> 00:35:01,060
All right. I see some head shaking. Yes. All right.

256
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:07,510
I'm just assumed because no one's saying no, we're not done. Oh, you're not done.

257
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:15,969
Yeah, I talk to them for a while. Okay. It's all in heels. Okay, we're going to go to the next stage, which you'll still be able to do without that.

258
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:18,940
So what? Sorry. Now, I want you.

259
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:26,770
I want you to do is to create one or two intervention components or activities to increase or decrease the determinant of risk factor,

260
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,760
one of the direct contributing factors and one of the indirect.

261
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:38,199
So as we talk about last time, typically in public health are either trying to increase something or decrease it.

262
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:42,690
So we're talking about maladaptive coping or poor coping. What do we want to do with that?

263
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,680
Do we want to increase that or decrease that risk?

264
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:54,339
How is it really easy? What increases or decreases if we increase it?

265
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:58,170
That would be called a one. I.

266
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:03,140
In fact, I was waiting for you in the back. I was.

267
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:13,250
So you want to think about for each item that you have at each level, are you trying to increase or decrease it?

268
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:23,900
And then you have to think about. So if we're talking about decreasing maladaptive coping and how might we do that?

269
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,370
How do we decrease poor coping? Yeah.

270
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:39,440
Mental health is a lot harder then because again, I do a world with endless amount of money here, like providing like mental health.

271
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:47,810
Like therapy, counseling and all of that. But again, that's kind of hard to really do that with intervention, right?

272
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:53,090
But so what you could do and a more realistic is you can have a roof based intervention, you know,

273
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:58,820
similar to like when you all start classes at University of Michigan don't have to take some kind of like.

274
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:08,350
Class. So what are we going to talk about, you know?

275
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:11,620
Yeah, it's like the modules for, like, the training.

276
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:16,160
Thank you. You. Right. Oh, okay.

277
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:19,840
They were supposed to have become the basis of it.

278
00:37:20,290 --> 00:37:23,380
So. So what do you do? Thanks for making me that.

279
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:34,930
You could lose on that, but. So it could be something like an online intervention where you learn coping skills.

280
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:39,430
You know, maybe you get through different scenarios and you try this.

281
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:48,790
Is that or group sessions, let's say in the residence halls where the resident advisor, whoever they're called nowadays,

282
00:37:49,870 --> 00:38:00,270
has a one hour group where you learn the difference between adaptive and maladaptive coping and how to engage in more adaptive to that.

283
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,300
That's yeah, therapy would be nice. The Grand Prix. Mental health in this country.

284
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:17,139
But that's never going to happen in my lifetime. So that that that's something there and then with with this you want to think

285
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,810
about an activity to increase or decrease the direct contributing factor.

286
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:32,230
So if something that's leading you to engage in maladaptive coping, what's something that might lead you to not have very good coping skills?

287
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:39,940
What might be happening or what what might be going on to lead you to not have very good coping skills?

288
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:43,719
Again, this one is a lot harder than the diabetes one.

289
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:51,640
So you want to switch over to like what what what might lead to someone not having good coping skills?

290
00:38:52,120 --> 00:39:01,150
I know you all have amazing coping skills. Right? But think of someone aware of their lack of education or whatever is exactly right.

291
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:06,400
Okay. So that might be one one else. Yeah. Having a familial like influences.

292
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:11,320
Right, right. Family influences. Because we learn a lot of our coping skills from our family.

293
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:20,140
All right. So with your example, the knowledge part, we can very easily, if we're doing an intervention here,

294
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:25,030
there's like that group based thing or modular, we can address that with the family.

295
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:28,870
The family could be one of the direct contributing factors to maladaptive coping.

296
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,829
So with this one thing that we can do,

297
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:40,000
because we want the intervention components to have to do with power critical strategies is to have some

298
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,060
activities where people really think about their family of origin and where they learned their coping skills.

299
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:50,560
Because coping skills are one of those things that you often don't think about it like.

300
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:56,410
I don't know. I mean, if you're hanging out and having dinner, who are like, So where did you learn that coping skill?

301
00:39:56,410 --> 00:40:04,450
That's really great. So what you could do in this intervention is you could have people maybe even do

302
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:11,440
a creative activity where they create a tree of where they learned how to cope.

303
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,840
You know, what did you learn from your dad, your mom, your caretaker?

304
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:22,090
And then critically analyzing that so people could start to think about, oh,

305
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:26,470
wow, I never thought about it before, but I knew exactly what my dad does.

306
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:35,710
And so that would be something that would have a critical approach as opposed to just this is adaptive, this is maladaptive, is how we do it.

307
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:45,309
You know, you leave that and you're like, okay, I have new skills, but if you dig deeper and you find out that through this,

308
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:52,570
you know, some family activity, you find out that you are repeating patterns of behavior that were in your family.

309
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:57,340
Now we're getting to the critical space because those can be more long lasting.

310
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:09,060
And then if we go down here even more indirect, you could think about why do you know why am I in your family of origin,

311
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:16,120
have different types of, you know, negative coping strategies.

312
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:21,460
And down here, it could be could be poverty, it could be lack of education.

313
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:25,510
I mean, and that's a tricky thing with these kind of diagrams. As you know,

314
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:35,170
some items and we've talking about this in the back can be both a direct contributing factor for some and an indirect contributing factor to others.

315
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:44,470
Right. So then you could go deeper into the effects of family trauma.

316
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:51,520
So that could be, you know, broader, maybe it's about institutionalized racism or historical traumas.

317
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,630
And so then you can have activities that really address that as well.

318
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,620
All right. So it's like you're digging deeper and. Deeper.

319
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:05,040
And keep in mind, as you're here, these are more direct than specific.

320
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:09,030
And then again, if you can't think about what's next.

321
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,570
What caused that? What caused that? What caused that?

322
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:18,450
And again, with mental health issues, it's more difficult because we don't know what caused a lot of these.

323
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:30,690
Now we're here if we're talking about diabetes and we're talking about food intake, you know, one food intake issue might be, again, about family.

324
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,299
What did you learn in your family? And that could be another activity. Then out here.

325
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:41,160
It could also be about culture or it could be about environment or other things like that.

326
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:52,320
And again, the with the critical strand of these, you're digging deeper into these things and helping people see why they do what they do.

327
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,349
I just thought of a horrible example, and I'm not going to. Not sure if I'm going to share it or not.

328
00:42:58,350 --> 00:43:02,760
But. And said all these commercials or what is it, noon.

329
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:08,050
The weight loss thing, like where they talk about, you know, the psychological side.

330
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:13,409
It's all about awareness, right? So it's like about, oh, now I know why I have eating.

331
00:43:13,410 --> 00:43:21,150
We had a pattern, things like that. That's what this is all about, is digging deeper so we can make changes that are sustainable.

332
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:27,150
Again, if I just say eat this food and exercise this many times.

333
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,210
Most of most people are not going to do that.

334
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:42,090
But if you dig deeper and figure out, wow, I never realized that, you know, every meal we always had to have a big dessert at the end.

335
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,850
And if we didn't have a big dessert, it wasn't a good meal.

336
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:52,260
And start to examine, well, why are you always eating like two slices of chocolate cake after every single meal?

337
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:55,710
Breakfast, lunch and dinner are a lot of things, right?

338
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:01,800
So that's those kind of interventions are going to be more sustainable. Does this all make sense?

339
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:03,120
All right.

340
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:12,450
So again, when you're coming up with your intervention activities, keep in mind your population, your environment, you have an unlimited budget.

341
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:16,470
So if you want to have, you know, individual therapy for everyone, knock yourself out.

342
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,070
But think about how that would work. Right. That's the other thing.

343
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:26,460
Even if we had a bajillion dollars and we were going to give everyone three free therapy, where are you going to do it?

344
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:30,690
Who's going to do it? Why are they going to come? All those different things.

345
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:36,450
So I want you to really pick it apart as much as you can. Any questions?

346
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:44,760
All right. Be creative. Let's hear tons of fun interventions.

347
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:50,520
Oh, yeah, that's what I saying. You got to have fun, right? If an intervention sucks, no one's going to go to it.

348
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:58,320
But, I mean, again, that's why I like doing interventions. I like I like to play with colors and paint and, you know, do stupid stuff.

349
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:03,840
But that's what brings people in with adolescents because I can really do better.

350
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:18,620
So knock yourself out. We'll walk around if you have any questions. So let's let's start by saying that on the surface, you're not going to.

351
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,340
I believe that getting in those shoes last year, they packed here.

352
00:45:27,410 --> 00:46:00,830
I don't think they should be able to get your shirt and be like, Yeah, yeah, no, I am not engaging at all.

353
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:13,120
Another story is like, Here is all the bad things you just made.

354
00:46:15,410 --> 00:46:23,420
So like I'm saying, like, I think they talk about it, like feeling like you're gonna break down the house.

355
00:46:24,050 --> 00:46:27,280
Did you feel like that was a big.

356
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:30,890
Did you have resources for that? Even engineers.

357
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:39,140
I have to keep you with car. And that's my favorite part of your vacation.

358
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:51,380
We just said it. We saw. Oh, I don't know what's on right now.

359
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:58,880
I think we would like to be, like, happy Neal and stuff like that.

360
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:11,360
I guess I was just like, Yeah, exactly.

361
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:22,540
Yeah. Yeah.

362
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,860
It's all using as, like, extra credit.

363
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:57,530
Like, show you like, you know, I don't want to necessarily make it very clear to me that your mother is like that,

364
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:41,870
but if I can find out, like, enough money to be just like an intervention on how to get to the point where I can say,

365
00:48:43,150 --> 00:49:00,290
oh, my gosh, which one of our friends at least stressed, which, you know,

366
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:30,860
there are some games surrounding uncle season to come on this show or ask you again.

367
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:55,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And there's nothing like asking for it.

368
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:01,250
Oh, yeah.

369
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:19,550
So it's like, how much?

370
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:33,770
Actually, sometimes in moderation, it will extend your best friend's house.

371
00:50:33,980 --> 00:51:12,090
You need to recognize that there might be a lot of, like, porn, cause I never having a much time.

372
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:51,440
I don't know. I guess guys don't know how to do something like that because, like, you know, I forgot to get rid of all of you.

373
00:51:51,710 --> 00:52:11,420
I just want you to cry.

374
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:20,110
But not that I feel that. I don't think the inherent issue with alcohol is that it's like smoking.

375
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,120
It's not about whether or not you think it has to do with the heart, like making sure.

376
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:57,830
I mean, I feel like there's something first thing I want to risk everything.

377
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:04,390
I can't my things.

378
00:53:04,490 --> 00:53:16,129
And I'm just like, oh, well, there's such a reason everybody drinks.

379
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:27,880
And I think it's very natural.

380
00:53:37,730 --> 00:53:52,180
So that's why it's so crazy, like getting her exams back to back exams.

381
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:59,330
It's more like focusing on a case by case basis.

382
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:20,420
So that's not such a good thing to do just to change the outcome.

383
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:27,740
I'm like, I like, like nine. I mean, like a new questionnaire now.

384
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:31,270
It's more like.

385
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:47,690
Yeah, like you said, you were skipping last night.

386
00:54:50,030 --> 00:55:12,170
I used to go to Harvard 82% of the time, which means you can't take and I do a lot of things like that.

387
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:26,100
So I really can't. And the rest.

388
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:40,990
You are not going to be like for you to start using.

389
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:49,080
Yeah. You know, it's like.

390
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:55,000
I don't know. I think that's why.

391
00:55:55,810 --> 00:56:09,400
I don't know. I don't think I mean, I don't like I don't know, I don't really want to have seven.

392
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:17,380
I'm still trying to figure out. Something has to be extremely dangerous every time I get to talk to you.

393
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:32,980
I mean, if you think about discussion,

394
00:56:35,700 --> 00:57:10,609
I hope you guys have the same 23 and even car like you were just to like I was somebody I was like I was actually I'm not on the other side,

395
00:57:10,610 --> 00:57:30,930
but I think it's just like so I think like for me, like, I'm not really sure.

396
00:57:30,980 --> 00:58:01,400
I feel like I just, I don't think it may not be relevant yet.

397
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:09,250
I guess it's like right after school.

398
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:29,080
So that's really funny. Let's see. Like this person was like that when it was like like I don't think it really was like I was

399
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:47,000
like I was like I was like a lot of people like like I was just gonna be like I was like,

400
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:56,310
no, I like that is not where my ends. I thought she would always be like, I'm not even.

401
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:11,610
And she was like, I'm not, you know what I'm trying to be like every other day, I was,

402
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:21,840
like, identified by saying, like, okay, I'm really not going to build the ratings.

403
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:26,560
I was, you know, I was so nice.

404
00:59:29,650 --> 00:59:41,960
I was just so excited because I was like, How are we going to change society?

405
00:59:43,100 --> 00:59:50,530
I don't think we should model for school.

406
00:59:50,890 --> 00:59:57,340
I was showing the different how do I think you saying healthy beverages that you can have?

407
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:12,080
Something else. We're like, really come around to say this so many times.

408
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:40,930
Well, I heard about that. You were talking about it, but it's a very difficult time.

409
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:58,430
Like I said, we like to get off during the week.

410
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:16,290
You know, that kind of like any time you like.

411
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:28,459
I was like I just thought about the past.

412
01:01:28,460 --> 01:01:36,740
I just like, I think, you know, this guy, like, something really intense.

413
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:48,140
Like, not like, you know, I like to call, you know, like a white man.

414
01:01:50,430 --> 01:01:59,990
I just. I just like, oh, man, I didn't really take that out right now.

415
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:10,040
And I was like, this is a little bit I like to use this.

416
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:47,899
I don't like to see my band outside of Europe when they do either, but I can do it.

417
01:02:47,900 --> 01:03:00,500
I'm not the guy that like, Oh, don't worry about trying to get it all, figuring it all.

418
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:08,840
Yeah, I know.

419
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:36,470
But I think this was not a No Child Left Behind.

420
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:45,590
When they first get to college freshman, they're like this year.

421
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:53,000
I think that it is something that long term.

422
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:59,990
Thank you very much.

423
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:15,950
Let's say you know what it looks like.

424
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:25,410
Why would you want to be disgusting? I like comedy said like half of them were done and I was like, yeah, sure.

425
01:04:26,210 --> 01:04:32,860
I mean, I don't like I don't like really like like.

426
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:46,020
Yeah, I like. I think he's really good.

427
01:04:47,570 --> 01:04:55,910
I like military I.

428
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:11,860
I was like, I don't know what you're talking about.

429
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:30,170
I don't know.

430
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:37,670
I just realized that sounds like not much.

431
01:05:38,150 --> 01:06:00,640
Yeah, actually, actually, like, I guess I was like, you're a bad guy.

432
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:44,820
Yeah, I like to go out there and do something like that.

433
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:18,860
And initially, 16, I wouldn't listen to all that.

434
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:35,970
I would maybe is 20 years between.

435
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:46,790
I was like, oh, job.

436
01:07:49,400 --> 01:08:40,130
Don't be like, Oh, no, I don't think too much about the 31 scared that I'm bringing my sister that goes down there like work and stuff like that.

437
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:50,960
I like I like it something very.

438
01:08:57,980 --> 01:09:07,610
What is your life like using the resources that I have?

439
01:09:08,890 --> 01:09:51,620
You know, I really like I don't really know what I was doing last year, my schedule, I never heard about it.

440
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:59,060
I was like, this is good. So I.

441
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:20,330
I also think about this like a bunch practice. I mean, I would go, oh, yeah, you know, I would be so, you know, like I that was great.

442
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:44,860
I was like, Oh, my God, that's going to drop everything.

443
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:57,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever it is.

444
01:10:59,260 --> 01:11:08,110
And so it's sort of like you're saying, it's okay, that's fine.

445
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:12,790
I think that's good.

446
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:18,310
I didn't have to. I know.

447
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:30,660
I, I like my president just like, really to visit my friends, to talk about, you know, like,

448
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:50,380
just like I think as long as it doesn't cover up like that, sometimes I think it's just like I just.

449
01:11:52,070 --> 01:12:01,000
I don't know. I don't know.

450
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:09,080
You got to come speak.

451
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:16,000
Like, I just feel like you're like.

452
01:12:25,990 --> 01:12:34,310
I, like, just my whole life right now.

453
01:12:36,550 --> 01:12:44,530
I can't really. This is the first time I've done some of the other events.

454
01:12:44,530 --> 01:13:01,540
It has been just like not even more so because it's all about I feel like these interventions may look very different, but.

455
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:05,190
Yeah, that's so.

456
01:13:06,100 --> 01:13:11,910
That's why I didn't like.

457
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:16,030
Oh. Oh, wow.

458
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:25,830
Yeah. Oh, I didn't.

459
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:31,810
I don't think it was like.

460
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:38,910
Know. Well, you know, I don't know.

461
01:13:39,090 --> 01:14:00,640
Well, look, I'm very, very comfortable in the world, but I just feel like it's just that it's like I'm so young.
