1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:07,530
Oh. I.

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:21,080
I believe. Oh, my God.

3
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:27,060
Oh. Did you hear from a friend of yours?

4
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:41,120
Oh, I'm fine. That was the reason why I gave me the phone for this good practice for three.

5
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,080
And also, it was a phone interview, so I wasn't very worried about the whole thing.

6
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:51,280
I thought that it was okay. That you should.

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,140
All right, let's get started. People are trickling in, but that's okay.

8
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,200
I hope you guys are all well. We're going to try to catch up today.

9
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,030
We're a little behind. It's going to be a lot of lot of activities today.

10
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:19,350
Okay. So prepare for that. We're going to have a geocoding and spatial joins, which we didn't finish last time.

11
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:27,060
And then we'll start talking about proximity analysis, which includes measuring hotspots and cool spots.

12
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,780
We won't get that far today, I think, but we'll do our best.

13
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:35,920
Okay. Just an outline for today. I want to talk about your final projects today.

14
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:49,560
Give you some examples of final projects, maybe a outline of how we may approach writing it up and and other information that might be helpful to you.

15
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:55,410
And you can ask me questions as we go through this material, and then we'll do lab activities.

16
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:58,550
Most of the class will break this up into two.

17
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,740
There'll be some student led discussions in between the geocoding and spatial joint activities,

18
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:14,760
and then proximity analysis would do some work with density analysis using buffers and spatial joints.

19
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:22,890
We'll learn how to measure distance. And next week, I will start doing some hotspot calls for analysis.

20
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,570
Okay, that's the plan for today about your final project.

21
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:40,710
So I just sent out an email to the class right before 230 or 220 or so, and I have to sign up for meetings with me so we could sign up as a team.

22
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:44,970
We can set up individually, if you like, but I prefer meeting with both of you at the same time,

23
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,570
and you are signed up with more than one slide if you need more time.

24
00:02:50,790 --> 00:03:00,209
Meeting start this Thursday and I think I'm hoping to meet with all of you by the end of next week so you get ample time to ask questions.

25
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,950
And then based on the meeting, work on your final projects.

26
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:10,590
Just a quick question to you all. How is your search for data going for your final project?

27
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,930
Good. Okay. It's a good have nots. Excellent.

28
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:23,130
All right. They know we're going to do a little activity today where you may you'll share some tips or some data

29
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:28,970
sources with the rest of your team that sometimes help students find information that they're looking for.

30
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:33,959
If there's some common interests in terms of your final project.

31
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:43,830
But I ask you to do is pose a research question or a programmatic or what I call a practical question that has a spatial focus.

32
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,900
Okay. And a lot of the questions could be descriptive questions.

33
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,690
They could be questions of association.

34
00:03:52,260 --> 00:04:02,430
But most of those association questions would have to be analyzed statistically to get a statistical correlation or measure of association.

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:13,380
In terms of descriptive questions, you can ask questions like, you know, how does some feature or attribute vary in a geographic space?

36
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:21,000
Does that attribute or feature? Is it clustered or dispersed in the space?

37
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:27,570
We can talk about distance to things or and so forth.

38
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:32,520
Okay. I'm going to give you some examples for some some of these projects that students have done in the past.

39
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,120
So you can get some idea of what how to develop your own thinking around this.

40
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,670
But the idea is to build up on your thoughts in parts one, two, three.

41
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:54,180
So right now you should be submitting part to today. Write your your draft question and we'll discuss that during our meetings.

42
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:59,400
And by the time you finished part three, you should have a pretty good handle on what you're doing.

43
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:12,329
And then you write up a final paper with 202,000 words or less, and you should describe the health issue that you're wanting to study.

44
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:20,190
You know, what is the rationale? What is the point of your of your analysis in your in your inquiry?

45
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,580
You should describe the spatial question as explicitly as possible.

46
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:30,150
You should discuss the significance of your analysis.

47
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,000
Why is it important? What is the background literature of the question you're asking?

48
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,320
A literature review and a statement of why this is important to study.

49
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,299
You should have a methodology section where you describe your methods that should

50
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:53,960
include things like your data sources and the measurement variables that.

51
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:01,890
You are using and or creating any analysis that you're doing okay.

52
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:10,200
Descriptive analysis, measures of association, measures of spatial correlation and so forth.

53
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:21,990
Since you describe your findings and as you describe your findings, you should be creating maps or charts as part of your results section.

54
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:33,570
And then you should talk about what are the implications of your findings, particularly in terms of research, programmatic or policy matters.

55
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:47,190
And you should include about 3 to 5 maps that you've created in our GIS and wanted to tables to supplement those maps or charts.

56
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:54,239
Okay. Your perspective could be local. It could be state level, could be national.

57
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,500
It could be global at any level in between.

58
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:07,350
Right. So here's some just pointers on how you may organize your final project.

59
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:17,579
Okay. You should have the background significant section describing why it's important to, uh, to, to answer the question.

60
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:21,230
You're posing a method section. How did you do it?

61
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:27,630
Right. What are the steps you took? And why did you do what you did and took your methods?

62
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,920
Right. Your results. What did you find?

63
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,050
Especially highlighting the important findings?

64
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,390
Discuss what you learned and so what around what you learned.

65
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,550
Meaning what the implications are, what you learn and your strengths and limitations.

66
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:53,999
Okay. Now for your method section, which is the second bullet, you could include your measures or data source.

67
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:04,110
I mentioned this the SC geographic unit of analysis, the time frame which you're studying, and any gaps in statistical analysis you're doing.

68
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,610
So here's here's an example of a final project you could take on.

69
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,070
It's based on some of the work that I'm doing in India currently.

70
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,070
The health issue that I'm focused on in India currently is tobacco use and youth population specifically and their families.

71
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,650
So what you should do first as you do this work is, you know,

72
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:34,639
review the literature about tobacco consumption patterns in India, you know, disparities in use,

73
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:44,660
current public health responses to tobacco use in India in terms of policy responses or programmatic or prevention programs, things like that.

74
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,330
So I encourage you all to start reading the literature on the topic that you're interested in right away,

75
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,809
especially literature that has some spacial focus to it.

76
00:08:53,810 --> 00:09:04,040
So you can kind of situate yourself within the water body, a broader body of work as you go through this literature,

77
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:13,490
as I went through this one, one key issue that comes up is tobacco access being a key risk factor for tobacco use initiation in kids.

78
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,820
Okay. You know, you can address prevention in a variety of ways.

79
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:23,210
You know, you can teach people about tobacco, about its harms, how to refuse it.

80
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:30,110
You can you could reduce media exposure.

81
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:40,790
You could increase prices. You could reduce wear, you know, public use, you can increase public use restrictions, those types of things.

82
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:48,170
But one key issue is access, particularly retailer access, where you can buy this product.

83
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:53,870
Right. So the question I could pose is something like a series of questions.

84
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,160
So you don't have to pose just one question. The questions can build off of each other.

85
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:06,680
So I could pose a question on is there a spatial variation in neighborhood tobacco access and socioeconomic status in India?

86
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,910
How does neighborhood tobacco access differ by neighborhood socioeconomic status?

87
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:26,240
So to answer this first question, I could create I could if I have data on retailers where things are sold, tobacco was sold.

88
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:35,440
I can map out the variation of that across the geographic space or the cities I'm working in right now in Mumbai, in India.

89
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,350
So I can do this kind of work in the cities that we're doing our research.

90
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:48,830
And I can create a bivariate corporate map looking at socioeconomic status and access to see where they may be.

91
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,710
High access and low access.

92
00:10:51,950 --> 00:11:01,460
In my neighborhoods, in my study neighborhoods, I can measure the statistical correlation between neighborhood tobacco access and FCF.

93
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:08,270
I can do hotspot and cold spot analysis of tobacco access within my 30 neighborhoods.

94
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:13,370
Okay. So these are some questions you can kind of pose.

95
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:21,410
And I could create maps and tables about the spatial distribution of poverty and access to tobacco.

96
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:31,230
I just mentioned this bivariate map map about density of retailers and percent living below poverty at a neighborhood level.

97
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:38,960
This is a mistake and I can measure local spatial correlation of tobacco access within the neighborhoods in my state.

98
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:46,610
It just kind of lays out some ideas about a project that I can take on if I was doing this for this class.

99
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:54,080
Now, these are some example projects. Yes, I go back to the first research question.

100
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:58,620
Are we assuming that students will be the ones?

101
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,080
Well, in this case, I'm interested in tobacco taxes as an outcome.

102
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:14,110
Right. So this would be something that may be associated with access neighborhoods.

103
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:22,010
So it could be an independent variable and the dependent variable would be tobacco access measures.

104
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:33,709
So some examples of previous projects that students had worked on in this class and just

105
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:38,030
giving you titles of these so you can get an idea of what students might have done.

106
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:43,220
So this the student did a geographic analysis of domestic violence in Michigan.

107
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:50,690
And I think this was looking at county level domestic violence rates and the variations in that across the counties in Michigan.

108
00:12:52,100 --> 00:13:02,040
One soon did a feasibility analysis of using mobile phone sex interventions as intervention channels in India for HIV positive patients.

109
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:13,280
The idea is to help patients manage their HIV better by taking their medication, by using safe sexual practices and so forth.

110
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,310
So looking at mobile phone penetration across,

111
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:24,860
I think the eastern part of the country to see if there is enough penetration

112
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:32,899
in certain geographies to do a mobile based intervention of some students and

113
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:38,600
location of Title IX funded clinics and risk factors for unintended pregnancy

114
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:45,710
and morality and county level variation in birth outcomes in North Carolina.

115
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:51,319
For your piece of genic environment examining county level data in Michigan,

116
00:13:51,320 --> 00:14:00,410
this was an analysis of food deserts and I think physical activity the new deserts in Michigan.

117
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:11,270
Market research for CART, which is a business that students wanted to create for food delivery services in low income neighborhoods.

118
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:18,379
So that student looked at which census tracts in Michigan.

119
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:30,380
I think specifically Southeast Michigan may have individuals living there who may value such a business.

120
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:36,620
So low income folks who don't have transportation, who are far away from a bus line.

121
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:47,360
You can find that data from the census in three maps of census tracts in Michigan to see where my potential

122
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:54,440
market might be fictional is that once the environmental hazards and communities of color in California.

123
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,809
So this is a county level analysis.

124
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:08,570
Again, looking at us, I think EPA measures environmental hazards and how they may be distributed across California counties,

125
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:18,410
particularly for I think it's a census tracts and see if they're close to places of where people of color may live.

126
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:29,660
Hotspot calls for analysis of robberies in Detroit, crime and food access in Chicago and Washington,

127
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:37,850
D.C. So I think interestingly, places that had low food access tend to have high levels of crime.

128
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,600
So this particular team was interested in the the overlap between those two things.

129
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:53,540
Understanding the school to prison pipeline in Michigan, violent conflicts and low birth weight in Sierra Leone.

130
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,610
Um, HIV prevalence in domestic violence in Kenya.

131
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:07,250
This was using the DHS survey that we kind of looked at in class from the DHS program.

132
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:13,160
They collect data on these types of issues. And we looked at the provincial data in Kenya.

133
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:16,459
Teen pregnancy in the US and Mexico.

134
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:24,170
So just issues of spatial variation and clustering of teen pregnancies in school, proximity to highways and asthma in children.

135
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:28,980
So yeah, so variety of different topics.

136
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,150
You can be very creative as you can see. I think your questions may get a little bit more nuanced as time moves on.

137
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,700
Okay,

138
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:42,799
so keep your mind open and we're going to learn things in the next couple of weeks to see if we can incorporate that kind of stuff into your work.

139
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,200
Okay. So what you're doing now is not necessarily final, it's just kind of getting started.

140
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:55,310
So what I recommend to all of you is again, start reading, okay?

141
00:16:55,490 --> 00:17:03,950
I get surprised sometimes. I meet with students towards the end of their project work and they haven't really read much about what's going on.

142
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,770
This is really important is they'll help you formulate questions, help you find data,

143
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:15,590
help you develop measures that are valid and reliable for your work,

144
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:22,100
and even give you some pointers on how you may want to analyze data and interpret your results and so forth.

145
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:27,660
So please read. Academic and non academic literature in the topic that you're studying.

146
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:34,830
Okay. So if you look at journals, articles particularly paying attention to the methods section,

147
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:41,040
look at the bibliography for additional papers you might be interested in reading.

148
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,980
Okay. You can look at reports. Right.

149
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:51,569
These are not peer reviewed journals, but these are reports of this have this you might be interested in governmental agencies,

150
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,630
produce these things, produce these kind of things.

151
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:04,050
So those are very important to read and they could be important to identify data sources for your work.

152
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,200
If needed, you could contact authors. Okay.

153
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:14,160
I think a couple of you have already done that for some of the work you're doing, which is so great and you have some time.

154
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:19,110
So if you find something that, Hey, I would love to have this data, I don't have it.

155
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,260
Maybe the author has it and they may be willing to share it with you.

156
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:27,360
So it's really good kind of thing to get used to is to contact people.

157
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:34,620
Even cold emails can work. Um, people who are, you know, doing work that you are interested in.

158
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:44,579
So they recommend doing that. Authors But also there there may be issues like you can contact governmental offices if you need access

159
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:52,430
to data or something like that that you're not really readily available like play online searches for,

160
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:56,280
for data and other things are useful.

161
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:00,149
I think data are becoming so much easier to find these days.

162
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,400
So maybe who looks like a lot of you're doing great,

163
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:10,379
but just some pointers on what things you can look for in terms of keywords or search terms, you know, data GIS,

164
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:16,920
spatial, geographic information society, map, geography, place, place based,

165
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:23,640
etc. These types of words may help you get spatial information and data sources.

166
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:29,070
Your health issue of interest start broad and then move to specific.

167
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,910
Uh, you can also think about not just the health issue but the risk factors or

168
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,540
preventive or promoted factors for those health issues as part of your search term.

169
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,490
Okay, location.

170
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:52,620
This seems like a no brainer, but sometimes you forget the country, the state, the locality at which you want to do your research and so forth.

171
00:19:53,130 --> 00:20:00,120
Now, these are lot of governmental departments, state level, county level,

172
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,730
city level, have, you know, GIS and health related data available and accessible.

173
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:15,300
And this is becoming more and more common. These are just links to some of the major, you know, big states nearby that you could find data for.

174
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:26,880
Uh, and this is just expanding exponentially nowadays, so I recommend going to those sources to get some data that you might need.

175
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:31,030
Also, there are non-health department resources, right?

176
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:37,200
So not just looking at health departments and planning departments are very important for, for spatial data,

177
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:45,420
um, especially boundary files and so forth, you know, educational departments, relations like schools, uh,

178
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,799
business development,

179
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:59,490
Treasury and I have to contact the Treasury to get information on taxation and licensing for alcohol and tobacco outlets in Michigan and California,

180
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,360
parks and Rec, you know, road, water, police, etc.

181
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,110
So these could be also helpful sources for data, uh, federal departments.

182
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:17,250
I think we've gone through some of these already, but you can look there as well and you can contact them.

183
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,940
Okay. There's also the, um, library.

184
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,670
All right. The librarians are amazing resource, and they're underused.

185
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:35,310
And amazingly, we have a spatial and numeric data librarian that all this person's job is to help people

186
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:43,469
find data for their GIS related projects and other information related to their work.

187
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:52,980
So you can check in a cool email or phone number to to set up a meeting and and get some help.

188
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,410
So the School of Public Health has support from the library, too, so you can contact them.

189
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:04,050
All right. Then we also have a geospatial data hub.

190
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,879
And I actually even sent you something from Missouri, which I just learned about it last week.

191
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:16,800
Right. There was a whole the Sociodemographic indicators resource globally, which is quite amazing.

192
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:23,790
So you don't even have to go to the census anymore. You can just go to Ezra and get some of the census related variables from.

193
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:35,220
Not just for our country, for many countries. Okay. So the work for getting data is easier nowadays and you can contact your network.

194
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:43,950
You guys may be working on projects or have worked on projects in the past that use gas in some way or have spatial data.

195
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:51,060
Many times you collect addresses, rank points of service or participants and so forth.

196
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:58,470
So that could be part of your project if you want. Okay, so your academic networks procrastinate with your friends and so forth.

197
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:10,380
So just some pointers on getting your work going and building on the momentum you have for your final project because of any questions or concerns.

198
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,400
Yes. Yeah, that's good.

199
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:22,770
So I guess could you go back to the first page around the site of this announcement?

200
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:30,400
And I guess my first question was just to clarify, like in the one feature that was submitted today,

201
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:35,050
all the potential questions will be asking what other information would.

202
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:41,100
Expect. I just think you want to.

203
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:50,820
Most important is to articulate your questions clearly and logically and provide some rationale about why you want to answer those questions.

204
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:59,550
I don't expect a deep literature review at this point. I just want to get your thoughts on paper and what your motivation is.

205
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:06,330
And then we can have a conversation about it and meet and give you some written comments as well.

206
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:10,670
And the tape will be attached to what we submit today.

207
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:19,589
That's the same team. That's right. But if you may have updated updated it in the last week, you may have found something new you want to add to it.

208
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:25,730
And yeah, and also on one page, are there any formatting things or.

209
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:29,390
Double speak. No, no, no.

210
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,860
No big format issues there. You can do it in any way you like.

211
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:44,860
It's just a kind of a draft document. And then when you talk about the 3 to 5 maps in order to do the tables, do all of those visual aids,

212
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:54,600
to me directly related to answering the research question and the like, the table, for example, would provide like a larger context of health issues.

213
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:02,230
I think it's fine to use tables and charts to provide context.

214
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:09,510
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

215
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:15,860
You know, I think also this number, 3 to 5, I may change that number in the syllabus.

216
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,780
Uh, I forget. So I have to look at it.

217
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:30,590
It might be 2 to 5, but I look at the syllabus for the final numbers for that particular piece there.

218
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:35,780
I think somebody else raised their hand. No. Yeah.

219
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,580
So. So why are we taking questions? That has been.

220
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,960
Don't happen. Well, they don't.

221
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,500
I mean, you know, of stuff you can learn just from descriptive analysis hotspot quotes by.

222
00:25:50,650 --> 00:25:59,680
And that's also descriptive. Yeah. Yeah. All right.

223
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,500
And I'm sure you'll have more questions coming forward.

224
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:19,180
So what I'd like you guys to do for a few minutes here is go to this link right here on this slide and this.

225
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:32,370
Probably works for you to. And there should be a table there.

226
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:38,550
Can you and can you guys get to it? So you ask and need to give you access.

227
00:26:38,970 --> 00:27:04,990
They. Have to update my browser to make sense.

228
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:25,030
Hmm. And. Right.

229
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,870
Okay. So you guys need access to the phone.

230
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:53,420
Maybe I should say anyone who has a long gun. You can edit that.

231
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:03,080
All right. So just take a few moments, 5 minutes to share the data sources, maybe just a couple,

232
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:09,780
the ones you think are quite interesting and would be useful for others and fill out this table.

233
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,510
Okay. Because some of you guys may have common interest.

234
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:19,110
You may want to do this kind of work in the future in another topic, and this could be a resource for you.

235
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:22,550
So here, just write the title for your data source.

236
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:35,250
Right. And a description of what's there and access information like a link or if you've got it from a person, an email, etc.

237
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:44,730
So take a few minutes to you can use your your first second assignment to help here take a few minutes to fill this out.

238
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,710
Yeah. About computer programing.

239
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,760
Computer question? Yeah, sure. So I'm looking forward to this.

240
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,690
The more you're locked in some of them. Yeah, but.

241
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:05,890
Oh, no. Yeah.

242
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:16,320
Like. Try.

243
00:30:48,270 --> 00:31:02,270
This is the machine. The. Both of those men.

244
00:31:28,220 --> 00:34:20,210
It's. All right.

245
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:27,730
It's. This is looking great. Yeah.

246
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:37,920
Let's wrap it up in a couple of minutes. And you can always add to this list to your leisure and check it out if you think you need something.

247
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:41,290
There's some general resources here. I see.

248
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:51,400
Like us saying interstate highways and freeway systems actually useful for almost anybody.

249
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:08,140
Great. Cargo Data portal, the.

250
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,490
All right. So once you finish, what we're going to do next is start doing some lab activities.

251
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:32,810
But before we get into that, I want to talk about just briefly about geocoding, what that is.

252
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:38,450
So just wrap it up and then we'll move on.

253
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:43,850
So we're going to first start with geocoding. We're going to start working with point data today.

254
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,270
So we've been mostly working with polygon information, write county boundaries and so forth.

255
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,930
So today we're going to start doing some point data work.

256
00:35:54,140 --> 00:36:00,860
And one important part of working with points on a map is to locate those features on the map.

257
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:10,970
And many times you have addresses for things like clinics, grocery stores, prisons.

258
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:18,710
People are looking at all kinds of different locations, but you don't know how to place them on a map and just probe into one by one.

259
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,510
I guess using Google Maps or something,

260
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:31,490
the geocoding process is to turn address information into spatially referenced points on a or a location on a map.

261
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:40,100
And so you take street addresses, you can have the street address itself or zip codes only.

262
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:46,970
So you can map just zip codes if you map just to give code to zip codes, which we'll do in a few minutes.

263
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:51,260
You go to the you get a point that's in the center of that zip code.

264
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:56,750
But if you have a full address, you can locate it right at the street level.

265
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:04,310
Okay. So address information is is is processed through something called an address locator.

266
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:10,490
And that address locator then is used to put those addresses on a point.

267
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:20,690
So we'll look at some information that address locators used to generate these locations from an address data.

268
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:27,320
One thing I want to make sure you understand is many times when you try to match or do geocoding work,

269
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:33,590
you don't get 100% match because they're often mistakes in address data.

270
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:36,890
Right. Maybe something is not spelled correctly.

271
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:43,220
The number is its type. Some critical piece of information is missing and so forth.

272
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:53,120
So you'll likely get unmatched results, which you don't have to worry about so much unless they are a large proportion of your data.

273
00:37:53,180 --> 00:38:00,410
So if you're geocoding a hundred different things and you get 95% match, you're probably okay.

274
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:10,740
And there are ways to find the rematch by changing the address information to make it work.

275
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:14,210
But I just want you to be aware when you're working with geocoding,

276
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:21,530
you may not result in 100% match, but if you're higher than 95 or so, you are in pretty good shape.

277
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:32,540
95%. Right. And geocoding locators are some they're often called geocoding services.

278
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:41,450
So Azeri has an artifact world geocoding service that covers many countries, but not all countries.

279
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,340
And you can find more information about that service here at this link.

280
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:55,880
And that's available to us, as you know, students and faculty and employees of the university here to use freely.

281
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:04,970
It does cost to geocoding each address, but is covered through our contract with Azeri, through the university.

282
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:12,020
Or you can use existing geocoding services that are out there,

283
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:23,929
but these are usually not as updated as maybe the for profit ones that, like the Azeri one, is the world today.

284
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:27,320
Use the Azeri service as we do our geocoding work.

285
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:37,010
Okay. So let's get started with geocoding just to kind of dive into it so you can get a better understanding of how it all works.

286
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:40,940
So we're going to start with graph activity 24.

287
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:46,310
So as always, I would like you to go to our canvas website.

288
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,860
Go to modules and I've added a lot more data to our zip file in my file.

289
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:04,070
So please download this zip file and put it in the C folder or the C directory.

290
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,730
I'm sorry on your computers.

291
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:20,850
Deleting my old version and then I'm going to download and extract the new version there.

292
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:33,480
So if you click the show in folder, right click on the zip file, extract all and choose your location.

293
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:42,420
C Drive. Select folder extract.

294
00:40:56,570 --> 00:41:00,620
Yes. Double check.

295
00:41:01,370 --> 00:41:06,570
Yes, it is reported. But I.

296
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:15,750
Deleted. All right, so you should see your folder here.

297
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:25,060
Right after you've got to download it, open up your apps, pro software.

298
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:33,310
And we're going to open up an existing NPR X File existing project.

299
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:13,420
All right. So once your largest program, go to open another project in the bottom left hand corner.

300
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:25,120
And go to the C Drive Lab folder, the projects folder within the lab folder.

301
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:29,890
And then there is a folder project folder called Clinic Site.

302
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:35,710
Double click that and open up clinic site approx.

303
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:46,240
Okay. So we're kind of thinking about here is, you know, there is a hospital in Pittsburgh that wants to open up a new, uh, satellite clinic.

304
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:54,130
All right, so what it wants to do is we'll learn about where their patients are located so their current catchment area

305
00:42:54,670 --> 00:43:01,240
and use that information as some piece of information to help guide their selection process for a new clinic.

306
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:14,290
And so what we have here, if you look at this, the contents page, we have the US interstate highways which are not on,

307
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:25,340
we have the US counties, US states, and then we have the Tri-State ZIP codes, which are Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.

308
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:33,330
Let's consider the tri state area and the bluish coloring and my screen.

309
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:39,940
It's hard to tell. It's blue, but those are all the zip codes and the boundaries of the zip code boundaries.

310
00:43:41,290 --> 00:43:45,100
And here we have two tables that are proprietary and one is called patients.

311
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:54,880
Let's look at that table. Can open it up. So these are hypothetical patients of this hospital system.

312
00:43:55,270 --> 00:44:00,730
Okay. But we only have their their zip codes. You don't have the street addresses.

313
00:44:02,170 --> 00:44:07,690
And what I've done is taken a 200 random sample of 200 of those patients.

314
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:11,890
For us to practice geocoding so you can open up that file.

315
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:24,670
So this first file table has about 9000 records and this one has 200 random sample of bounce records for us to use in our geocoding exercise.

316
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:32,410
So what we're going to do right now is geocoding these 200 zip codes to the zip codes in

317
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:37,470
the tri county area to see which counties have a lot of patients and which counties.

318
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:40,960
And we're not counting zip codes have fewer patients and so forth.

319
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:47,570
Okay. So we've done up to number two.

320
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:51,380
Right. So it's really easy to geo coat. Right.

321
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:57,050
So the one one way to get to the geocoding tool is right clicking on the table.

322
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:03,650
That includes the address information and you will see a gioco table option pop up.

323
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:12,469
So click that gioco table. And the really nice thing about Ezer is he can gives you all these steps.

324
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:19,730
It is a little tutorial that you can use to populate the tool with the information you need to check it.

325
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:24,500
So let's just read these steps in a first. What locator are you using?

326
00:45:25,310 --> 00:45:30,680
So you have to choose a locator. You'll only have one option because only one option is provided through Azeri.

327
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:37,430
But you can add on new locators if you need. Step two, you you put in information about the table of data.

328
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:47,600
Okay. So step three is you tell the computer which fields include the address information that you want to geocoding.

329
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:52,790
Step four, you output what is the output going to be called?

330
00:45:52,970 --> 00:45:56,300
Meaning a new feature class will be created from the table.

331
00:45:56,900 --> 00:46:00,590
That's the point layer. What do you want to call it? Where do you want to put it?

332
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,010
What countries do you want to use this? Do you want the geocoding service to use?

333
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:20,479
You can put all countries, but you better to just pick one and then you can talk about what type of address information you have as a final step.

334
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:31,130
So let's just push the start button. And first thing you do is choose your input locator, which is the Our Gas World Geocoding Service.

335
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:39,540
Next. Which table since that great clicked on patient 200.

336
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:48,480
The input table is already listed here. Okay. It asks you all how many fields are in that table that has address information.

337
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,520
We only have one field which is zipcode. So you put one field.

338
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:58,900
Okay. And then push next.

339
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:04,330
Well, one field with which field is it that includes is the zip code data.

340
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:08,860
So choosing zip code, not zip code one.

341
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:20,979
And then it asks you what you want to use the address location, zip code.

342
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:24,639
Not zip. Just zip code. Yeah, not zip code.

343
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:29,020
Underscore one. What location type do you prefer?

344
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:36,490
So you want the address location? Which output feel would you like?

345
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:41,930
Included. We want all the fields of there in the table to be in the new feature class.

346
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:48,610
So just push all and then push next. Well, what countries are you doing your geocoding to?

347
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:51,010
We're just doing in the United States.

348
00:47:51,010 --> 00:48:03,160
So just click that one and only one category can be our locations in your table, all limited to a specific type click postal.

349
00:48:03,670 --> 00:48:07,870
Okay. Instead of address, address would need to have a street address information.

350
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:12,520
We don't have that. We just have the postal zip code and then push finish.

351
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:22,210
Okay. So it shows you the geocoding table to your processing tool and then you push, right?

352
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:36,170
So at the bottom thing should start running. And once it's done, you'll get an information box here that tells you what happened.

353
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:44,060
Okay. We had 199 matched zip codes and one that was unmatched.

354
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:49,190
Okay. So we have pretty good accuracy here. And you can see what's happening.

355
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:56,480
You can start to start a rematch process. So talks about.

356
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,940
It was not able to find the specific zip code. So this could be an error in the zip code information itself.

357
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,620
But since it's only one out of 200,

358
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,610
I would just ignore it because it's not going to really make a difference in

359
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:25,690
terms of trying to identify the catchment area for your particular task here.

360
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,940
So you can push just close that out. Okay.

361
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:36,430
So if you look, you should have geo coded addresses.

362
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:50,330
Now, what happened? Okay.

363
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:59,830
So if you have that, if you push that little circle here above the arrows that are pointing in, it goes to something called full extent.

364
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:10,510
So do zoom out to the area that is in your boundary files and then I'm going to zoom back in into this area.

365
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:19,930
There we go. So these are the individual zip code centers.

366
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:32,980
So if you zoom in even further, you'll notice that there are points in multiple zip codes and there may be more than one point on a zip code,

367
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:39,880
but they're all on top of each other. They're coincident. So you can't tell how many are there just by looking at it.

368
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:52,210
All right. So if you were mapping out the full 9200, you would see a lot more dots and a lot more coverage in this area.

369
00:50:52,690 --> 00:51:00,410
And you can identify from that information. Which zip codes have patients that go to this hospital?

370
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:07,329
You can count the number of patients per zip code into a corpus map of that to look

371
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:14,800
at catchment area and kind of the intensity of the number of patients per zip code.

372
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:24,310
Okay. So if you're going to build a clinic, you could map out where your current satellite clinics are over where those patients are,

373
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:28,450
and maybe consider a few different options for a satellite clinic.

374
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:32,910
Okay. Okay.

375
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:40,470
Is that an error from the person in Indiana or they just in that part of it?

376
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:44,130
No, I think that's actually a person. So that's not the error.

377
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,780
The error was is missing is no dot for that matched person yet.

378
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:56,309
They may live there, but maybe they were visiting somebody in the tri state area got hurt who had had to go to the hospital.

379
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:59,370
Right. And now they're in the patient database.

380
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:07,530
Okay. So we have a so we have the geo coded, uh, layer up here.

381
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:11,820
Right. And you can. Let's save this file.

382
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:17,790
Okay. You can save it as because we're going to keep playing around with it.

383
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:29,370
So let's save it as the same main clinical site, but then add your name to the end of it just so we don't mess up with the original file.

384
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:37,920
Okay. Okay. So now let's go to activity number 25.

385
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,720
So I was mentioning we can count the number of patients per zip code.

386
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:48,000
Okay. So how do we do that? We use some process called spatial joints.

387
00:52:48,270 --> 00:52:51,600
So before we did joining tables together, right.

388
00:52:54,810 --> 00:53:03,270
We're joining a table with the boundary file to get your attribute data to a boundary file data.

389
00:53:03,990 --> 00:53:07,200
Here, what we're doing is joining patients to zip codes.

390
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:12,450
So we're using one feature and joining it to another feature.

391
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,790
And by doing that, yes,

392
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:22,349
it will also provide your account or some other variable that you designate for

393
00:53:22,350 --> 00:53:27,510
that specific zip code in relation to the patients that are in the zip code.

394
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:32,870
So let's do that procedure. So you have now, as you put it, the zip codes for all patients.

395
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,500
We can use a feature class of patients to count the number of patients per zip code.

396
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:41,460
This can be done by this spatial joint tool.

397
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:51,930
All right. So working with the same thing. So in the contents, plain right click on.

398
00:53:54,990 --> 00:54:06,980
The tri city zip code layer. And then join and release and go to spatial joint.

399
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:17,390
So the join target feature is traced the zip codes.

400
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:27,950
The joint feature is the 200 patients that we just geocoding is the output feature class is called IL.

401
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:31,310
You can call it what you like, but this is the automatic name it produces.

402
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:37,480
Let's make sure that we put it in the right spot.

403
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:41,920
It should be in the site selection geo database.

404
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:52,960
If you push the folder button, select site selection, geo database open and then I guess you want to name it.

405
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:58,060
You can name it. Here, try the zip codes.

406
00:55:00,190 --> 00:55:16,240
Join patients. And join 1 to 1 in match options intersect.

407
00:55:16,450 --> 00:55:22,250
So when they intersect with each other, the zip codes in the patients and push.

408
00:55:22,270 --> 00:55:32,020
Okay, so once it's done, it will create a new layer called tri state.

409
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:35,830
Zip codes underscore joint patients or whatever you named it.

410
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:45,040
So let's take a look at that. Okay. Right click and open attribute table.

411
00:55:50,310 --> 00:55:53,610
Okay. So at the end of this table.

412
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:02,950
I mean, we're the, you know, right here, the third column in this table, it says, join count.

413
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:07,360
So those are the number of patients per zip code.

414
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,900
Okay. So if you were.

415
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:19,810
The next step would be to then create a corporate map of this joint kind of variable.

416
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:24,910
Right. So how about you guys do that on your own?

417
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:31,430
You can do it by yourself or you can work with pairs. And that's the next page on the slides.

418
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:36,310
Exercise grade corporate map showing patient counts by zip code.

419
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:41,910
So create a corporate map using this joint variable.

420
00:56:45,550 --> 00:56:48,790
So we can get an idea visually about what's happening here.

421
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:52,590
Yeah. Yeah.

422
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:58,470
Just relax and just be friendly. What was the purpose of us joining those two layers again?

423
00:56:58,470 --> 00:57:11,160
And what was that doing? What it allowed us to do is add a variable to the zip code layer to tell us how many patients are there in each zip code.

424
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:22,200
Okay, so before that, all we had was this point layer, right, of zip codes for patients in a polygon layer of zip codes.

425
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:27,030
Okay. But we didn't know how many patients were in each zip code.

426
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:31,320
Yeah. Okay. Right. So this procedure helps you count that.

427
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:43,920
Yes. Please.

428
00:58:04,630 --> 00:58:59,330
Based. Can you get the number of patients for have got to show up on that permit and you get the number of patients versus those who like the labels.

429
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:09,440
Yeah. So you could right click on the look and then join later this one in the nutrition label.

430
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:23,280
Books, label properties and instead appeal name.

431
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:47,239
I guess you would put joint count. Just so you can't see it now.

432
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:51,700
But. When it turn out this land.

433
01:00:06,350 --> 01:00:15,790
And we'll. Know, I was working on symbol of union this.

434
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:41,990
Think. So you should get some kind of a map like this is not very informative at the moment because I only did 200 patients.

435
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:50,900
Um, the reason I didn't do all 9000 because one it costs money 9000 times.

436
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:55,010
I don't know, 20 people. It's a lot. And two, it takes a while.

437
01:00:55,340 --> 01:01:01,040
Okay. So it would probably take them several minutes at least to geocoding for all doing at the same time.

438
01:01:01,610 --> 01:01:08,520
I actually don't know what would have happened. So that's why you can try to do the 9000 on your own at home.

439
01:01:09,980 --> 01:01:16,900
But I would spend that effort. Geocoding addresses you really want to gioco.

440
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:25,040
Okay. So the just as briefly, it's a simple exercise to to visualize the symbology of that count variable.

441
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:32,360
What are there some other ways you could use this procedure, you know, to count points within a polygon?

442
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,730
That's the basic thing we did with spatial joining.

443
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:41,870
Can you guys think about some ways that might be helpful to the work you're doing for your final project or otherwise?

444
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:52,889
Yeah, I was thinking about for a project like Team Graphics and also like access to abortion clinics or open clinics.

445
01:01:52,890 --> 01:02:04,410
I'm thinking about like the data about location of like a particular abortion or family planning clinics and etc. presenting that.

446
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:09,700
That could be interesting. Yeah, absolutely.

447
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:12,760
So you have addresses for your phone planning clinics.

448
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:20,860
You can gioco those addresses. You can do the full address if you have the street name as well and the building number.

449
01:02:21,980 --> 01:02:28,530
Uh, and then you could count the number of clinics within a geographic boundary.

450
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:32,860
Could be census tracts even. So it doesn't have to be zip codes.

451
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:40,990
And you can get information about the variation in family planning clinics across the U.S., Texas.

452
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:51,160
Right. And then map that next to your fertility or teen pregnancy or whatever outcome variable you're interested in.

453
01:02:52,660 --> 01:03:14,140
Exactly. How about some other applications? No no ideas at the moment.

454
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:18,530
That's okay. I mean, there are many applications to this kind of stuff.

455
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:30,230
The one is you saw this paper for class, right? This was looking at the location of tobacco retailers near schools and parks.

456
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:40,880
And what they were trying to evaluate is what would happen if you had a ban on selling tobacco within 1000 feet of schools and parks.

457
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:44,780
So they counted the number of points,

458
01:03:45,950 --> 01:03:51,409
which are the retailers within a buffer zone around schools and parks to

459
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:56,090
estimate the number of retailers that would disappear if such a law was passed.

460
01:03:58,370 --> 01:04:04,880
This type of work can be looked at to measure the concept of density of something, the density of a point variable.

461
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:16,010
We've used it for work on tobacco retailers as well, where we counted the number of retailers near schools to get a density measure,

462
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:23,900
a retailer access tobacco retailer X or near school and see if that's associated with tobacco use in kids.

463
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:26,890
So there are many applications like that.

464
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:37,010
You can do this work with food deserts or areas of low access to food, fruit stores like grocery stores or farmer's markets.

465
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:45,980
And those usually have an address associated with them. And you can count the number of food outlets within a specific geographic field.

466
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:49,550
So there's many different ways you can use this type of information.

467
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:56,270
All right. So let's do the next activity, which is number 26.

468
01:04:58,770 --> 01:05:05,110
Well, let's look at the hospitals. So we have hospital addresses.

469
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:13,040
So this specific hospital that wants to build a new clinic site has competitor hospitals in the tri state area.

470
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:18,470
So it wants to see where the competitive hospitals are because you can't you maybe don't want to build a clinic,

471
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:22,520
a new clinic next to an existing hospital or another clinic.

472
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:25,280
Right. So that would give us information of where you'd be.

473
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:37,130
We don't want to put new clinic, so let's go code add hospitals in Allegheny County specifically, not in the whole Tri-State area.

474
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:42,400
So again, keep working with this clinic site for file.

475
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:47,900
Let's add data to it. Let's look at the streets.

476
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:57,980
I'm going to turn off this layer that we just created, go to catalog window and go to folders.

477
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:05,120
The clinic site, there should be a geo database called site selection.

478
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:11,090
And in there there should be a feature class called Streets.

479
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:21,440
So you can add that feature class to the current map and drag it over where you can right click on it and go add to it.

480
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:30,770
So you see this dense, kind of greenish area that just popped up if that happened, because there are a bunch of streets there.

481
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:34,850
So there are those are all the streets in Allegheny County.

482
01:06:43,330 --> 01:06:48,130
Now these streets. Data.

483
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:55,180
Let's look at the street there. Just right click on the street layer,

484
01:06:55,450 --> 01:07:08,020
go to attribute table and just get an idea about what type of information the address locator uses to try to pinpoint a specific address onto a map.

485
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:16,060
So, you know, these are information of the length of the street segment.

486
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:24,340
I think what's important is this type of data from address left to address left.

487
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:30,400
So that street segment, you have the street address numbers, the range.

488
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:39,820
This is the even side and this is from in to address on the right hand side of the street, the range on the odd side.

489
01:07:40,420 --> 01:07:44,410
Then you have a zip code number.

490
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:52,150
Okay. So this is kind of the information it will use to try to pinpoint where the specific address is.

491
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:57,550
So let's geo code addresses for the hospitals next.

492
01:07:57,850 --> 01:08:03,790
Okay. You can turn off the street layer. We don't need it. It's just a visual to help you see what's going on.

493
01:08:04,300 --> 01:08:09,080
Go back to catalog and let's look at hospitals.

494
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:13,150
There's a table called hospitals. You can add that to the current map.

495
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:18,100
The bottom you'll see the hospitals table, right click on it and open it.

496
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:25,570
And you can see that about 20 hospitals, you can have the street address and you have a zip code,

497
01:08:26,050 --> 01:08:30,220
you have bed count, and we have the name of those hospitals.

498
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:37,270
So let's gioco that same procedure. Right click on the hospital's QR code table.

499
01:08:39,790 --> 01:08:47,500
You can skip this tool, just this whole step by step tutorial for guide and just go go to tool.

500
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:58,210
Okay, so the input table is hospitals, input locator is the is read our world your code service.

501
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:03,340
Now this time we have more than one field for address information.

502
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:07,700
You have two fields. The first is the address, right?

503
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:20,660
And the second is the zip code. And what it will do is it will output a new feature class called Hospital Gioco.

504
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:30,440
I want to make sure that it's in the right spot. It's going to the default your database.

505
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:40,820
Let's change that. We should go to our GIO database in for this specific project.

506
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:51,080
So go to your C Drive lab folder projects the next site site selection open.

507
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:55,100
Okay. And say okay.

508
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:01,250
So add output to map after completion. So it'll put it on this map.

509
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:04,430
You say that? Sure. Yeah.

510
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:16,920
The output is going to a default location, so change that to our specific project folder.

511
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:20,540
So click on the folder icon.

512
01:10:21,830 --> 01:10:31,070
I went to the C drive HP 66 lab projects.

513
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:37,560
The next site. Site selection.

514
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:45,760
GB And there's also already a hospital geo coded in there, which is something I guess I did at home.

515
01:10:46,440 --> 01:10:50,550
So you can just add your name to the end of this. So it's different.

516
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:54,870
That's why there's a little exclamation point here as being something is wrong.

517
01:10:56,130 --> 01:11:05,940
That exclamation point should go away now. Preferred location type it is address, location, output field.

518
01:11:06,030 --> 01:11:11,820
You want all of these fields in the new feature class says country all.

519
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:16,950
Let's not do that. Let's just do United States and category.

520
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:23,490
This time we put address because we have the full address and then you push run.

521
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:34,620
Okay, so it said it was able to match 1990 5% of the 21 was unmanaged.

522
01:11:35,130 --> 01:11:38,860
So let's take a look at what happened. Push.

523
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:48,360
Yes. You want to check the rematch process and it zooms to the one that was not matched properly.

524
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:56,570
And I think it's. Okay.

525
01:11:58,440 --> 01:12:02,550
So I think what's going on, this is the information that's in the data in the table.

526
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:15,329
Okay. So there is a theme of of road, Delafield Road, but there is no actual street number, address number for that specific address.

527
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:26,070
You can scroll down to it, just find it. If you look at the status phone that tells you is matched to unmatched here, here's the unmatched one.

528
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:31,470
And if you go over to the right, this was the original data.

529
01:12:35,810 --> 01:12:43,070
Right here, Veterans Affairs, Pittsburgh, there is that address, but it doesn't have a street number.

530
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:49,130
So what you could do is go find the actual address for it, type it in and run this procedure again.

531
01:12:49,670 --> 01:12:55,250
But today, we're not going to worry about that. So.

532
01:12:59,190 --> 01:13:06,640
So these points here that were produced. The location of each of those hospitals.

533
01:13:08,480 --> 01:13:15,420
Okay. Okay.

534
01:13:15,420 --> 01:13:19,410
So you've created a new layer for the hospitals.

535
01:13:20,280 --> 01:13:25,859
Continue on. So you may find other types of point data out there which are not address data.

536
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:37,270
I think. I think the one was working with, uh, crime data, write police violence information, and there was that long information in a tabular form.

537
01:13:37,290 --> 01:13:46,060
So how do you get that onto a map? So sometimes you are across that type of information that you want to display on a map.

538
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:49,740
So let's do that analogous activity.

539
01:13:50,700 --> 01:13:53,160
So you're trying to put the satellite clinic.

540
01:13:54,120 --> 01:14:01,800
The scenario is, well, you can put clinics at schools or near schools to give them better access to youth populations.

541
01:14:02,550 --> 01:14:11,940
So this is the high school considering doing that. So in order to kind of get a handle on the schools relative to everything else that we've mapped,

542
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:16,740
they have a table of all the schools in Pennsylvania.

543
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:22,380
So we're going to look at the table of data for schools.

544
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:29,970
So here's a p a schools table in the site selection your database.

545
01:14:30,150 --> 01:14:36,210
So you can right click that and add to the current map.

546
01:14:39,590 --> 01:14:45,680
I'm going to just deselect the other point. And so you have a p schools at the bottom.

547
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:52,130
Let's take a look at that table again. So you notice there's a name of the school.

548
01:14:52,370 --> 01:14:59,660
There's some FIPS code associated with the school. And then there are just the left line data for each school.

549
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:03,380
All right. So super easy to display this information.

550
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:09,350
Right click on it. Did I skip a step somewhere?

551
01:15:23,990 --> 01:15:27,290
No. All right, so let's click on the table.

552
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:31,340
And above Gioco table is something called display x, y data.

553
01:15:32,690 --> 01:15:38,350
So click on that and it should create a full open window.

554
01:15:38,950 --> 01:15:48,379
But Display X, Y Data Input Table is a school's output feature class.

555
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:55,190
It automatically names it and I think it puts it in the site selection view database,

556
01:15:55,190 --> 01:16:02,930
which is good in longitude and latitude, and that's what coordinates system D want to use.

557
01:16:03,710 --> 01:16:06,800
We should use a core system that's in the current map.

558
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:10,730
Okay. So it will default with that one.

559
01:16:11,030 --> 01:16:19,129
So this map is in the North American 1983 data push.

560
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:28,710
Okay. You take a few seconds and now you have all the schools in Pennsylvania.

561
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:34,820
Okay. All right.

562
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:40,020
So it's easy to display x y data in.

563
01:16:43,860 --> 01:17:01,050
And so you should have you know, this is the system check our geo database to make sure you have this variable pay schools x y.

564
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:07,270
You probably have to refresh it right click refresh.

565
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:27,560
Right here this piece goes underscore table two point.

566
01:17:28,740 --> 01:17:31,830
Is that the right one? That is not the right one. Where is this located?

567
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:46,130
It. Put it in the default video database. Okay. Which is all right.

568
01:17:46,310 --> 01:17:56,030
It's still there. We just put it in the wrong spot. There it is.

569
01:17:56,030 --> 01:18:01,670
This one. This is an old one, which I should have deleted. I created it at home just to make sure everything works.

570
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:07,069
But there we have it displayed in that long data.

571
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:12,920
So let's do an exercise. Okay. So this is going to try to bring in all the stuff we've kind of covered so far.

572
01:18:14,450 --> 01:18:23,180
So the next slide is an exercise slide. Imagine you work as a project director for the Pennsylvania Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan.

573
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:31,880
If you're meeting your breast cancer advisory group soon to discuss geographic coverage of mammography, mammography clinics in the state,

574
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:43,040
the group is interested in identifying areas where breast cancer screening eligible women live that are inadequately covered by mammography services.

575
01:18:43,550 --> 01:18:51,290
Using the following data, use the following data to create a map to disk that you could use in the discussion with the advisory board.

576
01:18:52,520 --> 01:19:08,209
Okay. So the idea here is you want to map out Pennsylvania mammography clinics, you can map out the county polygons.

577
01:19:08,210 --> 01:19:12,350
The zip codes are available as well.

578
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:16,580
And in that zip code file, the zip codes file.

579
01:19:16,790 --> 01:19:21,950
There's data on women who are 40 to 70 years of age.

580
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:26,210
So the last two bullets gives you some guidance on what to do.

581
01:19:26,240 --> 01:19:32,629
Use the procedures we learned today about geocoding zip codes and using spatial

582
01:19:32,630 --> 01:19:36,830
joints to count points within polygons to help you complete this exercise.

583
01:19:37,550 --> 01:19:41,210
Are there obvious areas of the state where mammography clinics are needed?

584
01:19:42,770 --> 01:19:45,919
So see if you can sort that out. Get started.

585
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:53,150
You could even start a whole new project that's called Mammography Clinic 51.

586
01:19:53,760 --> 01:19:58,160
Okay, so you can just save this word, close it out.

587
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:02,640
And I've given you locations of all the data, right?

588
01:20:02,660 --> 01:20:09,980
Some of the data is in the site selection database and some of the data are in the United States geo database.

589
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:17,240
Okay. So go to those two places to find the information and if.

590
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:31,590
After we do this activity, I think we'll be taking a break.

591
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:59,130
Yep. Certainly.

592
01:21:29,430 --> 01:21:40,340
Because. It's like.

593
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:45,020
You. The.

594
01:22:58,190 --> 01:23:24,140
Know. There is a slight mistake in the exercise versus the site selection geode database.

595
01:23:24,170 --> 01:23:29,130
It says it's under data for the center project's clinic site.

596
01:23:29,310 --> 01:23:32,550
So what I did to get to.

597
01:23:42,510 --> 01:23:54,360
The fact that these are the Pennsylvania killing where that's in each community, 66 lab data from the United States to your database.

598
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:58,860
Okay. So these are the counties.

599
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:03,900
Okay. Okay. Here are the zip codes, which are right there.

600
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:11,250
So you can have those. But there is no site selection for your database in the data folder.

601
01:24:12,330 --> 01:24:16,510
It's in the projects folder under clinic sites.

602
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:24,670
So site selection here, database. And here we have paid clinics pasted to table so we can see.

603
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:29,870
All right. So slight mistake. No.

604
01:24:30,150 --> 01:24:35,250
So you just need these three files to do the work.

605
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:44,030
It's probably just. So.

606
01:25:18,810 --> 01:26:01,220
And it was. She?

607
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:34,210
Think. Yes.

608
01:26:39,750 --> 01:26:47,570
Contents. Please make. And.

609
01:26:57,170 --> 01:27:12,850
In a speech. That.

610
01:27:29,630 --> 01:27:35,920
There's like there's this whole area where there's some.

611
01:27:56,330 --> 01:28:02,990
Is that even though this controversy has only recently revealed that it is going to.

612
01:28:08,470 --> 01:28:12,870
I don't hear people having a getting started.

613
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:19,470
You know how to start stuff anywhere. You doing okay?

614
01:28:21,340 --> 01:28:25,200
I'm good. If you need help, just raise your hand. That's totally okay.

615
01:28:30,390 --> 01:28:34,920
How would you like to say that?

616
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:57,970
Oh. I mean, honestly, I know she's hiding it because.

617
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:10,780
Patients are easier to discover more.

618
01:29:29,450 --> 01:29:34,930
Okay? Yeah. A hand up.

619
01:29:34,940 --> 01:29:38,680
Okay. The consensus.

620
01:29:44,070 --> 01:29:49,400
And so I'm over here. I did all that I needed to.

621
01:29:50,410 --> 01:29:57,390
I thought extraordinary. I suppose the pay comes from the schools.

622
01:29:58,590 --> 01:30:04,080
But then I don't think anything anywhere.

623
01:30:06,090 --> 01:30:10,020
Basically, you have to make a decision.

624
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:16,110
So you never know. It's like nothing else doing is.

625
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:26,440
It could just be there. I just. I just. You have to be able to show us which ones.

626
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,430
Seven, nine, seven, seven, seven.

627
01:30:32,460 --> 01:30:42,000
Okay. And then so you can map out the screen and there is a level.

628
01:30:42,330 --> 01:30:48,510
Right. You can also map areas just for me here.

629
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:55,510
So if I went to any of the high schools when interviewing with clinics.

630
01:30:56,060 --> 01:31:02,750
Oh, okay. So I guess we would be looking at places where people are, but I don't think.

631
01:31:05,020 --> 01:31:10,030
Okay. Excuse me.

632
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:18,770
Specialist. So I guess on the one hand, the yellow counties.

633
01:31:21,790 --> 01:31:32,680
So you need to include a few countries on the table for this week unless see what is the main figure.

634
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:37,120
That's all you have this room like normal business with another man.

635
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:51,370
Did you spend Ukrainian data on a map and the world in this table.

636
01:31:55,920 --> 01:32:04,750
You are going to be called what it is to be voted upon and this is going x will see this church.

637
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:09,809
Why is this automatically always going to popular?

638
01:32:09,810 --> 01:32:19,540
Just the one year unless you have a year to subscribe to things like the defender of the law doesn't want to deal with.

639
01:32:20,710 --> 01:32:23,780
Is it for me?

640
01:32:24,050 --> 01:32:29,490
Is that okay? So you want to just change that one way.

641
01:32:29,640 --> 01:32:32,640
So that is not helpful.

642
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:36,710
Thank you. Yes. No, we're just not. Yeah, we're calling.

643
01:32:43,240 --> 01:32:55,930
You're doing it good. So once you get those going, don't let the V.A. just put you through the first step you should do.

644
01:32:55,930 --> 01:33:00,140
Is you the clinics, right?

645
01:33:00,970 --> 01:33:07,180
The second step you should do is count the number of clinics per zip code so they

646
01:33:07,180 --> 01:33:11,650
can you get a spatial variation of clinics across all the zip codes in Pennsylvania.

647
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:21,040
And then what I did, that's what I'm at. The next step is you can create a corporate map of the health variable.

648
01:33:21,340 --> 01:33:25,810
Okay. So there's only the variable goes from 0 to 5.

649
01:33:25,930 --> 01:33:33,700
So most counties have zero clinics and some one county up county zip code.

650
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:39,700
Most zip codes have zero clinics and one zip code has five clinics.

651
01:33:40,510 --> 01:33:45,010
So can create an equal interval map.

652
01:33:45,490 --> 01:33:51,220
Right. So actually, you probably want not even that.

653
01:33:55,130 --> 01:34:01,900
Natural breaks looks like a good one because it separates out the zero clinic's five classes.

654
01:34:01,910 --> 01:34:05,630
Right? You can turn that symbol into a clear symbol.

655
01:34:09,820 --> 01:34:14,380
So the zero zip codes with zero clinics are just clear.

656
01:34:16,430 --> 01:34:27,670
Okay. So now this gives you kind of a variation of all the zip codes in relation to clinics.

657
01:34:29,560 --> 01:34:35,110
Is the next step as well? Where are the women who are screening eligible located?

658
01:34:35,950 --> 01:34:39,160
What's the variability for that?

659
01:34:39,870 --> 01:34:46,970
Right. So the next you could do is you can that information is in both of these layers.

660
01:34:46,990 --> 01:34:57,700
You can symbolize this layer. It's probably good to insert a new map, actually.

661
01:34:59,080 --> 01:35:02,080
Okay. And you can.

662
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:10,120
At the end.

663
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:23,420
The PR zips later here.

664
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:35,570
And you can then symbolize if you look at this layer of data, there is a variable here called T Finn, 40 to 70.

665
01:35:36,380 --> 01:35:39,710
So those are total number of females that are 40 to 70.

666
01:35:40,610 --> 01:35:46,610
And then this is the total population, the total female population.

667
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:54,170
It's probably just good to map out the count because, you know, in this case, the rate is not important.

668
01:35:55,220 --> 01:36:00,710
You want to know how many of the of the potential patients are there out there.

669
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:04,160
So you can just symbolize that variable.

670
01:36:13,310 --> 01:36:17,690
There are multiple ways to address this issue. But you can. This is one way.

671
01:36:22,850 --> 01:36:29,780
It's not unique values. Sorry you weren't graduated colors.

672
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:39,660
This variable, looking at the distribution, it's very skewed.

673
01:36:43,500 --> 01:37:09,240
Quarantine breaks might be okay. And the coverage.

674
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:18,660
Because I think it's probably too many categories.

675
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:31,700
I mean, just do it into low, middle, high. Okay.

676
01:37:32,840 --> 01:37:44,280
So this map shows you where the. Looks like there's a high concentration of eligible patients in in the red area.

677
01:37:44,300 --> 01:37:52,670
That's right. And this map shows you where the concentration of clinics are.

678
01:37:53,930 --> 01:38:00,350
I think it probably would have been better actually to symbolize on the same.

679
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:10,860
Map using a graduated symbols.

680
01:38:12,530 --> 01:38:40,960
Approach. Sure that doesn't look too nice, but.

681
01:38:45,860 --> 01:38:49,490
I think you have to change the probably the size of the symbol.

682
01:38:55,920 --> 01:39:19,910
Because we are. This may give you a little better idea.

683
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:29,950
I would probably do it the opposite way, to be honest.

684
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:41,380
Make the color scheme be the female 40 to 74 years of age in the graduate, in symbols, the clinics,

685
01:39:42,730 --> 01:39:51,520
and then see if there are any red areas that have small circles or no circles at all.

686
01:39:52,090 --> 01:39:55,960
You can switch that around a little. Usually let's do that and then we'll start.

687
01:41:03,950 --> 01:41:37,550
You need this. A little better, but not that great.

688
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:17,710
All right. So in a way, this is not you get to play around with it, I guess, a little bit, but I guess you would want to see if there are any.

689
01:42:18,460 --> 01:42:27,790
There are some red zip codes here which indicate a high proportion or high number of eligible women for mammography screening.

690
01:42:28,420 --> 01:42:35,820
And they have very small circles indicating a low number of clinic sites.

691
01:42:36,130 --> 01:42:47,170
Right. So those might be potential counties that you would want to go to to create mammography clinics.

692
01:42:47,190 --> 01:42:51,610
Another way to try to approach it is create a bivariate map, right?

693
01:42:51,610 --> 01:43:01,690
So you can have one variable would be the number of clinic sites and the other variable would be eligible women and low clinic sites.

694
01:43:01,960 --> 01:43:09,910
High number of eligible women would be the counties that you would target for potential places where you may want to open.

695
01:43:09,910 --> 01:43:14,290
Mama would be screening services. All right.

696
01:43:17,730 --> 01:43:26,460
Look questions did you guys get through the actual doing the geocoding and counting exercise at least?

697
01:43:27,330 --> 01:43:30,540
Okay. All right. Very good. Let's take a break.

698
01:43:31,350 --> 01:43:39,390
It's 415. Let's take a break until 425, and then we will have our student led discussions.

699
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:52,380
I thinking about you in my flat?

700
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:57,240
If you look cool, let's see if you like this. Don't give me that.

701
01:43:59,250 --> 01:44:04,880
All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

702
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:21,440
It's the season. Right outside my door outside of it.

703
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:25,980
Well, no, I wasn't. I was getting worried.

704
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:29,590
And that would be the south of I.

705
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:48,350
Well. But this whole time you have of those things like three members who could probably not have heard.

706
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:08,210
Yeah, I really like the services and we are seeing, but I wonder if they really did anything interesting to you.

707
01:45:09,550 --> 01:45:14,810
Well, I guess interestingly, because I suppose I is greater than one.

708
01:45:14,820 --> 01:45:21,720
So it just like I can put 30 and it's still the same. So I mean so I guess I mean that would mean so this.

709
01:45:21,840 --> 01:45:25,690
Right, so that's not what I wanted to do actually. I wanted to be categorized.

710
01:45:25,830 --> 01:45:32,730
But did you do the middle section? So just to.

711
01:45:36,100 --> 01:45:39,810
Like greater than or equal to.

712
01:45:40,870 --> 01:45:55,710
I know this is a question. We just came from one.

713
01:45:59,630 --> 01:46:08,300
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. I thought in our project, final project for some into this, we're only putting questions.

714
01:46:08,730 --> 01:46:14,190
That's correct. Can we just pull, like, a few lines up as to how to put anything up?

715
01:46:14,610 --> 01:46:19,889
Because she asks so many questions. I'm like, I thought we were just putting like two or three questions.

716
01:46:19,890 --> 01:46:23,660
Let's take a look just to make sure. Because I forget all the time to.

717
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:32,870
Yeah. But now you've got your questions to your question.

718
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:38,170
So patients should be here. I guess you could only put a question.

719
01:46:38,170 --> 01:46:41,889
You don't even need a rational. Right? Okay. Yeah. Okay.

720
01:46:41,890 --> 01:46:52,360
So can two like this in 3 to 5 potential questions or maybe like modify it while we're like working on

721
01:46:52,360 --> 01:46:59,230
it or it's a draft and you just it's usually you can have questions that build on top of each other.

722
01:46:59,290 --> 01:47:03,850
Okay. Thank you. Incredible.

723
01:47:04,190 --> 01:47:19,940
Yeah. This is. It divides him so that for the.

724
01:47:22,110 --> 01:47:28,250
Oh, I think I'll start with this.

725
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:32,100
Oh, really? That's why I thought I was missing.

726
01:47:33,210 --> 01:47:47,250
So I was like, this is going to. Okay.

727
01:48:01,470 --> 01:48:13,660
So. Right.

728
01:48:16,750 --> 01:48:27,610
And it's a great day for you. And I think going back I had a shower, so I probably just like threw in our business.

729
01:48:27,940 --> 01:48:40,690
Right now, no one be six months back and I know when I leave during what it's like to get on, you know, it's how it will flow.

730
01:48:40,690 --> 01:48:47,830
But then once you let people getting up until, you know, it's with, okay, you take them for life.

731
01:48:48,280 --> 01:48:53,030
Oh, yeah. I don't know. I think your children.

732
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:58,930
No, I'm not getting ready for that.

733
01:48:58,930 --> 01:49:06,879
Sorry. Because then I think I didn't feel like halfway through it's that it's all going into this new agreement.

734
01:49:06,880 --> 01:49:10,620
That was other idea. And then I was like, whoa, this is like right next to it.

735
01:49:10,830 --> 01:49:22,069
So some elements of this like the exit of at like 10 minutes and I'm like, this is where it will be like helping people have a while.

736
01:49:22,070 --> 01:49:25,550
But be like I said, I'm just like, what? I would have been great, like the right way.

737
01:49:26,110 --> 01:49:32,680
Do you hear that? Yeah. I mean, the distances are a lot more business.

738
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:36,750
I but with the AP was like the same thing.

739
01:49:36,800 --> 01:49:45,700
I was just like, oh, well, I missed that. And I didn't realize it was doing that and sound like I paid attention to sort of take the story here.

740
01:49:45,700 --> 01:49:49,230
And I had no labels.

741
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:58,030
So what is true is that like I'll be in places if my full length, but if I exit out of my like thing to like reload.

742
01:49:58,030 --> 01:50:02,370
And I was actually just stayed in Virginia one state another like and lose it.

743
01:50:02,800 --> 01:50:09,970
Yeah service and I'm just like well I guess I can't lose because I've done that before.

744
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:25,990
So what do you do to like I wonder if you do like I think it was your last good, you know, like your only period and you still think it's cool.

745
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:30,130
Hopeless. He was instantly like, smell.

746
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:41,110
I feel like I need say what I needed for like I'm just like I'm away from of course these are just like,

747
01:50:41,110 --> 01:50:46,239
you know, like you have to get some opportunities that's like essential.

748
01:50:46,240 --> 01:51:04,000
But one time a lot of work obviously because like I was like, I need to be like it's my first, I go to good etc. So yeah, I.

749
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,510
It will be sort of like.

750
01:51:10,850 --> 01:51:14,510
You. Yeah.

751
01:51:16,020 --> 01:51:19,530
Thank you. I got the video. So got one.

752
01:51:26,340 --> 01:51:33,990
You can always ask, I think, if you just put it in a different light because I feel like you are human.

753
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:49,640
Yeah, I do like that because it is just any further and further increases in the person that you were putting into.

754
01:51:49,650 --> 01:51:57,090
Because I feel something something that occurred to me from those activities that I might require us to do.

755
01:51:58,200 --> 01:52:07,120
What are your thoughts on like a statistical thing seizure associated from a place so far, people with a pregnancy?

756
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:14,190
I think those are like kind of what we're talking about because another yeah,

757
01:52:15,060 --> 01:52:24,170
I also have a creative writing group and I think I was thinking probably because

758
01:52:24,480 --> 01:52:34,260
like emergency department is the one because more people with a lower income.

759
01:52:34,500 --> 01:52:34,709
Yeah.

760
01:52:34,710 --> 01:52:43,590
Companies that do look at like how they should have were willing to tell us like how long they stay like versus paid visits are much more concrete.

761
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:53,370
Yeah. Like there were a couple from California side here, but they also have that like they're great grandparents, right?

762
01:52:54,690 --> 01:52:58,980
So they have like those people.

763
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:05,420
So because if you compare like. For the whole time.

764
01:53:05,810 --> 01:53:09,800
It was like nothing.

765
01:53:10,550 --> 01:53:21,460
I don't know. You know me, you know, to make an account good enough for mother and daughter.

766
01:53:23,490 --> 01:53:34,940
Yeah, but it's like, you know, I downloaded the best time, and it looked like my dad, you know?

767
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:38,000
So maybe I'm surprised that this is, like.

768
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:53,160
This is. Yeah. I mean, like all three in the last few days.

769
01:53:56,860 --> 01:54:19,710
I think that kind of opened like I think she said, you know, like just like I should be able to use like I like this, you know,

770
01:54:20,100 --> 01:54:34,040
like I think like it's like, you know, like one, like my brother is in the newspapers and there's another somebody and one.

771
01:54:35,530 --> 01:54:41,750
The man of my. Yes. I'm just going to say I'd like to thank you.

772
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:45,840
I really feel like I could spread the perimeter of the backyard.

773
01:54:45,920 --> 01:54:52,520
Even then, like you're still having like, I wonder if it's like someone's attracting them to those areas versus,

774
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:56,670
like, where it's not like a wide spread. Yeah. Yeah.

775
01:54:57,800 --> 01:55:03,490
Well, it's just that what I know is really.

776
01:55:04,340 --> 01:55:17,450
It's a cover. Yeah, actually, no, I wouldn't put it like that.

777
01:55:18,260 --> 01:55:23,780
Yeah. And it became the only thing I ever the beginning of a story.

778
01:55:23,800 --> 01:55:33,560
Like, I'm like, all right, let's get started with the student presentation.

779
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:37,730
Caroline is first and then Hannah, then Sicily.

780
01:55:37,790 --> 01:55:42,680
So, Caroline, whenever you're ready, please come and start.

781
01:55:45,170 --> 01:55:53,750
Anyway. It's really good.

782
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:22,670
Up there. Okay.

783
01:56:24,110 --> 01:56:27,550
Hello, everyone. I'm Caroline. Hi.

784
01:56:27,560 --> 01:56:34,160
The paper on spatial distribution of underweight, overweight and obesity among women and children.

785
01:56:35,630 --> 01:56:41,450
And this was specifically in Uganda because they were using the DHS survey from 2011 in Uganda.

786
01:56:41,870 --> 01:56:48,739
So a survey that we've kind of taken a look at in the past few weeks, so a little outline about will be doing.

787
01:56:48,740 --> 01:56:54,649
I'll just talk about kind of the background of the survey. Why was the study conducted, why they chose the population?

788
01:56:54,650 --> 01:57:05,390
They did the data a little bit more about the spatial analysis, their findings, and then some strengths, weaknesses and main takeaways.

789
01:57:07,550 --> 01:57:19,580
So kind of a little bit of background about this study for many developing countries as they undergo economic changes and nutrition transitions,

790
01:57:19,580 --> 01:57:27,570
this public health paradox emerges, which is the coexistence of undernutrition and overnutrition at the same time.

791
01:57:29,240 --> 01:57:35,330
And this is also associated with rises in chronic disease that are associated with obesity.

792
01:57:36,050 --> 01:57:47,330
So diabetes and hypertension, they chose kind of this area in sub-Saharan Africa because which is anything like south of the Sahara Desert,

793
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:54,049
because there are some significant increases in obesity between 1992 and 2005,

794
01:57:54,050 --> 01:58:02,300
as well as increases in hypertension, which actually quadrupled from 2000 5008.

795
01:58:03,530 --> 01:58:12,980
An overall prevalence of 16.2%. And then another kind of interesting thing to think about in the context of our G.I.s in making maps,

796
01:58:13,640 --> 01:58:18,200
there is a lot of variation by region when it came to diabetes prevalence.

797
01:58:19,730 --> 01:58:26,330
So this regional variation kind of points to a need for a more nuanced spatial perspective on kind of what's going on.

798
01:58:27,140 --> 01:58:36,260
So that's kind of what led them to create this study. Yeah, so kind of just the need for more maps.

799
01:58:36,270 --> 01:58:43,159
Most they were finding that most of the spatial clustering and diet disease techniques that

800
01:58:43,160 --> 01:58:48,920
they wanted to use were kind of limited to developing countries or developed countries.

801
01:58:50,390 --> 01:58:57,830
So they wanted to address this gap and also kind of look at these sociodemographic risk factors,

802
01:58:57,830 --> 01:59:04,790
including age, marital status, education, income, and whether someone lived in a rural or urban area.

803
01:59:05,630 --> 01:59:14,630
And then they chose Uganda because they found that it was nationally representative of kind of the whole area.

804
01:59:15,230 --> 01:59:19,670
It has a very diverse population.

805
01:59:20,750 --> 01:59:31,670
And as I said before, they use this DHS publicly available data and it's population based surveys that provide indicators of demographics,

806
01:59:31,670 --> 01:59:32,840
health and nutrition.

807
01:59:33,110 --> 01:59:39,110
And they were focusing on targeting women because they found that that was kind of the population where this was more emerging to be a problem,

808
01:59:39,110 --> 01:59:46,400
but kind of discussed that later in the weaknesses. Moving forward, they might be interested to look at trends with men as well.

809
01:59:47,720 --> 01:59:58,940
Yeah. Yeah. So moving along to kind of their spatial analysis techniques, they performed at the cluster level.

810
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:06,200
So each cluster composed of an average of 5 to 10 households looking at women and children.

811
02:00:08,180 --> 02:00:19,220
The areas with the data DHS survey sample clusters, they didn't necessarily overlap with like the administrative boundaries of those areas.

812
02:00:20,270 --> 02:00:30,139
So this is a little bit confusing to me, but I think what I gathered was at times they had to like use GPS,

813
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:35,600
coordinate readings at like the nearest town or community center and kind of

814
02:00:35,600 --> 02:00:40,010
artificially designate areas rather than like using those administrative borders.

815
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:46,280
Yeah. And then to this is really interesting, this,

816
02:00:46,280 --> 02:00:54,890
this idea of zone of indifference to kind of prevent exclusion of local factors by imposing really sharp boundaries.

817
02:00:55,130 --> 02:01:01,130
Because they are looking at like, are there hot spots or cold spots of underweight, overweight obesity?

818
02:01:02,840 --> 02:01:08,450
They allowed for kind of this zone where there weren't as harsh of boundaries.

819
02:01:08,870 --> 02:01:15,010
So if, for example, like a hotspot is forming and there are, you know,

820
02:01:15,020 --> 02:01:21,320
folks who would fall within that hotspot that aren't necessarily in that zone, that could be included in that kind of.

821
02:01:21,800 --> 02:01:26,730
Difference. So, yeah, I had a quick question about this.

822
02:01:27,150 --> 02:01:32,670
Are there other instances that you can think of where maybe you're mapping a health issue

823
02:01:32,670 --> 02:01:36,810
and you think that using this same concept of a zone of indifference could be useful?

824
02:01:37,320 --> 02:01:45,540
Or on the flip side, are there instances where you think it is necessary to have really sharp cut offs?

825
02:01:46,870 --> 02:02:00,020
Her boundaries. Maybe I can clarify a little bit because I think we haven't covered the cluster analysis piece yet.

826
02:02:01,760 --> 02:02:06,350
So when you do cluster analysis, part of the computation.

827
02:02:09,050 --> 02:02:19,880
I get settings involved. What other areas do you want to include in the calculation of the cluster?

828
02:02:20,660 --> 02:02:23,890
So let's see. You want to think about a hotspot called Spot.

829
02:02:24,170 --> 02:02:30,680
So when you look at the index polygon and just the polygon surrounding it.

830
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:36,260
So that's called the contiguous polygon city.

831
02:02:37,250 --> 02:02:47,930
The other thing is you can say, well, I want inverse weighting, meaning all polygons in that geographic space are involved in the cluster analysis,

832
02:02:48,470 --> 02:02:54,470
but the ones that are further away have less weighting and sort of a difference as well.

833
02:02:54,560 --> 02:03:03,170
I'm only going to look at the polygons that are within x ft or miles or kilometers away from my index polygon.

834
02:03:03,500 --> 02:03:07,090
In the calculation of clustering. That's what's important.

835
02:03:07,850 --> 02:03:11,540
Everything else is a more so thing in this study.

836
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:21,379
They use this procedure. But you could use many different designations for this relationship and calculate cluster analysis.

837
02:03:21,380 --> 02:03:25,850
And none of it has to be driven conceptually for your research question.

838
02:03:26,540 --> 02:03:33,380
Maybe for infectious disease kinds of modeling, the inverse distance relationship is appropriate.

839
02:03:34,970 --> 02:03:37,790
Maybe if you're thinking about health services only,

840
02:03:38,600 --> 02:03:50,450
maybe you think about people traveling the maximum amount of time that's necessary and not ignore everything else beyond that distance.

841
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:57,140
And most of the default usages are just the contiguous polygons.

842
02:03:57,710 --> 02:04:05,320
So when you make a decision about how you run your cluster analysis, that's one important piece of it.

843
02:04:05,480 --> 02:04:13,190
And I think these guys use this concept of zoning a big difference. Yeah, I was thinking about that in the context of like my,

844
02:04:13,190 --> 02:04:22,249
like what we're thinking about for our like final project and thinking about team births and like access to family planning sites or abortion clinics.

845
02:04:22,250 --> 02:04:29,840
And I think maybe thinking about it in terms of like maximum distance, you could drive and then excluding like a certain area past that.

846
02:04:30,860 --> 02:04:35,330
But yeah, definitely that helps a lot. Clarification. Cool.

847
02:04:36,980 --> 02:04:43,040
Okay. So looking at their results. Not super surprising.

848
02:04:43,370 --> 02:04:48,830
They found that urban residents were more likely to be overweight or obese than rural residents.

849
02:04:50,780 --> 02:04:54,770
Again, overweight was significantly correlated with wealth and education.

850
02:04:55,700 --> 02:05:01,160
And women who are overweight or obese were more likely to have children who experienced that as well.

851
02:05:03,260 --> 02:05:10,339
They were also able to show that being underweight was significantly and negatively associated with being wealthy or ever married.

852
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:13,630
And kind of the converse was do was true for overweight,

853
02:05:13,640 --> 02:05:21,650
so significant in positive association with increased age, high wealth status and residing in an urban area.

854
02:05:22,670 --> 02:05:29,480
So looking at their maps that they created on the left, you can see the percentage of overweight or obese mothers.

855
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:35,120
So this ranges from 0% to 64% in some areas.

856
02:05:36,020 --> 02:05:42,410
So you can see kind of regions in the southwest. We're pretty overrepresented here in this map,

857
02:05:44,240 --> 02:05:54,260
which kind of really is just in line with their findings that these districts included their capital city and like the largest cities in Uganda,

858
02:05:54,260 --> 02:06:03,110
this is what's represented on this map. And kind of the inverse is true on the right map, which shows the percentage of underweight mothers.

859
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:11,870
So it's kind of the reverse of what we see on the overweight map. And the regions are more rural regions or regions with higher poverty.

860
02:06:14,060 --> 02:06:22,880
Then we can take a look at their hotspot analysis, which shows a pretty striking trend.

861
02:06:23,960 --> 02:06:30,830
It may take me a little while to stare at this map and kind of figure out, but I do think once you spend some time with it, it makes sense.

862
02:06:32,690 --> 02:06:39,290
So kind of the entire southern region is facing a pretty significant burden of overweight and obesity.

863
02:06:40,160 --> 02:06:45,590
And then the northern region is suffering from underweight and pretty much all, I think.

864
02:06:46,220 --> 02:06:51,410
But like one of these regions with the highest clustering are in cities.

865
02:06:55,510 --> 02:07:03,850
Yeah. So I found the study really interesting. Just the like content matter they're talking about, but also this new approach.

866
02:07:06,250 --> 02:07:17,200
So some of the strengths, just the I think the examination of demographic and socioeconomic factors was really interesting and they did a good job of

867
02:07:17,200 --> 02:07:26,919
explaining their methodology and I think kind of future uses for a study like this and policy implications some of their weaknesses,

868
02:07:26,920 --> 02:07:30,130
which they didn't address the weaknesses and limitations of the study.

869
02:07:31,060 --> 02:07:39,550
I would have liked to see more data about other or like more discussion about other risk factors associated with obesity.

870
02:07:40,870 --> 02:07:46,270
So what are other risk factors they could have considered?

871
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:02,660
Maybe like exercise physical activity. Yeah, definitely.

872
02:08:04,280 --> 02:08:11,480
Yeah. So they didn't the DHS doesn't include items on health behaviors that are related to obesity risk like exercise.

873
02:08:12,150 --> 02:08:17,110
So they didn't address that, but it would have been interesting to see also more questions.

874
02:08:17,120 --> 02:08:22,610
I know they talk about nutrition, but the study itself didn't really go into diet or nutrition.

875
02:08:23,150 --> 02:08:31,400
I know the DHS survey does ask questions about that. Another weakness is there is a pretty substantial subset of adult women that

876
02:08:31,400 --> 02:08:37,580
were excluded just because they didn't have the like height and weight data,

877
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:43,280
which obviously is necessary. But. And as I mentioned earlier, they didn't include men.

878
02:08:44,210 --> 02:08:48,890
And then another weakness is just the aggregation, which I get why they had to do it that way.

879
02:08:48,890 --> 02:08:56,510
But it's harder to get the point data, obviously, and then implications.

880
02:08:56,900 --> 02:08:58,040
As I said before,

881
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:06,470
it's a good starting point for developing interventions and policies and thinking about where those would need to be implemented in the country,

882
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:11,000
and also not just in Uganda but across the region.

883
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:21,040
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much.

884
02:09:21,760 --> 02:09:25,630
I have to apologize because we're behind in this class a little bit.

885
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:35,540
So you're reading stuff that we haven't covered yet. We will be learning how to compute these statistics in a week or two.

886
02:09:35,560 --> 02:09:39,370
So please bear with me and the speakers.

887
02:09:40,660 --> 02:09:45,670
An excellent job nonetheless. This Hannah.

888
02:09:45,670 --> 02:09:52,980
You are next. To.

889
02:10:07,660 --> 02:10:18,130
Okay. Hello. So the paper I will be reviewing is called towards the development of a gas method for identifying rural food deserts.

890
02:10:20,880 --> 02:10:27,150
And so the purpose of this paper is to develop a new, reproducible method for identifying rural food deserts,

891
02:10:27,510 --> 02:10:31,950
using the location of food retailers and residential units.

892
02:10:32,940 --> 02:10:36,420
And they then applied this new methodology to the state of Vermont.

893
02:10:38,010 --> 02:10:44,880
And this work is significant because the majority of research in this realm of food security has been done with urban spaces in mind.

894
02:10:45,870 --> 02:10:51,480
And as we will see, there are some critical differences between urban and rural spaces that really require

895
02:10:51,510 --> 02:10:57,180
separate methodologies for understanding food security in those different spaces.

896
02:10:57,930 --> 02:11:05,280
Also, up until this point, research has been primarily qualitative in understanding food access and food security.

897
02:11:06,300 --> 02:11:10,770
And that process of interviewing and survey data collection is quite expensive

898
02:11:10,770 --> 02:11:16,000
and time consuming and also pretty difficult to standardize that methodology.

899
02:11:16,020 --> 02:11:25,170
So the researchers here were curious how the use of geographic information systems could approve improve upon previous methodology.

900
02:11:26,160 --> 02:11:34,290
And then finally, just looking at the bigger picture, this work to establish a framework for identifying rural food deserts is really important

901
02:11:34,290 --> 02:11:40,620
to inform land use planning and also like community level health promotion initiatives.

902
02:11:43,810 --> 02:11:53,500
The authors define food deserts as areas of relative exclusion, where people experience physical and economic barriers to accessing healthy foods.

903
02:11:55,030 --> 02:12:02,290
And they refer to three types of access that they believe need to be considered when characterizing food environments.

904
02:12:03,220 --> 02:12:12,520
So the first is information access. And this refers to educational, cultural or social constraints that influence health behavior related to food.

905
02:12:13,570 --> 02:12:22,690
And so this involves thinking about how eating behavior can be influenced by pop culture or gender norms or a bunch of other cultural influences.

906
02:12:24,070 --> 02:12:28,990
Economic access is another important consideration cited by the researchers,

907
02:12:29,890 --> 02:12:36,910
since we know that poverty is generally linked to nutritional deficiencies and there

908
02:12:36,910 --> 02:12:41,200
are other economic considerations sort of within this idea of economic access,

909
02:12:41,200 --> 02:12:44,620
like the price of food or transportation costs.

910
02:12:45,880 --> 02:12:50,590
Finally, physical or geographic access, which is the primary interest of the study,

911
02:12:51,070 --> 02:12:56,410
and we will see how they use geographic information systems to map the distances

912
02:12:56,410 --> 02:13:01,540
from residential units to food retailers following along road networks.

913
02:13:03,460 --> 02:13:11,260
And the authors point out that there's a pretty complicated relationship between these levels of access that are quite difficult to disentangle.

914
02:13:12,430 --> 02:13:20,680
For example, having the knowledge of healthy eating, but not being able to access nutritional foods due to economic or environmental barriers,

915
02:13:22,000 --> 02:13:29,680
or thinking about how even if you live in close proximity to a nutritional food source, that might not be the shop that you can afford.

916
02:13:31,240 --> 02:13:36,370
So the authors explain how these intricate relationships are really what has made

917
02:13:36,370 --> 02:13:40,420
this type of work less straightforward in creating the standardized method.

918
02:13:41,350 --> 02:13:48,460
And also is why most of this work has been qualitative, a sort of the best way to pick up all of these contextual pieces.

919
02:13:50,260 --> 02:13:58,030
So my first question for you all, would you add or modify any of these considerations related to access here?

920
02:14:06,690 --> 02:14:10,320
Yeah. I feel like I don't know quite where.

921
02:14:11,290 --> 02:14:16,000
We like the substantive information since they feel like.

922
02:14:17,390 --> 02:14:21,190
Something you talk about the fundamental areas like flexible resources.

923
02:14:21,820 --> 02:14:27,920
People have access to. Depending on your family, you may have a.

924
02:14:28,280 --> 02:14:34,340
It's a different like fresh sources especially. CSC so far.

925
02:14:36,300 --> 02:14:41,420
So I don't know, like we. Where that. Yeah. Yeah.

926
02:14:41,430 --> 02:14:49,520
That's awesome. That's. Yeah.

927
02:14:51,140 --> 02:14:59,810
Nice. I had a thought about, like, the element of choice as something to consider just how people may not always choose healthy options,

928
02:14:59,810 --> 02:15:03,440
even if, like, information barriers are not at play.

929
02:15:04,340 --> 02:15:14,600
Um. Yeah. So then those three considerations were integrated into this new process for calculating access to food.

930
02:15:14,930 --> 02:15:18,860
And this involved personal accessibility and place accessibility.

931
02:15:19,340 --> 02:15:22,640
And this is sort of like the bird's eye view of their methodology.

932
02:15:23,030 --> 02:15:34,040
And then we'll really zoom in next. But personal accessibility is point data that contains attribute information related to individual circumstances.

933
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:39,770
So these are the kind of details you would see in an attribute table like what we were working with earlier today,

934
02:15:40,130 --> 02:15:47,690
like average education level or diet quality and place accessibility describes placing a buffer

935
02:15:47,690 --> 02:15:53,360
around a food retailer to determine its service area as a way of describing food access.

936
02:15:54,440 --> 02:15:57,740
And that's called a zone based aggregate spatial framework.

937
02:15:58,910 --> 02:16:04,460
And we saw that in another paper we read about the tobacco retailers and schools.

938
02:16:05,810 --> 02:16:14,570
So previous urban food Desert Research has used a buffer of 500 meters or a 5 to 7 minute walk.

939
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:18,890
But when thinking about rural spaces, that isn't really an appropriate metric,

940
02:16:19,190 --> 02:16:27,379
since people generally live farther than that distance from a food retailer and auto dependency is more prevalent,

941
02:16:27,380 --> 02:16:30,530
which is just a reliance on driving to get around versus walking.

942
02:16:31,010 --> 02:16:36,140
So for this new approach, they used a ten mile buffer to encircle healthy food environments.

943
02:16:37,340 --> 02:16:47,210
And the study also measures distance along road networks versus as the crow flies, which is really only possible if you have a GIS tool.

944
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:53,540
I don't know if you think about measuring the shortest distance from point A to point B along street networks by hand.

945
02:16:53,780 --> 02:16:59,870
That's a really tedious process. So having this geo processing tool that can do that for you is pretty cool.

946
02:17:02,300 --> 02:17:09,350
So this new methodology was applied to the state of Vermont, where 21% of the land is dedicated to farms.

947
02:17:09,350 --> 02:17:13,579
So quite rural and the mean per capita income is quite low.

948
02:17:13,580 --> 02:17:27,290
It was about 20,000 per year. So they first plotted the location of food retailers, which they defined as grocery stores larger than 2500 square feet.

949
02:17:27,290 --> 02:17:33,710
So like big grocery stores. And then they plotted all residential units across the state.

950
02:17:34,520 --> 02:17:42,049
And next they used the network measurement tool, which is that geo processing tool to calculate the closest distance between a

951
02:17:42,050 --> 02:17:47,600
residential unit and its nearest food retailer following along road networks.

952
02:17:47,780 --> 02:17:50,510
And they did this for every residential unit in the state.

953
02:17:51,920 --> 02:18:00,080
And so they were able to take the average closest distance value for each census tract to create their final mapping tool.

954
02:18:01,520 --> 02:18:07,010
So just looking at this first map here and its quality, I thought it was very easy to interpret.

955
02:18:07,850 --> 02:18:10,730
And the information they're trying to convey here is really clear.

956
02:18:12,950 --> 02:18:18,530
And I do really like how they measure distance following road networks versus as the crow flies.

957
02:18:19,430 --> 02:18:27,589
I don't know. You can see like even if you lived in close proximity to a food source, just the reality of how you would get there would be farther.

958
02:18:27,590 --> 02:18:29,270
And that's something that's important to consider.

959
02:18:32,360 --> 02:18:40,579
Also, just in looking at their methodology overall, I thought that it was laid out very clearly in the paper, kind of read like a recipe,

960
02:18:40,580 --> 02:18:43,639
and I think that's actually pretty important for this study specifically,

961
02:18:43,640 --> 02:18:48,710
since they wanted this new methodology to be something that's reproducible by others.

962
02:18:51,830 --> 02:18:56,420
Okay. So would you modify or add anything to this methodology?

963
02:19:05,280 --> 02:19:11,109
And like I was just thinking about looking at the map, like maybe I'll just add more detail about like thinking about like one way roads and stuff.

964
02:19:11,110 --> 02:19:16,209
Maybe like I'm making that so like understanding why they chose that to be a closest distance.

965
02:19:16,210 --> 02:19:20,290
Like this one seems pretty obvious, but if it was another one where like there was an easier way to get there,

966
02:19:20,530 --> 02:19:26,320
maybe adding like the like signals of like one way street or something could, could help explain why they chose a different route.

967
02:19:26,350 --> 02:19:35,260
Yeah, that's a really good point. I was also thinking about how they restricted their search of food retailers just to the state of Vermont.

968
02:19:35,620 --> 02:19:41,230
So somebody who lived on the border of the state might have a quality food source from in the bordering state,

969
02:19:41,500 --> 02:19:45,820
but that wouldn't be captured here, so they would be incorrectly labeled as a food desert.

970
02:19:48,070 --> 02:19:53,380
I also thought this might assume that people will select the food retailer that's closest to them.

971
02:19:54,310 --> 02:20:01,360
But as we talked about with economic access, people may travel farther distances for a more appropriate food source.

972
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:04,570
And so this method doesn't really account for that added time and cost.

973
02:20:08,500 --> 02:20:14,290
Yeah. Also thinking about the definition that they used for food retailers might exclude

974
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:19,990
more informal means of accessing food like farmers markets or CSA programs.

975
02:20:21,700 --> 02:20:27,879
Um. Yeah. Okay. So looking at their findings, once they performed the spatial analysis,

976
02:20:27,880 --> 02:20:35,590
they found 12 census tracts or 4.5% of Vermont's total population to reside in food deserts.

977
02:20:36,760 --> 02:20:44,499
And so again, they're defining food deserts here as census tracts with an average distance to a food retailer greater than ten miles.

978
02:20:44,500 --> 02:20:54,490
So outside of that buffer region. So looking at these chloroplast maps, again, I think they're both very easy to interpret and follow along.

979
02:20:55,240 --> 02:21:00,790
I thought that it could be helpful to see urban and rural spaces outlined here just for context.

980
02:21:01,420 --> 02:21:05,260
And also, since that distinction was so important to the study overall,

981
02:21:07,750 --> 02:21:13,360
this second map here is highlighting specifically the food desert census tracts.

982
02:21:13,780 --> 02:21:21,010
And the text related to this figure goes into more detail about how poverty and education may correlate with food deserts.

983
02:21:22,030 --> 02:21:26,440
But there weren't any maps that help you visualize this.

984
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:31,450
It was just written, so I thought it would be cool to see that sort of applied to a map.

985
02:21:34,120 --> 02:21:43,509
So what they did find was that within food deserts, census tracts, residents have lower education levels than the state average.

986
02:21:43,510 --> 02:21:48,100
But overall, that level of educational attainment was still quite high.

987
02:21:49,570 --> 02:21:55,090
And they also found that poverty levels were higher than the state average, but it was only by about a percent.

988
02:21:56,080 --> 02:22:02,649
So kind of interesting findings and what I thought was quite interesting was that the areas with the highest

989
02:22:02,650 --> 02:22:09,520
poverty levels and lowest education attainment levels for the whole state were actually in urban spaces.

990
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:17,050
And through the definitions of food deserts created by these researchers, they were not defined as food deserts.

991
02:22:18,670 --> 02:22:23,139
So I thought that just really emphasized how it's so important to have different definitions

992
02:22:23,140 --> 02:22:28,240
of food security and methodologies for defining those between the different spaces.

993
02:22:30,340 --> 02:22:38,829
Okay. So just some final questions for you all. How can the public health issue of food security be framed as a health behavior and

994
02:22:38,830 --> 02:22:45,160
health education issue and then I guess separately as a structural or policy issue?

995
02:22:51,700 --> 02:22:57,430
And then I guess adding on to that or separate from that, what would interventions at each of these levels look like?

996
02:23:03,290 --> 02:23:10,730
And we were talking about this previously with food security, that you could get a structural level, just the infrastructure.

997
02:23:11,230 --> 02:23:17,840
I think a lot of rural areas don't have transportation for folks who don't have access,

998
02:23:18,930 --> 02:23:26,660
you know, or you do have to wait until you start to go really far distance on the times.

999
02:23:28,250 --> 02:23:35,120
And so I do think there's potential in ways to increase infrastructure that would support that.

1000
02:23:35,120 --> 02:23:42,170
And also they could talk about other ways of obtaining food like a lot of rural areas to have better farming communities.

1001
02:23:42,350 --> 02:23:51,780
Are there ways like set up a structural thing that would create farm sharing or like community venture

1002
02:23:52,610 --> 02:23:56,780
funds and things like that and then draw on the resources that are already in rural communities?

1003
02:23:57,860 --> 02:24:09,620
Because I do have transportation and access like that is a harder issue in rural spaces and sometimes they not longer spaces as well.

1004
02:24:09,800 --> 02:24:18,020
Yeah. So anyway, there's definitely a balance there, but I guess I definitely think it's a structural and policy issue.

1005
02:24:18,020 --> 02:24:23,170
But I understand that there. Yeah.

1006
02:24:23,380 --> 02:24:28,940
That was awesome. Yeah I did something else analog to that that I saw in my.

1007
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:37,940
How? That could also probably address some of.

1008
02:24:40,280 --> 02:24:44,830
While still there. I forget the name of the.

1009
02:24:50,440 --> 02:24:59,240
Is based in western Michigan with his wife. Still have.

1010
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:05,450
Also. So I came to.

1011
02:25:06,590 --> 02:25:09,650
Yeah. That's super cool. Yeah. Yeah.

1012
02:25:10,040 --> 02:25:14,580
I think I also agree it's more of a structural, structural and policy issue.

1013
02:25:14,600 --> 02:25:19,280
And I was just thinking about the issue of affordability and access.

1014
02:25:19,690 --> 02:25:29,990
And so for example, at the moment food truck is or something ensuring that like we can see can be spent at those items, not just in grocery stores.

1015
02:25:31,590 --> 02:25:35,670
Cool. Yeah, definitely. Cool.

1016
02:25:35,880 --> 02:25:46,380
And then finally, how do geographic information systems improve upon qualitative analysis, particularly for understanding rural food deserts?

1017
02:25:53,620 --> 02:26:02,280
One thing I was just thinking about is the analysis tool that they did use here was just built right into the software and yeah,

1018
02:26:02,380 --> 02:26:11,020
made the whole process much more efficient. And I guess just thinking about maps in general is sometimes seeing something visually can

1019
02:26:11,380 --> 02:26:15,420
bring trends to light that you wouldn't see if you were just looking at tabular data.

1020
02:26:18,320 --> 02:26:22,280
Yeah. I think I like this question a lot, that qualitative research.

1021
02:26:23,390 --> 02:26:27,320
But I think going back to what they're looking at, like, you know, individual perceptions.

1022
02:26:27,320 --> 02:26:34,280
So if you're able to kind of geo code where receives food access is really low.

1023
02:26:34,280 --> 02:26:37,010
But really, really we're seeing that it is a social understanding.

1024
02:26:37,340 --> 02:26:45,319
What you're saying is this like why are they perceiving this, that there's this in this like free state food access place for them?

1025
02:26:45,320 --> 02:26:52,790
They, you know, they kind of understand the story of why they're not whether it's food deserts when they're doing some.

1026
02:26:52,790 --> 02:26:57,710
Yeah, yeah. The element of perception is a whole other thing to consider.

1027
02:26:57,860 --> 02:27:01,020
Yeah. Okay.

1028
02:27:01,350 --> 02:27:08,340
Thank you. Thank you.

1029
02:27:09,360 --> 02:27:14,110
Okay. I have one more presentation today.

1030
02:27:14,190 --> 02:27:18,870
Three today instead of two. Uh, yes.

1031
02:27:19,170 --> 02:27:24,450
Cecily Barnes. Asthma in Air Pollution in the Bronx.

1032
02:27:30,830 --> 02:27:41,150
There you go. Thank you. Hi everyone.

1033
02:27:42,650 --> 02:27:46,120
My article with Asthma Air Pollution in the Bronx,

1034
02:27:46,130 --> 02:27:56,120
Mythological and Data Considerations and Using J.S. for Environmental Justice and Health Research were written by Juliana Montag.

1035
02:27:57,410 --> 02:28:07,270
So the overall article focuses on, like environmental justice and how GIS methods are use to analyze, you know,

1036
02:28:07,280 --> 02:28:19,400
spatial relationships and exposure of polluter of pollution burdens and the characteristics that are potentially affected by such populations.

1037
02:28:20,150 --> 02:28:24,860
So cool. Very so just a little bit of background information on asthma.

1038
02:28:25,100 --> 02:28:35,420
If you're not familiar with the condition it is a chronic is usually long term and short term.

1039
02:28:35,690 --> 02:28:42,860
So short term usually long term in the airways are the tubes, you know, carry in and out of your lungs.

1040
02:28:43,160 --> 02:28:46,420
I mean, if you have asthma, you may have difficulty breathing.

1041
02:28:47,450 --> 02:28:51,739
And, you know, it can cause additional respiratory issues.

1042
02:28:51,740 --> 02:28:58,370
You know, as you get older, you might, you know, form, you know, different conditions such as like Zima and things of that nature.

1043
02:28:59,240 --> 02:29:08,720
But asthma had can be like is pretty like easily managed with various medical tools such as inhalers, breathing machines, things of that nature.

1044
02:29:10,730 --> 02:29:18,620
So there are different ways in which one can be exposed to like breathing and capabilities that can,

1045
02:29:18,620 --> 02:29:22,040
you know, contribute to, you know, forming asthma.

1046
02:29:23,030 --> 02:29:30,850
There's environmental conditions such as high humidity, pollen, you know, pollution.

1047
02:29:31,280 --> 02:29:41,269
So like land filled areas, areas that may have like factories that produce toxic chemicals, truck and car exhaust.

1048
02:29:41,270 --> 02:29:46,370
So if you're in a more transportation of city, less than walkable,

1049
02:29:46,370 --> 02:29:57,019
you may be more exposed to like being around cars that drive with, you know, filler like contaminated exhaust fuel allergies.

1050
02:29:57,020 --> 02:30:07,610
So that can range your pets, seasonal allergies, food allergies, that is infections and eczema, as mentioned before, and then also behavioral choices.

1051
02:30:07,610 --> 02:30:13,690
So maybe exercising or hard labor, smoking, etc.

1052
02:30:16,220 --> 02:30:20,900
So this study focused in on the Bronx.

1053
02:30:20,900 --> 02:30:24,440
The Bronx is one of the five boroughs of New York City right there in the middle.

1054
02:30:24,470 --> 02:30:31,700
Tourist is what? Excuse me? The East River is home to over 1.3 million people.

1055
02:30:31,700 --> 02:30:37,669
But I will note that this information is based off the 2000 census bird census.

1056
02:30:37,670 --> 02:30:42,290
So that might be a little bit different in comparison to 20 years later from now.

1057
02:30:43,160 --> 02:30:47,710
And at the time, it represented about 70% of the city's population.

1058
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:57,260
The city, the borough has a majority bipoc minority immigrant population.

1059
02:30:58,070 --> 02:31:03,530
It is also determined to be one of the lowest household income populations.

1060
02:31:05,090 --> 02:31:11,480
Also to know with the Bronx also contains the lowest average of educational attainment levels.

1061
02:31:11,900 --> 02:31:20,030
So it is putting some context is in the population and you know going further into the study as to why, you know, this location was chosen.

1062
02:31:22,130 --> 02:31:26,750
So what is the issue with the Bronx in asthma?

1063
02:31:27,230 --> 02:31:36,950
Why is this important to know? At the time, 70% of children living in the Bronx had health, asthma, hospitalizations,

1064
02:31:38,210 --> 02:31:44,900
and that was actually 70% higher than the city of Newark in addition to that.

1065
02:31:47,780 --> 02:31:51,019
Oh, wait. Oh, yeah.

1066
02:31:51,020 --> 02:31:54,580
I don't know how that happened. Okay, so industrial zone.

1067
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:58,850
So just wanted to give a further if this is on, why.

1068
02:31:58,880 --> 02:32:02,360
Okay. Before going to the next slide, what is the issue? Why is it issue?

1069
02:32:02,360 --> 02:32:09,259
So industrial zones, industrial zones are basically land lands that prevent manufacturing,

1070
02:32:09,260 --> 02:32:13,520
diminish industrial products, factories, power plants and warehouses.

1071
02:32:13,820 --> 02:32:22,100
So they're basically like legal boundaries in which the city can like place, you know, certain factories that produce economic growth.

1072
02:32:22,820 --> 02:32:30,230
So like factories that produce cars or like chemicals that are heavily toxic.

1073
02:32:30,650 --> 02:32:35,400
So with this boundary, they carry higher involvement.

1074
02:32:35,690 --> 02:32:42,590
Birds. And they're usually like marbled in in residentially zoned areas.

1075
02:32:42,830 --> 02:32:48,320
And that goes on to say that industrial zones are heavily incorporated in the Bronx borough.

1076
02:32:48,980 --> 02:32:59,090
And throughout the years, there has been like a relitigation and, you know, me and managing that, but there hasn't been much of a turnover.

1077
02:32:59,630 --> 02:33:09,920
And in comparison to a lot more privileged areas in the New York City area who do not have as much industrial zoned locations.

1078
02:33:10,580 --> 02:33:16,940
So yeah. So then that goes into what is the issue, why is that imported?

1079
02:33:16,940 --> 02:33:28,310
So as mentioned before, as environmental exposures are pollution exposure is is a few of the indicators of the development of asthma.

1080
02:33:28,610 --> 02:33:32,120
So as I mentioned before, 70% of children,

1081
02:33:32,120 --> 02:33:41,540
more than those in the city of New York has been hospitalized for the condition 700% overall

1082
02:33:41,540 --> 02:33:48,350
of people have overall have asthma and that is higher than the rest of the New York state.

1083
02:33:49,310 --> 02:33:57,379
And in the Bronx, like I said, from 1995, 1999, there were about 9000 hospitalizations within each five year period.

1084
02:33:57,380 --> 02:34:15,440
So, yes. So even with the further context as to what may be the like the ultimate like problem with like exposure to asthma in the Bronx area,

1085
02:34:15,770 --> 02:34:26,120
transportation was mentioned in the article as a as being one of the more prevalent exposures as well, which was investigated.

1086
02:34:26,900 --> 02:34:34,820
And that goes on to know that the Bronx so the transportation system in the Bronx is one of

1087
02:34:34,820 --> 02:34:40,250
the most heavily populated areas or usages of transportation in the New York City area.

1088
02:34:40,250 --> 02:34:43,670
So that goes on to say.

1089
02:34:43,670 --> 02:34:50,479
So the purpose of this study was to see whether or not the disproportionate

1090
02:34:50,480 --> 02:34:55,790
environmental burdens corresponded to an increased risk for asthma hospitalization.

1091
02:34:56,270 --> 02:35:04,009
So the spatial correspondence between the locations of land used to contribute to poor air quality and locations

1092
02:35:04,010 --> 02:35:11,750
of people who have been hospitalized for asthma in the Bronx surrounding in relation to environmental justice.

1093
02:35:12,080 --> 02:35:16,670
This was used to examine the implications of such correlation and association.

1094
02:35:17,420 --> 02:35:23,389
So we referred from there what was the geographic extent of the study.

1095
02:35:23,390 --> 02:35:28,430
So as I mentioned before, geographical extent.

1096
02:35:28,430 --> 02:35:32,540
So that means, you know, the barriers,

1097
02:35:32,540 --> 02:35:41,779
the indicators of the landmarks of such plants and where they're located and who's exposed to it, the fiscal integration.

1098
02:35:41,780 --> 02:35:46,339
So as mentioned before, you know, is this a walkable city?

1099
02:35:46,340 --> 02:35:56,450
Is it not? You know, are we using transportation systems? Is there a combination surrounding the two factors, cultural factors.

1100
02:35:57,620 --> 02:35:59,660
So like behavioral issues,

1101
02:35:59,990 --> 02:36:07,060
not behavioral issues like behavioral choices by like certain people of certain cultures in this community, are they smoking more?

1102
02:36:07,070 --> 02:36:11,090
Are they not? Which was kind of touched on.

1103
02:36:11,090 --> 02:36:17,659
But I'll go further to that as well. And then also existing political and jurisdictional boundaries.

1104
02:36:17,660 --> 02:36:24,470
So we're creating like the mapping or creating like the jurisdiction of what was going to be analyzed.

1105
02:36:25,040 --> 02:36:31,549
There was decipher between political jurisdictional boundaries and political boundaries have

1106
02:36:31,550 --> 02:36:37,340
more of a I think it's more depth and more long dated as to what the barriers look like.

1107
02:36:38,540 --> 02:36:47,300
And that causes like trouble because the data may not be the same across the board if one or the other boundary is utilized.

1108
02:36:49,100 --> 02:36:54,670
So while the bride did this study choose to use the broth.

1109
02:36:54,950 --> 02:36:55,790
So ultimately,

1110
02:36:56,780 --> 02:37:06,769
this was this study was used as a pilot to probably utilize in other urban areas who have high exposures of asthma or high rates of asthma.

1111
02:37:06,770 --> 02:37:11,750
Hospitalizations in the Bronx matched that data and that was necessary.

1112
02:37:12,260 --> 02:37:13,579
I think, you know, in class,

1113
02:37:13,580 --> 02:37:19,820
we've all might have come across like the trouble of like finding certain like information or data to incorporate within our maps.

1114
02:37:20,240 --> 02:37:26,990
So the combination of geographical, socioeconomic, economic data, data,

1115
02:37:27,650 --> 02:37:39,840
all of that combined provide a good catapult or a framework to see what's working and what's not with these datasets and with the potential mapping.

1116
02:37:39,860 --> 02:37:44,120
So, so yeah.

1117
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:52,579
So within the study it was there, the author and the researchers were trying to define,

1118
02:37:52,580 --> 02:37:55,340
you know, environmental hazards and balloons and what that would look like.

1119
02:37:55,850 --> 02:38:03,079
So a couple of ways that was determined or data was pulled was from the toxic

1120
02:38:03,080 --> 02:38:08,239
release inventory that's maintained by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,

1121
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:21,020
EPA, if you have taken, you know, their environmental health class at into school thus far, also the the toxic release inventory.

1122
02:38:21,590 --> 02:38:31,800
So, Tara, for sure, it also follows the standard industrial classification codes and then also the way data is pooled here.

1123
02:38:31,820 --> 02:38:41,180
So in the Bronx, there are actually like air monitoring locations that monitors like the pollution and the pressure that comes for like record levels.

1124
02:38:41,310 --> 02:38:46,510
Like meeting the criteria or not. But there are limitations in pulling such data.

1125
02:38:46,520 --> 02:38:56,419
So there is public data on facilities who are subject to report to the EPA, but it only has to meet a certain requirement to do so.

1126
02:38:56,420 --> 02:39:05,329
So there's usually larger facilities. And the you know, the smaller facilities that, you know, may have an impact on the environment as well.

1127
02:39:05,330 --> 02:39:14,989
The breaths area are not like properly recorded. So also, as I mentioned before, there's only three air monitoring locations in the Bronx.

1128
02:39:14,990 --> 02:39:25,700
So low mile, low number of monitoring locations equals a meaningless usage of sample points for spatial interpretation or interpretation.

1129
02:39:26,030 --> 02:39:32,120
So I guess my question thus far is like, you know, when we're only focused on like, you know,

1130
02:39:32,120 --> 02:39:40,280
environmental barriers in like asthma or in exposure to add, to obtain or to have asthma, I guess.

1131
02:39:40,550 --> 02:39:48,440
Well, other exposures may not be addressed when looking for data that maybe like finally is a causation.

1132
02:39:48,980 --> 02:39:57,670
I don't know that making sense, but yeah. Yeah, maybe like smaller businesses, like gas stations.

1133
02:39:57,680 --> 02:40:08,990
Yeah. Workers are always. Yeah, I guess so with car space cars, I mean, cars, gas stations, even like, like repair shops,

1134
02:40:09,350 --> 02:40:15,590
you know, or like used car shops, things that are like, you know, smaller on a smaller scale.

1135
02:40:15,740 --> 02:40:19,150
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I just got a couple of years.

1136
02:40:19,190 --> 02:40:22,879
Yeah. Secondhand smoke. Yeah.

1137
02:40:22,880 --> 02:40:28,450
So that's a definitely that's not like really recorded unless it's self-reported and it's probably not.

1138
02:40:28,460 --> 02:40:35,620
So yeah. Yeah. I'm thinking like if you're looking at low income communities,

1139
02:40:35,630 --> 02:40:40,530
which has a strain on these sources, I think the competition for resources are what makes.

1140
02:40:41,930 --> 02:40:53,370
She adds, I'm wondering if other factors like violence, exposure, anything that would require rolling up leads to actual excitement.

1141
02:40:59,110 --> 02:41:02,190
Yeah. So, like. No, no, that makes sense though.

1142
02:41:02,200 --> 02:41:07,450
Like, behavioral, like, outcomes. Like, that's sort of kind of what I'm hearing from that.

1143
02:41:07,450 --> 02:41:12,940
So like, what is like charging one to do, I don't know, idea what you're saying.

1144
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:23,320
Yeah. So, um, these were a few things that were discussed in the paper, and I'm going to go down the line of like the what they found,

1145
02:41:23,510 --> 02:41:27,730
what was limiting and go further into, you know, what you've mentioned.

1146
02:41:28,600 --> 02:41:35,290
So I don't think we've kind of went over buffers in class we had.

1147
02:41:35,290 --> 02:41:39,070
Yeah. So so you've gone over buffers now.

1148
02:41:39,220 --> 02:41:52,209
Okay. So this buffers was one of the tools within our ideas that was utilized to determine what zones are more prone to,

1149
02:41:52,210 --> 02:41:57,070
you know, asthma exposure and what zones are not.

1150
02:41:57,610 --> 02:42:03,939
So that so this like little conception here kind of shows you what that is.

1151
02:42:03,940 --> 02:42:09,669
So is a zone drawn around any point, line or polygon that encompasses all of the area within a given.

1152
02:42:09,670 --> 02:42:22,330
This is from the feature then for this study here, asthma air pollution study relied on buffer distances ranging from 150 meters to a half of a mile,

1153
02:42:23,320 --> 02:42:30,070
and then populations within the appropriate buffer distance are considered to be impacted and those outside of the buffer are

1154
02:42:30,070 --> 02:42:37,870
considered not impacted and buffers are acknowledged to be superior within this kind of work of environmental justice or just like,

1155
02:42:37,870 --> 02:42:47,260
you know, determining what's working and what's not or what's there or what's not, because it more adequately captures the potential for exposure.

1156
02:42:48,070 --> 02:42:56,080
So from the reading, a couple of buffers that were introduced that the savviest on it,

1157
02:42:56,920 --> 02:43:01,870
but you can see on the top right here there's these buffers like so areas that

1158
02:43:01,870 --> 02:43:08,680
have more exposure to toxic relief inventory and then like this combined buffer,

1159
02:43:09,310 --> 02:43:14,530
I'm not even going to like I think it's like it's kind of like the combination between the four here.

1160
02:43:14,530 --> 02:43:17,530
Basically. That's what I that's what I got from it.

1161
02:43:17,860 --> 02:43:21,999
So the bottom right here, major track rule buffer.

1162
02:43:22,000 --> 02:43:30,729
So like, so like, you know, routes of like, you know, trucks going back and forth in the Bronx area and yeah.

1163
02:43:30,730 --> 02:43:35,690
And then like limits access to highway buffers. So like the drawbacks to, you know,

1164
02:43:35,710 --> 02:43:43,900
such utilization of buffers is that it assumes that everybody is exposed within these, um, it's in these little dots.

1165
02:43:44,320 --> 02:43:51,280
But the moral of it is that I will say, oh well we're.

1166
02:43:51,280 --> 02:43:54,700
Forman is, is it that so should I speed it up.

1167
02:43:55,240 --> 02:43:58,270
Okay. So long story short.

1168
02:44:00,500 --> 02:44:05,520
Okay. So yeah, that's how you obtain information for buffers.

1169
02:44:06,220 --> 02:44:09,700
Okay. Findings from the research.

1170
02:44:10,870 --> 02:44:15,410
Like I say, a lot of the data was limited, save significant.

1171
02:44:15,430 --> 02:44:19,930
So ultimately 66% of the bronx's landmass falls within the buffers.

1172
02:44:21,370 --> 02:44:27,670
And then also the buffer distance was revised during the study and it also didn't make a difference in what was found.

1173
02:44:27,790 --> 02:44:38,529
So limitations there is like there's a difference using positional attribute accuracy in like what could be utilized to determine within

1174
02:44:38,530 --> 02:44:46,900
this mapping and giraffe g referencing why data certainty and what data to study was that there was limitation in hospital admissions.

1175
02:44:47,920 --> 02:44:55,000
You know, a lot of the information that they found from a social perspective was self-reported from hospitals.

1176
02:44:55,630 --> 02:45:01,990
So there it comes, like, you know, missing data, missing addresses, missing names, immigrant status.

1177
02:45:01,990 --> 02:45:06,430
One might not, you know, fill out full filling, fill out everything.

1178
02:45:06,850 --> 02:45:10,690
Also, I will say that they literally just looked at hospitals.

1179
02:45:10,690 --> 02:45:16,150
So what was like missing here was like doctors offices, emergency rooms, clinics.

1180
02:45:16,330 --> 02:45:24,700
These are their nature that may, you know, go, you know, that who were they may go to to address, you know, their asthma complications.

1181
02:45:25,450 --> 02:45:28,180
Um, so, yeah, this is the last slide with me.

1182
02:45:28,570 --> 02:45:37,000
So in the future, what this limited data there is, you are precise relationships between like environments of burdens,

1183
02:45:37,000 --> 02:45:44,110
race and class examination of multiple periphery exposures, sociodemographic data in and out of reference.

1184
02:45:44,740 --> 02:45:48,920
And ultimately this I will say the study was like from 2000.

1185
02:45:49,000 --> 02:45:52,660
So that's like well, 2000 basis like 15, 20 years old.

1186
02:45:52,900 --> 02:45:56,209
So what I was going to ask is like. If it was 2022.

1187
02:45:56,210 --> 02:46:02,900
Now, how would you recreate this map with like additional like indicators or with like advanced technology that

1188
02:46:02,900 --> 02:46:09,290
has kind of like progress with an obvious mapping and then like what sources would you use to obtain like,

1189
02:46:09,290 --> 02:46:13,639
you know, data information being that back then that information was kind of sparked.

1190
02:46:13,640 --> 02:46:19,490
So yeah, that that was basically the gist of it.

1191
02:46:19,490 --> 02:46:29,420
And thank you. Very thorough job, I have to say.

1192
02:46:29,630 --> 02:46:32,870
Yes. All right.

1193
02:46:32,870 --> 02:46:37,280
Thank you so much. Again, we are behind.

1194
02:46:38,090 --> 02:46:44,720
But that's okay. We worked in a career start doing proximity analysis, which included buffers.

1195
02:46:45,590 --> 02:46:48,649
But we'll do that next time. All right. Don't sweat it.

1196
02:46:48,650 --> 02:46:51,710
We'll catch up. I don't think we'll have a problem.

1197
02:46:52,970 --> 02:46:57,770
It's about time to go. So we'll talk next week. Please sign up for those meetings.

1198
02:46:58,190 --> 02:47:03,260
I've seen people are signing up already. But it's better we talk sooner than later.

1199
02:47:03,410 --> 02:47:08,690
So I look forward to talking to you guys and we'll see you in about a week.

1200
02:47:08,900 --> 02:47:18,500
All right. Take care. I this when.

1201
02:47:27,690 --> 02:47:32,280
I don't want you to me that no one gets hurt.

1202
02:47:33,070 --> 02:47:46,200
Luther wasn't really like that, so I always thought he was going to go through the bloody thing.

1203
02:47:46,470 --> 02:47:49,590
Yea, yea. Yea yea. I want to go with you.

1204
02:47:50,220 --> 02:47:54,840
Oh yea. Yea. Continuously.
