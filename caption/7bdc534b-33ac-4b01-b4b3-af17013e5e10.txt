Course. Overview, take two. Hello and welcome to HD 593.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:10,040
My name is Doug Wheeler and I'll be serving as the instructor for this course.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:17,090
I am currently an epidemiologist in the Cannabis Strategy Unit at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:26,990
I've experience studying drug overdose prevention, motor vehicle crashes, child injury prevention and several other aspects of injury prevention.

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:35,680
As you saw in the course review, Dr. Chris Schmidt was responsible for creating this course and she recorded all of the action videos.

6
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,599
This course was previously taught on Thursday evenings, and hopefully none of you panicked.

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:50,020
But this year this course will be taught on Tuesdays. All other aspects that Dr. Schmidt covered, including course policies, apply to this course.

8
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:59,920
I look forward to meeting all of you. It's my goal to learn from you and to apply your individual experiences to health behavior theory.

9
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,550
Looking forward to seeing you all soon.
