1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:10,630
Okay. So a few announcements.

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:19,820
One, if you are viewing this online, please do finish viewing stuff by next Tuesday.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,230
I realize that is the fall break, but I want to start getting the grades recorded.

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,420
This is this is the last class you have here with me.

5
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:35,319
And then most of you will be going on to Dr. Buxton next time.

6
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,959
And just a reminder that that starts at 3:00, not at 1:00, but it is also in the three in the next week.

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,170
It's fall break. So we actually start two weeks from now.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,320
Okay, if we can figure this out. Hi, this is Abraham.

9
00:00:56,371 --> 00:01:00,741
So again, the poll everywhere. So sorry again for the screen.

10
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:03,721
Hopefully there's not too much of a distraction for people coming back and stuff.

11
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:12,931
I we we just may not have a screen as they fill at the poll everywhere is attendance for free.

12
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:17,190
So again if you have not done that, please do it like right now,

13
00:01:17,191 --> 00:01:21,391
because we will be I will be switching up what the poll everywhere is throughout class.

14
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:31,871
So if you don't do it now, you just won't have a chance to do it. And then a few other announcements.

15
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:36,341
Oh, yeah. So finish viewing step by next Tuesday.

16
00:01:36,341 --> 00:01:43,960
If you have if you have permission to view things asynchronously, the homework is due on the 16th as usual.

17
00:01:43,961 --> 00:01:52,271
That is the Sunday. So please get the weeks this this final week homework.

18
00:01:52,271 --> 00:01:55,840
And this is like a bit of a simpler one. There's no coding involved.

19
00:01:55,841 --> 00:02:00,791
It's just reading through some systematic review articles. So it shouldn't take too much time.

20
00:02:01,661 --> 00:02:07,450
So after that, there is a final the final is due on the 23rd, so a week after that.

21
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:11,831
But the final will open up within, I think, later this afternoon.

22
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:17,560
So you are able to take as much time as you want on the final.

23
00:02:17,561 --> 00:02:22,210
That is something you have to do complete individually. So please don't talk to your classmates about it.

24
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:34,721
But you can it's you know, it's open notes. You can talk to me you can talk to in the GSI if the any homework makeups are also due on the 25th.

25
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:40,481
That is right before you start the next class. So like two weeks from now on, 1 p.m.,

26
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:52,271
the makeups are due for like any homework makeups or if you want to look at points back in a homework assignment,

27
00:02:52,271 --> 00:03:00,491
that's all I'll do with, in truth, any questions about, like, the timing of anything or where where we're at in the semester?

28
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:08,611
Okay. So on for today.

29
00:03:12,231 --> 00:03:19,341
Some of the quiz questions. So information bias, confounding selection bias typically operate in the same direction.

30
00:03:19,341 --> 00:03:21,351
And the answer is false and that's it most of you got.

31
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:26,481
So all of these things which can affect our study results and I think these are the three big ones.

32
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:30,141
So please do remember them. Information bias, confounding selection bias.

33
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:34,521
Does anyone have any questions about what we mean by those?

34
00:03:35,241 --> 00:03:37,581
Can I can I help you explain anything?

35
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:44,961
And this is, you know, one of the core concepts in epidemiology, and I know we probably are a bit vague explaining it, but I think, you know,

36
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:52,221
having an idea of what information biases, what confounding is and what selection bias is is very important for your for your future careers.

37
00:03:52,641 --> 00:03:58,911
Okay. But those can operate in different directions. So like if you control for one, you could even be further biasing your results.

38
00:03:58,911 --> 00:04:03,591
So if you're really going to do a quantitative bias analysis, you kind of want to control for all three elements.

39
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:19,671
Okay. So and then also some people have been asking and I will be putting up the poll everywhere with questions on the canvas.

40
00:04:19,681 --> 00:04:24,901
I'll probably do that later this afternoon. So that'll just be a separate link on canvas so you can look through all this stuff.

41
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:37,530
Okay. So if we are looking at something which is a parentheses Z, that would mean that it is a known confounder, but it's unmeasured.

42
00:04:37,531 --> 00:04:42,571
So like a parentheses just means that it's not measured in our dataset, but we know it exists.

43
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:55,071
And then misclassification, I would say, is a type of measurement error.

44
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:03,231
And then I'm just going through these again. These would be put online and it might be easier for you to see them visually.

45
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:09,651
I may believe you are all able to get the values that create the EBA.

46
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:15,981
What does the E value refer to? I think some of about two thirds of you got this rate, but some of you did not.

47
00:05:19,581 --> 00:05:29,511
So the e value conceptually it's like how much confounding does there need to occur to completely eliminate what we are seeing in the dataset?

48
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:34,761
So how much, you know, stuff that we're not able to control for how much unmeasured confounding is there?

49
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:43,521
And but like how do you measure how much component there is?

50
00:05:43,521 --> 00:05:49,011
Like, like what what confounding is as the concept is a bit is a bit, you know,

51
00:05:49,071 --> 00:05:54,711
because it refers to both like an exposure confounding relationship and a confounder outcome relationship.

52
00:05:55,101 --> 00:06:00,530
So the E value actually refers to those two separate measures of association.

53
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:06,051
It refers to the exposure confounder and it refers to the confounder outcome.

54
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:10,790
And the E value is just what would the strength of the association have to be for those two

55
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:18,231
values to completely explain away the what we found as the exposure outcome relationship?

56
00:06:24,211 --> 00:06:28,381
Okay. Again, this this will be put online.

57
00:06:28,381 --> 00:06:34,831
I realize it's probably not that easy to conceptualize these things if I am just talking about them.

58
00:06:38,921 --> 00:06:47,110
Okay. So today we're going to be talking about meta analysis.

59
00:06:47,111 --> 00:06:53,501
And the CDC's slide to this is this idea of knowledge synthesis.

60
00:06:54,461 --> 00:07:00,971
So knowledge synthesis, I think is is strongly related to our frequentist ideas.

61
00:07:00,971 --> 00:07:06,311
Because one thing I mentioned to you earlier this semester is the whole idea behind a frequentist

62
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:13,511
statistics system is that we are conceiving of our P values and our confidence intervals under this like

63
00:07:13,511 --> 00:07:19,181
imaginary world where a bajillion studies are being conducted at the same time looking at kind of the

64
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:27,521
same thing and we are coming up with like a p value which refers to all those imaginary studies,

65
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:35,230
but with a knowledge synthesis approach, we can actually collect a lot of similarly conducted studies,

66
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:40,630
so we can look to see in the literature what's out there for all sorts of other studies which are,

67
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:48,610
you know, looking at this coffee diabetes relationship or looking at, you know, vaccines in autism or or any sort of question that you want to know.

68
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:51,611
What has the some of the previous literature found?

69
00:07:54,431 --> 00:08:00,191
Okay. So on Slide three, I think it is important to be careful with our words.

70
00:08:01,391 --> 00:08:07,951
So how we refer to things in terms of cause and effect may depend on what kind of study we have.

71
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:10,621
So do we have an observational study?

72
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:16,961
Do we have a randomized controlled trial or are we looking at causal inference methods like marginal structure models or instrumental variables?

73
00:08:18,011 --> 00:08:20,320
Are we doing some sort of meta analysis?

74
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:29,531
So I would say that, you know, looking at using words like association and relation or relationship or correlation,

75
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:32,741
those are things which you can kind of say regardless of your study design.

76
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:37,991
Personally, in my mind, the word impact, you could also use it observational studies.

77
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:41,890
But I have had some peer reviewers in the past for similar articles,

78
00:08:41,891 --> 00:08:49,901
just not like me using the word impact for an observational study because they think that kind of has more of a cause and effect kind of a tone to it.

79
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:57,071
But when you start doing randomized controlled trials or really do these advance causal inference methods,

80
00:08:57,071 --> 00:09:01,960
then you consider using words like cause and effect. But you know, there might be a bit of controversy about this.

81
00:09:01,961 --> 00:09:05,891
You really want to make sure that you are you have like a really well-conducted study.

82
00:09:07,361 --> 00:09:14,921
And, you know, if you yourself are a bit cautious or if you want to not make too many assumptions,

83
00:09:14,921 --> 00:09:19,511
you could maybe stray from those words and stick to things like association relationship.

84
00:09:21,821 --> 00:09:25,241
But I think the benefit of having a meta analysis is here.

85
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:32,471
You can really start using words of cause and effect because we just have so much information from previous studies.

86
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:38,121
Okay. So in on the slide I have an asterisk by effect.

87
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:44,331
And the reason for that is because we do have some things like effect modification or effect measure modification.

88
00:09:44,571 --> 00:09:48,921
You can use that word effect in that context regardless of your study design.

89
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:54,860
I will see sometimes people will be okay with you saying, Oh,

90
00:09:54,861 --> 00:10:00,681
in order to estimate the effects of coffee and diabetes, we conducted, you know, a logistic regression.

91
00:10:02,091 --> 00:10:06,501
Some people will be okay with that, but some people won't. So we think that you're estimating the effect.

92
00:10:08,331 --> 00:10:09,831
In my mind that's a bit ambiguous.

93
00:10:09,831 --> 00:10:15,561
So depending on what you know you're submitting to or what audience you're looking at, you might want to be a bit more careful with those words.

94
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:21,411
Okay, so slide four, what do I mean by knowledge synthesis and what kind of syntheses are out there?

95
00:10:23,061 --> 00:10:27,290
So at the kind of like the the minimal effort, one would be a literature review.

96
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:35,121
And maybe this is something that, you know, for your project you're probably doing or maybe working for.

97
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:42,081
Professor, this is kind of a research assistantship you have, but it's just kind of doing a search on Google scholar,

98
00:10:42,251 --> 00:10:47,660
PubMed, seeing what's out there in the literature, but it's just kind of like what you find.

99
00:10:47,661 --> 00:10:53,811
You're not really delving too in-depth into anything. So that's a large review.

100
00:10:54,381 --> 00:11:03,531
A narrative review is pretty much the same thing, but a negative review is done by somebody who's considered to be an expert in the field.

101
00:11:04,101 --> 00:11:09,721
So what happened is, you know, decades ago, what a journal would do is they would contact some, you know,

102
00:11:09,781 --> 00:11:17,151
well-known expert in the field and ask them to write a negative review on a topic like maybe in the fifties and sixties.

103
00:11:17,151 --> 00:11:22,251
I'm sure there's a lot of negative reviews about out there about like the health impacts of smoking.

104
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:28,940
But the negative review is basically just, you know, what that expert thinks is important for the audience to know.

105
00:11:28,941 --> 00:11:34,251
So, you know, a literature review, any negative review, I would say conceptually is methodologically very similar.

106
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:38,421
It's just kind of you as an individual looking to see what articles you think are most important.

107
00:11:39,621 --> 00:11:43,161
So the big distinction is between those and a systematic review.

108
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:53,570
So in a systematic review, you do need to have your you need to provide more details about how you conducted your review.

109
00:11:53,571 --> 00:12:03,441
So like what databases did you go to? You need to know like what your search terms are, what dates you are including articles from, what languages.

110
00:12:03,921 --> 00:12:10,310
So you're being systematic in your literature review. And so predominantly that's kind of what's published today.

111
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:12,441
So there's not a lot of little reviews which are published,

112
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:21,261
although I will say one of my most cited articles that I worked on is a literature review of COVID 19, and we did that very early in the pandemic.

113
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:28,311
And we, you know, didn't consider it a systematic review because we were trying to get this paper out really quickly.

114
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:31,821
And as a result, we just called it a lot, actually. But, you know,

115
00:12:31,821 --> 00:12:38,421
a lot of times nowadays journals really don't publish literature reviews unless it's like a really pertinent topic where

116
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:43,491
they need fast turnaround on something because systematic reviews take a long time to collect all this information.

117
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:53,601
So a meta analysis is maybe a subset of a systematic review, and meta analysis is where you actually combine data from multiple studies.

118
00:12:54,321 --> 00:12:58,370
But you know, theoretically you'd only do that if you've systematically searched out those studies.

119
00:12:58,371 --> 00:13:04,821
You wouldn't really do a meta analysis in like a literature review or something of a scoping review,

120
00:13:04,821 --> 00:13:09,560
in my mind is kind of seeds only seeds different than a systematic review.

121
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:14,931
And a scoping review is more so of the perspective of like what is the state of the field and what's missing from it.

122
00:13:15,471 --> 00:13:20,540
Whereas the systematic review is more so looking at summarizing the state of the field.

123
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:27,651
So systematic reviews more so like what? What authority is in existence in a scoping review is like, what don't we know and how do we push it forward?

124
00:13:28,161 --> 00:13:32,991
But again, you know, kind of flip sides of the same question. All right.

125
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:38,361
So slide five, this is about databases.

126
00:13:40,401 --> 00:13:51,321
And they're the takeaway from this is that if you are doing some sort of systematic review, you should be using multiple databases.

127
00:13:51,951 --> 00:14:00,231
So the big one that we have in public health and in science here in the U.S. is PubMed and Medline is.

128
00:14:01,671 --> 00:14:04,851
It used to be something different, but now it's kind of combined in PubMed.

129
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:08,331
So they're not, you know, functionally, I don't think they're really that different anymore.

130
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,960
But there's other things, you know, that are covered.

131
00:14:11,961 --> 00:14:19,821
If you like the same citation index, there might be specific databases if you're doing something more religious psychology or the humanities,

132
00:14:21,111 --> 00:14:26,841
I would say Google Scholar or something. You know, I use it a lot. I'm sure you as students use it a lot.

133
00:14:27,711 --> 00:14:31,821
The benefit of Google Scholar is there's, you know, a lot of information.

134
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:37,191
It's very easy to search. Through. And it has some stuff which is called the gray literature.

135
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:40,781
In gray literature is stuff that's not really completely peer reviewed.

136
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:47,391
So that could include reports, policy speeches, abstracts for conferences or different peer reviewed, things like that.

137
00:14:48,411 --> 00:14:54,381
And that might be information that you want to get as part of your as part of your systematic review.

138
00:14:55,431 --> 00:14:59,060
But I would say that's like something that you just kind of need to consider as you're doing a systematic review,

139
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:03,771
like, do you include this gray literature? The other thing about Google Scholar is that, you know,

140
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:11,931
the Google is constantly updating how they do searches and how they, like prioritize certain things.

141
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:21,681
So it's not, you know, with with PubMed, you can kind of, you know, how PubMed like as a researcher, you know how PubMed indexes things.

142
00:15:21,681 --> 00:15:25,131
You know how PubMed works with Google scholar. You don't it's a bit of a black box.

143
00:15:25,671 --> 00:15:31,761
So it's hard to like systematically collect studies from it.

144
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:36,501
But I have a link on the slide to other databases which might be useful for you.

145
00:15:37,221 --> 00:15:44,331
One thing that I do recommend, and this is on the Slide six, is that when you are looking through permit and Google Scholar,

146
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:51,481
that you use the library links to them and here I have those direct links for me.

147
00:15:51,501 --> 00:15:55,611
I just put these as bookmarks in my web browser.

148
00:15:56,661 --> 00:16:02,751
And like the benefit of this is like when you link directly through the University of Michigan,

149
00:16:02,751 --> 00:16:08,030
then you will be able to directly access these full text databases.

150
00:16:08,031 --> 00:16:16,761
Whereas if you did not, you, you know, not every article has this publicly available open access article associated with it.

151
00:16:19,951 --> 00:16:25,901
Okay. So Slide seven Matt announces again with this is just about collecting information and

152
00:16:25,921 --> 00:16:30,751
like the numerical information from previous studies and doing some analysis with that.

153
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:37,531
And we will look at some examples of that in the next few slides.

154
00:16:38,191 --> 00:16:42,841
But if you remember anything from your other classes about multi-level methods or even if you remember

155
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:51,540
back to 601 with Dr. Bailyn about doing like survey research where you have to do of cluster data models,

156
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:56,101
these are very similar to that, that like each study is a cluster of data points.

157
00:16:56,581 --> 00:17:00,901
So if you are comparing, you know,

158
00:17:01,471 --> 00:17:05,251
you're doing a study of coffee of diabetes and you have like one set of data in

159
00:17:05,251 --> 00:17:09,841
the US and one set of studies from like Canada or like one group here in Michigan,

160
00:17:09,841 --> 00:17:17,071
one group in Illinois, whatever, like each of those individual studies needs to be considered like its own cluster of data,

161
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:25,331
and that's what the point of using multi-level methods is. Okay, so slide eight, what are graphs that you can put in better?

162
00:17:25,351 --> 00:17:29,131
And all of these are like, what? What kind of information would you show in this meta analysis?

163
00:17:29,281 --> 00:17:32,731
So one is the p curve. We'll talk about that later in class.

164
00:17:33,511 --> 00:17:38,011
The ones that we'll be talking about right now are these fourth plots and these funnel plots.

165
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:47,730
So forest plots are are designed to depict heterogeneity of results.

166
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:57,091
So you will show some, you know, what each individual study found and then you will show those all together.

167
00:17:58,021 --> 00:18:03,391
And then what you want to see is, is there variation across different studies or is there consistency?

168
00:18:04,381 --> 00:18:07,291
So that's of course, but even in a funnel plot,

169
00:18:07,681 --> 00:18:12,601
what you are looking at is the symmetry of results and especially with the perhaps what you're trying to see.

170
00:18:12,901 --> 00:18:20,190
Is there any reporting or publication bias? So in a funnel plot you can see like, is there something missing?

171
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:28,351
Is there a study that maybe was conducted in the past but just like was never was never published or,

172
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:31,201
you know, you weren't able to find it as part of your systematic review.

173
00:18:32,461 --> 00:18:36,241
So we'll talk about how you actually figured that out from the funnel plot later.

174
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:44,790
But the examples for today are taken from this article, a series of articles by Sedgwick and I do include a link to those articles I would recommend.

175
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:52,201
You don't click on those right now just because I actually changed some of the I changed some of the wording of questions,

176
00:18:54,661 --> 00:18:58,521
but I will break you into your groups now to deal with course plots.

177
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:04,261
So if you go to the Google Drive, you should have folders for your group.

178
00:19:04,261 --> 00:19:07,561
And in those there should be a description of these forest plots.

179
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,411
And then there actually is the fourth plot.

180
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:21,720
And then the last thing is that there is a as part of your small group, I want you to discuss, there's like four or five questions.

181
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:25,710
These are true and false. Please, as a small group, discuss them and why you think they're true or false.

182
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:31,651
And then we'll go through the groups and I'll have at least one of you in each group explain why you think it's true or false.

183
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:42,571
But individually, if you could put your responses in full everywhere, there would be great any questions about this course proper.

184
00:19:43,951 --> 00:19:50,311
Okay. And if you're viewing online, I'm going to power cycle the computer so you get a separate counter for.
