1
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:11,030
Zoom today, I had the great pleasure of introducing Dr. Marty Pie.

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,870
You'll all remember Dr. Pie from the video we watched at the beginning of class back in August,

3
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:26,540
where he spoke at this conference against colonial structures and global health and really spoke out against conferences,

4
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,339
global health Congresses having all of their meetings in high income countries, which,

5
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,540
as you know, continues to be an issue and looks like it will be an issue for the coming years.

6
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:42,560
Dr. Pi is a professor of epidemiology at McGill University and is also the

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:47,870
director of Global Health at McGill and the McGill International T.B. Center.

8
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:56,120
And Dr. Pi, in addition to all of that, also serves as the editor in chief for Global Public Health,

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,200
along with Dr. Katherine Cobb, attorney at APA, HSC in Kenya.

10
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:05,030
So, Dr. Pi, over to you. Thank you, Ryan.

11
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:09,320
Hi, everyone. Thank you for having me in your class.

12
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:17,270
So, Ryan, let me know if you can see my slides that they are there now.

13
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:25,950
Thank you. All right.

14
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:39,120
And I think all of you have access to my slides as well, as well as the reading the Forbes article, which I wrote on that ship in global health.

15
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:48,420
So I need to begin with my own reflexivity statement, as it were,

16
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:58,440
because this is not this is not a talk that's interpretable if you don't declare or think about having published nullity and privilege.

17
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:06,780
So I was born and raised in a small town in South India called Vellore, and I spent the first 30 years of my life in India.

18
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:12,989
And then I moved to Berkeley, California, to do my Ph.D. and post-doc at UCSF.

19
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,910
And now I've spent 15 years in Canada that I am a professor at McGill.

20
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:23,399
So in some ways I see myself as a double agent in global health.

21
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,510
And that piece is is all about people like me.

22
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:38,220
Quite a few people exist like me, people who struggle with two worlds and and definitely enjoy the privileges that come from straddling two worlds,

23
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:48,720
but also potentially problematic because self we are quite not sure sometimes whether we are inadvertently

24
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,530
or knowingly supporting the holidays in that piece that are so rife throughout global health.

25
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,190
Regardless of where I came from, I do see myself as someone who is very privileged right now.

26
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:05,640
Because of that, I am I am like you.

27
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,109
Right. Just like people at Michigan. I am at McGill.

28
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,520
We are all in the highest income countries in the world in North America.

29
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,630
And we have incredible power and privilege now.

30
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:26,940
And that should reflect in everything we think and do and act in the field of global health.

31
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:36,149
It should constantly be at the back of our minds in any engagement we have in global health, which is how I think about this myself.

32
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,010
Regardless of where I came from, I genuinely see myself as being very privileged.

33
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,540
Now, all of you, anyone who cares about global health will already know.

34
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,680
And this is no secret that global health is firmly rooted in white supremacy and colonialism.

35
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,560
Right. That's a historic fight.

36
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:06,800
And many people in global health, when you engage with them, they say, sure, we acknowledge that, but today everything is fine, right?

37
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,370
There's no problem right now, which couldn't be further away from the truth.

38
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:20,549
In fact, if you read contemporary books and I would very strongly recommend this new book by Kehinde

39
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:26,730
Andrews called The New Age of Empire How Racism and Colonialism Still Rule the World.

40
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:37,050
It's actually stunning to see how deeply neocolonial our systems are, even if colonialism, as such, is over.

41
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,810
We live in a post-colonial world. Coloniality is very much alive, right?

42
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:54,990
The systems and structures that were built hundreds of years ago still permeate how we think and do business in all aspects of of life,

43
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,400
not just global health. And understanding this is quite critical.

44
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:08,729
And a whole slew of articles and webinars and events have occurred on decolonizing global health.

45
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:15,810
I'm sure Michigan School of Public Health has also had perhaps student led events on decolonizing global health,

46
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:25,590
and identical conversations are also happening in decolonizing the development industry, the humanitarian aid industry.

47
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,520
Very, very similar conversations are happening there. And no surprise really, because global health and global development are very,

48
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,670
very similar in terms of their structures and how they're dominated by global, not countries.

49
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:44,360
And then all of you would have seen report after report coming out.

50
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,670
Wellcome Trust report on the fact that they are structurally problematic.

51
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,660
Medicins Sans Frontieres. London School. Liverpool School.

52
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,549
It's like a flood of reports coming out on how many of these global health organizations,

53
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:06,290
including really remarkable organizations like Doctors Without Borders,

54
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:13,820
which is a Nobel Prize winning organization, are all admitting that they have some serious problems that they have to deal with.

55
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:21,130
Right. And when I look at all of this and I ask myself, so so what exactly is going on here?

56
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:25,460
Right. What are these calls for decolonizing global health about?

57
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,150
What are these calls which are openly calling out structural racism within many global health organizations?

58
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,870
I ask myself, what kind of unifies all of these?

59
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:45,500
And in this article in PLOS Medicine that my friend Shea Abimbola and a whole bunch of us we wrote together during the COVID pandemic.

60
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:51,590
This elephant is kind of our understanding of what we think is happening.

61
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:57,980
I think each of us, when we talk about, you know, some of us will say there's racism.

62
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:01,129
Some of us see this capitalism as a problem.

63
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:04,430
Coloniality is a problem. White supremacy is a problem.

64
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:08,569
I think they're all different facets of the same underlying elephant.

65
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:10,879
And the elephant is global health.

66
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:22,100
This is very firmly in global development as well, is very firmly dominated by certain groups who pretty much hold all of the power and privilege.

67
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,690
And you will see soon that you and I belong in that category.

68
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,280
Right.

69
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:37,730
We are very, very powerful and privileged and everything that happens, all the systems that are in place are designed to benefit people like us.

70
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:44,870
And if you don't believe me, I will show you data quickly and walk you through it.

71
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:50,300
And there's obviously mountains of literature on this that I'm happy to share if you're interested.

72
00:07:50,690 --> 00:08:01,940
But before I get there, I often ask myself to big questions and what should scared the heck out of all of us who are interested in this in this space?

73
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:11,330
One is, can global health achieve health equity that we care about when the rest of the world is deeply unequal?

74
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:18,020
Right. We are living in one of the most inequitable worlds imaginable.

75
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:22,370
That's getting more and more inequitable by the day because of the pandemic.

76
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:28,290
So what does it even mean that global health would somehow magically achieve equity?

77
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:33,140
Even the word itself is not. That's one question what reflecting that can be.

78
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:42,440
How can any field that is inherently inequitable by the structure of the field is inherently power asymmetric?

79
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:47,330
How can that field go and tackle health inequities?

80
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,790
Right. Can an inequitable field ever address health inequities?

81
00:08:53,120 --> 00:09:02,810
Is the second question that I was reflecting, and I will show you some data which kind of back both of these questions and why I am asking them.

82
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:09,590
So. Question one. What is global health even mean in such a deeply unequal world?

83
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:19,990
And all of you know that the amount of wealth concentration that the world is seeing now is absolutely unprecedented, right?

84
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:26,460
Amount of concentration of wealth in the hands of a few people in the richest nation in the world.

85
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:35,990
It's absolutely mind boggling. So a couple of dozen of people own as much wealth as half of the world's population.

86
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:43,670
And these guys and their all men have become even more richer during this pandemic,

87
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:50,510
even as the rest of the world poorest people in the world have been pushed into extreme poverty.

88
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:57,710
These men are literally making billions as we speak.

89
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,069
And then. The reality of the world as it exists today.

90
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:10,549
And this is a spectacular, absolutely spectacular infographic by our world and data,

91
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,620
which all of you, I'm sure you know, on in inequality and living conditions.

92
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:21,590
And take a look in any any dimension here. Look at life expectancy of 84 in Japan.

93
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:30,350
52 years in Sierra Leone, mean means years of schooling, 14 years in Germany, one and a half years in Burkina Faso.

94
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:36,860
It really doesn't matter what you look at. The inequities are just absolutely staggering.

95
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,560
And so Max Roser, who's the head of our world in Data,

96
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:49,310
set this beautiful statement that where you live is in just more important than all the other characteristics.

97
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,700
It's more important than everything else put together.

98
00:10:53,450 --> 00:11:01,730
So when I teach Global Health the equivalent of your course at McGill, I tell my students, mostly Canadian students,

99
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:07,489
that just the mere fact that they are in Canada and the fact that they are at a

100
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:13,820
university like McGill automatically puts them in stratospheric levels of privilege.

101
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,210
I tell them that they have won the life's lottery, right?

102
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:25,400
That's how incredible heads up advantage that they have in every walk of life.

103
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,270
Health care, schooling, income. Doesn't matter what.

104
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:39,140
Right. And I would argue that all of you sitting at the University of Michigan in the United States would absolutely meet that criteria.

105
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:46,310
So I don't even need to know anything about any of you to make the claims that you guys have won the life's lottery.

106
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,230
I don't know if you agree with me or not, but I think that is the reality.

107
00:11:52,380 --> 00:12:03,290
Okay. So this is the way in which we live in and and the inequities that we see, whether it's the corporate vaccine coverage,

108
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:15,420
look at the shameful outcome of the vaccine, apartheid, the African continent, region, not even like one in four Africans have had two doses.

109
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:19,640
They'll get the booster shots or get the Bivalent Comic Con booster.

110
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:27,690
We're not talking about all of that yet. We're still talking about two doses, primary two doses, not even one in four people.

111
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:35,969
So I was in Kenya last week and we had an event on anti-blackness and global health and people there

112
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:42,540
were like absolutely fuming and furious about how they being left behind by the rest of the world.

113
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:54,900
I can't capture their anger and disappointment in all of us in how we have let them down, the kind of inequities seeing that COVID vaccine coverage.

114
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,639
And if that wasn't enough, and every single mistake we made with COVID 19,

115
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:06,900
we're making with monkeypox, the United States alone with 80% of the global vaccine supply.

116
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:12,960
An African continent has had zero. How is that even imaginable?

117
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,260
The continent, man and key box has ravaged for years and years as zero vaccines by.

118
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,060
You could get it in America and I could get it in Canada.

119
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:35,590
This is the sad reality. And this is this was my ramp advocates conference that the HIV epidemic it was the same thing, right?

120
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:40,050
We had access to antiretrovirals. The African region had none.

121
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:50,489
And people like to fight heroic battles for decades before ARVs became available, when Ebola was ravaging Africa, West Africa,

122
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:58,620
nobody did a thing until white people started getting Ebola and in the US and Europe and then suddenly, boom, billions of dollars invested.

123
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,950
Now, COVID, we saw that monkeypox, we see this. It's like a recurrent theme in global health.

124
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:10,800
Right. That that and that isn't a problem until it affects privileged people like us.

125
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:19,230
That's the only time the world will act or respond when the problem affects primarily black and brown people, nobody gives a damn.

126
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,220
And that and that theme runs throughout global health.

127
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,830
And so just to wrap this up, it isn't just about global health.

128
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:34,440
Look at climate crisis right now. As you all know, the COP 27 conference is underway.

129
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:43,440
And and this remarkable infographic by Jason Hickel shows that the G7 countries,

130
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:49,710
which includes U.S. and Canada, account for a majority of the carbon emissions.

131
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:53,730
Historically and today, we are the biggest consumers.

132
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:58,950
We are the biggest pollutants. There's no Western or argument about that.

133
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:07,020
And yet who is going to pay for all of this? The poorest parts of the world, Pakistan right now and sub-Saharan Africa.

134
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:12,120
Then the same inequity that we see and whether it's vaccine hoarding.

135
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:16,530
This is the strange inequity of a different kind. We consume everything.

136
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:24,480
We are the biggest carbon emitters. And then the actual Branca effect will be paid by countries in the global south.

137
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:28,589
And in fact, that infographic is also pretty staggering.

138
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:38,490
The one on the right to of the richest billionaires are making as much as 8000 times more carbon than the billion poorest people on the planet.

139
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:45,570
I mean, that's just bonkers. 8 billion people aren't even emitting as much as 20 people are.

140
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:55,470
And yet we you know, we know it's the poorest who are going to suffer from the the climate crisis that's unfolding right in front of us.

141
00:15:56,010 --> 00:16:03,690
So that's about the inequities at large. And the second is what's wrong with the field of global health, right?

142
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:10,860
Given how inherently inequitable our field is, what hope do we have of tackling inequities?

143
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:17,510
And so this, I think, is how I need all of us to kind of converge on this.

144
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:24,360
That is global health, right from the colonial times was all about us, what is good for us,

145
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:30,810
what we can extract, how we can hold on to power, money, resources, credit.

146
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:37,740
And it's then whatever we choose to donate or give, let's be charitable or be generous.

147
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,390
Oh, great.

148
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:46,700
So it's always about those of us with power and privilege and then whatever we would choose to do out of our generosity, the kindness of all.

149
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:50,970
Surrealism, right? Surrealism. That's how it is.

150
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:59,200
And look at the data. We. This is the Global Health 5050 Report on almost 200 major global health organizations around the world.

151
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,550
No surprise, they're all headquartered in North America or Europe.

152
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,520
If you want to break it down for the US and UK dominate global health.

153
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:19,520
Like extraordinarily powerful Seattle, that decisions are made at Washington, D.C. Many decisions are made Geneva, London, Paris.

154
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:29,930
These are the biggest decision making organizations, and they are far, far, far away for the poorest people, as far away from where the problems are.

155
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:37,820
And they are far away from better solutions. And yet decisions often get made that take the COVAX initiative, for example,

156
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:47,360
that COVAX initiative was conceived in a bar in Europe by a couple of guys with no consultation whatsoever with people

157
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:53,690
in low and middle income countries on how vaccine will reach them and what their desires are and what their needs are.

158
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:03,380
And this is typically how global health works, right? We make decisions on behalf of people thought a way because we think we know the answers.

159
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:09,559
We think we know it all. And we know it all because we are superior, right?

160
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,700
Because we are educated, because we are white, because we are rich,

161
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,990
because we are privileged, and therefore we will make decisions on behalf of people.

162
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:23,780
And then in the same report goes on to break down, who are the leaders of these organizations?

163
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:30,370
Right. And lo and behold, 17 out of 20 are nationals of high income countries.

164
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,970
People like us, mostly men.

165
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,850
Like me. And then three are nationals of low and middle income countries.

166
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:50,980
Right. In fact, they they've found data that just graduates of Harvard alone are the most dominant group in global health, just one university.

167
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:57,460
Harvard has such a big, outsized impact on on global health as a whole.

168
00:18:58,150 --> 00:19:02,889
And more recently, they even investigated who's sitting on the board of the Gates Foundation,

169
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:08,410
the board of Wellcome Trust, the board of GAVI, the board of UNAIDS, so on and so forth.

170
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:16,450
And look at that graphic. Barely 3% of the board seats are held by nationals of low income countries.

171
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,310
Half the board seats are just accounted for by U.S. and U.K.

172
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:30,310
That's what I meant when I said U.S. and U.K. pretty much people and organizations in these two countries pretty much run global health.

173
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:41,600
And then where do all the global health grants go? FOGARTY Wellcome Trust, USAID, its foundation about 70 to 80%.

174
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,840
And these are all data from from these organizations themselves.

175
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:53,459
Great. 70 to 80% of all the grants and contracts go to groups and organizations in the richest countries

176
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:58,980
in the world for would be money or USAID money would primarily go to University of Michigan,

177
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:05,010
will go to contractors in Washington, D.C. That's like the Wellcome Trust Fund primarily go to London School,

178
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:13,740
Liverpool School, Oxford, so on and so forth. This is how global health grants and funds follow a very familiar pattern.

179
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:22,320
Who's publishing in global health? Study after study even show that we people like you and me will be the first authors.

180
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:30,630
We will be the senior authors and folks in low and middle income countries if they are on the paper call and we know there's a bunch of them,

181
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,660
but they don't even figure. Right. We call that attitude research.

182
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:44,160
If you leave aside that issue of helicopter research, a side effect on low and middle income countries are on the paper dancing right in the middle.

183
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:47,520
They're neither the Leeds nor are they senior authors.

184
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:55,530
And likewise, we look at the our paper, look at global health journals and we look at the editorial board composition.

185
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:06,480
Most global journal editors are people like us, like folks in the highest income countries, mostly men dominate global health journals.

186
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,500
So there we go. No, that was just a very quick tour.

187
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:18,290
We could have spent a lot more time on this. But that brings me back to the elephant ride.

188
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:29,120
If every single facet of global health is dominated by folks like us, then and this is structurally deeply problematic.

189
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,600
Right? And then what are we going to do about it?

190
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:36,740
It's now a question worth asking in specific.

191
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,200
I am speaking to you because you are like me.

192
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:50,600
I'm like you. What is our role now that we know and understand that we are the prime beneficiaries of global health historically and today,

193
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,390
and that we have be whole, extraordinary power and privilege in this field.

194
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:06,350
I bet you one day when you graduate from University of Michigan and you become professors or wherever you end up going in your career,

195
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:09,800
you will be part of this power structure. You already are.

196
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:18,200
I am sure. So I ask myself, what is it that we can do to tackle the power asymmetries?

197
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,400
But it's not a question of what we are willing to do.

198
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:29,120
We should also flip this and say, What are the groups that ought to be in the driver's seat?

199
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,570
What are their dreams, desire and aspirations?

200
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:38,550
And this graphic. I have spent a lot of time tinkering with this and developing this.

201
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:46,430
And the more I see this, the more I kind of say, man, this is what I should have learned early on in my career.

202
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:53,460
As I see it. Global Health and development is firmly in the first column right now.

203
00:22:54,060 --> 00:23:05,880
Right. We see global health as an act of charity, philanthropy, aid donations, development assistance, saviors and kindness.

204
00:23:06,450 --> 00:23:10,440
Right. And all of that fosters dependency on us.

205
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:15,300
Right. We want other countries to be beholden to us, to be dependent on us.

206
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:27,550
This is how Global North likes it. And if you've seen all this about COVID vaccine, donations make charitable work, compassionate work.

207
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,550
All of that falls into the first column.

208
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:40,150
And when you talk to people in the Global South, like I did when I was in Kenya last week, they're saying we don't want any of your charity.

209
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,640
Right. We want to lead. We want a victim in our own destiny.

210
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:49,090
We have agency. We have autonomy.

211
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:57,520
We need to be treated with respect. And whatever access we are looking for is not charity, but as a matter of human rights.

212
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:01,990
If you have a right to COVID vaccine, I have it, too, is what they're saying.

213
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,790
Right. Because health is a fundamental human right, according to the UN Charter.

214
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:13,210
It's a non-negotiable human right. So they're saying justice is what they're looking for, right?

215
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:21,310
That we have every right to survive and thrive and we need access to medicines, whatever it is that we need.

216
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:29,979
We need to be publishing our work. We need to be taking ownership of our research and self-determination and self.

217
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,220
Sustenance is exactly what they're asking for.

218
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:38,350
Right. And scores of people have been writing about that, especially during COVID.

219
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:47,870
Right. And so when I look at column and column B, I'm like, the more we understand column B, right.

220
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,240
And the more we those of us who are in that privileged group back that mission as allies,

221
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,930
the better off the field of global health is going to become. Right.

222
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:09,460
And and and during the pandemic, the African region in particular, has been feeling so brutally left out.

223
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:17,940
Right. I mean, you look at the continent, it's pretty much dark when it comes to COVID vaccines, monkeypox, vaccine, access to accelerate.

224
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:22,570
I don't care what dimension of global outlook you will always see.

225
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:26,180
The map look pretty much black for Africa there like.

226
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:33,040
No, nothing like that. Right. And so last week, this whole conference on anti-blackness.

227
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:39,250
Boy, that was like rough. It was rough just listening to them.

228
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:46,280
They just smashed every one. Right? Like I was sitting there and listening to this, they came to me and said, Professor Pie,

229
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:52,060
do you know how challenging your country, Canada, is even to come and give a talk in a conference?

230
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:59,530
I'm like, I'm sorry. I have no I have nothing to offer but apologies because I know what they're saying is factually true.

231
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:09,860
Right. And so whether it's John Anderson, the former Africa CDC director, talking about why Africa must be self-sufficient,

232
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:16,210
we need the UN and the head of UNAIDS talking about why African leadership is critical.

233
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:22,150
This is what they're saying. Self-determination and justice is what they're really looking for.

234
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:33,260
And understanding this and respectfully getting behind that agenda and being supportive as possible as allies, I genuinely think is important.

235
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:44,110
Right. So they need to take and claim their rightful place at the table, not out of act of charity, but out of an act of right and justice.

236
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:52,780
Right. This is fundamental for any kind of decolonization to happen, and global decolonization should never be about us.

237
00:26:53,420 --> 00:27:01,960
Colonization truly is about that. Indigenous people, black people, what they want, what their vision is, and what they want to get done.

238
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:06,880
That's what decolonization is truly a book. In fact, if you look back into the history.

239
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:11,740
Decolonization really was about returning the land back to indigenous people.

240
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:15,830
I mean, the land was stolen. Right. Look at Canada.

241
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,110
We are we are a secular colonial country.

242
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:23,790
Right. So we right now I am on indigenous land that has been stolen from them.

243
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:29,760
So you can't really talk about decolonizing without understanding reparations, right?

244
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:33,269
Reparations, restitution, understanding.

245
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:39,300
All of this is critical for decolonizing. The flipside of this is those of us who are in the first column.

246
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:47,310
Right, the powerful, the privileged. I ask myself, so what is my role in it, regardless of where I came from?

247
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:53,190
In a hand. Right. And like you, I have to ask myself, is there any role for me at all?

248
00:27:53,730 --> 00:28:01,710
If so, what is it? Right. How do I contribute to the field of global health without making matters worse than what it is already?

249
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:10,060
And as of today, the only way I could resolve this in my head and I might change my mind right now.

250
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:14,170
Authentic allyship is the only part I see for myself.

251
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:24,870
I don't see any other way out of this problem. I know we are in a messed up, inequitable field, and I know I'm a beneficiary of that.

252
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,100
And I know I'm very powerful in the nation with all of that.

253
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:36,360
What do I do? Is a question I keep asking myself. So authentic allyship, not white savior ism.

254
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:40,260
Right. There's a huge difference in how we approach global health.

255
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,969
All of us could have easily approached global health through the lens of white savior,

256
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:50,590
as I promise you that hundreds of people love that we're approaching it like we think.

257
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:57,060
They genuinely think they need to go and see people, black and brown people in low income countries.

258
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:04,500
And we have to save indigenous people. That's white savior as white symbolism is not just about white people.

259
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,930
I can have that exact mindset of a white savior even though I'm brown.

260
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:16,829
Okay, so we abandon white savior ism as our lens, an authentic, real flagship.

261
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:21,120
And we'll talk more about what radio versus fake allyship is all about.

262
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:30,959
But this is how I'm thinking about again. That article, with scores of people quoted in it, is a great starting point for all of you to explore.

263
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,830
What will you do in your life to walk the path of election?

264
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:42,570
So a few preliminary talk to the nation.

265
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:52,750
So first of all, if you truly want to understand power privilege in an election, I argue you need structure training by people who really know this.

266
00:29:52,770 --> 00:30:01,259
Well, can I ask how many people in this class have had a structured workshop?

267
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:05,460
A class on power, privilege and oppression and anti-racism?

268
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,720
How many of you have had that? To two people.

269
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,450
Right. Okay. Three. All right.

270
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:28,780
So if you haven't, please go ahead and get that kind of training from people who are really qualified to teach this.

271
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:33,710
Right. I have been through something like 8 hours of structured training in this area.

272
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,170
Okay. Every time I go through this, my eyes just pop open, right.

273
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,330
Because I learn so much from this. Right.

274
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:50,389
After George Floyd's murder, there were quite a few people teaching and organizing workshops on anti-racism, like How to Be an Anti-Racist.

275
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:53,900
There are books out there, and I think those books are fine.

276
00:30:54,740 --> 00:31:03,050
You can get educated somewhat to that, but this is like serious work learning and it's a necessary learning.

277
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:08,240
And the fact that I, I went through all of this training in the last two years, I'm ashamed about it.

278
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:12,320
I should have gotten back when I was a grad student at Berkeley ten years ago.

279
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,540
Right. And there was no such thing being discussed around me.

280
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,870
But it's not too late for all of you. You're all young. You're in your mask desperately.

281
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,700
Now is the time you go and get that structured training. If you wish.

282
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:28,730
I can send some resources to Ryan and Ryan if you want to.

283
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:35,150
Kind of, I'm sure. I promise you, there are people at University of Michigan who are designed to teach this.

284
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:41,990
In fact, black people. It's who you look for. Black and indigenous people are the people you learn this from.

285
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:51,230
Although I've also learned it from a white woman in an outstanding job that I invited her to in my global health class that I'd be happy to do.

286
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,920
There are like 3 hours of instruction just on this.

287
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:59,240
It's baked into my syllabus. It's not an add on.

288
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:06,080
It's deep core part of my syllabus. And it has made a phenomenal difference to my students in my class.

289
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:14,170
So this is one power and privilege deal diagram that if you took a course like what I did, you will be kind of exposed to.

290
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:22,540
So take a look at this. Well, I mean, it's full circle and there's a website where you can download back from right.

291
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,390
When you go to this training, they will tell you to use a wheel diagram like this and map yourself.

292
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:35,990
Okay. The closer you are to the center, the read part, the more powerful and privileged you are.

293
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:44,200
And if you map yourself on the Outrage of the Week, the less and less privilege you're more likely to be oppressed rather than privileged.

294
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:53,090
Right. So take a look. If you are white, you make yourself at the at the in terms of the color dimension, you make yourself in the center.

295
00:32:53,510 --> 00:33:01,129
If you're a male, cisgender, white settler, light skinned, European heritage, Christian, no disability,

296
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:06,860
neurotypical, robust, mental, how you can map all of that and you will see where you land.

297
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,580
Right. What stunned me was when I if if if you attempted.

298
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:16,649
When did this to me? I would have said, Oh, but I came from India.

299
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:20,700
I'm a brown guy. I'm an immigrant, right? I don't see myself as very privileged.

300
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:24,750
But when I finished this training. I promise you.

301
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:29,640
But for the fact that I'm not white, I pretty much checked every damn box that was.

302
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:36,480
That's what made me realize how ridiculously privileged and powerful someone like me is.

303
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,620
I bet you if you went through it, you will find yourself closer to the center than.

304
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:50,940
Than than at the edge. Right. Just the fact that baby R and R education and R and R, you know, rich countries that we live in,

305
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,920
all of this plays a big role right now from this intersectional lens.

306
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,100
And intersectionality is inherent in this picture. Right.

307
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:07,560
You can be, you know, simultaneously privileged on one axis and be sanctimoniously, oppressed or another axis.

308
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,790
Right. So I'm a male and privileged when I'm not white.

309
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,940
So that could open me up to racist attacks.

310
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:18,470
Right. So all of that is part of that training.

311
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,410
So you cannot do this training without intersectionality at the heart of it.

312
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,410
Right. And intersectionality is also a core component.

313
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:32,819
And in my class, I had someone come given our lecture just in black and white matters in global, so formally intersectional.

314
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:37,230
And then this is how we learn. It's like that's how I structure the Forbes piece.

315
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:42,690
White people in global health must be allies to black, indigenous and people of color.

316
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,430
Global, not folks like us must be allies to global talk people.

317
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,660
Men like me must be allies to women and global white women be allies to black women.

318
00:34:55,290 --> 00:35:01,139
Right. So it's hetero folks must be allies to LGBTQ and so on and so on and so on.

319
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:05,370
But it never ends because that's what intersectionality is all about, right?

320
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,810
Would always find new dimensions to work through.

321
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:20,160
So with that broad understanding of how power, privilege and oppression operates, what's allyship and how do we go about it?

322
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:26,700
Right. So and night shift as defined by this group, it's an active, consistent,

323
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:32,309
arduous practice of unlearning and reevaluating in which a person in a position

324
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:37,080
of privilege and power seeks to operate in solidarity with a marginalized group.

325
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:47,370
And I already gave you examples of people who are in power and privilege and which group do they need to show up and show solidarity with?

326
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:57,320
Right. That's inherent in how I am written this. So the big thing that I learned is that our nation is not unknown.

327
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:02,810
It's a world. If you stop working on it, you no longer and right.

328
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:09,520
If you work on a it's not something you check off and then you disappear and you come back like two years later that same year.

329
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:16,819
But it's like it's a constant practice, it's a way of living, and you've got to keep on working on it.

330
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:21,910
The minute you stop putting in the hard work, you don't qualify to be called a nominee.

331
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,920
And it's not something that I called myself, right?

332
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:32,719
I don't tell someone, Hey, I knew that I like one day if I do my job well, they will say, You know what, my door is at my door.

333
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:39,200
Then I think they need to find that aspect and call you that you don't call yourself anyway.

334
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,459
And it's not about acting out of guilt like that.

335
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:53,330
Is this white guilt that somehow we have been privileged and then whatever we did or we didn't do, it's not about that.

336
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:59,479
It's about acting out of responsibility, and it's definitely not trying to save people at all.

337
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,060
We should be showing solidarity, right?

338
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:10,190
So in terms of responsibilities, every inch of the way, we acknowledge our power and privilege, just as I did when I started this talk.

339
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:14,750
You got to start with a very, very humble self-reflection, right?

340
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:19,190
We bring our capacity to receive criticism. So when you do this kind of work.

341
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:24,630
We will get carved out. We will make mistakes, we will get feedback.

342
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:33,210
And we've got to learn, learn to take that criticism and not just what shall I say, not be fragile about it.

343
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,200
You can't just be mean, never center on ourselves.

344
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:43,140
That's, I think, a critical part of being in L.A. If your relationship work and you're constantly

345
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:48,180
worried about yourself and your comfort and what you can do or what's bothering you,

346
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,050
none of that matters. I like ship is not about us, right?

347
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:55,560
I like ship. It's truly about those who are most oppressed.

348
00:37:56,010 --> 00:38:00,300
And our job is to not center ourselves, to focus on themselves.

349
00:38:00,930 --> 00:38:03,750
And we take direction from the people we seek to work with.

350
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:12,500
So if you engaged in an act of allyship with people in low income countries, they are the ones that should be telling you what needs to get done.

351
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:18,540
And it's your job to listen to them, not to talk over them and say, Hey, I know what needs to be done.

352
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:24,000
I'll come to Kenya and I'll tell you how to run your country or how to run your program.

353
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:29,940
That is the opposite of allyship. And allyship requires us to do the education ourselves.

354
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:35,820
We shouldn't be expecting black people to educate us. We shouldn't be expecting people in the Global South to educate us.

355
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:43,530
We do that damn hard work and learn and get better, and we definitely don't demand a plaque on the wall.

356
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:48,150
Nobody should be writing me, you know, certificate saying Madu was a good ally.

357
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:57,350
That's not the way this works. You just put in the damn hard work quietly, silently, and expect no regard or special recognition for anything we do.

358
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:04,410
And that's why a lot of people don't understand how you can be an ally and do

359
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:09,030
nothing because you won't be on an ally when it's nice and comfortable to you.

360
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:13,580
When the going gets hard, you disappear. You're not that right.

361
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,430
Unless you're Giuliani, it's having a skin in the game.

362
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:28,110
The willingness to give up something, the willingness to be uncomfortable, the willingness to cede our space resources, pass on the mike.

363
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,190
So if you're not willing to give up anything, then you absolutely have nothing to do with that action.

364
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:41,100
Right. Then you're not a real ally, and you will disappear the first hint of trouble because you're not comfortable anymore.

365
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:50,700
Right. So some people don't like the term for that reason because they think that allyship is widely abused and that it's got no meaning left in it.

366
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,570
So they're saying think become an active ally.

367
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:59,010
Right. Have you heard of the active bystander? To be an active bystander.

368
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,780
This is something along those lines.

369
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:07,290
You've got to be an active ally, which means you speak up against the injustice when you see it right, you stand up.

370
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:12,510
If someone is being racially profiled or abused, you're willing to take some risks.

371
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,730
But on that gradation of being more active, I,

372
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:22,230
like some people say you need to be an accomplice more than a way and others to say you need to be even more than that.

373
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,500
You need to be a coconspirator or a collaborator.

374
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:31,470
What separates a coconspirator from an ally is the willingness to put ourselves on the line.

375
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:35,310
Whether it's assets, reputations, tie in connections, other resources.

376
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,280
Coconspirators always have a skin in the game.

377
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:46,410
In short, a coconspirator will try to actively dismantle the structures that are holding people back and repressing them.

378
00:40:46,950 --> 00:40:50,760
Right. That is true liberation, as it were.

379
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:56,970
Right. Liberation is when you've gotten rid of the structural problems and everybody has equity.

380
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,990
Right. That is the hardest form of allyship.

381
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:06,690
And that means we are willing to disrupt, build and dismantle for the future that we want to see.

382
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,320
So now those of you are wondering, you know, what the [INAUDIBLE] is this anything to do with global health?

383
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:16,110
I will now talk to you about some concrete examples.

384
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:22,350
I will list a few and if you want during the Q&A to talk more about any of them, I'm happy to do that.

385
00:41:22,350 --> 00:41:30,630
Right. So firstly, during this pandemic, we could all be and have been advocating for more donations.

386
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:34,440
Why isn't America donating more vaccines or perhaps clothing or whatever?

387
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:42,480
I have pleaded with my government and Canada to do more vaccine donations, so that could be seen as an act of allyship.

388
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:47,640
But it still means donations. It still means charity.

389
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,580
It's not true liberation. Right. Because low income countries are still beholden to us.

390
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,990
They're still begging to us for vaccines. And we don't want to be in this position.

391
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,690
This is not save. It isn't what charity low income country said we had done with your donations.

392
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:10,080
We. It's the broken model that's not working. Give us the vaccine recipe will make it right.

393
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,840
We'll make our own vaccines. We'll save ourselves.

394
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:22,920
Just give us the technology or waive the troops IP and we will manufacture whatever it is that we need medicines, tests, vaccines.

395
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:34,950
And so supporting the the calls that hundreds of hundreds of countries made to waive the trip's IP to me would have been through ACTA coconspirators.

396
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:40,770
We would have dismantle the IP barriers that would have made the whole world safer

397
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:45,750
because the African region would have made the moon and made their own Moderna vaccines.

398
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:50,010
Everybody in the world would have been a much more healthier place.

399
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,639
And many, many countries making their own vaccines and products.

400
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:00,120
Right. That is a difference between saying donate more versus dismantle the structure

401
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:04,199
that's preventing countries from making their own products and saving them.

402
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,120
So today, I hope you can see the difference between our leadership and coconspirators here.

403
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,219
Right. And Ryan mentioned the whole issue of the visa apartheid.

404
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:20,820
Right. So the piece that I wrote in Forbes on passport and visa privileges and protocol, that kind of went white.

405
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:23,910
And I wrote back well before the AIDS conference.

406
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:29,030
And so at the AIDS conference, and it was in my city, Montreal, I show up there.

407
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:39,090
That was all panel on decolonizing AIDS response by UNAIDS and black people were absolutely outraged at the conference.

408
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:44,820
All of you know that no country has suffered more from HIV AIDS than the African region.

409
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,670
And here we are. Africans had the hardest time coming to Canada.

410
00:43:51,990 --> 00:43:55,170
How on earth do you justify this? Right.

411
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,940
The conference that afternoon absolutely should have been in the leadership role.

412
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:05,790
They were made to feel the most marginalized, dehumanized.

413
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:12,810
And they were absolutely outraged. Head of your needs was given a hard time to come to Canada.

414
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:19,530
And more recently, the head of Africa, CDC had a hard time going to the Berlin Wall to summit.

415
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:28,530
And these are leaders in global health for. And for every one high profile event like that, there are thousands of people who don't even get to apply.

416
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:33,580
What a bizarre. Right. The anger was so palpable.

417
00:44:33,590 --> 00:44:38,320
I mean, that's an actual photograph from the AIDS conference. Look at all the empty chairs and panels.

418
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:41,570
Not one panelist made it to Montreal.

419
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:46,760
Right. So what is what does all of this really mean?

420
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:54,470
And you and I honestly, you and I live in some of the world's most bizarre, hostile countries.

421
00:44:55,810 --> 00:45:03,040
Right. And if you have an American passport or Canadian passport or a European passport, you have no idea what I'm talking about.

422
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:08,040
You don't know what I'm talking about because you own that privilege, right?

423
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:12,030
It's like white people don't know what white privilege is because they don't see it.

424
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:19,650
It's the exact same thing. If you have a passport that U.S. or Canada, we can pretty much walk into any country.

425
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:26,909
Ryan wants to go to Kenya next week. You can I can I got a visa for, you know, Kenya in like 10 minutes.

426
00:45:26,910 --> 00:45:31,660
I uploaded some stuff online and paid a $50. Next morning, I had a visa.

427
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,690
Right. Try getting that to come to America.

428
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,780
Right. There are African countries right now.

429
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:45,750
If they wanted to come to Michigan and you invited them, their first visa appointment availability is 2024.

430
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:53,860
And this is the rubbish world they're living in. That's how unequal this this field is.

431
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:57,940
So we can waltz into any country invited on an invite.

432
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:02,590
Right. Just get on the plane and go. How powerful is that?

433
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:08,440
Right. And then you invite someone and you even willing to pay for their travel to come to Michigan.

434
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:13,030
I promise you, you cannot get them there because your government would not let them in.

435
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:20,560
Same is what happened to me. I invite people to McGill and they are denied a visa by the Canadian government.

436
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:25,389
This rubbish is just. It was bad for a long time.

437
00:46:25,390 --> 00:46:31,100
Right? This is a new. But because of this pandemic or whatever, all the the.

438
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:35,500
The xenophobia that's underneath the surface is now pretty much open public.

439
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,749
Right. Every country feels empowered to do whatever racist rubbish that they want.

440
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:48,250
Right. We banned a whole bunch of African countries and American variant was what's discovered, right?

441
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,290
Is it? No, they can't come right.

442
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:57,310
This kind of stuff is happening and it's happening so frequently that you wonder whether this is just by design, right?

443
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:05,980
This cannot be just an accident. So this was a huge issue in this anti-blackness meeting that I attended in Nairobi last week.

444
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:13,090
People were just boiling with anger. And what kind of messed up racist system is this thing?

445
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:16,899
So when you say, oh, come to our conference, I mean,

446
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:23,440
there was a tropical medicine conference in Seattle, this six tropical medicine conference in Seattle.

447
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:28,510
I want you to think about that for a second and tell me what on earth is that all about?

448
00:47:29,470 --> 00:47:32,680
What tropical diseases do you know happened in Seattle?

449
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,650
Who's dying there of of human African trypanosomiasis or whatever.

450
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:46,020
Right. What are we. When we host a conference on HIV AIDS with people in Africa, you know, will struggle to.

451
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:54,820
What are you actually telling them? You're telling them we're going to be talking about you that we're okay if you're not and that.

452
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:02,070
Isn't that correct? That is the exact message that's being transmitted.

453
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:06,810
We're going to talk about tropical diseases. We are okay if you're not here.

454
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,560
Right. This is how every aspect of global health is being played out.

455
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:18,950
Right. And I'm like, first of all, I don't even understand why there is a school of tropical medicine in 2022.

456
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,879
What the [INAUDIBLE] is that all about? How colonial is that?

457
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:27,630
Even that term? London School of Tropical Medicine.

458
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:32,100
Kidding me, right? And then they publish a report that they're actually racist.

459
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:38,549
I'm like, What the [INAUDIBLE] is this? Like, I can't even start to understand what all of this means, but I'm starting to see it.

460
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,390
And once you see it, you cannot unscathed. Okay.

461
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:50,189
Honestly, I genuinely believe that after this talk, the way you approach many of this global health business will be more critical.

462
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:53,850
Because I promise you, once you see it, you cannot see this, right?

463
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:58,230
You see the naked problems in front of your face.

464
00:48:58,620 --> 00:49:01,950
Male relation men dominate global health.

465
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:06,520
Men like me. Every part of global health is dominated by men.

466
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:10,190
In fact, it isn't just men. It's Whiteman.

467
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:16,670
It's older Whiteman. Nobody is more powerful than global health and older white men.

468
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:22,200
And I think that will be true for all parts of life. Nobody dominates the world.

469
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:27,709
And over to Wiki, right? That's the group that's making decisions for the rest of the world.

470
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:31,940
Right. And you look at the climate conference, did you see that picture from Corporatism?

471
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:41,450
And it's like pretty much an all male leaders conference and men and I will say this with humility as a male.

472
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:47,900
Men can be disastrous as leaders. We saw the failures of men during the pandemic.

473
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:55,490
We have seen them fail on climate crisis. And so the lack of women leadership is genuinely hurting the world.

474
00:49:56,030 --> 00:50:00,350
And we and these men will never concede that and we will not think about it.

475
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:08,840
But I've written a whole piece on what men like me ought to be doing, because we tend to absolutely corner all real estate.

476
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:14,340
And in global health, it's not just all male panels, a conference like Dominating the world.

477
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:18,500
We look at G7 and G20. It's pretty much all men, right?

478
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,400
And these guys are making the biggest decisions that impact the world.

479
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:28,280
They are the ones who decided not to share vaccines. They are the ones who decided not to back the trip's hype.

480
00:50:28,670 --> 00:50:31,940
They are the ones who continue to support fossil fuels.

481
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:41,780
Every aspect of the world is is decided by men, and that's turning out to be absolutely catastrophic for the whole planet.

482
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:48,500
Okay. So there's something important to discuss. Global health journalists, how do they walk the path of our nation?

483
00:50:48,530 --> 00:50:54,109
So I'm I'm I'm very proud with this little experiment in doing this.

484
00:50:54,110 --> 00:51:02,390
Global Health Journal was intentionally constructed to overcome all of the problems that the contemporary journals and global health have.

485
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,880
You look at the editorial board, it's a black African woman who is my fellow editor in chief.

486
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:13,400
If you look at the editorial board, about 50% of the editorial board is from the Global South.

487
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:19,820
We're intentionally doing everything that the standard journals in global health have failed to do.

488
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:25,759
The entire tune is centered on amplifying people normally not going to be visible,

489
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,810
and that's not going to be visible in any of the major global health journals.

490
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:34,910
So it's a work in progress. It's only a year since we started. Long ways to go.

491
00:51:35,390 --> 00:51:42,400
This is how you think intentionally at every stage. And you make sure you don't make the mistakes of the global health journals.

492
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:48,140
I've written a whole piece on global health training right until this pandemic.

493
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:57,440
You know, I used to teach global health, but I never centered it on black indigenous people and people from the Global South the way I do today.

494
00:51:57,950 --> 00:52:05,540
Today, if you look at my curriculum, much of the content is taught my colleagues and I, of course, I pay them in honorarium for their time.

495
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:11,470
I don't take their labor for free, but I have so many colleagues from the Global South that people,

496
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:19,610
indigenous people helping me teach my students and what a difference it has made to send to my course and people with lived experience.

497
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:25,380
It's absolutely dramatic the impact that the course has on my students.

498
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:32,870
So that's one way you can actually decolonize your global health curriculum and totally flip the way we do things.

499
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:41,300
Now I'm ready to kind of wrap this up by giving you this final piece of information or advice.

500
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:48,219
So. A lot of people in that piece that I wrote told me that relationship should

501
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:53,190
never be seen as privileged people somehow saving the less privileged people.

502
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,870
That is just a bad way of framing it. It's exactly the opposite of where we should be going.

503
00:52:59,470 --> 00:53:03,910
It's the collective liberation. I think we should all be working towards.

504
00:53:04,210 --> 00:53:07,630
And I think this Australian Indigenous and.

505
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:10,880
This quote is very famous.

506
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:17,660
And if you think about this quote for a minute, I mean, you stated that you start to understand and appreciate why this is so powerful.

507
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,680
So she says, if you have come to help me, you're wasting your time.

508
00:53:23,570 --> 00:53:29,600
But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let's work together.

509
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:37,990
Right. I can imagine. In a deeply divided, racially divided country like America.

510
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:47,750
Right. If you want to be an ally to black people in America who have suffered for centuries from the days of slavery day to day.

511
00:53:49,240 --> 00:53:54,760
And if you believe in Black Lives Matter and you want to show up as an ally to black people in America,

512
00:53:55,180 --> 00:54:01,470
you can almost see how a black person is telling you, You've come to help me, you're wasting your time.

513
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:08,860
But if black and white and every race benefits from dismantling racism,

514
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:16,030
the structures that hold white supremacy and pay them, then all of us are liberated from this problem.

515
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:24,180
Right. Because racism is bad for everybody. A deeply divided, racialised, racially divided society.

516
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:29,470
It is catastrophic for everybody. So dismantling that is benefiting everyone.

517
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:33,190
That's our collective goal. Our goal is collective liberation.

518
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:40,930
And therefore, working together makes sense, but not saving someone or not as acting out of guilt.

519
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:44,350
But this is a totally different approach doing this.

520
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:51,370
So this requires us to think deep and hard about how we show up as allies and how we take

521
00:54:51,850 --> 00:54:57,400
guidance from people who are the ones who are suffering the most and most oppressed,

522
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:01,030
and how we show up and be allies to support them.

523
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:09,400
So I hope this was helpful to you and I know this is a lot and you have tons of questions bubbling in your head.

524
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:15,140
And Ryan, thank you for even thinking of including this in your course.

525
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:24,220
I bet you most global health courses anywhere in North America would have not even the faintest taste of this way of thinking or doing.

526
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:29,770
I myself didn't include all of this content in my global headquarters until the last three or four years.

527
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:31,150
So it's a work in progress.

528
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:39,230
But I have a feeling and I have a very good feeling that young people connect to this material way better than the generations.

529
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:49,180
Right. Because they can see the immediate advantages of this way of thinking and they generally are much more open about that.

530
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:58,810
So when we recently did a whole two hour session on power and privilege in my school, most faculty did not show up for that session.

531
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:07,090
Student debt. Right. So that just tells me that there's some fundamental issue that young people just get it.

532
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:15,790
They see it. Right. That it's the older generation and genuinely cannot see it and able to predict is the older generation which will have that right.

533
00:56:15,790 --> 00:56:20,350
See it as an approach to global health, which is one of our leadership and solidarity.

534
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:25,570
Thanks, everyone. Thank you so much.

535
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:31,960
Stopped by and I think we have a little bit of time for questions if anybody has any.

536
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:43,150
Questions there are looking very. I'll ask one more.

537
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,040
You all think one. Thank you for coming to class today.

538
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:52,460
Dr. Pi and I did see someone in the chat mentioned that they would appreciate the resources that you had mentioned earlier.

539
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,810
Just one quick question about the conferences. What do you think is kind of like the solution there?

540
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:04,370
Like, should should the should the International AIDS Conference be held in Africa?

541
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:11,270
Or is is it also we need to work on like the recent problem of getting allowing

542
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:15,020
global health scholars in other countries easier access to coming here as Ebola.

543
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,120
What what do you think is most important there?

544
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:25,730
So I have written a whole piece about that, which I'm putting in the chat box to get back to the piece on passport and visa privilege.

545
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:30,710
Absolutely. HIV AIDS conferences should be held in the African region.

546
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:37,490
Right. And in fact, when it was held in the African region, it was not the most spectacular conferences.

547
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:44,370
Right. Every time I go to a tuberculosis conference in Paris or Barcelona or wherever.

548
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:48,500
What's this? I had I went to Kenya last week for tuberculosis conference.

549
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:56,750
19 day difference. Right. Just having people who are most impacted, people who have lived experience,

550
00:57:57,110 --> 00:58:02,930
people living with HIV, people who suffered from TB to have them come and talk about it.

551
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:07,250
It just inspires the heck out of you. Right. It changes the way you approach it.

552
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:14,680
Having them dominate the agenda, having them construct the agenda, mix and night and day difference to the to the conference.

553
00:58:14,690 --> 00:58:20,150
Right. So absolutely, we've got to start moving conferences to wherever the problem is that we discussing.

554
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:25,790
Right. So no no conference on malaria in San Francisco makes zero sense to me.

555
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:29,090
Absolutely. And it sounds to work the differently.

556
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:37,220
But when we do host meetings in Michigan, McGill or wherever we go to push arguments very hard on this issue.

557
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:42,440
But I have a feeling that you would run right against this far right groups.

558
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:47,270
Right. Because border closing borders is a far right strategy.

559
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,450
Anti-immigration and refugee is exactly how far right works.

560
00:58:52,850 --> 00:58:56,120
So how right is all about finding a group to hate? Right.

561
00:58:56,570 --> 00:59:00,740
It's Mexicans who are bad people. It's like Chinese or bad people.

562
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:04,219
It's like these immigrants who are destroying our world.

563
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:08,720
Right? The greed. That anger in the China letter to the ports.

564
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:16,040
Right. It's a winning strategy for them. Just like far right will always use scientific anti-science as a strategy.

565
00:59:16,070 --> 00:59:19,570
Right. These are structured ways of how they become powerful.

566
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:26,270
Right. So you will have a problem, right? I mean, you can't even defend reproductive rights in your country right now.

567
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:31,300
How do you go and defend anything, anywhere else?

568
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,230
Internally, you have such massive problems, right?

569
00:59:35,590 --> 00:59:41,290
That's what when whenever I talk to students in America in particular, I tell them, like,

570
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:50,000
before you get on a plane and go and try to save someone in Africa, think hard about what's happening in your own country, for God sakes.

571
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,999
Right. School shootings.

572
00:59:52,000 --> 01:00:00,400
I mean, how many kids have to get slaughtered before your leaders wake up and act like you've lost your abortion rights that women have,

573
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:04,090
people have died for them to acquire, and now that's gone.

574
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:11,530
You have a massive problem with some global help, I would argue, is also shining a light internally that you got to see.

575
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:16,870
Our world is messed up here and we better show up and do something right.

576
01:00:17,230 --> 01:00:22,420
Beyond. Beyond voting, beyond organizing. So I will just say this.

577
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:29,860
My course, a global health course became very dark in the last few years because I myself am not feeling good.

578
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,010
None of us will fine right now.

579
01:00:32,680 --> 01:00:41,020
I can't imagine any of you will find the pandemic and the madness and the UN elections and the tensions that you are all seeing.

580
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:44,710
It's a very difficult place for all of you as it is for me.

581
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:49,960
So my course got darker and darker and angrier and just outraged all the time.

582
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:55,480
So this this year I decided that I can depress the heck out of young people in my course.

583
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:57,220
I want to do something constructive.

584
01:00:57,460 --> 01:01:06,220
So I started bringing people, movements, people who are actually spearheading people movements to either end violence,

585
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:12,070
you know, people who are looking for vaccine equity, people who are mobilizing.

586
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:20,590
And I want some hopeful messages on how you can and I can together we can try and disrupt some of this crazy things we've seen.

587
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:26,409
Right. So, Jonathan, to go back to your point, it will not be easy for you to advocate for the government.

588
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:31,150
That visa should be easier because you hit against this immediate wall.

589
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:37,510
Building walls is how rich countries think. Virtual walls like and real wants.

590
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:45,219
Right. So it's it's it's like a dead in the water proposition that people like you and I have influence on that.

591
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:53,380
Right. The only way to have influence is to get bad people out of those places and elect good people in.

592
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,880
And that's not been easy for you. Right. Next question.

593
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:08,830
Oh, Sarah, go ahead. Hi.

594
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:12,190
So I'm actually in the Health Behavior and Health Education program,

595
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:17,590
and we have a lot of discussions around systemic issues and how you account for them.

596
01:02:18,190 --> 01:02:25,300
And one of the discussions we've had, and I'd like to bring that question to you, is within academia, particularly since, as you said, the.

597
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:32,879
Majority of opinions is that we don't necessarily need to think into all of these issues or consider them or reflect on them necessarily.

598
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:37,830
A lot of people just go in and do their work, how they're going to do it, regardless of the communities they're entering into.

599
01:02:38,310 --> 01:02:44,970
And so if those individuals, like you said about, you know, offering a lecture and not having the majority of the faculty attend,

600
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:46,799
when you're providing these options,

601
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:54,540
like what more can you do to try to change how people in academia think about these things when they don't want to engage?

602
01:02:56,110 --> 01:03:03,660
I don't have an answer to this, Sarah, because academia or the incentive structure is very, very different.

603
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:11,580
We are rewarded for publishing, rewarded for bringing money, and we're not rewarded necessarily for doing the right thing.

604
01:03:12,090 --> 01:03:20,270
Right? Right. Our internal structure, every aspect of our structure is pushing us to be more self-centered self-promotion.

605
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:22,830
Right. We all have to brag about ourselves.

606
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:31,230
Get more money, more grants, have more power, build a larger lab, have more students, is how all of academia works, right?

607
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:37,380
So? So anyone who wants to do the right thing, for example, be an ally.

608
01:03:37,950 --> 01:03:43,260
So. So if I was an ally and I give up my I don't fight for being the first author.

609
01:03:43,500 --> 01:03:48,800
I'm fine. DUPNIK Later. And my department will punish me in some ways, right?

610
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:53,159
Because promotion wise, that's, hey, why are you not the lead author anymore?

611
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:58,050
And then I write back saying, When being an ally, they'll say, What the [INAUDIBLE] are you talking about?

612
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:08,460
Right. So I genuinely don't have any easy answers for you because academia is very much a part of this messed up power structure.

613
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:13,570
In fact, think academia is particularly messed up. Yeah.

614
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:24,060
That makes sense. Thank you. And I posted a link to the Kenya meeting last week on anti-Blackness and Global Health.

615
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:30,900
Please take a look. It is still very uncomfortable, but you should you should watch it.

616
01:04:31,230 --> 01:04:39,060
I felt super uncomfortable sitting on the stage surrounded by black people who are telling me how messed up our country's souls.

617
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:43,650
And we gotta have the honesty to listen to what they have to say.

618
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:47,160
And their anger is 100% justified.

619
01:04:47,430 --> 01:04:54,180
Imagine if you are on the African continent and you had to wait for 2 hours, two years to get your COVID vaccine.

620
01:04:54,180 --> 01:04:57,350
How would you feel? Really?

621
01:04:57,360 --> 01:05:05,219
How would you feel? And watching people die around you or watching your elderly parents still waiting for their phone to get a get a shot.

622
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:09,420
Right. That they are so disappointed in to see you.

623
01:05:09,630 --> 01:05:16,500
You come to us when you need data, but then come a time to actually show up as an ally.

624
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:24,390
You guys just bailed out on us, right? And then you invite us for your conference, and your bloody countries treat us like criminals.

625
01:05:25,050 --> 01:05:28,950
How upset and unhappy they are. There are no words to.

626
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:35,460
To capture that. Okay, so this is what makes me realize that we even more.

627
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:39,930
How many panels have you seen? Google Health. There's a whole bunch of Americans on the panel.

628
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:47,860
What's global health about it? Honestly, what's global health about a planet that's full of people like us?

629
01:05:48,860 --> 01:05:52,990
What does Global Neiman mean in this context? Right. This is the problem.

630
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:58,580
We genuinely think we can have a panel and discuss Africa with no African in the panel.

631
01:05:59,420 --> 01:06:05,450
Right. We normalize that kind of rubbish so many years that it doesn't even look odd to us.

632
01:06:05,780 --> 01:06:12,680
Just as we have a whole bunch of men on the on the podium talking about women's reproductive rights or whatever.

633
01:06:12,920 --> 01:06:21,440
Right. This rubbish happens every day. And just having that flexibility to say something seriously messed up about this panel.

634
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:24,830
Right. Who's talking about who's problem here?

635
01:06:25,130 --> 01:06:28,130
Who's got the lived experience to talk about this? Right.

636
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:32,899
Asking just a few questions immediately makes your eyes pop open.

637
01:06:32,900 --> 01:06:42,810
Nancy, I'm not sure I want to listen to this plan. Or I'm going to call this panel and face this the right group to talk about this particular issue.

638
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:48,910
Right. So think hard. I mean, ask all the hard questions and it's not going to be easy.

639
01:06:48,930 --> 01:06:52,500
Allyship is brutal, but there is no harder pack.

640
01:06:52,650 --> 01:06:55,800
And I can see if you can think of any of the pack, you let me know.

641
01:06:56,100 --> 01:07:03,629
But once you've seen the problem that I've shown you, the structural problems, there is no way out of this mess we've got.

642
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:10,410
If you're going to fight for equity, you begin by asking deep questions about how inequitable the field itself is.

643
01:07:11,390 --> 01:07:16,700
Right. That's how you make progress towards a more equitable field.

644
01:07:17,030 --> 01:07:21,590
Because I don't believe an inequitable field like local health, the gentlemanly type.

645
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:25,470
We failed Petkovic. We completely failed on.

646
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:28,640
On making equitable access to anything.

647
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:35,680
And that is just now. It's just happening right now. And we failed again when monkey pox will fail with the next pandemic.

648
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:44,840
Right? Because every pandemic, rich nations will do exactly what they do, promote themselves or they retain what was bankable.

649
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:48,440
This is like a beautiful playbook that we have mastered.

650
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:52,610
And how do you break through? This is beyond my understanding, climate crisis.

651
01:07:52,610 --> 01:08:02,060
Same [INAUDIBLE] all over again, right? Rich nations will never admit that their role in precipitating the climate crisis.

652
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:07,580
We will never do reparations. We will not support low income countries.

653
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:15,140
The climate crisis and low income countries will get hammered in the coming years because of climate crisis that we create.

654
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:22,820
Right. So this is this is the exact power asymmetry that this pandemic or whether it's conflicts or climate crisis,

655
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:26,210
you see rich nations have a standard pattern of behavior.

656
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:30,050
And you and I are, you know, running away from.

657
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:40,740
Sorry, Ryan, I know you ran out of time. So. No, no, we actually class normally goes to 420, so if you're happy to stay on, I think we have.

658
01:08:41,090 --> 01:08:46,230
I'm happy to stay on. But your students, the students look worried.

659
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:51,079
That's why I want to make sure I don't leave them on a horrible note.

660
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:55,100
So if there's anything I can do, let me know. No symptoms.

661
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:56,480
One quick question for me.

662
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:06,110
How is something you talk about in class quite often, which is as early career people, myself included, if we have a supervisor who is,

663
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:12,610
you know, who is, you know, work in a very colonial manner or somebody we work with who is quite senior.

664
01:09:12,620 --> 01:09:17,870
Even for me personally as a postdoc, I need to get first sort of publications to get a job next year.

665
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:27,140
How do we navigate those while being in an active ally and work and get system without it, to be completely honest, sacrificing our careers?

666
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:28,370
Yeah.

667
01:09:28,730 --> 01:09:38,600
So firstly I, I hear you and I don't think the kind of stuff that I do today, I don't think I did when I was an assistant professor 15 years ago.

668
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:41,750
Okay. So I acknowledge that this is not easy.

669
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:53,690
If you are lucky and you're working with a supervisor who truly was anticolonial and truly anti oppression and 90 racist,

670
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,719
then this sort of discussion, madame, would be easier.

671
01:09:56,720 --> 01:10:02,560
But I predict most of your supervisors and senior people in global health would not like that, right?

672
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:07,220
They are. They are living in a very different era and they can't see what they can't see.

673
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:13,520
So one example that I can give you right now, and I'm not that I expect you to do it right now,

674
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:18,410
I pretty much am not a senior author on any of my students papers.

675
01:10:18,770 --> 01:10:25,670
If it was done in a low income country, I make sure that petition goes to the my collaborator in that country.

676
01:10:26,120 --> 01:10:31,759
And often my student is a junior and I author with someone from that if it is part of their thesis.

677
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:40,700
Right? So I have figured out a way to make sure both partners have credit, equal credit, and I take myself off the picture.

678
01:10:40,700 --> 01:10:44,630
I don't give a [INAUDIBLE] what I'm on the paper a lot that I'm not.

679
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:54,050
I'm not asking you to do that because I know you need to worry about your career, but you could certainly be a Julian first author of a team, right?

680
01:10:54,410 --> 01:11:01,520
That's absolutely valid and sensible and thoughtful and makes everybody happy.

681
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:09,830
And, you know, you could take turns on one paper, your name of your first in the paper, so you could still say this was equal contribution rate.

682
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:14,360
And I would argue when you write a statement or whatever,

683
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:20,120
that you even say that you're doing this intentionally because you don't want to be extractive,

684
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:25,130
you don't want to make the same mistakes the older generations have read.

685
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:35,420
I predict as the way progresses, you will stand out as someone who's genuinely not just talking about equity, but rocking the clock on equity.

686
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:46,640
Okay. Thank you, Christian. So I had a few questions.

687
01:11:46,650 --> 01:11:53,130
Can you hear me? Yeah. Okay, great. And so if I looked at all worried, I.

688
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:56,879
I just had to get the. I was just getting the cupboard.

689
01:11:56,880 --> 01:12:02,190
Gear's move into my brain. So that's why it's kind of strange.

690
01:12:02,190 --> 01:12:06,899
But I actually had two questions. I was okay. You were in your slides.

691
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:12,630
You mentioned that a ghost and coconspirators were like a little bit above active allies.

692
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:17,640
And I was just wondering that a conspiracy were kind of working for,

693
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:26,970
I guess you were tied as to liberation and working towards kind of weeding out underlying paradigms in the mind.

694
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:34,170
And I was wondering if there was any reliable way to measure that in the mind kind of, you know,

695
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:42,090
I think the smartest way of measuring whether that's happening is when you are no longer required to be an ally,

696
01:12:42,540 --> 01:12:49,800
you dismantle the structures that when they imagine a world where you no longer need to be an ally,

697
01:12:50,310 --> 01:12:54,720
imagine a global health space when you and I are no longer necessary.

698
01:12:56,020 --> 01:12:59,260
Right. And all those walls have come.

699
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:05,740
We do need to then. Need one group to be an ally to another group that's oppressed.

700
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:09,640
Right. You have you have evened out the field for everyone.

701
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:15,580
Right. That is the hard part. And there aren't too many examples that I can think of.

702
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:22,000
But to me, I would absolutely love if the African region, just as an example,

703
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:26,920
could make their own vaccines, medicines and all the products that they need to.

704
01:13:26,920 --> 01:13:34,629
They need never rely on rich nations anymore. To me, and that's why the W.H.O. and Moderna help in South Africa is critical.

705
01:13:34,630 --> 01:13:39,340
Right. I want to see that succeed because Africa,

706
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:48,280
after everything we've seen and how excluded that continent has been historically and to me, they genuinely need.

707
01:13:49,210 --> 01:13:52,480
To be independent of this group, they will shape charity model.

708
01:13:53,260 --> 01:14:02,260
So if that succeed, it would be a brilliant example where we dismantle the structures that hold them back.

709
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:13,270
Oh, yeah. Because I do agree with like a lot of your ideas and I think it would be interesting because I've seen like,

710
01:14:13,270 --> 01:14:18,300
how would you publish that kind of idea in a paper, you know? Yeah.

711
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:22,540
Okay. And also, I have one more question, actually, if that's okay.

712
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:30,250
At the very beginning of your your talk, you mentioned something about like the the philosophy of double agent and being

713
01:14:30,250 --> 01:14:34,120
stuck in between like this kind of fork in the road between privilege and conflict.

714
01:14:34,630 --> 01:14:42,730
And I was wondering, it's kind of what Annette but I was wondering how that relates back to this idea of being a public servant in a way,

715
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:49,510
and if that had any relationship at all or if that was kind of a different idea.

716
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:56,200
No, it's a different idea. It's like I came from a low income country, but now I'm in a high income country.

717
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:03,459
Right. That's what that double agent, that straddling of two worlds is like double agents.

718
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:06,640
And there are many people like me. Right. There are lots of people like me.

719
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:12,790
And we often are stuck because I don't know whether I can speak for India anymore.

720
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:17,800
Right. So people ask me to comment about India and sort of from India.

721
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,640
Right. Yes, I know India. Yes. My mom still lives there,

722
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:29,860
but that doesn't necessarily mean I can then speak for India all the time because I am in this

723
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:37,860
position of power and privilege and over a period of time it's the further away from India.

724
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:43,900
And the longer I've been away from India, the less and less I think I truly reflect India.

725
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:50,200
Right. So I need to be thoughtful about what how I would position myself to look at what that really means.

726
01:15:50,510 --> 01:15:54,370
One of the questions from Sophia.

727
01:15:54,610 --> 01:16:03,810
Sophia, you want to ask the question or you want me to leave it on? Sophia.

728
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:10,960
They're not going to. Her Mike isn't working out.

729
01:16:12,280 --> 01:16:19,210
So she says, are folks better able to be an ally or coconspirators when working outside of academia and NGOs?

730
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:23,350
Assuming those INGOs are operating under the same prism mindset,

731
01:16:23,710 --> 01:16:29,950
I would argue virtually every organization in global health is operating under the same dualism model.

732
01:16:30,340 --> 01:16:43,030
So and NGOs in particular, I mean, even NGOs like MSF, all of them have deep rooted saviors and models underneath them, right?

733
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:47,160
So yes, one can and should be an ally and a coconspirator.

734
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:54,520
If you ever worked for an NGO like that, an NGO NGO can be deeply problematic.

735
01:16:54,580 --> 01:17:02,260
You got to really think hard and understand what that NGO is, how they operate, and make sure you're not part of the problem.

736
01:17:02,380 --> 01:17:09,160
Right. Which means if you are working in them, then addressing them is also part of you election work.

737
01:17:13,550 --> 01:17:17,600
I think we're almost out of time. And any last minute quick questions.

738
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:27,739
Dr. BI, thank you so much. This was incredibly eye opening and insightful and I'm sure it's just the start of

739
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:32,930
conversations you'll be having in class and and trainings and other workshops you'll be doing.

740
01:17:33,260 --> 01:17:37,040
I'm sitting in on the curriculum board for the Global Health Major next week,

741
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:41,479
so those will be taking to them a lot of the ideas you brought up, which is fantastic.

742
01:17:41,480 --> 01:17:48,740
So thank you so much. And we'll post all the links and the readings which Dr. by provided on canvas.

743
01:17:49,610 --> 01:17:52,940
Thank you so much everyone and I wish you the very best in your career.

744
01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:54,880
He can't.
