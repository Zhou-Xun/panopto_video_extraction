1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:05,320
Let's hear what he said.

2
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:16,070
He lays out a map of the first CB see me including.

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:29,020
And now we are talking and we are talking how technology drew so far I don't know and I'm also interested in it.

4
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,290
And I decided what was right for me.

5
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,450
So I was like, first home. I am like, no, I'm not doing anything.

6
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:56,460
Just like watching the Internet. And she it's just like I just now he has to respond to me in my work.

7
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:01,980
Before it was like beta release and I'm like, it's problematic.

8
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,670
So I mean that like I don't know how I can do it, but then you like free downloading on Sunday.

9
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:16,499
You can't do that because I think it's like if it works lt like they use like

10
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:22,530
at work but like I think that having like yourself or anything like that,

11
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:30,930
that they're a little sad. And she was like, Yeah, I have my ass. And I was like, okay, so like, love your house if possible.

12
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:37,050
So training. Yeah. So it's not really stability and everything else.

13
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:51,760
Yeah. Yeah. It was like, oh, so it's not like you want something just out sometimes.

14
00:01:52,050 --> 00:02:04,890
Yeah. I'm going to be looking where students from St Louis, everything's fine.

15
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:10,190
They're pretty awesome because how would you find anything?

16
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:27,390
So I mean, I have to provide the kind of accommodation like my earplugs are probably in my

17
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:41,380
backpack because I haven't been out like and I might start with something else.

18
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:49,889
So I don't think, oh yeah, like I might have something next week.

19
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,920
So I was like, I think it's going to be too dark in here.

20
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:06,390
Yes. I we literally went on Monday with everything we need to get out of that.

21
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:22,290
Yeah. I go to like it really like as much until I can get, get to bed because my question is, are you going to love it?

22
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:32,730
I would literally question. I have I haven't even thought about that.

23
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:36,340
You know.

24
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,430
Yeah, I think I just thought, oh, we are,

25
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:56,640
we said we was going to start looking at like when you're like an extra like okay, I have well anything in the class.

26
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:15,190
I was in my head, I read about it when it comes up and you know, it was like you were talking about politics and I was like, I'm sorry.

27
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,920
I like really pivoted very quickly, but then I know we're all on the same page here,

28
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:40,000
so there's going to be like I told you, I just I got my mind off it.

29
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,969
I don't I don't know.

30
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:57,540
I mean, I think I think it's was trying to in.

31
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:07,370
I mean, like, you know. Right. Well, that's what he wanted.

32
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,589
Okay. Today we're going to talk about this regulation of appetite and satiety and obesity.

33
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:24,940
But first, we're going to talk about the quiz. So the quiz questions are a little bit more detailed now and a little bit more

34
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:31,300
challenging because we're getting into the more challenging material for the class.

35
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:42,310
So our quiz number, question number one, we're talking about drugs that are used to treat diabetes.

36
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,430
And in this particular case, we're looking at a class of drugs called lipids.

37
00:05:49,090 --> 00:06:00,940
And what these drugs do is they inhibit the Peptidase four and they inhibit the degradation of ingredients.

38
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:09,850
And so based on this background, I asked you which of the following statements on the physiological effects of weapons is true?

39
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:17,350
And if we're giving a drugs that inhibits the decadent degradation of these

40
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:21,280
ingredients are going to stay around for a longer period of time for circulation.

41
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:28,710
And the correct answer here is that the elephants will increase the half life of and credence.

42
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:37,510
JP And glucagon peptide one and this is going to be at night.

43
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,959
Okay. And then some of you who will go into clinical practice will see the use of this

44
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,830
particular drug quite frequently in people who have diabetes and other metabolic issues.

45
00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:03,290
Number two. Recently there have been studies looking at these receptors and human cancer.

46
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:07,819
Now, I'm not going to expect you to understand cancer biology,

47
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:16,970
but this is this question serves as a way to ask you questions about why, why receptors.

48
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,430
So in this particular question, we're looking at, you know, what is important to you.

49
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:29,690
So here we have recently empire and empire receptors have been shown to play a significant role in human cancer.

50
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:36,650
Novel cancer treatment, such as neuropeptides, receptor antagonists are being developed to treat cancer.

51
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:45,469
Let's say an NPI receptor antagonist would have which of the following effects is administered systemically.

52
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:50,810
And this is assuming that this particular drugs can cross the blood brain barrier,

53
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:55,400
which is a really important and it works systemically and doesn't cross the blood brain barrier.

54
00:07:55,410 --> 00:08:00,860
Then if this receptors important in cancer, this has got to work.

55
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:09,620
If it crosses a blood brain barrier, then it's going to have alternative effects and which is its effect on appetite.

56
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:13,510
And the correct answer here was it would reduce appetite.

57
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:20,030
Everybody pretty much got that question correct. The last question was the tricky one.

58
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:27,650
And this is a level of detail that was was confusing.

59
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:33,770
And so the question starts with one left and levels are elevated and circulation,

60
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:40,880
how would this affect sensitivity to C, c, k in the notes after a meal.

61
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,470
So if left in levels are increased, right, you have more stored energy.

62
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:58,430
And so the neural projections from the Arctic nucleus of the hypothalamus go in different directions and one

63
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:06,530
direction as to the NTS and this affects the sensitivity of the A.S. to hormones coming into the brain stem.

64
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:15,200
So what would you just just on that information, what would you expect to see with sensitivity to K?

65
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:20,880
If leptin levels are elevated increases, sensitivity would increase.

66
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,340
However, the quiz that we had said leptin levels were reduced.

67
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,310
Oh yeah. Yeah, they were. So that's why we all got it wrong.

68
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:35,400
Yeah, I'll get her on. Okay? Okay. Yeah.

69
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:39,500
Okay. Sorry about that. I'll go back and fix that.

70
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:45,800
So this is I was copy and pasting from my google doc into the quiz function.

71
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,770
That's where it got me. Okay. I see. Okay.

72
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:56,090
Sorry about that. So it makes sense to you when you see the question this is now.

73
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,690
Okay, good. Just copy and paste them around for some reason.

74
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:03,470
Okay. All right. I'll go back and correct that.

75
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:08,430
Yeah. So if nothing else, we are reduced in circulation.

76
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:13,070
And it will be increased to 65, which would increase me on size.

77
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:16,909
Yes. Okay. Yeah. Because that's what we on. And that's.

78
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:21,110
That's what you have. That's what your reasoning was. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

79
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,200
Yeah. So, like, just the opposite of this. Yeah. Yes.

80
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:33,049
Okay. Another detail that some of us have of a question about was like the after reveal with us also be true during a mailer.

81
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:45,200
It's like really that the way I structured the question was, okay, you have a period of time after a meal where she's okay, levels are increasing.

82
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,820
Yeah, they're going to increase if the meal last more than 20 minutes, 30 minutes,

83
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:55,280
but it's after the meal where they start to increase and then they peak.

84
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,750
So that's kind of why I put that bit of information in there.

85
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:05,300
Thank you. Okay. Sorry that confused. And I'm glad to hear that everybody was thinking about this more deeply.

86
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:14,360
Yeah, I was thinking about it. Is the system that that some people will be seen as the queens of age.

87
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,580
It's like more difficult for people to be about the same to me about this right now.

88
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:30,110
The detailed information comes from the last few lectures that we've had, and that's where you need to focus your energy in terms of study.

89
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,690
Thank you. Thank you. Right. Yeah.

90
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:43,190
Actually, Professor, can you repeat if the lesson was decreased, the answer would not be because leptin levels are decreased.

91
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:48,950
Your sensitivity to C, c k would be affected.

92
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:55,820
Right? So if you want to increase leptin levels back again, you would want to lengthen meal time.

93
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:03,770
The time that you spend eating a meal so that your sensitivity to C, c k levels would decrease.

94
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,310
Right. And which increase the meal? Yes.

95
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,870
So increase the length of time you spent eating a meal. Okay.

96
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:22,400
So for today. And I think I do so for today.

97
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,680
Today, there's a lot of material.

98
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:35,000
We might not finish everything we're going over today, and the exam will cover all of the material up until this particular lecture.

99
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:40,530
Okay. So in this lecture we're going to talk about.

100
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:50,550
Things that aren't working normally and people who have higher BMI when we're going to start with the gut hormones.

101
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:58,560
And I want you to be able to describe the gut hormone responsiveness of feeding and taking obesity, defined leptin resistance,

102
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:08,820
and how it impacts appetite and satiety and describe hypothalamic inflammation and its impact in appetite and satiety.

103
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:14,610
And finally, expelled fatness. Describe body weight homeostasis models.

104
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:18,210
And I don't know if we're going to get to the body weight homeostasis models.

105
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:24,240
QUESTION At the end of the lecture, the questions, I should say.

106
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:30,360
So the reading was on was focused on this body weight homeostasis,

107
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:42,930
and it gives you lots of examples as to why the thinking that we have this mechanism in place to maintain for us to maintain a certain body weight.

108
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:46,860
And it describes all of the problems with this theory.

109
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,750
And at the very end of the lecture, I'll address that.

110
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:59,160
So we have got hormones that regulate appetite and satiety.

111
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,080
And there have been a number of studies that have been done to demonstrate this.

112
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:14,360
And one would think if we have these mechanisms in place, we would maintain a certain body weight throughout our lifetimes.

113
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,230
Let's see if that's true.

114
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:27,590
So we have Corexit genic hormones from that produced by the gut that stimulate appetite and one that's really well characterized.

115
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:32,840
And as far as we know, it's the only one that is really physiologically important and that's growing.

116
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:41,180
And then there are several anorexic genic hormones that are produced by the gut that inhibit appetite.

117
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:51,980
So it's true that these symptoms systems function normally in people with obesity.

118
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:59,490
So the first question you get have okay, let's look at the index, organic hormone drilling.

119
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,960
The levels of this hormone different in people with obesity.

120
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:12,840
So I'm going to show you some studies looking at plasma ghrelin levels and

121
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,790
see how they compare in people who are clean versus people who have obesity.

122
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:21,510
And the question is, are they any different?

123
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:35,659
So this particular paper was published in 2001 by Matthias Chopp, and he was looking at plasma, Greenland levels,

124
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:42,590
just grill and total grown, and he was looking at the level of these hormones and different groups of people.

125
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,730
And so he has this, these different categories here.

126
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:54,080
So here's plasma growing and here's Caucasians Lean and people with obesity.

127
00:15:54,440 --> 00:16:01,790
And then here's another subset of people on the Pima who are lean and people who have obesity.

128
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:13,230
And. The level of ground here plasma relative these individuals is is less and people with

129
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:22,530
obesity and females there's no difference here between these different groups of subjects.

130
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:32,540
And so they're matched for age sex and body weight and they're controlling for that meal timing as well to make sure that the

131
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:46,200
levels of ghrelin are measured at the same time or after a particular meal then and the p part of this figure ratio of plasma,

132
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:51,480
ghrelin and on the Y axis and then body mass index on the x axis.

133
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:58,110
And the different colors correspond to these different groups, individuals.

134
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:08,430
And as you can see, as you go up the BMI chart here or increase in BMI, plasma adrenaline levels seem to decline.

135
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,860
That doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but maybe it does.

136
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:28,319
So here's another way of looking at this relationship. And in this example, you're looking at the ghrelin response to feeding and people in this case,

137
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:34,810
they're calling them normal weight and people with obesity. And this is time, post meal and minutes.

138
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:46,300
So this is ghrelin responses to a test meal and ten individuals and people with with very high levels of obesity are looking particularly at women.

139
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,520
And here's the level time post meal.

140
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:59,500
The level of ghrelin in the individuals with normal weight in this case was higher than those individuals who had obesity.

141
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:09,100
And as time goes on after the meal and notice in the individuals who were in that have less than 25 BMI category,

142
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:13,149
their ghrelin levels are declining after the meal.

143
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,980
So they're at their lowest point 30 minutes after the meal, and then they start to go back up again.

144
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:29,890
The individuals who had a higher BMI, BMI person, 30, much greater than their levels don't decline.

145
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,930
But it stayed flat after the video. Didn't go up after 30 minutes.

146
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,640
Now that's total gorilla,

147
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:57,080
which studies were done prior to the appreciation that it states that the concentrations of gorilla when they're isolated are selected.

148
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:09,350
So in the next series of of graphs here, you're looking at fasting and postprandial total ghrelin, and then we'll show you isolated colonies.

149
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:17,930
And in this case, you're looking at groups of individuals with a mean BMI of 23.

150
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:25,640
Here with the triangles, 35 with the open squares and 47 with the closed squares.

151
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:36,870
So here they are at baseline. So the people that had the highest total ground concentration were that those

152
00:19:36,870 --> 00:19:43,979
individuals with a BMI of 23 and then the next highest with people who had a BMI 47,

153
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,760
followed by people who had a mean BMI 35.

154
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:59,250
And then after a meal with the lean individuals on one level strap, you expect them to total ghrelin and then they flatten out.

155
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,940
Whereas the individual with is much higher BMI at the 47 levels.

156
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:16,440
Eleanor kind of flat with the people who have you, PMI 35 people down a little bit, but they were kind of a flat line.

157
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:24,690
So this is this is total ghrelin levels and this is what has been shown in a number of different

158
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:32,430
experimental models where the levels of ghrelin appear to be lower in these subjects.

159
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:42,610
Now let's look at isolated ground. Now we're dealing with a hormone that has the activity that suppresses the appetite.

160
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,179
So if we're going to focus on studies that look at actually the active form of

161
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:52,390
the hormone that does not think this is the one we want to pay attention to.

162
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:00,850
So here we have plasma isolated. This is the active form of the hormone that makes you hungry.

163
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:08,209
Right. So here is fasting and postprandial elsewhere at that time.

164
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,360
Zero all the way to 120 minutes on the x axis.

165
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:15,920
An isolated problem this time on the y axis.

166
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:20,720
So here are the individuals with the different different levels of BMI.

167
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:30,440
And this time people with a BMI of 23 and the BMI of 47 are starting out at the exact same level of isolated growing.

168
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:45,379
And after the meal, the levels of relevance escalated well on decline in individuals who have a BMI of 23.

169
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:55,100
That's what you would expect to happen. Right. But let's look at people with this higher BMI, why it goes up, if anything.

170
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:05,120
And these these pound signs are hashtags, everyone to describe a symbol to show you a significant difference between this and that.

171
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:13,430
You have to know people with a BMI of 23 so it doesn't decline to go up a little bit and they stay at this level.

172
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:26,080
And then you would expect that people who are kind of in between having a BMI of 35 to be somewhere around here, but they're not.

173
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:31,060
They're down here and they go up a little bit after a meal.

174
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,210
But for the most part, this line is kind of flat.

175
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:45,670
So these responses that you would expect to find after a meal in regard to the active hormone will follow the pattern that you would expect to see.

176
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:53,400
Excuse me. Yeah. What is that in all mechanism behind that?

177
00:22:53,460 --> 00:23:00,140
If you think we expect that people with obesity have because they have high appetite lifestyle.

178
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,540
Well, I'm going to walk through this and discuss this.

179
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:16,300
So ground level seemed to be inversely related to total energy balance in this particular explanation.

180
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:21,460
So individuals with obesity in a state are in a state of positive energy balance.

181
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:26,770
Right. And then lower ghrelin levels would be expected.

182
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:33,520
Right. If they have a higher adiposity, that perhaps they would have lower levels of protein.

183
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:44,720
And that's that's what you would expect to see. Right. There's a modest decrease in grilling following a meal immediately postprandial,

184
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:52,340
and this may account for the deep satiety leading to an increased intake over time in individuals with obesity.

185
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:57,650
So this is the explanation as to what you're seeing in the previous slides.

186
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:05,770
Now, is this data casual or observatory?

187
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:11,150
In other words, are these observational studies, are we controlling for ghrelin levels here?

188
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,970
So that louder observational right.

189
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:22,670
Or just looking at Ritalin levels before and after a meal and looking to see how they change,

190
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:31,520
we were going to find a way to test these ideas out in an experimental level.

191
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,530
We have to use an animal model. Can I ask something?

192
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:41,090
Yeah. So these little increases that we saw midway up 30 and 60 Minutes.

193
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:46,640
Do you think those could account for increased intake? Possibly.

194
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:54,050
But this is a small study you have you have, you know, 10 to 20 subjects in each of these studies.

195
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:57,470
So this is a small group of individuals.

196
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:03,620
So, you know, we don't know. It appears, I think what the takeaway is, they don't decline like they should.

197
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:17,290
That's the takeaway message of this. So so that.

198
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:22,630
And when you have a higher BMI, it doesn't appear that this the gremlin is functioning as it should.

199
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:29,040
How about gut hormones? Are they functioning differently in people with obesity?

200
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,710
And so we're going to look at experiments that compare the responses of gut hormones

201
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,960
before and after a meal in people who are lean versus those who have obesity.

202
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:46,140
And let's first let's look at 2.1 levels at baseline and after a meal.

203
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,110
What would you expect to see in a lean individual versus those with obesity?

204
00:25:55,930 --> 00:26:05,270
The GOP won the increasing hormone produced by the gut in response to energy substrates in the gut.

205
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:16,100
And it decreases appetite, increases levels and has increased, in effect to increasing levels of insulin.

206
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:27,230
So what would you expect to see at baseline? Ion lanes are higher in people with obesity.

207
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,130
And you can see people write about after a meal.

208
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:58,490
Okay. Let's see. So in this particular case, you're looking at responses to a liquid test meal and 19 people with they're calling this normal weight.

209
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:04,460
Now, this would be people with a BMI of less than 25, us versus those who have a BMI above 30.

210
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:13,280
So after GOP wants this active GOP want Mississippi commercials here.

211
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,549
And this is time in minutes on the x axis. And the open circles are the people who have the BMI.

212
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:23,210
Less than 25 people with the BMI, more than 30 are shown here.

213
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,710
So GOP wants increases after a meal.

214
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:37,460
Right. And that's what you see in the subjects who who are clearly gets up and that remains elevated for the next hour.

215
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:47,060
And that's what you expect to find. Right? However, let's look at what's going on in the subjects who have obesity.

216
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:52,700
Their response goes up a little bit here. But these as these error bars are pretty big.

217
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:59,330
So this is would not be significantly different. And then they dropped a little bit and then they kind of flatten out.

218
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:06,280
So the difference between this year and all these time points demonstrate that this

219
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:11,410
more and more one is an increasing after a meal and these groups of subjects.

220
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:24,230
So that's just one gut hormone that suppresses at a time.

221
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:30,910
What about some others? So let's make a prediction about p y y levels at baseline and after meal.

222
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:35,890
What would you expect to find in lean versus those with obesity at baseline?

223
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:44,350
I think it should be lower.

224
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:50,140
And then after about after a meal, it also do well.

225
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:53,390
Okay. See? All right.

226
00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:01,580
So this is p y y levels and this is after.

227
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:08,149
So you have two different groups of subjects here, people with a BMI 20, a less than 25,

228
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:16,220
and people with to be migrated by 30 on the open square so that people with a lower BMI, experienced people with a higher BMI.

229
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,229
And this is after a 500 milliliter, Neal.

230
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:31,460
This is a volume. And I'm looking at calories here on the on the x axis.

231
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:38,090
And they're looking at now levels of to lie at peak levels.

232
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:47,840
Okay. So after these individuals consume this meal, white wine increases, but at baseline,

233
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:56,780
at both the lower caloric meal intake and the higher caloric intake, it follows that predictable pattern, right?

234
00:29:57,950 --> 00:30:06,529
Where you have higher levels of p y and those lean versus those who have obesity and all the way up the scale.

235
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:12,350
As we increase the size of the meal in terms of calories, it's higher in the people who are playing.

236
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:16,850
And the astronauts say that these are significantly different.

237
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:29,300
Okay. So that follows a normal pattern of response is responses to y y.

238
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:40,100
So this is a study by better in 2003 and you're looking at here responses to either

239
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:47,750
people given a bolus of sailing or people given a bolus of feeling with p y y.

240
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:52,160
And that's shown here. And these are the individual subjects.

241
00:30:52,670 --> 00:31:01,790
And these lines represent the changes in caloric intake and individuals who have obesity versus those who are least so.

242
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:09,280
So you're looking at the intake factor and response to a buffet meal now and

243
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:15,410
can people just given sailing happens versus p y y you might have 30 and over,

244
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,270
you might have less than 25.

245
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:24,500
And see initially there's a higher intake in the individuals who have obesity and you'll want to live lower at these levels.

246
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:31,190
But when you compare the values here in terms of caloric intake to greater than those with

247
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:39,709
a who are lean and when you look at responsiveness to the meal and the levels of p y,

248
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,430
y now they all seem to go down and they seem to go to lower levels.

249
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:51,560
Now, the problem with this scale is that we have some people out here and we have some people down here,

250
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:56,870
and it's it's hard to follow these individual values.

251
00:31:57,410 --> 00:32:01,310
So to simplify this for us, they provided these bar graphs.

252
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:05,240
So in the bar graphs, you're looking at caloric intake.

253
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:14,239
This is looking at you give somebody a bowl of sailing and they're looking at caloric intake and

254
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,250
people who have obesity and people who are lean and you see that there's a greater caloric intake.

255
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:24,020
The people have a higher BMI here and then you give them p y y.

256
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:29,210
Your expectation is that they're going to consume less food when they're presented with a meal.

257
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:33,650
And they do, they consume less food.

258
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:42,800
But the response here a little bit different between these two different groups, and this is explained better by this particular graph here.

259
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:53,570
And when we look at total power consumption over a 24 hour period, this is over a shorter time period, we see the same type of relationship.

260
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,200
So here's another way of looking at this data. Okay.

261
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:11,149
So of people looking at plasma peak y y in people who are a group versus people who have obesity and we just give them sailing and we show that

262
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:19,130
there's levels of p y y are lower in people with obesity and then they go up after the buffet lunch and individuals who are in the lean group,

263
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,120
their they levels are higher and then they go up after the buffet lunch.

264
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:34,010
So there's these expected differences that you would you would anticipate seeing in regard to this particular gut hormone.

265
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:49,320
So it seems to be functioning the way one would expect. So he presented the data in a different way in this fourth figure, in this particular paper.

266
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,430
And here you're looking at plasma p, y y levels.

267
00:33:55,320 --> 00:34:00,720
And this is and this term we're looking at the differences in body mass index.

268
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,840
So these are very lean individuals. The average BMI here is around 20.

269
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:12,480
And the individuals with the higher BMI, their average BMI is close to perhaps 35.

270
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:18,000
We see that plasma p y y levels are quite a bit lower.

271
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,489
So this would exceed what would follow your expectations.

272
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:29,399
You have less of these satiety signals causing one to ingest more calories.

273
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:35,340
Right. And this happens at baseline for lower levels and even after a meal.

274
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:51,910
So to go back to our chart, so we'll look at this, right, and look at the Delta change up to the thinking.

275
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,910
And I'm not going to change them because the pace, the baseline is really lower.

276
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:02,460
Oh, you mean the distance from here to here? Yeah. Yes, that's.

277
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:08,350
Yeah. Six left as well. Right. Okay. Delta.

278
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:16,110
Would point. Okay.

279
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:25,470
What about some other satiety signals? What would you predict for C, c, k age versus people with obesity at baseline?

280
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:37,600
Do you see a similar pattern if you why why would be lower in people who have obesity versus those who are lean and after a meal, perhaps.

281
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:43,450
What is the data show? So this is going back to the paper.

282
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:48,310
Who compared these different groups based on their BMI of 23, 35 and 47?

283
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:58,120
So here's time zero and the baseline point. And in this case, people who have got an average BMI, 47 here,

284
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:04,860
their plasma is the K levels are the lowest followed by those not here's the open square.

285
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:13,719
Those who have an average BMI of 35 and those who have a BMI 23 are not that different from these two.

286
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,720
But this is much lower for the people with a very high BMI.

287
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:24,170
And this is after a meal and we have an increase in all groups.

288
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:33,799
Um, in terms of C C K levels in the blood and in the individuals who are watching this 23

289
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:39,500
BMI goes up on a 30 minutes and it starts to go down again and then goes up again.

290
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:45,740
And then the other two groups follow this pattern where it goes up and it stays, as you would expect.

291
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:55,670
So and in this case, the order of C, C, K levels followed the expected patterns,

292
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:01,010
but at baseline they're lower and after a meal they appear to be lower in this

293
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:07,170
particular group versus most of these time points for the individuals who are.

294
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:14,160
Yeah. There was the volume of the flood control.

295
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,060
It's the volume of the flood control I believe they were given.

296
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,990
Know. I don't know. I don't know.

297
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:36,100
They were given I believe they were given the same amount of calories in this particular experiment.

298
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:41,600
I don't know that volume would be some of them actually feel hungry.

299
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,030
I don't know.

300
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:54,310
Maybe the food amount is enough for people who have a lower BMI so the of declines in a stretch response perhaps the counter receptor response.

301
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:03,580
Yeah. Well remember C C K is responding to what in the gut here is stuff like that.

302
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:11,380
Yeah. The lipids. Okay. So that that might not be explained by the same kind of receptor.

303
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:18,030
I got it. Thank you. So here's a summary.

304
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:24,129
Here's here's the gut. Hormones, they don't seem to follow expected patterns in subjects with obesity in cases.

305
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:30,310
In the case of growth she'll be one reason why why they seem to but they they're lower

306
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:38,920
so they increase but they're lower at baseline and they're lower at after a meal.

307
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,610
And it's the delta. The changes that are increases isn't what you would see.

308
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:47,409
And individuals who are lean and the CC K kind of looks like what you would would see

309
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:52,960
would keep y y where they start out lower and people with a higher BMI and they increase.

310
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,650
But at most time points they're lower than the subjects who are.

311
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:10,040
Okay. So perhaps this reflects the inability of the gut and people who have obesity to inhibit postprandial appetite.

312
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,690
So that sensation of being full or being satiated is less.

313
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:23,480
And people with a higher BMI perhaps related to these differences and gut hormones that we've talked about.

314
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:37,630
Okay. So that's what's going on in the gut. And then we're going to talk about some things going on in the central nervous system.

315
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:44,110
And the first thing I'm going to mention here is this concept of hypothalamic inflammation.

316
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:52,600
And this has been demonstrated mostly in animal models in mice that are fed a high fat diet, a 60% fat diet.

317
00:39:53,560 --> 00:40:01,209
And then there's one study that I'm going to show you that was done in humans who had a very high BMI to look at in

318
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:09,760
terms of what's going on in areas of the brain that we know that are important in regulating appetite and satiety.

319
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:21,130
So there's been quite a bit of work done looking at levels of circulating

320
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:29,080
pro-inflammatory cytokines and if you increase body weight by feeding an animal a high

321
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:37,540
fat diet or you're to look at other mechanisms of inducing increased caloric

322
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:42,009
intake resulting in an increased level of that and possibly in an animal model,

323
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:50,410
you see the same thing where there's an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines circulating in the blood and you see this in humans as well.

324
00:40:53,500 --> 00:41:01,450
So to do this experimentally, to give animals a high fat diet, then this is a very calorically dense diet.

325
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:13,630
The level of saturated fatty acids in this diet is very high, and it increases the circulating levels of saturated fat in circulation as well.

326
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:23,650
And it's thought that these lipids now can cross the blood brain barrier and have physiologic effects.

327
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:36,600
And the lipids themselves, particularly the saturated fats, are thought to have pro-inflammatory effects that can get through the blood brain barrier.

328
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:42,280
They can get into the hypothalamic neurons and cause some damage there.

329
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,360
And they can also,

330
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:57,010
I'm going to show you some studies that looked at how a high fat diet affected the firing of these MPI agouti related peptide neurons.

331
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,320
And it can actually increase the activity.

332
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:14,719
You also have this other cell type that's present in the brain that can contribute to inflammation within the central nervous system.

333
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:22,610
And these are the glial cells. And these glial cells can respond to these lipids and circulating cytokines, perhaps.

334
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:30,260
And so these are these microglia are resident macrophages that suspect that are specialized cells,

335
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:36,350
macrophages in the brain, and they're thought to contribute to this central nervous system, inflammation.

336
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:49,580
And as a consequence of these events, the central nervous system becomes less sensitive to circulating levels of leptin and insulin.

337
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:56,790
Okay. So there have been a few studies looking at this.

338
00:42:56,790 --> 00:43:02,610
And these are experimental models, again, with different groups of mice.

339
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:05,430
Regular diet or a high fat diet.

340
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:16,440
And then you can get mice that have these green fluorescent proteins that are specific to different populations of neurons.

341
00:43:17,310 --> 00:43:22,230
And then you can feed the animals different diets after the diet trial,

342
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:34,200
take their brains out and stay in sections of the brain for pathways that are known to contribute to increased levels of cytokines and inflammation.

343
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:45,540
So let me describe this for you. So this is a paper we're looking at the responses in the hypothalamus to this high fat diet.

344
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:55,110
So the title of this is Chronic Activation of Inflammatory Signaling and Agouti related neuropeptide Y Neurons in Mice for the High Fat Diet.

345
00:43:55,980 --> 00:44:03,480
And in this particular slide, you're looking at animals who are fed a normal diet or a high fat diet.

346
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:10,820
And the green corresponds to the agouti related peptide neurons.

347
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:17,190
So here's, here's a section of the brain and the blue indicates the different nuclei.

348
00:44:17,310 --> 00:44:20,730
And this is the nucleus here.

349
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:26,760
And within the acute nucleus you have mp y neurons that are shown here in red.

350
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:32,250
And it's really hard to see this, but if you look at this in your lab type and blow this up,

351
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:39,570
you can see here there's a marker for an inflammatory signaling event within

352
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:46,140
these neurons is phosphorylated C Jun And then when you overlay these images,

353
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:55,620
these three images, you get this readout and it appears that there's greater C gene activation,

354
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:03,719
which is a pathway that indicates there's a greater inflammation within these nuclei in the brain,

355
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:13,560
in the mice were fed this high fat diet and the way they quantitative this is shown here this is ten weeks in a high fat diet and we're

356
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:24,180
looking at this higher levels of C2 and these are positive cells that are much higher in the animals that are fed high fat diets.

357
00:45:26,430 --> 00:45:30,870
And then they also did the same type of experiments.

358
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:35,760
In this case, they're looking at a different kind of attack here.

359
00:45:35,910 --> 00:45:37,709
They're looking at HRP neurons,

360
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:47,250
which overlap with the same thing as one or two different markers for the two different one cell type that's known to stimulate appetite.

361
00:45:49,710 --> 00:46:01,080
And then they they're looking at down here action potentials and these neurons and they're trying to determine their activity,

362
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:11,460
the firing rate of these neurons. And what they found is that the animals that were fed this high fat diet for ten weeks,

363
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:17,460
this increased the firing of these neurons that are known to stimulate appetite.

364
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:26,610
So in this experimental model, the animals that were on the high fat diet for ten weeks, we see this increased firing rate.

365
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:31,200
Right. And this increased the activity of these neurons.

366
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:42,210
And there were a bunch of subsequent slides or figures associated with this paper showing that it was a greater weight gain in these animals.

367
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:45,780
And yes, I'll get to your question in a second here.

368
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:53,850
If you just experimentally activate this pathway, this gene pathway, chronically, you see the same thing.

369
00:46:55,620 --> 00:47:05,010
Where you have the activation of this tuned pathway, which gives you a greater firing of these widely realized peptide neurons.

370
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:14,010
Stimulating appetite in the animals made as a consequence of this and that their appetite increases.

371
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:21,270
Yes, I do know. Is it a total high fat or high saturated fat diet?

372
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,010
So it's a it's a total high fat, but it is high saturated fat.

373
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:35,370
And the reason for the higher saturated fat has to do with the ease of administering the science experimentally.

374
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,210
So if you have lots of polyunsaturated fats in that diet, it would be really difficult to handle, right?

375
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:48,290
It would be mushy. Would it be running? It would be difficult to put in the cages to feed these animals.

376
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:51,750
I mean, you could do it, but it adds another layer of complexity.

377
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:58,950
The saturated fats are solid at room temperature and the food kind of looks like Play-Doh.

378
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:06,600
I'll show you a picture of it later in the semester. And you don't have to worry so much about oxidation of the lipids as well.

379
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:16,080
Okay. So here's. Here's a summary figure for the sets of experiments.

380
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:22,230
So here are two different groups of mice.

381
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:28,050
So here are the acuity related peptide neurons.

382
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:40,230
Here are the ones. Here's the signaling pathway that is affected that leads to the increased firing of these neurons.

383
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:53,850
What this does is it increases food intake and decreases leptin signaling, and it decreases systemic leptin sense of sensitivity as well.

384
00:48:54,230 --> 00:49:01,410
So these are the animals that have gained weight and have gotten more adiposity, more fat as a consequence of consuming this high fat diet.

385
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,360
And then here we have another model system.

386
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:15,240
And in this case, we're looking at the inflammatory cascade, another inflammatory cascade that's activated that has similar effects,

387
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:20,790
increasing the rate of firing of these neurons, increasing food intake,

388
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:25,890
and that in this case, we're inhibiting insulin signaling and glucose metabolism.

389
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:35,070
So focus on this half of the figure. This is what's going on.

390
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:44,610
They created these mice to generate a similar response and have normal weight as a way to control for or is an

391
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:53,190
experimental model to increase the appetite in these animals by stimulating these inflammatory cascades in these neurons?

392
00:49:53,610 --> 00:50:01,400
Yeah. Okay. Just to clarify, because I'm a little confused about the placing of the normal mouse versus by doing that.

393
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:07,140
So because of these signaling pathways are occurring out of the past in the high fat diets.

394
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:12,990
Not here. Yes. Okay. Because it was just confusing because the one is like right next to like.

395
00:50:13,850 --> 00:50:20,940
Yeah. It this this part of it is confusing, but it's a way to control for the effects of the fatty acids.

396
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:22,800
And that's doing a lot of other things.

397
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:30,360
Was to create a transgenic mice mouse that where they can chronically activate these pathways and induce increased

398
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:36,990
food intake and inhibit insulin signaling and glucose metabolism in an animal that's not on a high fat diet.

399
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,940
So that's why there's this kind of control. Okay, so.

400
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:48,690
Okay. So that's that's a theory as to why,

401
00:50:49,110 --> 00:51:01,370
based on your sensitivity to circulating leptin may decline as a consequence of having a higher level of elevated possibly.

402
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:08,730
That's that's one theory. The next theory is this less than resistance theory.

403
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:12,570
Okay. So let me walk you through this.

404
00:51:13,050 --> 00:51:22,380
So let's hear resistance. So this is the coexistence of having excess and possibly more adipose tissue and elevated serum leptin.

405
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:27,660
Okay. And the les.

406
00:51:27,870 --> 00:51:34,290
So that we know that the levels of leptin here are proportional to how much adipose tissue you have, how much fatness you have.

407
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:41,340
And so subjects with obesity are said to be in a state of leptin resistance.

408
00:51:42,030 --> 00:51:47,640
Okay. The circulating leptin is ineffective in reducing their food intake.

409
00:51:48,570 --> 00:51:55,200
If we think of leptin as something that would inhibit appetite and increase energy

410
00:51:55,200 --> 00:52:01,080
expenditure through some kind of propensity mechanism to increase energy expenditure.

411
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:10,560
We shouldn't see this right. But people who have who have had these higher BMI are thought to be in a state of leptin resistance.

412
00:52:13,600 --> 00:52:23,410
How does this happen? So this is two figures showing you the signaling in the leptin receptor.

413
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:28,620
I see this better if I put the mouse over here.

414
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:36,850
So here is white adipose tissue and leptin levels are proportional to the amount of white adipose tissue you have,

415
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:44,650
and leptin is coming from the white adipose tissue and it circulates in the blood

416
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:51,700
and it goes to the acute nucleus and it binds to Lecter receptors expressed there.

417
00:52:53,590 --> 00:53:02,230
So the leptin receptor associates with this object here, this is a highness.

418
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:12,640
This is a kinase that activates the leptin receptor signaling pathway by correlating these three different risk residues on the leptin receptor.

419
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:17,020
And they have downstream signaling effects shown here.

420
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:24,069
The important one that I want you to focus on related to Lebanon resistance is this this

421
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:31,120
particular pathway where you're getting an activation of this step through a pathway dependent.

422
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,180
So it's that three levels increase in the cytoplasm.

423
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:43,290
This is a late transcription factor that goes into the nucleus and it increases

424
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:53,010
the levels of these signaling molecules SOX three and TCP these two molecules.

425
00:53:53,040 --> 00:54:03,779
Now these two are transcription factors that have a sex enter said that after a while you get left and binding to the receptor.

426
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:14,610
We get these signaling events and these molecules now SOX three and TCP IP, they inhibit further left in receptor signaling.

427
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:21,030
So it turns off the the ability of the Lepton receptor to have signaling events inhibiting appetite.

428
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:25,650
Right. And these events are short lived.

429
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:30,600
And if you have lower levels of circulating left, then this functions well.

430
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:41,170
So yeah, the think adipose tissue can do is it can release factors that can activate this other molecule,

431
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:47,940
TTP one B which inhibits JAK two activation of this receptor.

432
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:59,430
So I have so here's that in the lean body in the wild type animal, here's a leptin receptor to activate JAK two phosphorylation.

433
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:06,600
There's signaling events that occur through these residues and the leptin receptor.

434
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:10,650
Pay attention to this one. There are signaling events coming from here,

435
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:20,070
but this is the one I want you to remember where this particular cascade results in an accumulation of these two transcription factors.

436
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:36,880
Okay. And this shuts off the subsequent left in receptor signaling and the effects of leptin here in terms of its ability to inhibit appetite.

437
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:44,710
And if you were to, how do we know that this is important in regulation of body weight?

438
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:52,690
Well, if you knock this out, this particular or you take out a receptor and you knock it into an animal and it doesn't have

439
00:55:52,690 --> 00:56:02,649
this particular amino acid at this this tyrosine at this particular portion of the receptor,

440
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:10,010
they will increase in body size and get really fat on just regular chow meaning.

441
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:20,630
So this Stat3 signaling leading to activation of these transcription factors increase in the cytosol and turn off the electric receptor.

442
00:56:22,820 --> 00:56:27,050
So that pathway short led to people who are worthy.

443
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:36,580
So so what this does is it blocks that that's further signaling the letter receptor.

444
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:51,680
And then you also have this other pathway inhibiting JAK two activity and that is in addition to what's going on with the leptin receptor.

445
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:58,860
Okay. And that what this this does is this device correlates to.

446
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:03,670
So it becomes a negative. All right. So that's the normal pathway.

447
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:07,360
What happens with diet induced obesity?

448
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:17,170
So in this case, with diet induced obesity, you get more adipose tissue and you get because of that,

449
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:24,070
remember, leptin is is correlated with the total amount of adipose tissue.

450
00:57:24,070 --> 00:57:34,840
Have leptin levels increase. They circulate and they reach the brain and you get this chronic activation of the letter receptor.

451
00:57:36,370 --> 00:57:43,060
And what this does is it activates these inhibitory pathways here shown in red.

452
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:56,640
So the hand receptor is being activated chronically, leading to an accumulation of Xbox Three and TCP.

453
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:08,860
And what they do is they shut off the leptin receptor. Then you also get chronic activation of this other kinase that d phosphorylated JAK2.

454
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:19,420
So this is the basis for inhibiting leptin receptor signaling that should normally shut down your appetite

455
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:25,930
and increase your energy expenditure because of these increased levels of these transcription factors,

456
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:30,920
of these these signaling events that shut down the leptin receptor.

457
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,330
That doesn't happen. Yeah.

458
00:58:34,540 --> 00:58:38,469
Why is it short lived? 5 minutes, minutes?

459
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:41,590
2 hours, maybe. What is the explanation?

460
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:45,250
Why? It has a short clip. Why would they have a short term effect?

461
00:58:45,250 --> 00:58:53,320
Because these events that are going on, phosphorylation de phosphorylation, they can peak in an hour or two and then they decline rapidly.

462
00:58:53,330 --> 00:58:55,900
So there's a kinase that activates the pathway.

463
00:58:56,170 --> 00:59:04,390
There's another D phosphorylated enzyme that comes along that increases in response to that and de phosphorylation shuts down the signaling pathway.

464
00:59:08,990 --> 00:59:13,310
So with high adipose tissue at once, the amplitude of letting receptor signaling,

465
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:23,840
there's this increase in SOX three and TCP IP and this is a strong inhibition of leptin receptor signaling.

466
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:32,200
And you also get inactivation object to that once leptin receptor signaling in in

467
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:38,180
individuals in a high adipose tissue in animals that are fed a high fat diet.

468
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:40,910
Okay.

469
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:54,530
So here's another way to visualize, and that's shown here in this particular illustration includes the hypothalamic and complementary effects as well.

470
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:59,250
So here's panel a figure.

471
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:03,540
Here's what adipose tissue to produce leptin.

472
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:13,770
The left a receptor responds to this by activating the Stat3 pathway and this can ultimately inhibit appetite.

473
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:24,679
And then here are these cells that are responsible for inflammation in the central nervous system and the astrocytes.

474
01:00:24,680 --> 01:00:31,340
And they're not doing anything because there's not enough circulating lipid to cause a problem.

475
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:44,450
And if you were to give this animal or this individual exotic, this leptin, it would promote the activity of this pathway,

476
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:52,790
suppressing appetite even further, because these neurons now are left and responsive in this particular state level.

477
01:00:53,450 --> 01:01:05,239
Circulating left in the bottom half of the illustration shows you what happens when animals are fed a high calorie diet,

478
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:11,390
or humans are consuming a high calorie diet leading to chronically elevated levels of leptin.

479
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:19,860
So here we have just one little circle here representing left in levels.

480
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:25,350
Now we have three of these. And here you have chronically activated.

481
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:37,860
Step three, you have endoplasmic reticulum stress, and that would occur as a consequence of having high circulating lipids.

482
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:43,580
And you have feedback inhibitors.

483
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:49,440
The Xbox three. And the TCP IP.

484
01:01:49,890 --> 01:01:53,430
These these inhibitors of these leptin receptor signaling pathway.

485
01:01:54,240 --> 01:02:11,560
And these are. These are communicating with the lack of glia and astrocytes, and these cells are becoming activated by this air stress.

486
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:19,090
They're becoming activated by higher levels of saturated fat, getting into the central nervous system.

487
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:24,220
And that's causing some chronic inflammation as well.

488
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:35,250
So the lepton that you would need to suppress appetite in this particular state would have to be a bit higher to suppress appetite.

489
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:45,270
Here's outlet and that you would have to give to this particular animal with a higher level of adiposity to suppress their appetite.

490
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:52,530
So leptin resistance is a complicated concept,

491
01:02:53,160 --> 01:03:01,800
and these are a couple of pathways by which you start to occur through the hypothalamic inflammation

492
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:09,690
and through this desensitizing the leptin receptor due to the accumulation of inhibitory signals.

493
01:03:16,930 --> 01:03:20,989
So that's that's the basis for these outcomes.

494
01:03:20,990 --> 01:03:24,400
So these things are mechanisms is from animal models.

495
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:29,930
Animals put on a high fat diet. You see these affects what's happened in humans.

496
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:37,480
Well, this next paper is a landmark paper published, I believe this is 2010 or 2012.

497
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:44,890
And they're looking for, in this case, obesity associated with hypothalamic injury in rodents and humans.

498
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:49,450
And here they're showing you the same kind of experimental model.

499
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:54,010
They're putting animals on a high fat diet for 20 weeks or four weeks.

500
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:58,540
And they're looking at the levels of these transcripts.

501
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:05,380
The Monday for shown here on the bottom of this graph are different cytokines

502
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:10,240
that are in four different cytokines that are known to be pro-inflammatory.

503
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:16,780
So if you put animals on a high fat diet for 20 weeks, this is a 60% fat diet.

504
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,780
You see an elevation of these pro-inflammatory molecules in the brain and in the liver.

505
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:37,760
So after 20 weeks, an animal goes from normally 25 grams at that particular time period to 50 or 60 grams because they're on that high fat diet.

506
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:48,090
And you see this level of pro-inflammatory cytokines being produced in the liver and in the central nervous system.

507
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:58,440
What happens earlier? Do they have to have this high level of adiposity to see, to experience these pro-inflammatory events?

508
01:04:58,650 --> 01:05:03,030
Now, here's what happens after a three or four weeks.

509
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:14,190
So when the hypothalamus we see a significant increase in the cytokines, interleukin six and TNF but not the liver or adipose tissue.

510
01:05:20,130 --> 01:05:25,370
The rest of the figures look at weight gain and this is in days here.

511
01:05:26,270 --> 01:05:33,770
So these events at four weeks, this would be 28 days. You see more total mass in the animals in the high fat diet.

512
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:42,680
Okay. You see initially a high food intake that kind of tapers off, but it's higher than the animals in the regular chow.

513
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:47,870
And if you look at the total caloric intake of these animals over time and days,

514
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:55,580
they take in a lot of this high fat diet and then it starts to decline and get even out with the animals on the chow.

515
01:05:56,810 --> 01:06:05,690
So the high fat diet is representative of a highly palatable food.

516
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:11,420
To a mouse, it looks like cookie dough. You know, it's rich and fat.

517
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:20,420
It has the characteristics of a highly palatable food and they consume more of it and they get bigger over time as a consequence.

518
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:26,630
What would happen if you were to look at just one day of being on the assignment?

519
01:06:27,860 --> 01:06:37,160
Well, you see one day you see an increase in these transcripts for the pro-inflammatory cytokines within the hypothalamus.

520
01:06:37,490 --> 01:06:49,530
After just one day acting on the time that Dr. So it's thought that these inflammatory events that occur from being on the high fat diets themselves.

521
01:06:50,570 --> 01:06:55,070
Can affect the hypothalamic nuclei.

522
01:06:55,070 --> 01:07:04,700
Causing inflammation and inflammation can shut down the effect of these signaling events that would normally suppress appetite.

523
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:12,060
And then just here's some some more details about this.

524
01:07:12,390 --> 01:07:16,050
You're looking here at Microglial Markers.

525
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:20,640
Now, these are the other cells. They're not the neurons. We're looking at these immune cells in the brain.

526
01:07:20,730 --> 01:07:25,560
You're looking at their inflammatory markers.

527
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:30,350
And here this is CD 68, M.R, one GMP.

528
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:37,739
We're looking at how these change in response to being on the high fat diet versus chow for a number of days.

529
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:45,930
Then we see this significant increase in the glial cell population and their inflammatory

530
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:51,290
markers increase in a very short period of time in response to these types of things.

531
01:07:51,300 --> 01:08:02,970
High fat. So the glial cells, this is this concept here where you get activation of these inflammatory cascades and the glial cells as referred to,

532
01:08:02,970 --> 01:08:08,880
react elicits and it's called these are hallmarks and the brain in response to neural injury.

533
01:08:10,230 --> 01:08:14,820
So the glial cells are responding to inflammation that's induced by the high

534
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:20,910
fat diet that is looks like a neural injury and the glial cells become active.

535
01:08:24,990 --> 01:08:32,820
And here's a lot more detail about this response, but these are details that I don't want you to memorize.

536
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:41,940
But if we if we take a closer look at what's going on within the hypothalamic nuclei,

537
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:52,020
then this particular figure is focused on what's going on with the passing neurons, the neurons that are activated by leptin that suppress appetite.

538
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:57,540
What happens to them when in this case an animal is put on a high fat diet?

539
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:02,900
So here are the different markers.

540
01:09:03,060 --> 01:09:07,260
And we're seeing here in this case, another marker for neuronal injury.

541
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,160
It shock protein 72. It goes up high fat diet.

542
01:09:11,730 --> 01:09:14,340
And here's another way to look at this. We're here.

543
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:23,820
We have fluorescent protein markers for showing you that 72 protein is upregulated after seven days of feeding the high fat diet.

544
01:09:24,780 --> 01:09:34,980
And we look at mitochondria and see mitochondrial injury as a consequence of this effect of the high fat diet.

545
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:42,240
And this is after 20 weeks of feeding autophagy indicating more injury to the mitochondria.

546
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:50,130
But most importantly, I want you to remember this what happens to the population of neurons that suppresses appetite?

547
01:09:51,150 --> 01:09:54,810
That's the policy neurons, their population, their numbers go down.

548
01:09:55,830 --> 01:10:01,050
And this is shown here. So here here's the here's the standing of the cells within the hypothalamus.

549
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:09,510
These different dots correspond to the passing neurons, and there are fewer of them in the animals that are on the high fat diet.

550
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:16,200
And when you quantitate these by counting the number of passing cells in a particular region,

551
01:10:16,710 --> 01:10:20,910
you find that in this case, after eight months of being on the high fat diet, there are fewer of them.

552
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:38,060
Does this happen in humans? Well. In this particular example, they're looking at a different region of the brain in these images.

553
01:10:39,290 --> 01:10:45,710
So they're looking here for evidence of glial cells and they're looking at the regions of ranges that the medial basal hypothalamus.

554
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:54,150
And you're comparing here people with that with a BMI of less than 25 versus that people who have a BMI greater.

555
01:10:55,710 --> 01:11:02,400
And you're looking here for some kind of a marker for reactive closeness in this medial basal hypothalamus.

556
01:11:03,330 --> 01:11:10,200
And they're looking at glial cells and the response to tissue damage.

557
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:17,220
And in this particular case, they can measure hypothalamic damage.

558
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:27,900
They can look at glial reactive change, proliferation or hypertrophy in these different regions of the brain, and they can by collecting images.

559
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:32,330
Here's the amygdala, here's that medial basal hypothalamus here,

560
01:11:32,340 --> 01:11:41,130
the regions where they acquired these images and they produce these types of graphs where you see as we go up in BMI,

561
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:48,450
there's a greater level of this signal ratio indicating greater levels of doses.

562
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:57,150
So this is the evidence that they provide in terms of neuronal injury occurring in people is higher because.

563
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,370
The next question are I'll go through the summary here.

564
01:12:05,490 --> 01:12:16,350
So chronic hypothalamic inflammation could lead to weight gain, leptin and insulin resistance, as we saw in the mouse models on peptide levels.

565
01:12:16,350 --> 01:12:22,440
And individuals with obesity are lower at baseline and after a meal escalated,

566
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:26,130
ghrelin levels decline in normal weight, but not in individuals with obesity.

567
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:39,510
And so, um, and in human models, we're seeing this evidence for neuronal injury as a consequence in the animals with high fat diets.

568
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:46,080
And in this particular paper in these humans and response to having a higher BMI.

569
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:54,510
So this is where the theories come from in regard to the effects of either

570
01:12:54,690 --> 01:13:01,110
either having these caused by high fat diets or in humans having higher BMI.

571
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:09,810
Explain or attempt to explain unresponsiveness to hunger cues as a consequence of lower levels

572
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:15,390
of circulating hormones or dysregulated circulating hormones and insensitivity to leptin.

573
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:27,319
So. I'm going to guess I'm going to go up for five more minutes.

574
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:33,950
And I don't know if I'm going to finish this, but the paper that I had to read had to do with this discussion of,

575
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:41,030
do we have a is there a mechanism for maintaining your body weight?

576
01:13:41,690 --> 01:13:47,090
Is there does your body attempt to maintain its weight at any particular time?

577
01:13:48,110 --> 01:13:58,909
And it discusses different theories that might explain this and it describes the set point model and then shortcomings of the set point model.

578
01:13:58,910 --> 01:14:08,030
And then it points to at the end descriptions as to why the set point model might be inaccurate and

579
01:14:08,030 --> 01:14:18,050
whether or not it's of a physiologic benefit to try to regulate body weight homeostasis to begin with.

580
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:28,760
And it points to the environment as a critical factor and what we've seen in terms of the increased prevalence of obesity in developed nations.

581
01:14:29,810 --> 01:14:39,440
So as you probably have heard and read, the set point theory comes from experiments done by Kennedy.

582
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:45,890
And there were some also some experiments done in humans, the Minnesota Starvation Study.

583
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:56,000
And they consider the adipose tissue as a critical factor in regulating appetite and body weight.

584
01:14:56,630 --> 01:15:08,090
So in the first figure here, you have a situation where the body weight is regulated by how much stored energy you have in the form of fat.

585
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,129
And this signals to brain that there's a target cells in the brain.

586
01:15:13,130 --> 01:15:19,610
And we've discussed what these are that affect intake and energy expenditure.

587
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:29,870
So this would be the leptin response of neurons in the brain and you maintain a certain level of weight based on this pathway.

588
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:39,710
Okay. So if you were to increase your body weight by increasing caloric intake through a positive energy balance,

589
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:45,590
this would increase the signals to the brain, to the left and responsive neurons,

590
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:56,720
and this would presumably decrease intake of calories and would increase energy expenditure in the form of a genesis perhaps.

591
01:15:57,860 --> 01:16:04,640
And this would have ultimately a negative effect and it would reduce energy intake

592
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:09,040
so that you would go back down to the initial body weight that you started that.

593
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:17,020
Conversely, if you were to decrease somebody's body weight so that it shrunk adipose tissue levels,

594
01:16:17,830 --> 01:16:22,330
the signal coming from the adipose tissue in the form of leptin would decline.

595
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:27,640
And this would have the opposite effect. Right. There would be less leptin, signaling.

596
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:38,440
There would be greater hunger and appetite, there would be less energy expenditure in terms of the resting energy expenditure.

597
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,400
And you would get hungry and you would take in more food.

598
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:50,320
And this would increase energy leading to energy intake, leading to a positive energy balance to get back to that level of adipose transport.

599
01:16:53,230 --> 01:17:03,370
But in an experimental model where you have rats in a cage and you give an chow, this model works really well.

600
01:17:04,270 --> 01:17:10,840
And in the case of the human starvation experiments, if you have people who reduce their food intake in this way,

601
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:19,600
if you feed them regular, a regular diet that they had consumed before, their body weights go back to what they were before starvation.

602
01:17:19,660 --> 01:17:24,460
If you were to force feed them and then stop force feeding them, they would go back to this set point.

603
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:30,730
This works very well, and in the absence of highly palatable food,

604
01:17:31,570 --> 01:17:36,340
that is highly probable food that seems to be the trigger that messes up this paradigm.

605
01:17:41,200 --> 01:17:51,130
So just I'm going to go through this one slide and then today and then we'll come back to this set point theory when we meet again on Wednesday.

606
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:53,680
So the set point theory,

607
01:17:54,010 --> 01:18:02,470
the fat tissue produces a signal itself to be leptin that reaches the brain to inform it about peripheral energy stores in the form of lipids.

608
01:18:02,650 --> 01:18:06,730
Long term energy stores, energy gain weight.

609
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:15,410
Body mass is above the set point. Food intake declines and energy expenditure increases.

610
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:24,980
To get back to that previous set, when you lose weight on fatness declines below the set point level.

611
01:18:25,550 --> 01:18:31,190
And as a consequence, food intake increases and energy expenditure decreases.

612
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:42,560
And over time you get hungrier, you eat more, and you're trying to get back to that particular the previous level of about a positive.

613
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:48,260
So this is the set point theory again proposed by Kennedy in the fifties.

614
01:18:48,770 --> 01:19:02,110
And then when leptin was discovered in the nineties, 1994, it became the molecule that was responsible for this set point regulation.

615
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:07,550
The idea. All right. I'm going to stop there because we're at the end of our time.

616
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:15,709
So have you discussed the set point theory in other classes? Have you discussed issues related to its problems in terms of it?

617
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:26,040
Explain what we're seeing. You read the paper, the perusal assignment is do I put it up on Wednesday, read that.

618
01:19:26,040 --> 01:19:31,250
And you can see why the set point theory is it's problematic.

619
01:19:31,610 --> 01:19:37,880
Yeah. Yeah. I received a couple of questions about what I had written on the board that just wanted to address that really quick with you all.

620
01:19:38,180 --> 01:19:40,420
Sure. Let me let me take the step. Yeah, go ahead.

621
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:49,100
If you guys had seen these comments emailed to that community, he addressed briefly the crisis in Iran.

622
01:19:49,880 --> 01:19:58,114
I think I'm the only Iranian in this cohort. So the first line I wrote is, you know, my saw, I mean, which is the name of a 22 year.
