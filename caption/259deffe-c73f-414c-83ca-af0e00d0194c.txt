1
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:16,150
And. I'm getting. Jason Davis.

2
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:55,500
It could be a good time. Okay.

3
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,880
Just triple checking all these deep stuff. I just don't want to kind of always mess up data so that we can clarify.

4
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,110
But the other things I just wanted to check with you guys.

5
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:19,780
Has Jackie reached out to people about the being on the website things or not?

6
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:29,709
Not yet. Okay. So let me I'll connect with her too, because usually there's a lot going on there,

7
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:36,040
like redesigning founder, but not the undergraduate and master's student core courses.

8
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:40,660
And so there's just like, like so many moving parts right now and this departmental.

9
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:45,460
To school space. I think some things are falling off.

10
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:55,070
A little bit of the radar there. The other thing I think I mentioned this or maybe emails, but for the IDP piece, so you guys, you know,

11
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:02,290
did the IDP and everything around in different formats and as people have done, you know, different formats lots of times.

12
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:14,950
But what I did, Christine, I've been going back and forth about this IDP stuff, and I forwarded her the formats that I provided to you guys for IDP,

13
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:20,440
and I mentioned that my IDP thing is that like if people have a helpful, like we should sort of figure out the best.

14
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:29,540
Systematic way for people to do that. And so I think none of you guys are on heavy, doc, is that correct?

15
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:34,310
That's like the governing body of the big doctors.

16
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:48,889
Okay. So I think this May 1st go to he beat us, but then he doc hopefully can like pull together a meeting of all the teach systems and you

17
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:52,400
guys can kind of all contribute to what you think would be most helpful because I think.

18
00:03:53,290 --> 00:04:02,559
This is also happening seems like a random motivation to to do IEPs and to get people kind of more on the same page.

19
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,730
So I guess I would just say like watch for that and definitely give whatever, you know,

20
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,920
hope and hoping that there'll be multiple people across multiple years so that they can reflect

21
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:21,220
on like what was helpful over time with that IDP because I know that is an issue to consider.

22
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:25,030
Uh, what else about that stuff?

23
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:30,850
So again so I think it'll I think it'll start with he'd doc who.

24
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,870
I'm not in contact with Jackie.

25
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:46,459
And then I wanted to today we'll talk about conferencing and we flipped this session with should say 11, ten, 11 to 11, nine, ten, 11.

26
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:53,630
That's just totally wrong. Sorry, 11, nine readings and we'll talk about just sort of like them.

27
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:59,990
It's kind of fun, I think, to talk about this. But there's a lot of like perils and pitfalls of dissemination,

28
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:04,970
especially like on sort of social media spaces where a lot of people disseminate things.

29
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,780
So we could talk about that as well as conferencing.

30
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:15,920
But I wanted to see I know that I've talked with Amy and she's going to APJ and there's anyone else conferencing.

31
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,270
Like we're submitting things to conferences in this next.

32
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,720
You know, foreseeable few months. Oh, you also want money?

33
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:31,110
That's right. Even so. Okay, so you guys are both going to go J and then Clara.

34
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:41,510
Do you have ideas of conference? Okay, cool.

35
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,450
So that'll be good to hear about how that goes when you and you guys get back.

36
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,200
And it's that that is like upcoming beginning of November, right?

37
00:05:51,070 --> 00:06:01,980
Right. Okay. And I think about it like 60 minutes of hopefully I never want to assume at this point.

38
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:04,480
Right, exactly. Okay. Well, that's that's great. That's awesome.

39
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:11,409
So, yeah, so it'll be good to like follow up and, you know, just kind of hear how everything went NABJ day.

40
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:16,270
And then I think what we can talk about today is just kind of previewing like could do a little

41
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:24,790
strategizing about how to make it like work best for you and as well as the social media stuff.

42
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,819
Okay. And then the other thing I just wanted to clarify,

43
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:36,040
so I do have to sort of like randomizer thing so that it's like officially randomize who reads whose paper and these are my results.

44
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,480
So and I wanted to put that in red because I want to clarify that we're all on the same page of those dates.

45
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:54,460
So what we would do is have Amy review quiz paper closer to a newspaper, and I can review Clara's paper.

46
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:59,030
And provide that peer review feedback. Does that make sense?

47
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:08,650
Oh, I read that back. Oh, did I say it backwards either way?

48
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:16,210
I was just writing in there. So if the author is Amy, the peer reviewer is clear.

49
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:20,260
Okay. Well, maybe the hero should go that way. I don't know.

50
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,040
So I reviewed my favorite two points.

51
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,100
Yes. And I. I'm so glad you're here.

52
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,090
Yeah, maybe that's the direction the arrow is.

53
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:38,680
And I'd be like Amy since a quick glance name, of course, since declared.

54
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:46,400
I know. And what we talked about last time.

55
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,650
No, just that we're all expecting papers.

56
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:58,600
And I keep getting messed up because my syllabus. But.

57
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,210
So you guys will send the paper to your peer.

58
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:08,670
I have a 16. Of November.

59
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:24,330
And then the peer who is reviewing the paper will send it back to you on the 23rd, which is the day before Thanksgiving.

60
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:29,760
So if you guys also like what I say, I mean, I know that that's just a week apart.

61
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,520
Or so. But if you guys want to.

62
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:40,550
Send it back earlier because you're leaving town. Whatever it is like that, it's totally fine.

63
00:08:41,840 --> 00:09:00,230
But those are weak of heart and deeds. And then if you guys send in your review to me also, and then the draft that the peer sent you by 1123 also.

64
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:09,700
So just send the review to your peer and to me and then you can upload it and canvas the facts.

65
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:20,249
Or just email it to me, that is fine so that I can just sort of like review and again,

66
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:26,670
like this is really just to provide, you know, any tips or comments on.

67
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,690
What to review. And what also is going to say.

68
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:44,610
Oh, yeah. Also, while we're talking about this, I just wanted to kind of go over the assignment a little bit in terms of what points we're reviewing.

69
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,090
And it's really just a perk to provide, you know, assistance.

70
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:55,979
But it's also usually when we talk about this, we're talking about peer reviewing in the same day.

71
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,610
So we'll talk about peer reviewing in advance of you guys doing these reviews.

72
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,910
But what I did want to do. I'm sorry. Get out of this for Seth here.

73
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:19,860
Little bit of it was. Yeah.

74
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,490
I mean, there's a I know I feel bad to, like, switch up these dates.

75
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:30,449
I was like Christy messing with my schedule, but it's like, we could just.

76
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,290
We just. There's a video today that is like, okay.

77
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,740
Sorry. I have these notes to myself. Comments.

78
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:52,540
Oh, boy, I. And I want to find out what that mother.

79
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:00,800
You put it right before you pre you commented on Article three term.

80
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:12,410
I think it's really important to keep reading that we have a list of three so many Americans like my guys, the midterms that are closer to me.

81
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:19,180
Oh, my gosh. Yeah, I think.

82
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,100
I think that is what it is. I did like that. Yeah.

83
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,689
And I'm sure I've said this before for you guys,

84
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:33,210
but a lot of the reading in this class is like for your reference and some instigate discussion and some it's like, so you have it.

85
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:41,350
So yeah, if you want to go back to it. You know, one of the things that we've we talked about at the beginning and is always good

86
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:45,370
to just check in again with like those the students who are ahead in the program,

87
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:52,299
but like what's a good way to like organize all the stuff that I have from the semester and like,

88
00:11:52,300 --> 00:12:00,310
do I just dump it into a folder or do I, you know, because you're canvas access to these folders will and.

89
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:09,020
And so I think it's always a good, good idea to figure out a system that works for you.

90
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:15,020
And it seems like some people have done Google. Like Google Folders by class.

91
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,860
To sort of save ratings.

92
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:31,020
And I think, you know, my other side is like this canvas state still exists and I'm sure we can re re invoke, you know, because people's access to it.

93
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,180
But just kind of like while you're in the class and like for all of your classes.

94
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:42,620
Like Justin's, I would imagine it's going to have a lot of really good resources that you'll kind of go back to over and over.

95
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:50,810
So like somehow figuring out to like fold or those readings so you can access them again in the future, not be a canvas is good.

96
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,730
Okay. So this is kind of the like my little write up about this assignment.

97
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:59,479
I just wanted to go over a little bit and I know nobody's like written.

98
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,590
This paper gets a full abstract still, but the idea of the peer review is like, like I said,

99
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:11,930
to get some practice peer reviewing also to kind of just get to know each other's topics, which we do a little bit.

100
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:17,059
But I think it makes for good image discussion for like our final presentation times when we're like,

101
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,810
Oh, this is a research we could go about looking at this, Oh, this is how to do that.

102
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,400
So this is the thing will submit the draft to that.

103
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:34,520
I just kind of set the goal of the final paper is to develop a concise lit review to situate your topic of interest,

104
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,890
to describe the significance of the topic for public health.

105
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:41,870
Think of it as an opportunity to make your case for why the topic should be studied and what the

106
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:48,679
gap in the sciences and a preview so that because the paper ends before the approach section,

107
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,270
the pre the paper is really like significance and innovation to think about like grant terms.

108
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:01,370
But you can also preview like why the way you'll address it will be, you know, innovative.

109
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:07,490
Again, you can see how this could map perfectly to premium but doesn't need to.

110
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:15,500
And then again, the peer review assignment is not like reviewing a journal article where we're

111
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,630
just like another review journal articles by like tearing people's work apart.

112
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:29,689
But it's more we want to be more like instructive and giving more information because in a peer reviewed journal article,

113
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,860
like, people couldn't decide to do that, but they often just kind of do the critiques.

114
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:39,420
Which we'll talk more about. But this is more like, you know, think about this.

115
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,940
You don't have to have the answer. But to sort of to provide some guiding questions, I think can be helpful for the peer.

116
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,620
And also, I think given your guys knowledge and you've already heard a bit about these topics from each other,

117
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:59,460
but sort of I think sometimes where the gaps are can be a part where people like,

118
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:07,170
you know, and we need to be able to like ideally one could emerge from this paper by being able to say,

119
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,130
like, here are the gaps, like boom, boom, boom, you know, like very tight.

120
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,660
And that could always get tighter for all of us because that's like part of our research agenda.

121
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:21,540
And so that's that's a part where I feel like sometimes of peer reviewing and saying, like,

122
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,040
I think I can add to it what the gaps are, but like we list them or something like that.

123
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:37,290
And then the, the peer review learner kind of responds to these questions and if this should be easy for the peer reviewers to respond to,

124
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:45,810
because the writer I like apparently has like spoon fed it to the reviewer or is starting to do that because I know it's a draft.

125
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:54,090
And then with is population like this should be very easy to answer if you have enough of a draft there.

126
00:15:56,730 --> 00:16:04,980
And then this I feel like this question of the it's kind of gets into methods a little bit of like how previous research

127
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:13,049
has been doing this with this advantages and disadvantages and how previous like researchers have have gone about this.

128
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:20,040
It gets a little bit into approach, so this question may not be quite as well developed in these like literature review drafts,

129
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,780
but it may be a part where there's a gap. So that may be a question that's a little harder to answer.

130
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:31,260
And then just this sort of like gut reaction of like, does it leave you with an understanding of the questions?

131
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:39,060
And then I always like people to comment on writing style just because it's like just another set of eyes on one's writing.

132
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:44,280
So hopefully and I have like the one strike, the one area improvement.

133
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,489
So this the state is wrong here.

134
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:53,700
So this is usually becomes the day before Thanksgiving because I think this part of the semester is like I need a little bit more time.

135
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,669
And so those are kind of the there's like overarching peer feedback.

136
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,230
It's not like go in and correct the grammar. Like that's because we also know it's a draft.

137
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:13,280
But like at this point, thinking about the paper, your final people will be in much better shape if that peer can go in and address those questions.

138
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:17,910
So that's kind of it. It's much more of an overarching peer review idea.

139
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,559
So do you guys have questions at this juncture on that peer review?

140
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:26,640
We can continue to talk more about it, but. I'm good.

141
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:33,680
Okay. Cool. So let me go back to this and.

142
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:40,020
Then just to confirm that, we'll do final papers by the six.

143
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:46,130
Of December. And then I will get the activities with the comments.

144
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:52,840
And. Yeah. Okay.

145
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:58,700
The other thing we hadn't talked about quite yet was the presentation dates.

146
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,790
Because we have three.

147
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,149
Actually, I just. Sorry.

148
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:14,020
1/2. Let me just look at this calendar on my own because it's the most accessible.

149
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:20,490
We have class. We do not have class on the 23rd state before Thanksgiving.

150
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,090
Then December 3rd, I'm sorry, November 30th.

151
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:28,380
We do have class and we want to do a research presentation.

152
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,060
And then we do not have class.

153
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:42,060
Like classes are over. The week.

154
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:49,020
December 14th or 12th, December 12th.

155
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,950
So we actually do not have class December 14th, which somehow.

156
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:02,749
I had thought in my head, maybe we did have class because, you know,

157
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:09,290
it is is like the University of Michigan winter break is so short that sometimes it kind of goes into that next week.

158
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,470
And so I think I took a look and was like, oh my gosh, I actually don't have.

159
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,860
So I needed to do a little juggling there.

160
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:23,389
But so we do want to do presentations and we may end up doing two presentations.

161
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:29,480
That means on the same day, which I think that's fine, but so I don't think we want to do three on the same day.

162
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:39,410
I think that's a lot. But so if you guys want to decide like who wants to go on the 30th and who wants to go on the seven?

163
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:45,650
Not the name to which it says it's all. That would be great.

164
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,150
And I, you know, we'll do two on one day and one on another day.

165
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,510
And it's really up to you guys how you want to do that.

166
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,520
So we can confirm that maybe even for the next time, we'll see how people are feeling about the institutions.

167
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,040
Okay. Sorry for all that data confusion stuff too, but.

168
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,020
Okay. I think that is everything.

169
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:20,040
It's funny, this class, there's so many topics like we're doing today can kind of move around, but I still feel like there's like a good flow.

170
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,550
So I feel like, ah, for my brain, the flow is a little, a little funky now.

171
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,190
But anyway. All right, so.

172
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:32,220
So talk about, um. Um.

173
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:45,390
Okay. Okay. So this is like, be a flashback to kind of prior conferencing eras of, um, I mean,

174
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:54,150
it'll be interesting to see how masked it is actually, because it's so big, everybody will have traveled.

175
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,730
There's like gnarly flu things going around right now and other things.

176
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:06,370
So just I think it might be a super spreader event no matter what.

177
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,820
Right? Right. I know.

178
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:17,190
And then you think like, okay, this conference rooms and he, like, never leave the hotel and you just kind of like,

179
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:22,490
walk it around and everybody's ever for, like, a long time and all those surfaces and,

180
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,610
you know, so, like, take some antiseptic in your bag or whatever.

181
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:36,930
But, you know, conferences are great, and we all want to, like, be in a room and learn from the people talking and, you know, ask questions.

182
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:47,490
To be engaged. And I think just even looking at this photo, kind of like, oh, conference room is really lovely and it's a chance to engage.

183
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:56,770
And this is actually kind of a nice setting in that like everybody's at an individual table, which often, you know, is not the case.

184
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:59,369
We're like on those kind of back rows.

185
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:06,659
And so I think this also I liked it because it kind of illustrated like you can always turn to your neighbor and chat in a conference.

186
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:12,059
And I think one thing that happens a fair bit is, you know,

187
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:18,210
you end up next in a scene in a lot of the same people in similar sessions because you're interested in the same stuff.

188
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,000
And so that's like a nice informal way to just be like, hi, here we are again, you know,

189
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,320
just to sort of establish like a little bit of a loose tie, like we're in this together to do to do conferencing.

190
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:38,130
So this is where I feel like this is, you know, this is just it's kind of constantly changing the space of.

191
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,980
Which conferences do I go to?

192
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:49,010
You know, which align with my research interests, like kind of specifically,

193
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:54,890
which may probably be smaller conferences of a few hundred or fewer people.

194
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:03,380
The primary professional meeting in our field, like really big picture is APJ.

195
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:09,520
But that may not you know, there's a ton of stuff at APJ, obviously,

196
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:18,920
but it may not be like from your conference, you know, going forward you may find more specialized stuff.

197
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:26,540
And I think it's always helpful, even though it's expensive and it becomes like quite a bit to go to lots of conferences,

198
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:33,980
especially if you can in this era, try out a few different ones.

199
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:40,370
And I think hopefully people will be able to try out a few different ones kind of ongoing.

200
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:48,250
But this is a really good time to try out some different ones because you can build those early networks across different meetings.

201
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:58,939
And so what you may get from like APJ, you know, is sort of broad introductions to like this is what the field cares about.

202
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:04,940
It's always there's always something in the news from APJ. You know, it's very like current topics.

203
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,510
Like, you know, top people, amazing keynote speakers.

204
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:19,890
So I think in that in that way, like for that alone, going to APJ and just seeing these, you know, luminaries in the field is really exciting.

205
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,710
And there's definitely about just like high energy of just being there among so many people.

206
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:34,379
And then these are some other like considerations when we're thinking about so APJ images every

207
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:41,430
year and then some big conferences like really this is like subspecialties are all over the place,

208
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:52,710
but a lot of conferences are only every other year. And so thinking about that and this particular like what's the timing of your doctoral career?

209
00:24:53,310 --> 00:25:00,110
So like APJ, if it's every year, you could just plan to do it every year or do it once and be like, okay, I've done it.

210
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:05,009
It's not my thing, you know? Or like, I'll do it at the beginning and then I'll do it like what?

211
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:08,730
I'm sort of seeking for jobs because I have like the broadest audience.

212
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,399
But if you're talking about more specific conferences, it may not occur all the time.

213
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,910
I always use the example of S, R, K, which actually is on here, but that's a child development conference that's sort of like my disciplinary home.

214
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:25,950
That's only every two years, the big meeting.

215
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:33,540
And then they have like sort of more specialized like focal topic breakout meetings on the off years.

216
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:40,230
And so it's a good idea if you guys like find a conference and this is just like a sampling

217
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:44,340
of a few behavioral medicine is one that a lot of people in this department also go to,

218
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:52,590
um, to go to that conference website and just sort of scan like when are your upcoming conferences

219
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:57,230
like across the next few years because they should have those dates findable on their website.

220
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:05,130
And then are there other like kind of like affiliated meetings that they like will cross,

221
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:11,580
you know, brand with or they're like subsets of that bigger organization.

222
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:19,020
And so just kind of, you know, talking to people and spending some time on the website, just sort of see what the plan is.

223
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:26,129
Because if a conference is not every year, then like it could, you know, hit, you know,

224
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:31,080
now and then, not until your third year, you know, or your second and fourth year.

225
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,990
And so sort of figuring out like when in your graduate training you want to hit these conferences.

226
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:42,570
Um, I think, you know, in your first year you often don't have like your own data to present,

227
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,729
but then that could be a good goal for like year number two to say like, oh,

228
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:53,670
I'm going to go and present something, you know, like a poster based on my work.

229
00:26:54,900 --> 00:27:00,300
And it can be a kind of a good, you know, on the way to being a paper goal.

230
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,719
Another thing that that I think is really good advice.

231
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:11,460
Sometimes it's hard to follow, but if you're preparing something for a conference like try your best to make it into a paper.

232
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:20,190
And that's, that seems really obvious, but it's easier said than done because I think we've all probably like been in the last minute

233
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:25,649
scramble or we will be to put something together for a conference and then you kind of go,

234
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:30,420
Oh yeah, that was great. And then you look back at it and they're like, Oh, to make this a paper, it's going to be like a big leap.

235
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:35,690
And sometimes it won't become a paper, but if you can, you know,

236
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,579
kind of keep it in the pipeline to becoming a paper because you've already

237
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:42,090
spent time on it and hopefully get feedback like I've been thinking about it.

238
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:49,750
So that's another sort of sidebar. The other things that are particularly relevant to think about are like, How pricey is the meeting?

239
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:54,840
Who's going to pay for you to attend the meeting for your plane, for your hotel, for that registration?

240
00:27:55,410 --> 00:28:02,549
So most, you know, professional conference societies will have like a student registration, you know, level.

241
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:09,360
But like, for example, SVM is really expensive to go to as like a full fledged faculty member.

242
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,269
It's like $700 or so that have membership and they're like really just to go and like be part of a symposium.

243
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,989
So some of them just really get very expensive, not currently,

244
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:22,980
but just sort of that's the way to keep in mind, like as you think about, you know, careers.

245
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:30,809
Um, and then the other big question for you guys too is like if you're going to get funding for attending the meeting,

246
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:38,280
do you need to present to be a presenter of something? And so often I'm not sure about internal funding.

247
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:42,630
And like if your advisor says like, hey, I can cover you go to this conference like that, that's fine.

248
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:52,889
But for like, um, like university internal or external funding, you often need to like, have a little thing that says, you know, great,

249
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,920
maybe you'll be presenting your poster at this date and this time, and you have to,

250
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,840
like, submit that little announcement in order to get funding to attend the conference.

251
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:01,980
So that's what I keep in mind.

252
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:10,679
And then I've been to this like talk to your advisor, other students and there's just, there's a few, but I would say these are not great,

253
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:17,669
but I put them up there for your reference like sites about what are conferences in this area and it tends to be pretty idiosyncratic

254
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:24,389
and like I think it's better just to talk to people in the field about what they attend and when I put the Michigan one up,

255
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:31,980
so that's like the Michigan Public Health Conference. So that's like a different type of conference and very local issues.

256
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,500
And that exists, you know,

257
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:45,719
like in any kind of area that you'd be interested in and working in conferences that are more community engaged and involved.

258
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:49,650
People like coming from the health department, coming to talk to researchers from the University of Michigan.

259
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:57,450
So that's like a very different kind of conference from like one of these, you know, very research focused, professional, kind of.

260
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,190
So you say, oh, that, that, that.

261
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:13,400
I guess I don't know how you say it. Someone was just talking to me about that might have been Christie or might have been someone else,

262
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:21,740
but I think that's another one where people kind of have started to go to in the sort of eating and nutrition space.

263
00:30:22,710 --> 00:30:31,620
Which nobody here necessarily is, but it's been PI, which is like international society for physical activity and nutrition behavior.

264
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:36,180
Some combination of those words is another big one.

265
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:43,870
The other conferences that people have known about or gone to in the past that

266
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:51,400
are that were interesting or bad or good or recommendable or not as serious.

267
00:30:51,910 --> 00:31:01,139
Oh, yeah, that's right. You had mentioned that one. I'm mean, man.

268
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:08,620
And it was still very much in protest. A lot of mystery.

269
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:14,920
All right. It was great. It's my pleasure.

270
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:22,170
And Maple. It was clear to call the session.

271
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:32,380
It was small enough that you. I think that's really key.

272
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:41,610
I think that's why it's really important to like build in a smaller one and with like a big, big FPGA and Big Sur CD or something.

273
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:50,920
And now do they have? It might have been NCR.

274
00:31:52,690 --> 00:32:00,700
There's one that's also like a social at the conference and maybe the people who do that or go to ACR.

275
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,680
But I'm not sure there might be another one, I think. And we were in a class.

276
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:17,730
Speaking as I was nine weeks ago, they were mentioning that the person who had the ANC conference is in Soho had been in there for one or so.

277
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:24,940
I don't know, several comments on the tenor. Yeah, I think that that rings a bell.

278
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:27,560
So I think, um, you know, like,

279
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:34,030
social B is certainly something that we'd all be probably interested in and interested in attending and finding out more.

280
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:43,569
And my hearing people also present from like, you know, outside of your discipline, I think that's always really helpful because then you're like,

281
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:50,080
Oh, this feels like epidemiology and I feel like this, or like, Oh, we want to integrate some of these methods.

282
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:55,149
And so I think it's really helpful kind of defining like where your work sits to be at

283
00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:01,570
conferences that are like like one away from where you like spend your main focus of your time.

284
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:06,340
And I think it can also just kind of like spark a little bit of information in.

285
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:13,480
Disciplinary like moments of like, oh, that's what they look at that, you know, this variable or like this is how they look at it.

286
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:25,900
So I think that's that's that's always helpful. And I think I've mentioned before this of PR is it's less help but it's very like behavior and

287
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:32,120
youth behavior focused and they're very kind of oriented to junior and junior investigators,

288
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,490
the junior people, um. Okay.

289
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,730
I'm trying to think feel like there was another one that was, like, floating around.

290
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,420
It's always good to just sort of hear what people have also done in their prior lives.

291
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:50,570
I really enjoyed that. The Science Conference conferences. Monsters.

292
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:56,310
And how do you help these? Very. The politicians remind us.

293
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:06,639
Implementation of research in collaboration. That's every two years.

294
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,750
And that's. Mm hmm.

295
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:22,340
And what that was implementation research. That's great.

296
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:29,020
Yeah, that seems like. Do you have a sense of like which disciplines kind of tend to go?

297
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,120
Or is it really just super broad? It's pretty broad. There are a lot of like.

298
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:40,790
Most of the material sciences. So a lot of it is hard to focus on because there is a lot.

299
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:47,010
Focus on the computer research. Research and practice.

300
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:58,500
Community forums where you can buy time for you to be engaged and to be more active.

301
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:09,580
That's not all. Yeah. It's really helpful to actually hear from both the researcher and the.

302
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,710
That's great. That's great. I'm going to add that one to talk about.

303
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:25,570
And I think like AT&T does have I think certain I think they call them tracks.

304
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:32,989
Seems like not a great term but whatever. But just like focus areas and I think some of them are like community partner focused.

305
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:42,050
And so there definitely are parts of each day where new partners are coming in and coming to the conference for sure, because it's so broad reaching.

306
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:50,170
So expensive, but yeah, totally.

307
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:53,919
Exactly. And then it's like, I don't know.

308
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,680
And I, I had one experience where I had a community partner came with me and it was a local conference.

309
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:05,919
So it wasn't like the travel wasn't as expensive, but it was still it was very, you know, still very academic,

310
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:16,059
which was like it like just led to some interesting conversations between the two of us because she was like, I see why you like this.

311
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:20,830
And I, you know, it's like I'm just like not as into it.

312
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:28,570
And I felt like it was a good use of time and, you know, so anyway, it was just it's always interesting when like in this conferencing space.

313
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,280
Like how it's set up and how kind of inclusive of partners there is, I think really.

314
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,639
GRACE And it wasn't a that wasn't like a bad experience that she was just sort of a she was like it was one of those things.

315
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,630
She was like, oh, yes, I know.

316
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:49,530
Like this is sort of where you like spend the southern part of your day.

317
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,910
So, um, yeah, it's always an interesting thing, but I like that's good to hear about that one.

318
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,819
The other thing, and I think we, you know, we talked about this a little bit,

319
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:12,540
but the other thing that can kind of come up that might come up for you guys is like an opportunity to go to like a CDC or NIH sponsored meeting.

320
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:16,069
That's that will be like an awesome experience.

321
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:30,600
So I would say take any opportunity that you have to do that because they're usually focused around like a driving question or a driving topic.

322
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:40,800
So for example, like Rashan and Kiana are going to one that's sponsored by, I think it's like NIH, CDC and HUD.

323
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:45,989
So like focused on housing and it's going to be more of a workshop meeting.

324
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:51,270
But then I think Kiana is doing a poster on some of the stuff that we worked on.

325
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:59,969
And then Roxanna is like giving a talk. And so if you have the opportunities to do those that are like, you know,

326
00:37:59,970 --> 00:38:08,340
with your mentor or just sort of NIH also offers more like broad training stuff and they do a fair bit of implementation science.

327
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,420
They have these conferences and.

328
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:18,710
Kind of these three branded like minds the gap meaning like between research and practice and also like other sort of sub.

329
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:29,129
You know, so. Topics, I guess. Some of those will come up on those like NIH alerts that I was talking about the other day and

330
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:35,310
some I feel like you just kind of have to like find out in the ether how they're happening.

331
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:45,240
So. You know, it's always good to just like keep in mind that those happen and that like you can go to those like some are invited,

332
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:52,920
but a lot of them are open. What's another?

333
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,560
Did you say Academy health? Amy Yeah.

334
00:38:58,540 --> 00:39:05,769
So yeah, it's it's kind of a it's like a lot of knowledge to accumulate and sometimes it feels like a little daunting,

335
00:39:05,770 --> 00:39:09,370
I think, to figure it out because it's like a lot of different worlds you have to kind of get to know.

336
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:18,220
But as you talk to people and I always ask, are there conferences that you go to, I think you'll get some good, good responses that way.

337
00:39:19,570 --> 00:39:24,760
Okay. To do that. Yeah. The cancer one's ACR and yeah.

338
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,700
Those are big. They were about like SBM against.

339
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:37,120
But I did local teaching and learning in Mexico, and that was really nice to just figure out what other people would be working on.

340
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,960
Yeah, but I think my favorite one,

341
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:51,490
they started a Cancer for Latinos conference that launched on this down there in Phenix O'Neil and it was almost said to be in that niche.

342
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:54,650
Yeah, that's really. I think that's the most exciting.

343
00:39:54,670 --> 00:40:00,310
They've been out. So it is nice that you can identify where people are.

344
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:03,850
Yes. Oh, my gosh. Totally. Yeah.

345
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,319
And I think it's really I mean,

346
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:10,719
I've definitely had that experience where I'm like I had a really focused one and I'm like, oh, I love all of you people.

347
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,890
And then you, like, scatter, and you go to these other ones and then like, like I've hung out.

348
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:21,610
It has been and been like, where are my people? They're not here like this.

349
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,639
Yeah, yeah. They're big. And like, people just sort of have like I think that's when you really do like you notice you kind

350
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,240
of bump up against those like interdisciplinary like differences and they're like,

351
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,719
Oh, I really don't approach things that way. How interesting that you do.

352
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:44,830
And okay, I'll take that under advisement. You know, and so it is fun to figure out and to explore like let yourself explore a bit,

353
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:51,220
but it's great when you can find those niche ones and that's where you really can make this like meaningful long term,

354
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:55,149
you know, networks and connections. So and sometimes they to at least for me,

355
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:01,959
they tended to be more and more progressive and like the big ACR is like really starting to

356
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,090
feel like about something that I feel like I have a little need to be talking about a lot.

357
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:16,120
I think that's really true. Yeah. Yeah. We joke that like Scott had the only the only international travel that, like,

358
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:22,899
our family is like ever benefited from is like Scott goes to this international Alzheimer's meeting and it's like it's only every two years.

359
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:28,510
They're like, it's a good location. And like, my conferences are never like international foreign places at all.

360
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:35,560
But, but we always sort of joke that like, they're so big, they're like a big cancer, you know, they come out with a big statement.

361
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,700
And I think what I'm literally was like something like, you know, aging is associated with memory loss or something.

362
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:48,850
Like it was like one of the headlines and we're like, really, this is what like this conference comes up with.

363
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,970
But they have to be so, you know, careful.

364
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:55,890
And certainly like we talked about that whole Alzheimer's kerfuffle with like the,

365
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:01,450
you know, do you know, the brain scan misreading of the images and stuff?

366
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:06,550
And so I just feel like it's very interesting, like this sort of big conference.

367
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:14,630
You know, splashy news has to be like, you know, and probably that will happen also APJ,

368
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:21,250
they'll probably be some like headlines that like Fox News picks up but is like really runs with and you know wants to.

369
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:25,430
Whatever. But then there'll be some things that we can all be like. Uh huh. Yeah.

370
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:32,420
So I think that's. That's a really good point. Oh, cool.

371
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:37,400
Okay, so let's think about when we're gonna think about submitting something.

372
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:47,770
And I think has everybody in this group, like, kind of led a submission to a conference before or been part of Y?

373
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:52,070
Okay. So I think we got like, let's put this up.

374
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:56,960
It's very straightforward, but good not to forget submission dates.

375
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:03,020
The other thing, and again, we've all worked in teams, you guys have all worked in teams,

376
00:43:03,020 --> 00:43:06,140
but it's that issue of like giving your coauthors time to review.

377
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:11,630
Certainly same with papers, but conferences always end up being like on a crunched timeline.

378
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:16,159
And then people are often getting like, Here's my submission, can you review it in two days?

379
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,110
Because I got to submit it and oh, and then you've also got to submit a no conflict of interest form.

380
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:24,790
And I'm sorry, it's midnight, you know, and I'm like, I always do that, you know,

381
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,670
I'm not going to not review it and not submit it, but it's like I would have been nice to have like do today, you know,

382
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:37,489
get a window to do just so I don't forget, you know, um, so anyway,

383
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:45,559
posters are a really good way to start and especially and it does feel different when

384
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,550
you're presenting your own stuff compared to when presenting like as part of a team.

385
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,800
Because when you're part of this like established team, you're kind of like, oh, here's like what we've been working on and you know,

386
00:43:55,850 --> 00:44:02,900
you're the presenter, but like maybe it wasn't your, you know, ideas or whatever that were leading to that particular poster.

387
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:08,450
But at some point in your process, you'll be able to present your own stuff,

388
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:15,140
which is just by nature a little more anxiety, you know, than that, but exciting at the same time.

389
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,850
And so I think, you know, posters are good, posters are great.

390
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:30,530
And then if you can also do oral presentations, which are again, sort of jacks up the stress level, but it's a good experience.

391
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:38,030
And so it's one of those things that a lot of people are like, Oh, I don't know, it makes me nervous in an oral presentation.

392
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:42,350
I don't feel ready and you know.

393
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,390
It's just if it comes your way, I would say say yes.

394
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,900
And then just like sort of make yourself go for it.

395
00:44:53,430 --> 00:45:00,149
The other thing that that often junior people can do, you know, maybe not in your very first year, but, you know,

396
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:06,180
I think that you guys all have expertize that you could be asked to like and provide good information about abstracts.

397
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:15,750
And so, for example, whatever society conference, you know, your advisor is part of or whatever,

398
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:24,510
there might be opportunities to review abstracts and you can often, you know, get a get your name on the list as a reviewer.

399
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,460
And that is always just like peer reviewing, grant reviewing,

400
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:35,460
abstract reviewing for content isn't always good experience that you can try to seek out.

401
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,850
And I would say like, now is the time. You know,

402
00:45:38,850 --> 00:45:46,170
it's sort of grad school is the time to do that because you'll be asked to do it over and over in your careers for various different purposes.

403
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:53,670
But this is a good way to get like. Also, just like a very first look at like people's ideas,

404
00:45:54,210 --> 00:46:00,870
see what's happening and see what's kind of bubbling up as like, really, really, you know, big ideas in the field.

405
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,819
And you can also get a sense of like how people write abstracts and how they approach it.

406
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:15,209
And some are great and really like beautifully, you know, concisely stated and you're like, wow, this is an awesome abstract.

407
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,760
With some you're like, Oh my gosh, I can't believe you submitted this.

408
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:24,710
So you're just getting a sense of like that range is really great and that happens when you do reviews.

409
00:46:25,710 --> 00:46:35,670
So and conferences are always desperate for reviewers. And so especially if you, you know, can get on, you know, you're seeking out a conference,

410
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:40,469
you go to their website if there's anything about like we need reviewers like see if you can

411
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:44,790
sign up because that would be a really great experience for those people just to keep their,

412
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:52,140
you know, critique skills and then all of the stuff around cost and logistics of attending conferences.

413
00:46:54,070 --> 00:47:01,930
You know, there's lots of sources for her funding, but you have to make sure you, you know, presenting like a hatchet in some cases.

414
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:08,680
The other thing that probably you guys all know or maybe have even done before,

415
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:17,200
but like most conferences will have some sort of like volunteer positions that you can do and then that will defray costs for the for the meeting.

416
00:47:18,190 --> 00:47:23,979
So things like checking people in and it's also good, you know, can't chitchat too much because you hold up the line.

417
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:29,950
But it's a good way to just get like an eyeball on like, oops, I'm so just checked into my line of work, my academic crap.

418
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:35,380
So I kind of like figure out that person, you know, like that's sort of something I think about always at conferences.

419
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:42,069
Um, and yeah, so this is all just like try to try to get funds.

420
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,490
But this I think is a really great thing to do at meetings.

421
00:47:45,490 --> 00:47:52,959
And I just remember like at some point in grad school, one of my first conferences, it was that feeling of like, Oh, I just checked in.

422
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,250
This person is like, wow, they're famous, you know?

423
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:01,090
You know, it's just like a made a very real okay.

424
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:08,110
And then this is bit like sort of, hey, once you're at a meeting, get your thing present in and get submitted.

425
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:11,889
You're going to go to the meeting at the meeting or this is actually even before the meeting,

426
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:18,490
if you can, every everything will have a conference, you know, massive program usually.

427
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:25,959
Now I feel like every conference has an app. There's hashtags to like follow to attend the conference.

428
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,520
And so I think some of that,

429
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:34,120
like personally I loved the paper programs because you could just like go back to them easily and you have to like scroll through an app,

430
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:36,790
but that's just sort of not a thing anymore.

431
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:47,500
But the following conference hashtag I think is great, and I think that that can be really just a light, easy way to connect with people.

432
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:50,920
And I really think that that can be a great thing.

433
00:48:51,460 --> 00:49:06,190
Um, I also, I will say at least one time in a meeting I was going to give a talk and the room was wrong and I like got a flash on Twitter saying like,

434
00:49:06,190 --> 00:49:09,639
this thing has moved to this room. And I was like, Oh my gosh, I'm in that.

435
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:18,040
And so then like that's how I knew more quickly like being a speaker than email that it, you know, so just sort of like once, you know,

436
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:30,460
prepping to be there really try to do some advanced legwork about like what would make it most and you know, ease my time there.

437
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:37,840
And then I think also be strategic because again, especially with these huge meetings, it's just impossible to do it all.

438
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,690
And so kind of have a plan of like, do I want to, you know, what about, you know,

439
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,990
hopefully I can review these sessions in advance or like program things.

440
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:55,360
You know, I would say definitely try to get to some of the keynotes because those are going to be those like big, like inspirational.

441
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,020
Like you leave feeling like, oh, I'm so glad I'm in the field of public health, you know?

442
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:07,540
And but then thinking about more of these individual sessions, like, you know, not for every single one, but like if you can,

443
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:13,360
I think you get more out of it if you make a plan and sort of say like, okay, am I going to like try to meet this person?

444
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:20,380
Am I going to see my friend give a talk and just sort of like be there, be supportive and see what it's like to be a graduate student giving a talk?

445
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:25,870
Or is it like really topic driven? Do I, like, need to firm up my knowledge about this?

446
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:31,210
Do I think I want to like go in this direction in my work and really be there for the topic?

447
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:38,020
And of course those could all overlap. Um, I think that this is again like a,

448
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:43,509
these big conferences sometimes it can be helpful and again probably more as you get

449
00:50:43,510 --> 00:50:49,270
towards like crafting your own methods for like your dissertation research and stuff.

450
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:55,000
Like maybe six months to a year before you're doing that.

451
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:59,889
Going to sessions that are like methods focused and that they that are that

452
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:05,130
are kind of new methods or like things that you don't know how to do already.

453
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:10,870
Because those typically, like if there's a section on methods or a program a session on methods,

454
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:15,220
it's probably because it's kind of a cutting edge method and people are interested in it.

455
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:22,479
And so and people are like interested in learning more about it. And so I think that kind of gives you that like it's a little bit of a glimpse

456
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:27,460
into the future about like what people are going to be excited about and like,

457
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:33,040
can you maybe integrate those methods into your training so you'll kind of, you know,

458
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:38,770
be not a head, but, you know, just so you'll be connected in that space I think is helpful.

459
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:46,900
And then these kinds of things too, because conferences can be tiring. So, you know, try trying to stay out.

460
00:51:47,010 --> 00:51:56,229
My, um, a lot of people like I put exercise like personally that is not something that I would be able to manage the conference,

461
00:51:56,230 --> 00:52:01,549
but I would feel like, okay, I'm walking like thousands of steps. That's fine. But some people like really love that.

462
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:07,030
And a lot of like SBM always have like a fun run and there's a lot of these like health behavior focused conference and sort of like,

463
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:08,560
let's all go on and exercise together.

464
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:14,350
And I think that's awesome if people are like into that and comfortable with that and that's like something that they want to do.

465
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:19,830
They're also conferences that are a little bit less, I would say hardcore, that's that.

466
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:24,090
And they talk about like let's take a, you know, a walk or meet up, you know,

467
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:32,079
and do something else that isn't necessarily a good running because like not everybody feels comfortable like running with like an academic process,

468
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:39,430
you know, like, and so, you know, I feel like sometimes you just like sometimes you run into people, you know, in the hotel.

469
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:44,229
They come from the gym and I'm like, Oh, I just I don't want to see people at that state, you know?

470
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:49,570
So that's me. But I think it is, you know, it's something that like comes up.

471
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:55,300
And I think, you know, the other things, of course, that come up with things like happy hours and you know,

472
00:52:55,690 --> 00:53:00,999
like just PR said, like has a dance party and so like, you know,

473
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,780
just sort of getting like your own comfort zone about like bonding with people and like

474
00:53:07,990 --> 00:53:13,000
maintaining professionalism and like where you fall on that and that changes over your,

475
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:22,150
you know, career, but just, you know, kind of think through in advance like, you know, because usually they list those kinds of things in the program.

476
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:32,290
Like, is it better for me to like go to the dance party or like just to retire to my room and like chill out and sleep, you know, or like my talk?

477
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,870
I have definitely been conferencing with people who just are like, go, go, go all the time.

478
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:44,429
And I'm like, Are you doing a talk tomorrow? And they're like, Oh, yeah, that's going to, you know, I'm like, Oh my gosh, I really can't sit that way.

479
00:53:44,430 --> 00:53:57,430
It's so, you know, people vary. Um, and then the other thing is that the idea of just kind of for each session jotting down a few key nuggets and.

480
00:53:59,630 --> 00:54:03,710
I think if I haven't said this already.

481
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:13,469
Yeah. This can be helpful to just do like manually and not be not bring your laptop

482
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:17,250
into a session sometimes because even if it sort of feels more efficient,

483
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,870
I think we all know, like the temptation of when you have your laptop, you can do things and you're not necessarily as in the moment.

484
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:32,910
And I think it's helpful to just sort of. Like as you review know, what was that conference like?

485
00:54:32,910 --> 00:54:35,850
What did I do? What did I learn? What like nuggets did I get?

486
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:44,040
That's can be easier in like a journal compared to oh yeah where was that Google Docs that I opened about that conference and.

487
00:54:45,170 --> 00:54:55,090
You know, was I just typing what they were saying or was I, like, really thinking about how it's useful to me and oh yeah,

488
00:54:55,100 --> 00:55:03,620
just sort of like if you can select the key things that you really want to attend to because things will conflict and that's just like,

489
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:10,470
okay, so and then this is sort of more along that line of like during a given session, um,

490
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:20,300
and again thinking about like where you guys are right now and like where you want to go in your personal future research careers.

491
00:55:21,710 --> 00:55:29,050
What things are helpful about this session. So it could even be like, Oh, wow, this person is employed at this place that I've never heard of.

492
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:38,030
But it sounds like they do really cool stuff. And so let me find out more about that place or like they use this method.

493
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:42,020
I've never heard of it, but it seems really relevant. So let me find out more about that.

494
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:49,009
So I can just kind of be like those little pins and stuff or like this person gave an awesome talk.

495
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:54,290
Why did I think the talk was so awesome? Or This person gave a horrible talk?

496
00:55:54,290 --> 00:55:58,430
And these are things to remind myself that I don't want to do and talks.

497
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:08,570
And I remember I saw like an academic crush of mine give this talk and it was like a pretty big talk, really well attended.

498
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:13,340
And he was such a bad speaker. I was like, Oh my gosh.

499
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:23,750
It was like, no images, just black small text on white slides and like, that's it and just not an engaging speaker.

500
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,649
And I was like, Oh, mental, no. Like, never go see him speak again.

501
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:31,520
Like, still love his papers, but like, wow, that was really disappointing.

502
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:38,659
So, um, you're going to always pick up something and then, you know, it could be again, like the content of the topic.

503
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:42,680
Oh my gosh, they found this thing. But I would say, like in conference settings,

504
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:48,350
it's sometimes less about the actual finding that they're talking about and more just about like this area.

505
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:56,479
Because I think that and this is just like to give ourselves a break to like any given conference finding like it

506
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,990
still needs to stand the test of time to be published in the paper before it's really like out there out there.

507
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:09,139
So like it can be presented at a conference and then it may never go anywhere or it can be

508
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:12,709
presented in conference and it like comes out as a paper the next month and then you're like,

509
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:20,450
Oh yeah, that was that cool session I went to. So I think like findings of a given session are can be important.

510
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:28,159
And if they're like smack in the middle of like your area and you're like, ooh, what did they, you know, I need to know, then that's really exciting.

511
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,570
And then you could like ask questions of the people because you're like so deep in the area.

512
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:40,760
But I think sometimes the findings of any given paper are like less of a take away that kind of these other things around it.

513
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:46,070
I don't know if that's something that you guys have found before, but I've often found that in meetings,

514
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:50,150
like I'll be like super sad about a topic and then I'll go, I'll be like, okay, yeah.

515
00:57:50,490 --> 00:58:00,170
I was like, but like I connected with the people. Um, and again, like, if you guys want to talk to people after, I think that's a great thing to do.

516
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:10,999
And Chelsea was telling the story of Cox that she was at one of these Alzheimer's meetings and Scott was giving a talk and she was like, Oh, yeah.

517
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,040
I went over, like, stalked. And after the meeting and was like or after his talk, it was like, Hi, I work with you.

518
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:22,070
And she's like, I'm not here yet, you know? So it's is sort of a you never know where those things will be, but it's always good.

519
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:26,179
And even like if you have I think I was saying the same thing when you're talking about conferences,

520
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:29,930
but like even if you have this certain like next that you want to go to and like

521
00:58:29,930 --> 00:58:33,200
your person is kind of busy talking but you really want to talk to that person.

522
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,779
I would say, like if I had to choose,

523
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:41,750
I would say like try to connect with the person and then be a little bit late to like your next session or whatever.

524
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:50,960
Okay. And then asking questions again like have something meaningful to ask.

525
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:59,659
You don't need to ask the question. I mean, session. But the other thing about like where we get to kind of social media is if you're following

526
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:06,620
that conference hashtag and you kind of have a sense of what like like if it's mental health.

527
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:11,990
Like what the topics for the hash tag for that conference might be.

528
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:14,850
And you're in a session and you're like, Ooh, that's really cool.

529
00:59:16,050 --> 00:59:20,370
I want to tweet that and just sort of connect with other people who might be in the session.

530
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:22,260
I think that can be a great thing to do,

531
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:29,400
but you just want to be careful to like get the content right that you're tweeting and sort of if you quote the person,

532
00:59:30,510 --> 00:59:40,860
you can tag the person in the tweet. Um, what I, what I don't think is super great, but I don't know, people do this all the time.

533
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:41,909
I don't know how you guys feel about it,

534
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:53,700
but I'm just taking a picture of the slide that the person has done and tweeting that I feel like I've heard mixed reviews from speakers,

535
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:56,900
know people who did that. So I don't know.

536
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:00,240
Have you guys seen that or. I've seen it done a lot.

537
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:15,750
That. That's an excellent point.

538
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:21,600
Yeah. Yeah. And I think, like, maybe in a keynote, they sort of expect that more.

539
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,720
But like, if you're kind of presenting, like,

540
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:34,290
here are initial findings that are kind of hot off the not press you head, then it can be a little more, I don't know.

541
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:37,050
Can feel a little more, um, shaky.

542
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:49,430
I have a few times I've like not totally but I sort of live tweeted like some meetings has been more in that keynote

543
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:58,970
type session and I think that those can be really awesome to sort of see and follow the process on social media.

544
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,950
Uh, that was consistent. That was about to be taken. Yeah.

545
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,980
So I guess that's a that's a good consideration.

546
01:01:09,990 --> 01:01:15,440
Like if you if you want to add that to your, you know, if you're giving a talk and you feel like you can say,

547
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:20,480
you know, please treat or please don't take pictures of my slides, like give people a guideline.

548
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:27,330
Um. This is something I always say, like, well, leave or stay for the full setter.

549
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:30,719
Like, you know, the best can have been in this situation.

550
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:32,010
So you can kind of make that decision.

551
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:40,170
I do think it's important to give that positive nonverbal feedback to the speakers, especially the little conference,

552
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:45,899
because they will see you again and they will be like, Oh, that's that woman in the yellow sweater who is like nodding at my talk.

553
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:52,230
I like her, you know, like just that is hard to not take in positively.

554
01:01:55,050 --> 01:02:03,360
And I think, like, as you guys give oral presentation, I think you'll realize how important that is in that sort of blank room.

555
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:10,580
And of course, harder to do with masks on. But. We've all gotten used to that at this juncture.

556
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,910
Okay. So this is all hopefully in person.

557
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:23,680
Any kind of thoughts or reflections on those in person? Conferencing times, that is.

558
01:02:24,730 --> 01:02:28,360
Audience members that have been helpful or not helpful, as always, are not helpful.

559
01:02:28,360 --> 01:02:33,290
Person to person. Not always. Sometimes. There are not helpful people.

560
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:44,700
With my personal representation. One of my is from Miami.

561
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:48,790
It was like. I know.

562
01:02:50,050 --> 01:02:53,129
Said he was, like, conniving and, like, very engaged.

563
01:02:53,130 --> 01:02:56,540
And that was the first period.

564
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:03,070
Yeah. I think it's totally true.

565
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:11,900
I think it's really it's like a good role to take because, you know, that person is up there like a little stressed no matter who, you know.

566
01:03:12,740 --> 01:03:21,110
And it's just I do think, like with masks, it's just harder to like gauge, you know, and then yeah,

567
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:28,040
it seems like then you could also that would be an entree to go and talk to the person after you would have really enjoyed your time.

568
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:38,510
So, you know, just with every any of these question asking opportunities, I feel like.

569
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:46,160
It's helpful to ask a question if you're wanting to sort of like make yourself known

570
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:50,320
to the person that can be sort of general question or certainly if you have content,

571
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,250
you know, a question of the session.

572
01:03:54,790 --> 01:04:02,080
You know, but I have also been in meetings like the same person asked the same question in each session and I'm like, okay.

573
01:04:05,170 --> 01:04:09,139
So that's I do. Ponder. All right.

574
01:04:09,140 --> 01:04:16,190
So that's all in person conferencing. And then I think we've all also been in this situation of covered conferencing.

575
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:20,180
And so hopefully we will. Well, I don't know.

576
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:25,600
I think this. This has the potential to fade out.

577
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,950
But I think that there'll always be some talks now that are just going to be virtual.

578
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:39,610
And I, I just, I feel like the more people I've talked to recently about, you know, hybrid options and we talked a little bit about like I think.

579
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:48,750
We're saying like the junior talks where we're remote and then the senior talks were in person or something.

580
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:55,380
And I just, you know, I just don't. I don't know how it's going to go.

581
01:04:56,340 --> 01:05:00,840
I think the hybrid option is just not feasible for conference settings.

582
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:04,850
And so I think they have to do a hybrid based session, like not within a session.

583
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:08,309
And so I think there will be some continue to be talks like this.

584
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:16,680
And I don't know what APJ, if they've like described what it's going to be like or what options there are in terms of.

585
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:35,229
On the website, I'm thinking. The will be in-person.

586
01:05:35,230 --> 01:05:39,950
But there. So they.

587
01:05:40,190 --> 01:05:43,160
So it is maybe kind of a hybrid within the session.

588
01:05:44,330 --> 01:05:51,320
It sounds like perhaps like if you had virtually I guess as the presenter, if you have virtual attendees.

589
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:57,260
And they just witness it and that's fine and you know, interact that's probably.

590
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:03,500
Well, it'll be interesting.

591
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:13,790
I mean, hopefully they'll they'll gather some data to evaluate how that goes and like, you know, how they what the attendance is like.

592
01:06:14,510 --> 01:06:18,410
So. So I think this is like a, you know, stay tuned.

593
01:06:20,890 --> 01:06:23,860
I think the other thing that I like to try for experiments act of aggression.

594
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:33,420
But I do think that is like one of the points of going to these things in person is just to network and get to know humans.

595
01:06:33,430 --> 01:06:44,720
And so. You know, one of the things we can do is do this like a pre introduction of yourself, you know, and again, just not to.

596
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:48,040
Ten people that maybe two or three people.

597
01:06:48,550 --> 01:06:58,270
And see, you know if they would be available to meet at the meeting or say like I'm looking forward to attending your talk.

598
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:03,970
Depending on on the enthusiasm of wanting to meet the person.

599
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:12,430
But you can always just sort of put your name onto their radar and then you can if your advisor,

600
01:07:12,430 --> 01:07:16,090
for example, knows people that are important for you to meet.

601
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:20,530
That's obviously a great way to do it. But I think it's also.

602
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:32,400
Very, you know, reasonable and welcome to the person giving whatever presentation to sort of do this pre introduction so that you know that if

603
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:40,260
you come up to them after their talks in a calm exchange email or I emailed you to connect or something like that and again,

604
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:47,340
like this, that's kind of what I was saying before. Like how much do you want to like pursue an interaction with the person?

605
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:58,290
And if you do end up and I've totally done this to go and like meet the person for coffee and then I've been asked to meet people for coffee.

606
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:02,829
And I think it's just a really nice feature of conferences because everybody's sort of overwhelmed.

607
01:08:02,830 --> 01:08:08,190
And even if the conversation is not, Wow, you're going to be a mentor, I'm like, Hey, award, that's awesome.

608
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:18,660
Like you still have sort of made a connection. And I think that those are kind of the point from a lot of these meetings.

609
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:25,140
And then, of course, as we would all follow up afterwards and, you know, Zoom or whatever.

610
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:34,210
So in my career stage right now, it's often like somebody could contact me and wants to like we had,

611
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:41,249
we had a postdoc program for a while and they like wanted to find out more about postdocs or they wanted to talk about pay awards.

612
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,640
And I wanted to talk about a project like there's always sort of a driving set of questions.

613
01:08:45,630 --> 01:08:51,240
I have also had the experience where people kind of reached out and just like wanted to have coffee and talk and that seems like less.

614
01:08:52,650 --> 01:08:56,820
Appealing because everybody's time is really pressed at a conference.

615
01:08:56,820 --> 01:09:01,470
And so, like, it's helpful to have an agenda for those kinds of like asks.

616
01:09:04,920 --> 01:09:09,460
They're going to say about that one. Yeah. So I think I think those are all good.

617
01:09:09,480 --> 01:09:18,210
I think it'll be great. Great to hear from you guys what APJ was like and how all this stuff kind of goes to.

618
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:20,220
Okay.

619
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:28,549
The other thing just to note, and this is kind of like in the reviewing of the programs and different sized conferences will have different of these,

620
01:09:28,550 --> 01:09:31,730
but there sometimes can be pre conferences,

621
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:36,110
which is also a good way to like cut down on the huge size of a conference or like maybe at the cancer meeting.

622
01:09:36,110 --> 01:09:40,280
There's like a pre conference of like the more focus group and those are your people.

623
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:43,370
And that's also a nice way when it's connected to the bigger conference,

624
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:48,350
you automatically have like a little group who you've kind of been talking with and who you know,

625
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:52,040
and maybe they have like a little hashtag of their own.

626
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:55,150
So, for example, C, D,

627
01:09:55,640 --> 01:10:04,450
there was always an emotions pre conference that I went to for a long time and sort of that would be like a group of maybe a hundred now,

628
01:10:04,580 --> 01:10:07,129
maybe even like 60 people sometimes.

629
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:13,820
And you know, you'd have these sort of breakout discussions around key questions before and then you all go to the big conference.

630
01:10:13,820 --> 01:10:17,980
And it's also a good way to like, you know, just grow your network.

631
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:26,240
So I think that's good because then you can go to their talks and they come here to sell other things like special interest groups,

632
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:29,090
which SBM has a lot of different special interest groups,

633
01:10:29,090 --> 01:10:35,120
and that can be a way to kind of like carve out a more manageable subgroup from a big conference.

634
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,840
They also, you know, conference conferences.

635
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:46,340
Conferences often have these like lunch with the leaders or conversation hours that are much more informal.

636
01:10:46,970 --> 01:10:52,780
And so you can, you know, then I definitely would not attend one of those unless you like to,

637
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:56,540
you know, want to participate and get to know people a little bit.

638
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:06,590
And then there's often, again, with most of these big conferences, like an early career like trap or breakout or here,

639
01:11:06,590 --> 01:11:12,020
you know, things are start is like early career things and just sort of looking for those across the program,

640
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:18,800
I think could be a way to like help with decision making, just a big, you know, firehose of information that's coming at you from the conference.

641
01:11:19,820 --> 01:11:24,979
That might be a way to cut down. And then the other thing is to attend like skills based sessions.

642
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:28,700
So either methods, that's more like hearing about methods.

643
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:39,679
But if there are skills based ones, like, for example, learn how to work with the, you know, fragile families data sets that can be at a conference.

644
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:45,530
And that can be a really great thing to do because you not only will, like, learn the skills,

645
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:49,970
but you'll also like to get and get to know the people who are going to be working with that data set.

646
01:11:51,320 --> 01:12:00,290
And then it's just really helpful in terms of sharing information and troubleshooting, maybe starting new collaborations like from that meeting.

647
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:05,750
So a lot of conferences and I think this feels like an increasing trend will have these

648
01:12:05,750 --> 01:12:10,040
sort of skills focused sessions around really around working with different data sets.

649
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:15,890
And I think that would be a great entree to have, you know,

650
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:22,220
getting to know a whole new it's like a whole new direction or option to how to explore your research questions.

651
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:30,340
I mentioned keynotes. Oh, and then this. I don't know if the choir knows about these people, probably.

652
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:33,910
But just like all the internet age people are going to bigger conferences.

653
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:41,799
A lot of people will come and be like the program representative or like, I need a K and I'm at this meeting and I'm here to tell you about that.

654
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:49,660
I do K funding opportunities and I think especially if you're like applying for any kind of career training award,

655
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:57,240
stopping by the funding tables is awesome because then they also like Get to know you and they like go,

656
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:03,610
okay, you're the face of this person's, you know, me 12 times through whatever that I swear I'm going to set up a phone call with you, see?

657
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:11,110
Like it's really just a social connection that is very, I think, important to make because those are the people.

658
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:21,610
They're like, I've often met with program officers at meetings, you know, to like meet them for the first time or like to discuss ongoing projects.

659
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:27,190
So that's I think a really important function. And they usually hang out again, like these big meetings.

660
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:31,749
It's like there's the posters, there's like stuff you can buy, there's funding,

661
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:37,120
there's like that section of conferences that's just like, I think where people kind of go to like decompress.

662
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:42,820
We're going to talk a little bit, but I would say definitely swing by those on your rounds of conferencing.

663
01:13:44,300 --> 01:13:47,650
And then another thing that some people do that I have not necessarily done,

664
01:13:47,650 --> 01:13:51,430
but are things like the business meetings because they're actually some of them are open.

665
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:58,990
And if you again, if you find your conference, that's like your thing and you decide,

666
01:13:59,110 --> 01:14:04,240
I want to be like a SBA person, like they just they are like totally where I want to be.

667
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:11,020
And even if not like something I want to try out, like I might be interested in leading maybe ultimately a special interest group.

668
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:14,739
And so I'm going to go to one of these open meetings where they're discussing,

669
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:18,220
like the future of this society and where we're going, what we think is important.

670
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,629
And I think that's also generally helpful.

671
01:14:22,630 --> 01:14:25,600
And like in terms of job seeking too,

672
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:33,429
that can be a place where you like connect with people who are not only important people within the conference organization,

673
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:41,890
but they also just might know more broadly of research going on or jobs in academia, not in academia.

674
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:52,810
And so these kinds of meetings where it's like very visionary and, you know, you can take on leadership roles, I think can be really helpful.

675
01:14:55,950 --> 01:15:01,470
Let's see any other experiences people have had like with, again,

676
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:09,850
this kind of like extra activities and maybe is sort of outside of like the scientific sessions or content sessions.

677
01:15:16,950 --> 01:15:20,200
I was like to ask if I don't think of everything that.

678
01:15:24,580 --> 01:15:32,920
On the sidelines of the conference. You have to think in a way that that's true.

679
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:42,430
Colleagues. They wanted to. I totally agree.

680
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:46,470
Yeah, like, we're in, like, a hallway after a meet after a session.

681
01:15:46,710 --> 01:15:53,190
And I do think that there is that flow of like the beginning of a meeting.

682
01:15:53,430 --> 01:15:58,229
Every is like, oh, I'm going to every session. And then by the end, people are just like, you know, in the hallways and talking.

683
01:15:58,230 --> 01:16:06,210
And so that's I agree. Like that's when some of that like informal, like, hey, we're going to go get dinner or, you know.

684
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:13,049
I think I think sometimes like the sort of like what do you do for like a meals can kind

685
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:17,490
of come up like you could be with like a lap group who or a friend who you're like,

686
01:16:18,210 --> 01:16:21,420
we're going to get, you know, do this meal on this night and we're gonna plan this.

687
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:25,230
But sometimes if you have like a gap in your schedule,

688
01:16:25,530 --> 01:16:35,760
that can be helpful because then you can sort of try to fill it more informally or more like spontaneously or just go to your room and order,

689
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:42,690
you know, salad and a glass of wine, which is what I tend to do, not always, but like sometimes it's like, I need a break.

690
01:16:43,350 --> 01:16:48,810
Um, but yeah, all of that informal interaction stuff and I think a lot of this extra stuff is.

691
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:55,959
It helps kind of foster some of that informal interaction because it's hard, and I think so.

692
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,840
And again, it'll be really interesting to hear you guys reports, but like,

693
01:16:59,410 --> 01:17:04,450
I think people are I think people are both like urgently wanting to connect,

694
01:17:04,450 --> 01:17:11,290
but also kind of out of practice and like probably going to be more exhausted, I don't know, or maybe more energized.

695
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:23,820
So it'll be interesting to see how both. See just a little more about that same point about.

696
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:29,739
Conferencing are just posters, really.

697
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:37,620
Posters. I think that again, like, hopefully we're back to this.

698
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:44,329
Big posters being involved on this is, I think like different sets of strategies.

699
01:17:44,330 --> 01:17:54,860
But if you're doing posters and just sort of having like it's a great opportunity to practice like that key 32nd message around.

700
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:59,520
Here's my poster. And so just saying, you know, can you hear your here, you know,

701
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:04,890
if you're going to send these posters saying can you walk with your poster or if somebody is like sort of lurking?

702
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:09,380
But I say like, would you let me walk you through my poster?

703
01:18:11,060 --> 01:18:15,800
And then I think this is really important to just sort of like be ready to, you know,

704
01:18:16,310 --> 01:18:21,469
like have an exit strategy because the person with the poster, like if nobody's going to buy their poster,

705
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:25,040
like if you could sit and talk with them for a while, but if you're realizing like, oh my gosh,

706
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:31,069
I don't, you know, this is like too much, then just sort of, you know, turning the page so much.

707
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:39,060
It was really interesting. I got to go meet someone or whatever. And I think posters, people are kind of like overwhelmed.

708
01:18:40,280 --> 01:18:45,649
You know, it's going to be hard to hear because of masks and like not being able to see

709
01:18:45,650 --> 01:18:49,430
is already was hard to hear and people are like leaning in and what what.

710
01:18:49,790 --> 01:18:57,290
So again, it'll be interesting to see like how posturing is in this big conference space especially.

711
01:19:00,020 --> 01:19:03,919
Someone I feel like did it to someone, say in this most recent session,

712
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:11,360
or maybe that maybe at another point like still having like in years may not have been very well may not have business cards but like.

713
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:20,560
In this world of like everything electronic, sometimes it's helpful to have a physical reminder of like but people that you talk to.

714
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:25,950
And so if people did have business cards, that would be a chance to use them.

715
01:19:26,870 --> 01:19:34,930
You may not have Michigan business cards. But that might be something to think about.

716
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:38,640
Like, I know there is a way to get Michigan business cards.

717
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:41,650
Like a small stack.

718
01:19:41,660 --> 01:19:48,850
I mean, I have a house purging stuff right now, but I have a box this big and I'm like assistant research professor from like 2006.

719
01:19:48,850 --> 01:19:53,950
And like, I think I just don't know how to use them. I'm just going to put them in the recycle at this point.

720
01:19:53,950 --> 01:19:59,620
So, you know, I would say if you are interested, check that out.

721
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:03,610
But if you have them, bring them. Yeah.

722
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:07,300
People use QR codes or QR codes.

723
01:20:07,300 --> 01:20:11,100
Yeah, I heard. That's a good idea.

724
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:16,540
So you could just connect them directly to. Yeah.

725
01:20:22,410 --> 01:20:26,790
And yeah, I think that all totally feeds to the follow up piece.

726
01:20:26,850 --> 01:20:30,180
So you could see the skit. I love the part because each time.

727
01:20:37,460 --> 01:20:41,450
And I think LinkedIn is a good example. I mean, I think like that sort of it's like a.

728
01:20:43,390 --> 01:20:51,460
Like people use it to varying degrees, like in sort of parts of academia.

729
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:58,870
And I think that public health and certainly master's students use it as a business.

730
01:20:59,740 --> 01:21:04,820
Our business oriented, but I think it's a good general one to use.

731
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:13,610
And then you think of something else. Any.

732
01:21:15,850 --> 01:21:21,760
I can't hear what I was going to say. Hopefully we're not going to be doing posters in breakout room.

733
01:21:22,060 --> 01:21:25,480
Hopefully that will end presenting on Zoom. I'm just going to sit by this.

734
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:29,830
Hopes that we're not doing this. Any time soon.

735
01:21:30,570 --> 01:21:34,290
Elaborate on it. But I will say it like, did you guys see this when it came out?

736
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:42,809
This like this was like a CNN reporter and it was just about like how your life can be going on in a disastrous way.

737
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:48,480
But, I mean, we're like still expected to be super professional. So it's it's more of a broad zoom comment.

738
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,990
But I think this can be a different type of.

739
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:56,880
Just a challenge because of technology.

740
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:04,170
So the other thing like around with the meetings, this is more about.

741
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:11,459
So I've kind of gone from like being at, you know, choosing the conference, being at the conference, being in a session.

742
01:22:11,460 --> 01:22:15,570
This is like in your presentation, you know, handling your question. This is like in your presentation.

743
01:22:15,570 --> 01:22:24,660
But this idea of how to structure oral presentations, there's also we can take a take a break before we really get into the social media part.

744
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:34,050
But I think there's a lot of really good information out there informed by people who do who do like data visualization or who do much more.

745
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:42,050
Communication focused presentations than the typical academic presentation.

746
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:47,730
And so I think. Spending a little bit of time with some of those resources can be helpful.

747
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:52,530
And these are just some examples and I always like those 1 to 10 tips things.

748
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:57,900
But I think generally this is. He's quite nice.

749
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:08,790
This idea of like simple slides and limiting text sometimes depending on kind of people's academic background, maybe.

750
01:23:10,530 --> 01:23:17,700
I assume that's rain and snow, but it looks a little snowy or it doesn't look.

751
01:23:18,240 --> 01:23:21,960
It looks a little. Am I okay?

752
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:28,680
So anyway, so some people will say like, oh, put more information on the slides about your methods.

753
01:23:28,800 --> 01:23:36,360
So if you're presenting complicated statistics, you want to include enough detail so that somebody who does that isn't going to be like,

754
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:47,400
Hey, wait, you didn't look at blah, blah, blah. But I would say that you're making your like significance, but review points simplify his images.

755
01:23:48,420 --> 01:23:59,999
And so those are just more memorable. But methods may be a point, maybe a time when this is not true practice or timing, you know,

756
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:05,850
test your media in advance and try to stick to a main message, which, again,

757
01:24:05,850 --> 01:24:11,040
as you're presenting your own stuff that can get harder to do because like,

758
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:18,389
you know, the whole iceberg of stuff underneath what you're presenting and you know, all the caveats,

759
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:24,900
you know how the protocol was like, whatever, not perfect or what, you know, the interesting parts.

760
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:32,610
But you really want to kind of keep that at least for the presentation part, with the single message or the, you know, three key messages or whatever.

761
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:39,299
And you can always have those like back pocket slides that when people say like, well, what about when this happened?

762
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:45,240
It would be like, great question, I have to say about that. And then you like pull it up and you can go into more detail there.

763
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:49,770
And those slides, I think like they can be the similar kind of format as what you've done before,

764
01:24:49,770 --> 01:24:53,999
that they don't need to be like the single point per slide of the great images.

765
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:58,590
They're more like explanatory. So you want to provide more detail on those back pocket slides.

766
01:25:02,370 --> 01:25:08,520
Okay. And then this this changes human behaviors. That's sort of the thing about like take do you take pictures of slides like what?

767
01:25:08,790 --> 01:25:12,929
You know, how how do people treat sort of like early results?

768
01:25:12,930 --> 01:25:20,590
Because I think all conference results are really early results and kind of we can talk more about that in social media part,

769
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:29,069
but that's something to consider. And then I think the other things again, because are all all existed in professional spaces,

770
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:34,680
but like there's that notebook idea again and then just I think in the follow up,

771
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:44,430
these are easy follow up things and I have QR code and LinkedIn, but these are just, you know, sort of basic.

772
01:25:44,430 --> 01:25:51,239
But just to put them up there and I think it's helpful to have that follow up question kind of in mind to be generating.

773
01:25:51,240 --> 01:25:54,719
And if you're in a conversation with somebody, be like, Oh yeah, I'm going to, you know,

774
01:25:54,720 --> 01:25:59,340
remember that we both, you know, grew up in this state or something like that.

775
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:04,310
And some sort of personal detail and a question about their work,

776
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:10,200
and then go ahead and send those emails even if, you know, they feel sort of embarrassed to do.

777
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:14,889
And I know they can kind of stack up and like it, you know, just take a day after the conferences.

778
01:26:14,890 --> 01:26:21,959
You're kind of decompressing before you have a little bit of a day or half a day and just sort of pound out those emails or in your hotel room,

779
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:28,230
but maybe don't send them during the conference, put them on a delayed send so that the person doesn't get up during the conference.

780
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:37,080
And then same thing, like if you are asked to send something, you know, just make a list of the people that have it easily accessible to do.

781
01:26:37,090 --> 01:26:43,770
So now and again, this was a lot harder for members to do with paper part of the thing.

782
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:47,489
So it's purging for my office over the summer were like old posters that were like

783
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:51,299
on a single page of paper you can't even read but like were important to send out.

784
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:56,910
So now we don't need to do that. Um, and then just a.

785
01:26:58,160 --> 01:26:59,899
Switching a little bit from conferences,

786
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:12,170
but just sort of saying networking in general opportunities to all those conference things also go for within and across you about new people,

787
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:18,860
speakers, etc. So like thinking about networking other than at conferences,

788
01:27:21,320 --> 01:27:29,660
you know, kind of these are all things that you guys will all do courses meaning like choosing new courses,

789
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:34,520
new professors, etc. Hopefully you guys will all present at some point at this symposium.

790
01:27:35,420 --> 01:27:41,870
I'm sure you will. Maybe not this year, but like you'll have that opportunity.

791
01:27:42,050 --> 01:27:51,760
And so that's a good like again place to put your work out there and network within your department that will help with, you know,

792
01:27:51,770 --> 01:28:01,009
asking people to in committee, etc. or for individual meetings with people maybe before you ask them to be on a committee serving on committees.

793
01:28:01,010 --> 01:28:09,590
Those like the grad student role of feedback is one example, but there are other committees that people can fill.

794
01:28:10,700 --> 01:28:16,190
And then again, like it's just more like using the same techniques across as different things.

795
01:28:17,330 --> 01:28:23,620
Visiting speakers, I'm not sure. Did you guys have a chance to meet with Stephanie Cook when she came as a speaker?

796
01:28:24,840 --> 01:28:26,660
You know. Yeah.

797
01:28:26,670 --> 01:28:34,469
So the, you know, again, if it can if it works for schedule, I would say take those opportunities and then similar is with conferences,

798
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:43,470
have some questions lined up, do a follow up, especially if it seems like that person could be really, you know, a great connection for you.

799
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:53,670
Um, and then there's just some links to like questions about meeting the speaker one on one because it's often like over lunch, they're tired.

800
01:28:54,330 --> 01:28:59,219
It's a group of people. You go around and say everybody's interests and then it's like, okay, what questions do you have?

801
01:28:59,220 --> 01:29:05,390
And so like you wanted to sort of tee up some questions. Okay.

802
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:13,530
So we can do a little break and then talk more about social media stuff and dissemination.

803
01:29:14,960 --> 01:29:19,490
Awesome. There's never a coffee break, so I don't want those copies.

804
01:29:19,730 --> 01:29:27,950
And we have no copies. Oh. But yeah.

805
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:31,700
It's exciting to talk about conferences to.

806
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:40,230
To. Cash is great.

807
01:29:40,380 --> 01:29:44,610
I'm going to see the same situation, my friends in New York.

808
01:29:44,940 --> 01:29:51,790
Yesterday it was so hard. Look, I'm not quite right outside the.

809
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:59,200
Wow. Yeah.

810
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:02,960
I was thinking I saw some plans yesterday with some, like, set up in Africa.

811
01:30:14,930 --> 01:30:19,670
Yeah. We are. Phillies fan.

812
01:30:24,050 --> 01:30:27,380
Because I have been playing can add in New York and Philadelphia.

813
01:30:28,530 --> 01:30:31,550
But they're not. You know, that's just.

814
01:30:38,410 --> 01:30:41,570
My. Oh, no.

815
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,330
This is my brother's wedding. It's for his birthday.

816
01:30:47,050 --> 01:30:52,870
And they were there, like, basically right up on the hill, right at my dad.

817
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:57,440
Yeah. So that you kept putting on cowboy, like he's just.

818
01:31:02,250 --> 01:31:14,650
Who are all the cowboys? My friends.

819
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,120
She played volleyball. This.

820
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:30,660
I was like courtside. And it was women's volleyball, so young. But that's just like using, like, physical prowess, physical, like something.

821
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:38,080
I mean, they were just so crazy. I was like, how are you going to have, like, really bad reflexes even though his balls are fine?

822
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:48,120
But it's just so amazing to see, like, see. You know, any sports, college sports.

823
01:31:48,990 --> 01:31:52,920
A high level. It's like. I can't imagine. Like. At.

824
01:31:55,710 --> 01:31:58,930
I was in D.C. when won the World Series.

825
01:31:59,870 --> 01:32:03,690
And then. Oh, no.

826
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:07,710
To you. Oh, yeah. Was a capitalist. Oh, great.

827
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:12,570
Yeah. So there is some pretty thing.

828
01:32:13,380 --> 01:32:17,460
And then it goes back to that. There had to be the first Thanksgiving.

829
01:32:25,050 --> 01:32:30,879
For nine months. It features a conversation about how politics works.

830
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:41,340
And not at all, but. To make conversation that literally sports not only that class sportsperson but

831
01:32:41,370 --> 01:32:47,680
that yeah they like to think that that's Tom Brady which is that we were machine.

832
01:32:48,910 --> 01:32:53,229
Tom Brady and the Red Sox won the World Series.

833
01:32:53,230 --> 01:32:58,370
And so it's like for people who were there for like forever, this person, Babe Ruth,

834
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:06,340
who whatever, I was like, wow, this this experience really going away from sports so funny.

835
01:33:06,340 --> 01:33:15,700
It's like such a dominant theme when we were there. But yeah, you know.

836
01:33:21,650 --> 01:33:25,690
I hate to say this that I've in here. Here we go.

837
01:33:27,600 --> 01:33:30,860
Unless we wait until the end of October or before. I agree.

838
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:34,940
I totally agree. It's been a beautiful, beautiful.

839
01:33:35,510 --> 01:33:38,980
Yes. Beautiful architecture and.

840
01:33:40,290 --> 01:33:43,290
And you know, I always kind of think about it too.

841
01:33:43,300 --> 01:33:52,560
Like it is that kind of a semester where we're like, okay, I got so much to do and like, might as well hunker down and be in this grave, you know?

842
01:33:54,150 --> 01:34:01,960
But. Usually there's a little there's like a snow event sometime in December.

843
01:34:01,970 --> 01:34:10,580
And then it kind of goes. Goes away for a little while, you know, but January, February.

844
01:34:13,970 --> 01:34:18,020
I mean. It kind of does depend on the year.

845
01:34:18,030 --> 01:34:21,840
I mean, I feel like that you kind of are expecting it.

846
01:34:22,380 --> 01:34:26,070
And so it's it's cold, snowy.

847
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:33,510
It's not like usually drifts of snow, it's like it'll snow and then it'll kind of get icy as gray.

848
01:34:36,760 --> 01:34:43,300
But then, I don't know. It's like March is I think I don't know if you feel the same way having lived through a lot of this too,

849
01:34:43,330 --> 01:34:54,700
but like March feels just long and it's a long month and it's just like hanging on and you're like, Oh, come on, I want it to be over.

850
01:34:54,700 --> 01:35:02,770
And it's just not over. So you can, like, buckle down for like January, February, and by March I'm like, Oh, my God.

851
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:07,510
Right, yeah. Yeah. So and Michigan does have a spring break.

852
01:35:07,900 --> 01:35:12,400
I forget when it is. Is it the last week of February event?

853
01:35:13,960 --> 01:35:18,320
It's always different. So like the. Ann Arbor Public Schools.

854
01:35:18,620 --> 01:35:25,070
When we first moved here, those were aligned, and then they took away the February break for Ann Arbor Public Schools.

855
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:30,400
So there's no break. But then they have a break in like. End the march.

856
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:35,980
Which is not aligned with U of M at all. So it's just been a little challenging.

857
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:44,070
So when I don't teach in the winter semester, I'd like taken kids to just go and be in work, usually just to visit my family.

858
01:35:44,070 --> 01:35:48,540
But like, yeah, you just, you do kind of want to, like, I would say,

859
01:35:49,380 --> 01:35:54,900
maximize that break just for like getting a little hint about the weather and seeing people.

860
01:35:55,410 --> 01:36:04,050
You can start to have more confidence to go to something that's a good thing, you know, in the in the March time for the late February time.

861
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:13,680
It's reading The Farmer's Almanac. Oh, you feel very bad for me, but they are perfectly.

862
01:36:14,180 --> 01:36:19,500
There's going to be a third year in a row, a third worst one year in a row.

863
01:36:20,780 --> 01:36:26,780
I like the way that they're projecting, you know, that it's actually going. According to them.

864
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:36,590
And there's going to be a lot of. Hospital services were.

865
01:36:44,090 --> 01:36:47,580
When you hear during the phone. I'd like to.

866
01:36:48,650 --> 01:36:56,890
You know, that was. In our.

867
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:08,240
I just want to have people like that for a the. In the tree across there.

868
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:17,640
River in. I just remember, like, yeah, we had.

869
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:23,290
We heard about the Honda Civic. Little.

870
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:27,900
And I remember pulling out the road.

871
01:37:28,550 --> 01:37:31,890
Like not being able to see. Well, it's sort of like the truth is that.

872
01:37:33,620 --> 01:37:42,860
Simon Lauder. It's like I knew they couldn't see me because I was like, all over the country and actually speaking out.

873
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:50,800
But this time we had a government type thing and they were digging in to replace the pipe.

874
01:37:51,420 --> 01:37:56,020
It was so cold they were looking for a blow torch to kind of warm up like we're doing thing.

875
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:00,090
And then like they would lay it up the pipe and then they were. And I was just going.

876
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:03,760
That was the way I was like, I don't understand. Like, what?

877
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:14,760
Why? So that's not typical, but it's not like you can kind of get a snow or cold winter so interest can be right?

878
01:38:14,870 --> 01:38:20,980
Yeah, it is. Yeah. You know, and just get shoes that can like, you know, people you can put like.

879
01:38:24,150 --> 01:38:37,750
Waterproof, but like. Like you can even get are scary things, but you can get like the anthrax mano nano or something like that.

880
01:38:37,750 --> 01:38:41,890
They're just they're like ice taking. But I do know people who like,

881
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:50,440
if it's snowing and icy and their shoes so that of you keep walking around in the winter and something something on in the winter if you just.

882
01:38:51,950 --> 01:39:00,550
Turns out a lot of people have slipped from the White House just like nobody thinks that, you know, so good.

883
01:39:00,700 --> 01:39:05,870
Good to, you know, invest in some good footwear. All right.

884
01:39:05,960 --> 01:39:11,660
So all right. So let's see.

885
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:18,649
I want us to talk about this, like, dissemination stuff, both like generally and then also,

886
01:39:18,650 --> 01:39:24,170
like dove into a little bit of social media specifics because I think it's yeah,

887
01:39:24,170 --> 01:39:27,950
it's it's important to kind of think through like what's what the strategy is going to be.

888
01:39:29,150 --> 01:39:34,729
So here's the why. And you guys may have seen this before,

889
01:39:34,730 --> 01:39:44,450
but this is that idea of like it takes 17 ish years on average to get like a finding from, say, this is a conference or what.

890
01:39:44,900 --> 01:39:50,270
So this is a conference, but like here's the research idea gets funded and h so it's like,

891
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:53,750
oh, we're giving a no see about this, we're interested in this topic.

892
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:59,899
And then like you get grants and you get publications and then maybe the research, if it's clear,

893
01:39:59,900 --> 01:40:04,910
it gets synthesized into like the key message and then it gets into practice eventually.

894
01:40:04,910 --> 01:40:13,880
But this like takes a long time. And so part of the focus in like the dissemination world is like, let's shorten this pipeline,

895
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:22,580
not to the point that like the research is good and it's too early for consumption, which is part of the social media concern.

896
01:40:23,150 --> 01:40:29,120
But like we need to kind of just in the. And get these more out into practice.

897
01:40:31,010 --> 01:40:39,559
And then I think what we manage a lot in public health and this is even a little bit independent of all the political overlays,

898
01:40:39,560 --> 01:40:44,090
which I think are really important and challenging.

899
01:40:44,870 --> 01:40:59,210
But we do complex research and we try to address complex things, and it's not like all of the findings that we have are easily.

900
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:05,840
Described in the nuanced way that they exist if that makes sense to like you can describe something

901
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:11,660
is like you know aging is associated with memory loss and that is like not news to anybody.

902
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:17,780
And some of the public health findings might sound that way. But then there's so much like nuance and importance and complexity that's,

903
01:41:17,780 --> 01:41:23,090
like, hard to get into, like a tweet or, you know, a paper, let alone a tweet.

904
01:41:24,260 --> 01:41:27,979
And so what I liked about these papers, like, especially that quick paper,

905
01:41:27,980 --> 01:41:32,000
is that it kind of goes through the steps of like how to communicate effectively.

906
01:41:33,290 --> 01:41:38,599
And I think the other thing to highlight is that this is totally important no matter what career path one has.

907
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:43,370
And I would argue even more important if you're not in academia because you're like much more on the front

908
01:41:43,370 --> 01:41:52,399
lines of making policy or talking to policymakers or like making change in the world through an organization.

909
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:55,850
And so you really have to think about effective communication.

910
01:41:57,350 --> 01:42:05,450
And so this reading about kind of lessons learned from dissemination.

911
01:42:06,740 --> 01:42:11,600
So if we just sit there and like put our stuff into journals that people are not going to pick it up and be like,

912
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:15,170
Oh, this is an exciting new Internet and I should try it in my school.

913
01:42:16,100 --> 01:42:18,170
That's just not going to happen. And we know this.

914
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:27,740
And so sort of figuring out who the people are that we need to talk to in order to get our like findings out is a key piece.

915
01:42:29,450 --> 01:42:35,839
And also this idea of like storytelling as a frame and I will give a pitch for

916
01:42:35,840 --> 01:42:41,090
anybody who's interested is that Brian Sigmund Fisher does those improv sessions.

917
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:49,400
And I think that that is such a fabulous approach and idea.

918
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:52,780
And I get like this is it probably makes you better and everything.

919
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:56,389
I have not personally done them, but it probably needs you better.

920
01:42:56,390 --> 01:43:04,880
Giving talks, giving like messaging in, you know, engaging and concise ways.

921
01:43:06,910 --> 01:43:13,389
And it makes you better at storytelling, which you know is really helpful.

922
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:20,230
And like anything out of the video that you should point out about the woman who is telling the story about being with the,

923
01:43:20,620 --> 01:43:24,400
you know, the family as a nurse. And it's just so compelling.

924
01:43:24,760 --> 01:43:28,390
Like, we can easily identify if we hear a story.

925
01:43:29,140 --> 01:43:36,160
And so it's hard to do with every research topic, but figure out what the story is.

926
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:39,520
But if you can and if you like, you know,

927
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:45,549
have the qualitative data or you've done interviews and you can draw on experiences that you've learned

928
01:43:45,550 --> 01:43:53,080
about in your research that can be so powerful and that it's like the hook that will get people to engage.

929
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:59,950
And the other lesson learned here about like dissemination of a specific, you know,

930
01:43:59,950 --> 01:44:05,080
finding or research plan or intervention is like it has to align with the organization's goals.

931
01:44:05,110 --> 01:44:13,120
So similar to the idea of like foundation funding, where we really want to be aligned with what they care about,

932
01:44:13,600 --> 01:44:17,290
we have to figure out what the organization that we're working with cares about.

933
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:25,660
And so, Amy, I'm thinking of the the stuff around the community colleges and like the tribal colleges being

934
01:44:25,660 --> 01:44:33,200
in a hundred different like organizational headers and sort of like what will work there,

935
01:44:33,220 --> 01:44:37,660
what will work in creative colleges that are not tribal colleges?

936
01:44:38,290 --> 01:44:43,930
And figuring out that match is obviously not simple, but really important.

937
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:51,640
And then, you know, we want to think about like, what was the real world impact of lots of the things that we do.

938
01:44:52,210 --> 01:44:56,740
And so I think what was helpful is that so we've been talking about conferences.

939
01:44:57,040 --> 01:45:00,970
You know, most research dissemination is in journals and conferences.

940
01:45:01,990 --> 01:45:06,430
So it doesn't really do all this work predictors of dissemination,

941
01:45:06,430 --> 01:45:12,339
which I like to of like whether you are likely to disseminate or like put efforts toward disseminating your work is whether you've

942
01:45:12,340 --> 01:45:20,590
been in a practice or policy policy setting or whether the funding that you had to do the work requires a dissemination activity.

943
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:28,450
Definitely not all funding does. But like I mentioned, the Health Endowment Foundation requires that sustainability plan.

944
01:45:28,450 --> 01:45:31,840
And like if you don't have it, we will not get the funding. So I think there is more of a.

945
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:38,840
Towards this, which is good because people always respond like you put requirements around money.

946
01:45:40,640 --> 01:45:46,879
So I think these I like this table because it sort of gives resources about how to do this.

947
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:55,070
And then like these are sort of, you know, different ways to do these processes and as well as talking about the.

948
01:45:55,600 --> 01:45:59,649
Specific dissemination frameworks that have developed that the dissemination of innovation

949
01:45:59,650 --> 01:46:07,600
sciences and then here is much more sort of like up to us these are like these personal driven,

950
01:46:07,990 --> 01:46:11,740
independent, individual driven ways of sharing information.

951
01:46:12,220 --> 01:46:18,640
And we will talk more about this. And then these are more maybe like in a job context.

952
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:25,300
So like you'd disseminate a policy brief or you have wait, you know, these are ways to.

953
01:46:27,250 --> 01:46:31,270
Disseminate to these different kind of constituencies, I guess.

954
01:46:32,250 --> 01:46:33,030
I to say.

955
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:44,090
So I think it's good information and I think this is kind of where we're focusing a little bit because this is really easy to relatively easy to do.

956
01:46:44,090 --> 01:46:52,400
It's easier to send tweets than like create a policy brief. But I think if you one can misstep and so you want to do that either.

957
01:46:54,500 --> 01:47:00,410
Okay. So the other thing I just want to talk about that cook paper.

958
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:08,360
This is this idea of like effective communication of science and what modalities you might want to use.

959
01:47:08,360 --> 01:47:16,159
So like infographics, we've probably all played around to different degrees with using infographics to represent findings.

960
01:47:16,160 --> 01:47:20,600
And I think it's one of those things like it sounds great,

961
01:47:20,990 --> 01:47:31,190
but it's really hard to do effectively and you really have to like know your finding and know your message in order to get a good infographic going.

962
01:47:31,220 --> 01:47:39,709
So. And again, we can sure, we all know this, but it's not as simple as like pasting points from your discussion.

963
01:47:39,710 --> 01:47:47,630
And you know, it's a cute format, but it's like, okay, what are the kernels of knowledge and what is need?

964
01:47:47,630 --> 01:47:51,950
What do we need to include an infographic to lead up to that knowledge?

965
01:47:53,780 --> 01:47:59,600
And I think it's you know, there's. Certain people who are like really, really good at this.

966
01:48:00,020 --> 01:48:07,130
And I think that's where that interest probably helps to sort of generate new ways of thinking about things.

967
01:48:08,450 --> 01:48:18,260
So infographics, I feel like are they can be overly simplistic, but when you get a good one it like includes you know.

968
01:48:20,960 --> 01:48:23,810
Even a bit about methods or like, you know, definitely fluids.

969
01:48:23,810 --> 01:48:29,000
What the problem is includes like how do we know this and includes sort of like recommendations.

970
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:31,160
I feel like those are great for graphics.

971
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:43,580
If we're talking about like trying to get a finding out something like the conversation is much more kind of comparable to like in academia piece.

972
01:48:43,580 --> 01:48:51,200
And so it's much more you have more opportunity to like frame and write about the context and it's still sort of public facing,

973
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:55,279
but it's more academic style, popular press.

974
01:48:55,280 --> 01:49:05,759
So something like. You know, a long article in a magazine like The Atlantic or something like that is usually written by a journalist,

975
01:49:05,760 --> 01:49:09,780
but they might like, you know, interview people about the findings.

976
01:49:10,590 --> 01:49:18,480
It's also true that one could be interviewed about findings that are just quoted as like a news media release.

977
01:49:18,570 --> 01:49:27,410
So. Lots of different ways to think about that writing pop ads and how kind of persuasive they are.

978
01:49:27,410 --> 01:49:34,730
People do they do get a lot of traction. Blogs, videos, social media, that's kind of the final section of the press.

979
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:46,579
That's the thing. And then this list. I mean he's got it to believe it's a be 16 considerations of how to communicate about science.

980
01:49:46,580 --> 01:49:51,440
But I think these are all really important to keep in mind.

981
01:49:53,090 --> 01:49:57,590
And so like seeking and creating opportunities to disseminate.

982
01:49:57,740 --> 01:50:07,370
So like conferences, publications are kind of where you want to start because you want to build up your academic credentials around this.

983
01:50:09,740 --> 01:50:18,950
But then kind of after that, after you have a message and your team has a message for your, you know, wanting to.

984
01:50:20,050 --> 01:50:22,990
Disseminate something that you feel really confident about,

985
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:32,319
that there's data behind that's maybe ideally been like replicated and or that's an issue you think has not appeared at all in the literature.

986
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:39,040
That's maybe more of the case for like a ED because you don't have the data behind it, but you're like,

987
01:50:39,040 --> 01:50:46,809
this is important to consider because there's data behind it and these other like dimensions or other research areas.

988
01:50:46,810 --> 01:50:51,940
But we have not applied it to this research area. So it's kind of like your gaps in the review.

989
01:50:54,070 --> 01:50:59,410
The other thing, and again, this is often not up to us, but this don't sensationalize.

990
01:51:01,230 --> 01:51:07,920
If you remember, like that green jelly beans example when they were like tested 50 jelly beans, they found the green ones were important.

991
01:51:07,920 --> 01:51:15,660
Like, that's the headline that you're going to get if you come out with some findings, that's maybe the headline you're going to get.

992
01:51:15,900 --> 01:51:24,060
And we really can't control that because even if you're working with a journalist who wants to interview you about findings, that's great.

993
01:51:24,540 --> 01:51:35,130
But like their process is not to then run that final product by you because they're a way more tight deadline than any of us are.

994
01:51:35,580 --> 01:51:43,710
And they're just like getting a quote. They're going to put out their article and then they're going to hope that you're quoting

995
01:51:43,920 --> 01:51:51,180
accurately so and that you don't need a ton of context for that quote to be accurate.

996
01:51:51,300 --> 01:51:56,880
I guess that's a better way to put it. And so I feel like we don't often have control here.

997
01:51:57,450 --> 01:51:59,549
But one of the things that, again,

998
01:51:59,550 --> 01:52:08,550
like if you could take advantage of being here is you can do some media trainings with like the U of M, there's like a U of M level.

999
01:52:08,550 --> 01:52:16,110
And then there's a school of public health level media training that is done by that com group marketing and communications.

1000
01:52:18,060 --> 01:52:25,770
And I think for those of us in public health, it's just important to really think carefully about that and try to get training if you can,

1001
01:52:26,670 --> 01:52:31,659
because I will say it like it's stressful to be interviewed by journalists because of that,

1002
01:52:31,660 --> 01:52:38,020
because you're like, Oh my gosh, don't take me out of context. Or like, Oh, I don't feel comfortable with what this message is.

1003
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:43,570
And if you can like really get down to a sentence, but.

1004
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:51,540
Is short and doesn't need a ton of context for rapping in order to be interpreted.

1005
01:52:52,640 --> 01:52:57,020
That's great, because then you can sort of feed it to the journalists and say, see this?

1006
01:52:57,560 --> 01:53:01,520
And that will be accurate and I'll represent this field or whatever I might be speaking about.

1007
01:53:03,530 --> 01:53:08,030
And I would say I haven't had like horrible experiences with journalists.

1008
01:53:08,840 --> 01:53:14,479
But some of my colleagues of my one of my pediatrician colleagues has definitely had the experience where,

1009
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:20,120
like, you know, studying parenting and studying like child eating behaviors,

1010
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:25,370
they've definitely sort of taken quotes like and not even quotes from her,

1011
01:53:25,370 --> 01:53:32,089
but just sort of the interpretation is like and the headline is like Parents are feeding infants better food or something like that.

1012
01:53:32,090 --> 01:53:35,489
And it's just, you know, those are like those it had that time period,

1013
01:53:35,490 --> 01:53:41,630
that headline that like an attention grabbing headlines that like, you know, parents place infants at risk for obesity.

1014
01:53:42,470 --> 01:53:46,450
Like, that's, you know, people would be like, oh, wait, how does that happen?

1015
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:54,020
And then it's like this much more nuanced study. We looked at parenting like obesity rates in infants, but that's not the headline.

1016
01:53:54,020 --> 01:53:57,230
So I think it is really like it can be like a stressful space.

1017
01:53:57,380 --> 01:54:03,470
And I think some of the findings that, you know, again, in this sort of like politically charged era,

1018
01:54:05,120 --> 01:54:12,740
there's a lot that can be like just picked up and it's by whomever and like used non as intended, I guess.

1019
01:54:13,250 --> 01:54:17,690
So if you ever I mean, I think it's also just like an overall caution.

1020
01:54:17,720 --> 01:54:22,740
So if you have a finding or have some research area that like if you're doing and

1021
01:54:22,740 --> 01:54:26,330
you you have a sense like it could be misinterpreted or there could be like,

1022
01:54:27,590 --> 01:54:30,890
I don't know, people could like find this or not love it.

1023
01:54:31,880 --> 01:54:35,959
Talking with your advisor, if they talked to media before for sure is important.

1024
01:54:35,960 --> 01:54:39,260
And then talking again where you have these resources at Michigan,

1025
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:45,350
taking advantage of those and talking to the people about like how do we frame this?

1026
01:54:45,350 --> 01:54:53,060
And if there's some study that comes out, they can like, you know, write up the news release and get quotes in advance.

1027
01:54:53,540 --> 01:54:56,180
The other thing and again, this is just like for the future, but like.

1028
01:54:57,410 --> 01:55:04,850
A journalist might want to talk to you on the phone, but you can also say, you know, I can't talk by phone, but I'm happy to exchange an email.

1029
01:55:04,850 --> 01:55:15,469
And then you have more control over what you say and you can edit because they will edit on your own email.

1030
01:55:15,470 --> 01:55:19,879
You have a little more. I think this is the other thing with all of this.

1031
01:55:19,880 --> 01:55:26,510
It's like once you kind of have feel confidence and you know, you know, you're not overstating your data,

1032
01:55:26,630 --> 01:55:33,260
know this is like beyond the discussion section where you might be told by a peer review or like you're overstating your claims,

1033
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:35,480
don't talk about causality because it doesn't matter.

1034
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:42,410
You know, that's all really important to keep in mind for all this, because you don't want to be in a situation where you're overstating your claims.

1035
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:52,310
Okay. So this is definitely kind of something you guys might do know later in your academic

1036
01:55:52,310 --> 01:55:56,610
career if you have a finding that like gets picked up because that does happen.

1037
01:55:56,660 --> 01:56:01,250
Right. Especially if it's like locally relevant, then it can get picked up.

1038
01:56:02,480 --> 01:56:06,330
But also anywhere, you know, you go into careers and all this stuff.

1039
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:12,090
Again. Increasingly so. Okay.

1040
01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:16,350
The other thing, like another big picture thing is.

1041
01:56:18,510 --> 01:56:22,140
Like How do we learn to do this and who and whatever are.

1042
01:56:23,280 --> 01:56:31,410
Like, I like her sort of talking vertical because she's talking about like years back to that 17 year pipeline.

1043
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:40,170
We want to shorten that pipeline. But we're we're like in academia, we've been rewarded for like publishing papers, which is good,

1044
01:56:40,410 --> 01:56:45,270
and we should be policy makers, but like not for the sort of broader dissemination.

1045
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:53,130
And so how do we make it possible in our field to sort of be rewarded for broader dissemination that is based on our science?

1046
01:56:54,540 --> 01:57:02,160
So I think I just put that in there as like something to think about because what you guys need to do as PhD students is like.

1047
01:57:03,050 --> 01:57:05,580
Do the research, do the papers, you know.

1048
01:57:05,870 --> 01:57:17,390
But I would say, like also prep for this broader dissemination and be able to figure out how you're going to tell the story of your research.

1049
01:57:18,200 --> 01:57:23,030
But like, you don't want to get ahead of telling the story for research before you've done the research.

1050
01:57:26,560 --> 01:57:34,900
And what else about that one? So yeah, sort of thinking about like the alternative networks, um, they have things like, you know,

1051
01:57:34,900 --> 01:57:41,860
so just big picture as people are reviewed for like tenure, you know, how many papers did they publish?

1052
01:57:42,160 --> 01:57:47,379
Did they get grant funding? Do they have an R? What, what? How much money are they bringing in funding wise?

1053
01:57:47,380 --> 01:57:51,040
Like those are the metrics. Classic tenure metrics.

1054
01:57:53,610 --> 01:57:59,429
It could be that people are like a really big presence on Twitter or something like that,

1055
01:57:59,430 --> 01:58:03,720
and they have these alternative metrics of like sharing information that are really impactful,

1056
01:58:04,320 --> 01:58:08,880
that are sort of don't count in the academy ten year thing.

1057
01:58:09,660 --> 01:58:19,110
Ideally, they're kind of both happening. And so I think that it's good to just sort of check in on these things as a

1058
01:58:19,110 --> 01:58:24,240
balance because you want to get especially in academia and even in not academia,

1059
01:58:25,590 --> 01:58:30,960
you want to be pulling your messaging from reliable, rigorous research sources.

1060
01:58:31,050 --> 01:58:34,710
So even if you're not creating that research in one spot in your current position,

1061
01:58:35,940 --> 01:58:43,530
you want to be basing any recommendations on things that would be picked up on Twitter, like on good research.

1062
01:58:47,350 --> 01:58:56,180
Okay. So those are just sort of like big, big points. And I like that.

1063
01:58:56,960 --> 01:59:00,740
This I don't know if people have like read his stuff before the filmmaker,

1064
01:59:00,740 --> 01:59:10,130
but I think he has a good way of just sort of talking about how things are taken out of context, how things are like sensationalized.

1065
01:59:11,720 --> 01:59:17,540
You know, if you're in a hot area and this is the other thing like none of us know, like whether our area might get hot.

1066
01:59:19,250 --> 01:59:24,920
And so something can come along and all of a sudden you're like, oh, my gosh, somebody called me for, like, good quotes.

1067
01:59:24,940 --> 01:59:33,600
What do I do? And so that's that's just always important to kind of have that going in your head, like, how would I do that?

1068
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:40,549
And again, usually you'd have time, like certainly before you would do anything big, you would have time to respond.

1069
01:59:40,550 --> 01:59:47,840
And like being on, you know, a TV spot or a podcast or something like that, they'll give you some lead time to prep that.

1070
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:55,370
You can ask for questions, but something like a quote about this research study that could be a lot more short timeline.

1071
01:59:55,370 --> 01:59:59,330
So just. You know, talking with people about how to explain your results.

1072
01:59:59,660 --> 02:00:02,810
I think it's always important for even your area of research.

1073
02:00:04,490 --> 02:00:14,720
Has anyone had the experience of talking with, you know, kind of dissemination spaces in terms of research that they've been involved with?

1074
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:22,850
Our team was contacted. Hmm.

1075
02:00:26,810 --> 02:00:30,139
Final thought. So, I don't know.

1076
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:33,470
Maybe I can tell if you're still working for Google, right?

1077
02:00:33,980 --> 02:00:38,890
And you probably didn't follow because the story came out and were like, oh, man, he followed up.

1078
02:00:39,050 --> 02:00:42,740
Oh, did he? Okay, that's good. That's good. That's very weird.

1079
02:00:43,670 --> 02:00:46,760
Oh, really? So it was like, what was it like for.

1080
02:00:48,350 --> 02:00:52,730
And we a lot of asking questions and researchers looking the other side of.

1081
02:00:56,620 --> 02:01:02,520
I get what? What? We communicated correctly.

1082
02:01:02,530 --> 02:01:09,260
You're taking out of context, talking. Totally.

1083
02:01:09,980 --> 02:01:13,600
And things that, like, we obsess over like terminology, right?

1084
02:01:13,610 --> 02:01:18,379
And like we try to not use jargon when possible, but we also want to be really precise.

1085
02:01:18,380 --> 02:01:22,130
And we're not talking about this just like the broad, like trauma.

1086
02:01:22,340 --> 02:01:26,090
Like the word trauma is used all the time.

1087
02:01:26,090 --> 02:01:29,360
And like, it actually means something really specific, but it's really not math.

1088
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:34,630
Those don't wrap on 100%. So like but then in an interview,

1089
02:01:34,640 --> 02:01:40,700
do you want to say like exposure to traumatic events that could perhaps invoke trauma reactions like you don't want that either.

1090
02:01:40,700 --> 02:01:44,720
So like that is a really hard balance I think.

1091
02:01:46,370 --> 02:01:49,820
And I'm trying to like the things that I've been interviewed about that I've.

1092
02:01:51,460 --> 02:01:56,350
Like they've been fine. But they also feel like either you're oversimplifying.

1093
02:01:57,690 --> 02:02:03,480
And or you're sort of the thing that the person is excited about is something that you're like.

1094
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:12,999
There's less research to bear that out. Look, I'm in this situation sometimes where I talk to people about, like self regulation of eating disorders.

1095
02:02:13,000 --> 02:02:18,290
This like a very specific niche topic. People want to know how can we improve our self-regulation of eating?

1096
02:02:18,340 --> 02:02:23,740
And I'm like my sense, having lived in this research world for a few decades at this point,

1097
02:02:24,220 --> 02:02:29,230
I'm like, you know, the research base is a lot less than what people are saying.

1098
02:02:29,650 --> 02:02:35,650
But people are excited about these ideas, partly because none of that brain wants to go back to shame.

1099
02:02:36,850 --> 02:02:41,590
People are excited because of him too. And like that, some of our research is just not based on anything.

1100
02:02:43,180 --> 02:02:47,650
So then if you're in the position of saying like, Well, here's the important place to focus,

1101
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:52,890
you want to kind of guide the interview over that direction. But that could be really hard if they really want to talk about that.

1102
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:58,470
And so. I think that, you know, some of it takes practice.

1103
02:02:58,560 --> 02:03:06,120
Some of it takes like. Just writing down like use these words and use them consistently when I'm talking about,

1104
02:03:06,610 --> 02:03:11,220
you know, different like different populations maybe in your work like.

1105
02:03:12,150 --> 02:03:16,920
This applies to this group. This applies to this kind of trying to do that clarification.

1106
02:03:16,980 --> 02:03:23,010
It's going to be more generalized than you probably talk about it in her research,

1107
02:03:24,360 --> 02:03:31,050
but kind of striking a balance between like overly general sensationalize or not accurate and like,

1108
02:03:31,170 --> 02:03:37,830
okay, that's not exactly how I talk about it in my research, but like it's it's it's not inaccurate.

1109
02:03:37,890 --> 02:03:47,850
Totally. You know, like, I think that could be really hard because we spend so much time over here trying to, like, clarify our terms and.

1110
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:54,260
I think that's the other thing that I would highlight from his talk.

1111
02:03:55,740 --> 02:03:59,610
This whole thing about, like, trials and like what works, what doesn't work.

1112
02:03:59,610 --> 02:04:07,590
And if you are ever talking about like a clinical trial or other kinds of results like and you might, you know,

1113
02:04:08,070 --> 02:04:14,110
be seeing the results of this clinical trial, like what people want to know is like, did it work or did not work?

1114
02:04:14,130 --> 02:04:17,220
And you're like, wow, there's a lot of classifications.

1115
02:04:17,220 --> 02:04:17,640
Yes.

1116
02:04:18,330 --> 02:04:28,139
And so I think figuring out like what the key caveats are, especially if you have a non-significant outcome or a weird outcome or something like that,

1117
02:04:28,140 --> 02:04:37,970
you can say we didn't find evidence that this worked and we think it is because people didn't attend the sessions or have like

1118
02:04:37,980 --> 02:04:49,230
some reason that you couldn't like feed to the interviewer and as well as like a core message of like so next steps or so.

1119
02:04:49,230 --> 02:04:58,620
Amy in the story, when they talked with you guys with you, do you feel like the overarching story was kind of on target or.

1120
02:04:58,950 --> 02:05:02,230
I think that really you were a person that you thought.

1121
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:13,150
Second order. Hmm.

1122
02:05:13,500 --> 02:05:23,120
I like culinary school. Mm hmm.

1123
02:05:23,670 --> 02:05:27,500
Like that. Told that story. Right. That's like this. Uh huh.

1124
02:05:29,950 --> 02:05:33,880
For more on. That. Right?

1125
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:39,550
Right. That's a great example. You know, this story is going to carry the day.

1126
02:05:40,210 --> 02:05:43,930
I had a question. Have you ever been asked to talk about like a study that you had?

1127
02:05:48,910 --> 02:05:53,230
Yeah, that's a good question. I feel like I have been asked to talk about.

1128
02:05:54,890 --> 02:06:02,870
A general topic. And then I know that I have a study that's ongoing in that space that's not like ready

1129
02:06:02,870 --> 02:06:07,400
for prime time or like we have early conference results that kind of counteracted.

1130
02:06:07,790 --> 02:06:17,520
Yeah, some stuff. So yeah, then and then what I'll say is sort of like, you know, it's complicated.

1131
02:06:18,000 --> 02:06:21,870
Like, it's not a straight forward relationship, which I'm sure is really unsatisfying.

1132
02:06:21,870 --> 02:06:26,669
But you know, and like we all read articles where at the end they're like, so it's complicated.

1133
02:06:26,670 --> 02:06:31,920
And like that's a sort of an unsatisfying, like, journalistic piece to read.

1134
02:06:32,430 --> 02:06:41,070
But if I sort of know that where they want to go is kind of not what I think it's going to not turn out to be accurate.

1135
02:06:41,370 --> 02:06:42,210
I guess if that makes sense,

1136
02:06:43,140 --> 02:06:52,620
then I will kind of try to bring in a little bit of that sort of doubt where sort of like we really don't know because we haven't done the research,

1137
02:06:53,430 --> 02:06:58,950
you know? And I think that's totally reasonable to say, especially if you don't know.

1138
02:07:00,160 --> 02:07:08,879
Yeah. And you know, we had a like a we had a a trial, a childhood obesity prevention trial that like had not no results,

1139
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:13,410
no accident took place in that in that polar vortex time that I was talking about.

1140
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:22,229
And so it was like really hard, I would say harder than maybe even typical to get parents to attend and all this stuff.

1141
02:07:22,230 --> 02:07:25,530
So that's kind of the message we when talking to reporters.

1142
02:07:26,820 --> 02:07:30,000
I said, you know, it was a good idea,

1143
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:36,989
but the engagement was so low that it really wasn't something that you ended up being able to

1144
02:07:36,990 --> 02:07:42,360
test very well because we didn't have a lot of like ability to get parents to these sessions.

1145
02:07:45,470 --> 02:07:53,000
Yeah. And that one actually that one had a kind of an interesting story because it got published with the results of this null trial,

1146
02:07:53,000 --> 02:07:59,780
got published in Pediatrics, which was like a good journal. And like Julie, my collaborator was like, We've got to publish these findings.

1147
02:07:59,780 --> 02:08:06,770
Like, we're really like we have to let the world know that like this didn't work, which I agree, but it's like very hard to publish, no findings.

1148
02:08:07,700 --> 02:08:10,790
And what they did is that they said, we will publish these findings,

1149
02:08:10,790 --> 02:08:18,170
but we're going to include a commentary by like this prolific researcher who was very on board with the idea that it should have worked.

1150
02:08:20,540 --> 02:08:22,759
And so they kind of did like a side by side publish.

1151
02:08:22,760 --> 02:08:29,659
So it wasn't quite like media media, but it was still like it was like an editorial piece kind of accompanied the findings.

1152
02:08:29,660 --> 02:08:35,780
And so the editorial piece was about like, here are some way, here are some rationales for why it didn't work,

1153
02:08:35,780 --> 02:08:40,210
as opposed to like the fundamental concept was flawed of the trial.

1154
02:08:41,660 --> 02:08:42,620
So that was interest.

1155
02:08:42,630 --> 02:08:51,320
That whole experience was interesting because it was like very much like the pediatrics editors really wanted it to be true that this concept.

1156
02:08:52,230 --> 02:08:57,240
Was it worked for obesity prevention, which is like the sort of parenting self-regulation.

1157
02:08:58,890 --> 02:09:04,469
And I think there are. It's certainly true that like some of the implementation and I do think the parent

1158
02:09:04,470 --> 02:09:10,170
engagement piece was a big reason why the home some of the home stuff didn't work well.

1159
02:09:10,950 --> 02:09:18,510
But I also kind of wonder and like young kids, like, how relevant is self-regulation for eating behavior?

1160
02:09:18,960 --> 02:09:20,940
And that's something I've done a lot of research on.

1161
02:09:22,620 --> 02:09:27,320
And they were like really not willing to like let that drop as like, maybe that's not a good idea.

1162
02:09:27,330 --> 02:09:32,660
Like maybe we shouldn't be pursuing this as like an intervention strategy for obesity prevention.

1163
02:09:33,060 --> 02:09:36,990
And they were like, we don't want to we don't want you guys to say that that's like too strong.

1164
02:09:37,710 --> 02:09:43,140
We're going to publish this editorial next to your paper that says, We still should be looking at this,

1165
02:09:43,140 --> 02:09:49,680
and here's these different ways we can look at it, which and I'm kind of not I'm kind of like I don't know, like, you know.

1166
02:09:50,700 --> 02:09:54,389
So that was an interesting experience. And it was like all within academia.

1167
02:09:54,390 --> 02:09:57,540
It's like within baseball or whatever inside baseball, right?

1168
02:09:59,670 --> 02:10:04,710
So to talk to people about those like nuanced findings that even like academics, certainly.

1169
02:10:07,130 --> 02:10:11,960
I think that that particular study recruitment and even contacted the Times about a study.

1170
02:10:13,510 --> 02:10:18,100
Oh, that's a good question. Not necessarily.

1171
02:10:18,100 --> 02:10:28,299
Although like if something actually know that if something is like newly funded and maybe like like it's health endowment funding,

1172
02:10:28,300 --> 02:10:34,330
kind of a locally important, you know, hey, we're going to do a new study on this like that and I cares right now that just got

1173
02:10:34,330 --> 02:10:39,280
funded which you should connect with the way that like cancer surveillance people.

1174
02:10:41,650 --> 02:10:48,430
But but in a way to like promote the study and say like, oh, we're recruiting now and people should enroll.

1175
02:10:48,550 --> 02:10:52,900
Yeah. You don't kind of want I don't know if that's what you're getting at, but like you don't want to, like,

1176
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:59,049
give away your hypotheses in a way, but you just want to say, hey, we're interested in looking at this issue.

1177
02:10:59,050 --> 02:11:07,810
So I think that could be a little bit of a tricky interview, but then you could just sort of talk broadly about the research area.

1178
02:11:09,780 --> 02:11:17,060
Yeah. Yeah. And like, we're seeking people to participate, you know, so that we can learn the answers to these really progressive.

1179
02:11:18,950 --> 02:11:24,420
And that would be a bit. Extra recruiting tool making.

1180
02:11:27,830 --> 02:11:36,680
Yeah. There's so many there's so many ways in which all this happens that I think sometimes we're not prepared to, like, figure out what to do.

1181
02:11:36,680 --> 02:11:45,379
And I think it does pay to be as strategic as possible because then if it's like both, if something goes not how you want it,

1182
02:11:45,380 --> 02:11:49,580
you don't think you want that thing to just go away and it won't because the Internet,

1183
02:11:50,180 --> 02:11:54,829
you know, but then if it goes well and you can like craft your message and say like,

1184
02:11:54,830 --> 02:11:59,719
look at this cool piece that highlighted our work, then you can use that in a lot of different ways.

1185
02:11:59,720 --> 02:12:08,890
So it's sort of a, there's like an approach avoidance thing going right that you want to have, have it be good, and so it's worth it.

1186
02:12:08,930 --> 02:12:12,260
Sometimes I feel like I talked to someone.

1187
02:12:12,530 --> 02:12:18,110
Oh, Karen Peterson in nutrition. We were discussing this because she's often asked to talk about kids and eating and obesity prevention.

1188
02:12:18,130 --> 02:12:25,580
And she was like, Oh, I had an interview with NPR and I took a half a day to prep and it was like really a half a day.

1189
02:12:25,580 --> 02:12:32,660
I would take like an hour and feel like, Oh gosh, I'm sort of guilty because I'm taking an hour to prep for this like non research activity.

1190
02:12:33,500 --> 02:12:41,750
But at the same time like if you can really prep and just sort of like figure craft your message and figure out a

1191
02:12:41,750 --> 02:12:47,840
story to tell and like that would then be a very compelling interview that then could have like benefits later.

1192
02:12:48,710 --> 02:12:52,940
So I thought that was interesting because she was also like a big senior person when I was talking to her was like,

1193
02:12:52,940 --> 02:12:58,330
Oh my gosh, I always thought you could just do that in 10 minutes. And it sounds like you can, but there's crap behind it.

1194
02:12:59,420 --> 02:13:03,800
Yeah. Yeah. So it's also good. Yeah.

1195
02:13:03,810 --> 02:13:13,580
So, like, really, really fascinating to think about. Oh, and I wanted to say to you, like, this is sort of more around this, like, infographic thing,

1196
02:13:13,580 --> 02:13:19,070
but there are these training things and I think it's like we're sort of in a good position because everybody cares.

1197
02:13:19,430 --> 02:13:23,090
To some degree, like people care more about like what we do and it's much more accessible.

1198
02:13:23,450 --> 02:13:29,300
But I think that's we, we have a little bit more danger of like the common turns.

1199
02:13:30,500 --> 02:13:35,329
Versus like our what we really need. And so I think that's something we have to work with the public health.

1200
02:13:35,330 --> 02:13:44,240
But like if you talk to like people who do well and this is climate change, so this is like the scientists who really need to get messaging, you know,

1201
02:13:44,690 --> 02:13:56,690
get their arms around messaging, you know, depending on what kind of work you're doing, you can really see like kind of how much of an issue this is.

1202
02:13:56,690 --> 02:14:00,130
But I think this is a this is always true for public health researchers.

1203
02:14:00,260 --> 02:14:09,499
People always want to know to some degree, like what we're finding and doing and studying, but so like scientific writing here,

1204
02:14:09,500 --> 02:14:15,110
like, you know, you're providing a lot of context, you're providing references, you're writing more texts and Branford graphics.

1205
02:14:16,160 --> 02:14:20,960
And then it's always like, you better figure out your authors and the focus is on the results.

1206
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:28,190
And then here again, this is the climate change example, but the more broad communication about science, like what's the societal context?

1207
02:14:28,190 --> 02:14:38,959
And I think this is where like we have it easy because we can come up with examples and have societal context here like you want to have a planet.

1208
02:14:38,960 --> 02:14:45,560
This is like infographic, explanatory text with graphics and then like especially if you have community partners,

1209
02:14:45,860 --> 02:14:52,210
you know, talk about who contributed to this, especially like, you know, if we recruited, you know,

1210
02:14:52,220 --> 02:14:57,440
people from this community and it was so wonderful to have a whole that could come up in a paper,

1211
02:14:57,440 --> 02:15:05,690
but it's much more likely to be like here we want to know who contributed to the to the communication and then the focus here.

1212
02:15:05,690 --> 02:15:10,549
Here's a set of results and like kind of a narrow interpretation and you don't go beyond your results.

1213
02:15:10,550 --> 02:15:19,760
And a paper here, as long as you are confident in those results that that body of work, then you focus more on like the, you know, recommendations.

1214
02:15:21,080 --> 02:15:28,309
And so some of these trainings, this is like media training and says, for example,

1215
02:15:28,310 --> 02:15:31,610
it's been I'm sure like, you know, people needed that they could get it.

1216
02:15:31,610 --> 02:15:36,020
And then the U of M one was going to see if it would pull up.

1217
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:42,889
I think this just came out in the vector. I don't know. This is this is from last year and nobody left.

1218
02:15:42,890 --> 02:15:46,040
But in the vector, this is a similar idea.

1219
02:15:47,180 --> 02:15:52,280
So it's just like a one hour session that they offer me. I do think they were just newly offering this.

1220
02:15:52,280 --> 02:15:58,430
Again, they they just sort of had this like training session to talk about.

1221
02:15:59,060 --> 02:16:02,690
Here's how we work with the media, with the media people.

1222
02:16:02,690 --> 02:16:12,769
So they had no the deal. I think it's also helpful to do it because then they know you and then they can be like, Hey, this is coming out.

1223
02:16:12,770 --> 02:16:17,060
Or like, let me know if papers that come out and we can help you craft your message.

1224
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:21,820
So I think that's that's helpful. To pursue.

1225
02:16:28,450 --> 02:16:34,060
So the first two things were I just coming this question because I had an experience.

1226
02:16:34,500 --> 02:16:39,460
Yeah. Immediate training. In high school, and they were very nice people.

1227
02:16:42,210 --> 02:16:52,310
The fact that. Yeah, probably.

1228
02:16:53,470 --> 02:16:56,590
I think that that doesn't know if anybody has that.

1229
02:16:56,740 --> 02:17:00,930
I feel like it just came out and just quickly do a quickie check.

1230
02:17:01,860 --> 02:17:18,150
Um. Okay. Here it is. Upcoming media and public engagements, training for faculty and staff.

1231
02:17:18,780 --> 02:17:30,560
And that's in the vector. So this is. These sessions for us to learn more about various methods of public engagement.

1232
02:17:31,450 --> 02:17:38,090
What's today? There's one today at noon.

1233
02:17:38,790 --> 02:17:45,200
Oh, my God. So this is search using social media for public engagement.

1234
02:17:45,950 --> 02:17:49,399
Social media platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn and great tools for public health researchers,

1235
02:17:49,400 --> 02:17:52,070
professional astro expertize trying to find different power stations.

1236
02:17:52,070 --> 02:17:58,219
But how do you decide where and how to virtually join the Public Health Marketing Communications

1237
02:17:58,220 --> 02:18:03,760
team to learn about industry best practice by using social media and helpful tips.

1238
02:18:04,820 --> 02:18:07,940
Content of this session will be targeted to faculty, staff and students.

1239
02:18:07,940 --> 02:18:15,920
Remember to register. But I can.

1240
02:18:22,850 --> 02:18:29,200
Casey before I even register. It either planning for later or something.

1241
02:18:31,390 --> 02:18:35,140
How timely? Because I think that's the thing.

1242
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:41,520
They like to do it all the time. I will say this, Marc Department,

1243
02:18:41,530 --> 02:18:52,299
the fact that they even exist is like within the last seven or eight years maybe that they became a department and like when they kind of first came,

1244
02:18:52,300 --> 02:18:56,770
people were like, What? Like what? Why do we have this?

1245
02:18:57,280 --> 02:19:03,250
But I personally have found it really awesome and they'll help. Just kind of get your message more digestible.

1246
02:19:05,590 --> 02:19:09,129
But it was a kind of a little bit of a culture shift that they kind of are around.

1247
02:19:09,130 --> 02:19:12,710
But there's like branding and like whenever they're, you know.

1248
02:19:14,550 --> 02:19:19,290
A booklet needs to be made that kind of goes through them. And I think that's really helpful and good.

1249
02:19:19,320 --> 02:19:26,030
But there's like, I don't even know if it was pushback, but it was kind of just like we got we had brandy.

1250
02:19:27,030 --> 02:19:32,340
So it's it's very interesting to to see kind of how they have fit in.

1251
02:19:32,490 --> 02:19:37,799
But I do I think that public health, it's like it's public and they're researching things that are important to the public.

1252
02:19:37,800 --> 02:19:42,740
So like, you know. It's complex, but it's so important.

1253
02:19:43,980 --> 02:19:47,460
Get the messages out. I think I kind of think they're great.

1254
02:19:47,860 --> 02:19:53,040
That's my. I mean, like any communication courses.

1255
02:19:54,690 --> 02:19:59,360
It's so within. Yeah.

1256
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:03,410
I think they probably are more workshop are like.

1257
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:11,389
But I have this. Yeah, we've been talking about this actually curriculum committee because I think like

1258
02:20:11,390 --> 02:20:15,790
especially for master's students and then you go and you work in a health department,

1259
02:20:15,800 --> 02:20:24,980
say, and something like COVID happens like you need to have a good communication strategy and that's an important like MPH goal.

1260
02:20:26,720 --> 02:20:35,270
And in HIPAA, we have a communications requirement for the master's program students and there are courses that meet that.

1261
02:20:35,390 --> 02:20:45,700
But one is what is Brian's sticky communication course, which is I don't know if anybody is aiming to do that and that.

1262
02:20:46,250 --> 02:20:50,000
So that's always a great course. I've always heard great things about that.

1263
02:20:51,020 --> 02:20:54,470
And it's, you know, open to, I think, master's and up.

1264
02:20:55,820 --> 02:21:01,940
And then Ken does Ken Resnick does a health it's just health communications, I think it's called.

1265
02:21:03,350 --> 02:21:08,050
And so there's within the Knoll teachers they just changed the name of it.

1266
02:21:08,060 --> 02:21:11,030
So I don't know the new name, but it was called Materials and Methods.

1267
02:21:11,030 --> 02:21:16,489
And it's all about that's much more like about designing program materials and like an info,

1268
02:21:16,490 --> 02:21:22,370
you know, doing this kind of stuff less like other communication stuff.

1269
02:21:22,370 --> 02:21:28,490
But in Ken's class, I think also like they do video and they kind of do some health communication tools.

1270
02:21:28,850 --> 02:21:32,929
And I think that would be I think that's a nice thing too.

1271
02:21:32,930 --> 02:21:36,320
Like we could have those kind of classes up in the department. I think a little bit.

1272
02:21:36,530 --> 02:21:41,270
We could have a policy advocacy thing, but that would be awesome.

1273
02:21:41,420 --> 02:21:47,719
And there have been there have been some times that we have taught those, but it's been more from outside people too.

1274
02:21:47,720 --> 02:21:51,680
So I think it would be great to have more of that.

1275
02:21:52,960 --> 02:21:59,200
I mean, if you talk to the people who do firearms research, they're interviewed quite a bit about that.

1276
02:21:59,380 --> 02:22:05,470
And that's an area where you have to sort of think about your messaging carefully.

1277
02:22:06,910 --> 02:22:09,639
So there's a lot of people who have experience,

1278
02:22:09,640 --> 02:22:14,920
and I feel like it'd be great to pull in that experience, of course, but it doesn't make sense to have.

1279
02:22:17,470 --> 02:22:25,120
Um hmm. But it's always good to be aware of options for drinking.

1280
02:22:26,770 --> 02:22:29,800
And there are few to certain bright ones to.

1281
02:22:31,330 --> 02:22:37,389
SBM, I think does they do these sort of like with your 700 horn membership,

1282
02:22:37,390 --> 02:22:43,719
you get that, you get like training stuff and they do they do things like that as well.

1283
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:48,680
Help, of course. Okay.

1284
02:22:48,720 --> 02:22:52,110
Let me see. Oh, yeah.

1285
02:22:52,110 --> 02:22:59,459
Yeah. And then this is like another article here that was sort of about going from like and this is a good example.

1286
02:22:59,460 --> 02:23:02,850
I think this is like, yeah, and it's like really dense text.

1287
02:23:02,850 --> 02:23:11,840
That's why it's there. But this is like a topic that's been rigorously evaluated through research and like we didn't

1288
02:23:11,850 --> 02:23:16,980
we know enough about this topic to like have a strong recommendation so that like those U.S.

1289
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:23,070
Prevention Task Force type recommendations or something that really has a lot of research behind it.

1290
02:23:24,030 --> 02:23:33,150
Take that and go to an infographic because that is really you can be confident in your in your research and what they showed, I think.

1291
02:23:33,270 --> 02:23:33,990
Yeah, I put this on here.

1292
02:23:34,290 --> 02:23:41,909
So like this was a study that actually tested like do you prefer your information from an infographic or from a, you know, dense research article?

1293
02:23:41,910 --> 02:23:44,069
And I found it interesting. It was a tiny sample,

1294
02:23:44,070 --> 02:23:51,570
but more physicians preferred like the kind of text with all the context and and more nurses were preferring infographic

1295
02:23:51,570 --> 02:23:56,910
and I suspect and I think they sent me an article like nurses are the people who have to like explain this to people.

1296
02:23:56,910 --> 02:24:03,389
It's like, I know it. But right now my job is to like engage people and explain it and have them change their health behavior because of it.

1297
02:24:03,390 --> 02:24:11,460
And so like this was much more helpful and I thought it was kind of cool that they did a study to show that, um, okay,

1298
02:24:11,550 --> 02:24:22,410
so this idea of like the complexity, don't forget to talk a little bit about the methods just so that they know like what you did.

1299
02:24:22,590 --> 02:24:26,969
And that's a way to provide some context that's meaningful to say.

1300
02:24:26,970 --> 02:24:34,950
These are the people we interviewed for. This is how many people we interviewed, you know, um, and then don't forget your caveats, but not too much.

1301
02:24:34,950 --> 02:24:43,109
So it's again, this like balancing, um, and then provide some context like, oh, this really applies to, you know, middle schoolers.

1302
02:24:43,110 --> 02:24:48,209
We're attacking public schools in Michigan. You know, I wouldn't go beyond that.

1303
02:24:48,210 --> 02:24:54,720
And maybe you could even say, like, it may be really different for high schoolers because we,

1304
02:24:54,960 --> 02:25:00,360
you know, we're talking about early onset substance use as opposed to, you know.

1305
02:25:01,340 --> 02:25:10,310
Much more advanced substances. He is a figure, know your audience and also publish publish it first.

1306
02:25:10,640 --> 02:25:18,320
When you start talking about it has you know no. And when we're talking about this dissemination so the pursuit.

1307
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:22,040
Oh yeah I know. And that's that little public health blog that I kind of love.

1308
02:25:22,040 --> 02:25:26,300
And like whenever I have something that I feel like a sort of public facing, I try to, like make a pursuit about it.

1309
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:32,690
And I think it's just good practice. To do that.

1310
02:25:35,300 --> 02:25:40,670
Okay. This is also just some.

1311
02:25:41,630 --> 02:25:45,170
Again, I think this is known to this group, but.

1312
02:25:46,430 --> 02:25:53,630
It's this issue of like the audience may not want to hear it, but like if you're in the position of having to present something.

1313
02:25:54,440 --> 02:25:57,470
How do you do that? And this is true across lots of different settings.

1314
02:25:57,950 --> 02:26:04,130
The other thing is that figuring out what your audience does want to hear, and that can be good with the story.

1315
02:26:04,790 --> 02:26:11,690
But it's also like, you know, listening to your audience and knowing what they value and talking about those parts,

1316
02:26:12,020 --> 02:26:17,450
at least to initially engage them in your research findings.

1317
02:26:19,370 --> 02:26:26,059
And I think, you know, this is really hard to do and it comes with practice, but, you know,

1318
02:26:26,060 --> 02:26:30,380
a lot of things and you have like a great depth of knowledge and that's only going to increase.

1319
02:26:31,310 --> 02:26:36,180
But then like not all of that knowledge needs to kind of be, you know, gone into.

1320
02:26:37,770 --> 02:26:40,700
To the audiences. We're trying to reach.

1321
02:26:43,470 --> 02:26:52,530
And this is another piece that, again, this brings in the sort of ah, ah, intense the intense political climate that we're all living in.

1322
02:26:52,540 --> 02:26:55,170
But this is just I don't know if you guys have seen this before, but.

1323
02:26:59,210 --> 02:27:05,360
But there's there's some some of these graphics are done for like who's a more right wing,

1324
02:27:06,020 --> 02:27:12,620
what sort more read point publication in a more left wing publication and sort of like, where do people get their news?

1325
02:27:13,100 --> 02:27:16,640
And this is sort of applying it to like the science news space.

1326
02:27:17,540 --> 02:27:29,000
And so this was like a reading of. An infographic reading which kind of popular press publications.

1327
02:27:29,540 --> 02:27:34,970
Have more like a more evidence based versus more like ideologically driven.

1328
02:27:35,690 --> 02:27:37,630
And I think this is an interesting way.

1329
02:27:37,640 --> 02:27:48,280
It's like a science overlay of those like news publications and they're like political leanings because it's important to like thing,

1330
02:27:48,710 --> 02:27:50,720
you know, again down the line,

1331
02:27:51,380 --> 02:27:59,090
if you're getting interviewed by, you know, if you get contacted by someone from, you know, Pacific Standard, I'm like, I've never heard of that.

1332
02:27:59,090 --> 02:28:05,210
I don't know what that is. You may want to check them out and figure out, like, you know.

1333
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:12,860
Where they stand now, Mother Jones, is what I have heard and I read articles from them,

1334
02:28:13,670 --> 02:28:18,920
but then I'm also aware they are kind of more politically left.

1335
02:28:20,190 --> 02:28:23,560
Others. Uh huh. What else?

1336
02:28:24,760 --> 02:28:36,680
Um. Like I think it's you know, some of these examples are not solely in the public health domain, but some of them are pretty like the person.

1337
02:28:37,580 --> 02:28:41,450
Also like Brian Zygmunt Fisher is involved with the conversation and that's sort

1338
02:28:41,450 --> 02:28:47,900
of some of the some of the guidance of the conversation resides in Michigan.

1339
02:28:49,830 --> 02:28:53,809
So that's just sort of an example. And then. That.

1340
02:28:53,810 --> 02:28:56,870
I'm not sure if people got a chance to look at that little policy brief video.

1341
02:28:56,870 --> 02:29:03,259
But I think it's interesting because they really kind of go through it's like students

1342
02:29:03,260 --> 02:29:09,200
responses to this process of writing policy issue briefs and like what they're.

1343
02:29:09,550 --> 02:29:18,950
The what I liked about that was sort of like how I had to sort of change my thinking to get this research into like a policy brief space.

1344
02:29:19,100 --> 02:29:26,839
So I don't know if in again, in prior lives, people have had experience with trying to write those kinds of things.

1345
02:29:26,840 --> 02:29:30,020
But it's something we talk a lot about in public health,

1346
02:29:30,020 --> 02:29:38,270
and I don't think we get necessarily formal training in that, but it could be really important training.

1347
02:29:40,740 --> 02:29:48,150
And I thought that this piece around you need like a sentence that somebody can distill.

1348
02:29:48,330 --> 02:29:54,040
You know, you need to just do the distilling of the sentence that can still get the point across of it.

1349
02:29:54,060 --> 02:29:57,209
Like, that's also about like knowing your audience piece, right?

1350
02:29:57,210 --> 02:30:04,250
So like, if you have somebody who's going to have 30 seconds versus 5 minutes versus like an hour, you know, what are the key parts?

1351
02:30:04,260 --> 02:30:14,479
And again, like a lot of this. It's good to sort of keep in your mind and like previous thinking about it, but we are also, you know,

1352
02:30:14,480 --> 02:30:20,420
so this is like to you know outward facing stuff to policy brief if your work has policy implications like.

1353
02:30:21,580 --> 02:30:24,730
And it needs to be work that you've like digested on for a while. Right.

1354
02:30:25,510 --> 02:30:33,159
But at the same time, we're all kind of working on like a 32nd pitch about our current selves and steam, I think back to the conference stuff.

1355
02:30:33,160 --> 02:30:38,680
So we're like. I think this has relevance for both the Democrats sense.

1356
02:30:42,360 --> 02:30:53,580
Okay. Oh, and then the other thing. I think I could put in so maybe it's maybe later there are some like cool websites that have plain language.

1357
02:30:55,670 --> 02:31:03,360
Like recommendations. And so I think I might have a link on one of those later, but that's something to just think about.

1358
02:31:03,360 --> 02:31:08,429
Like, you know, if you're in this position of like, oh my gosh,

1359
02:31:08,430 --> 02:31:15,900
I got to really present all my complicated stuff too in a simple, clean way to an audience that doesn't do this.

1360
02:31:16,410 --> 02:31:22,500
How might I do this? And it could come in handy to it thinking about, like, recruitment materials and, you know,

1361
02:31:22,500 --> 02:31:30,200
going to community venues and presenting your work in hopes of maybe recruiting people to participate in the work.

1362
02:31:30,210 --> 02:31:35,490
So it could come in handy. Lots of different ways, I think. Okay.

1363
02:31:36,270 --> 02:31:41,160
We did coffee break. Let me just talk a little bit about the social media space and then yeah.

1364
02:31:41,220 --> 02:31:50,550
Was wondering. Okay. Okay. So this is where it can be so awesome and it can be kind of go wrong.

1365
02:31:51,630 --> 02:31:56,910
It's like the social media space, as with all things. So that's, you know, things like that.

1366
02:31:58,140 --> 02:32:07,430
But like this is a cool example of like somebody created an infographic as I was talking and Sherry could go to somebody.

1367
02:32:07,440 --> 02:32:15,030
She used to be the head of SVM and and is quite a she tweets about a lot of things and I think that you know,

1368
02:32:15,030 --> 02:32:22,859
things can be really awesome and inspirational and I totally have gotten ideas and things that

1369
02:32:22,860 --> 02:32:28,740
make me think a new way about something from sort of academic the Twitter world of social media.

1370
02:32:29,610 --> 02:32:36,030
But you kind of have to figure out who those people are going to be. Oh, and then I was also a good example of tagging on the conference.

1371
02:32:38,490 --> 02:32:42,270
And so like, why would we go to social media while everyone is doing it?

1372
02:32:42,270 --> 02:32:43,380
And that's totally true.

1373
02:32:43,410 --> 02:32:51,000
Like there's always, I don't know if you guys have noticed this or like how much people are on Twitter or other things at this point,

1374
02:32:51,000 --> 02:32:58,290
but fast information exchange of like good and bad information connect to a broad audience.

1375
02:32:58,290 --> 02:33:04,230
And then this is the other piece of like sort of start to establish like a professional identity in the social media space.

1376
02:33:05,070 --> 02:33:10,350
And I do think it's becoming not an expectation, but like a lot of people are on that, on it.

1377
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:15,059
And I think that for especially junior people, it can be a great source of support and resources.

1378
02:33:15,060 --> 02:33:23,040
So people are like, you know, people will post like grant application or tips on job interviewing or tips on

1379
02:33:23,370 --> 02:33:28,049
grant writing or tips on negotiating faculty offer or lots of different things.

1380
02:33:28,050 --> 02:33:32,580
And I think that that is really very valuable.

1381
02:33:32,900 --> 02:33:39,120
That info also teaching and like presentation style stuff.

1382
02:33:39,600 --> 02:33:47,850
And then when it comes to job seeking obviously like great for a network, but for all of those things you want to be careful and this is a.

1383
02:33:48,790 --> 02:33:52,360
Just a link to link pitfalls of social media.

1384
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:59,379
But it's really for all of these reasons because it's so important and ubiquitous that it's important to,

1385
02:33:59,380 --> 02:34:07,990
like, create our image and behavior and what we do on social media in terms of professional ism.

1386
02:34:09,430 --> 02:34:15,670
So I think that like and I focus on Twitter because like I'm kind of simple on Twitter, but.

1387
02:34:18,860 --> 02:34:25,489
You know, it's people probably have had or possibly have had like Twitter accounts before and

1388
02:34:25,490 --> 02:34:29,930
they may or may not be like the one you want to make with your professional identity.

1389
02:34:31,100 --> 02:34:39,049
And we had a situation of a student a few years ago who was like, oh, my gosh, they like linked to like my personal Twitter.

1390
02:34:39,050 --> 02:34:46,990
And it was some journalist or some external person and they were like, Oh my gosh, I didn't realize my email, like, was findable.

1391
02:34:47,030 --> 02:34:50,870
Like, I didn't realize my personal Twitter was findable from my email.

1392
02:34:51,680 --> 02:34:58,819
And it was I mean, was like, I really didn't want that to be ever affiliated with like my kind of professional personality.

1393
02:34:58,820 --> 02:35:06,560
So this is important to like kind of just review different accounts and how people are thankful that information is findable.

1394
02:35:08,510 --> 02:35:14,060
And I think he kept his personal Twitter, but he was just like, I had to decouple it from, like, my other stuff.

1395
02:35:16,310 --> 02:35:21,889
So just sort of thinking about like what the profile says and if I think I have an example.

1396
02:35:21,890 --> 02:35:27,590
Yeah. Of like, you know, and if we've been on academic Twitter and sort of seeing like how people describe themselves,

1397
02:35:27,980 --> 02:35:31,250
sometimes people make a point to say like, opinions are my own.

1398
02:35:32,120 --> 02:35:40,549
Not everybody does that. Um, I personally am a little, I'm like pretty conservative in my tweeting.

1399
02:35:40,550 --> 02:35:45,770
Like I just sort of tweet out like, here's a cool study or like sometimes I'll get a little more impassioned,

1400
02:35:45,770 --> 02:35:53,810
but I try to link my passion to like child health policy or something that is like related to my work.

1401
02:35:54,230 --> 02:36:00,230
And I just really don't use Twitter for other stuff I do, you know, put my friends kids on Facebook, like realize what I do.

1402
02:36:00,230 --> 02:36:03,380
So I try to keep that separated.

1403
02:36:03,830 --> 02:36:07,280
I mean, same thing for LinkedIn, you know, any other things.

1404
02:36:07,280 --> 02:36:11,120
And LinkedIn is more obviously personal or professional Twitter.

1405
02:36:11,120 --> 02:36:16,850
And of course, now Twitter is like, who knows what's going to happen? I don't know how much Twitter will change and all that.

1406
02:36:17,690 --> 02:36:26,930
All these like what's what's his name is saying Twitter. But. I think Twitter is a really in-between space.

1407
02:36:27,080 --> 02:36:30,170
So you have like so much personal stuff, so much political stuff.

1408
02:36:30,170 --> 02:36:34,850
But then there is this like academic Twitter space that I think is really helpful.

1409
02:36:35,160 --> 02:36:43,550
So, so kind of defining your profile, like what you care about and then sort of alert thoughts of people and retweet.

1410
02:36:45,590 --> 02:36:52,820
Okay. And then this is more just like Twitter specific information of tweeting things.

1411
02:36:53,720 --> 02:36:56,750
And I'll just say, like the cautionary notes, the debates.

1412
02:36:56,780 --> 02:37:02,059
So this is where, like, I put up those, like, Instagram things.

1413
02:37:02,060 --> 02:37:07,129
I don't know if you guys had followed seen this, but people were putting up like posters about like,

1414
02:37:07,130 --> 02:37:12,800
this is science and this is women and science and putting out these like photos of themselves and saying like,

1415
02:37:12,800 --> 02:37:17,000
you know, attractive women can do science. And it was this whole sort of thing.

1416
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:21,770
And I think it's just interesting that that all kind of played out on social media.

1417
02:37:21,770 --> 02:37:30,950
And I think there's just that's like a reason to be at least a little bit engaged in the social media space in your academic academic hat on,

1418
02:37:30,950 --> 02:37:34,000
because these things happen. It's like they happen again.

1419
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:39,380
I think social media like they happen, they're really intense and then they kind of die away, but they are influential.

1420
02:37:40,220 --> 02:37:51,799
And so things to sort of just keep in mind political tweeting and I know, you know, we're heading into an election month very soon advocacy.

1421
02:37:51,800 --> 02:37:56,900
And again, here's where like we kind of are on the edge in public health, but we do a lot more advocacy.

1422
02:37:56,900 --> 02:38:00,680
It's kind of baked into a lot of stuff we do or could be.

1423
02:38:01,280 --> 02:38:07,980
But we also especially like early on in our career, like want to be mindful that like we want to keep it based on.

1424
02:38:09,420 --> 02:38:16,889
Vetted things, be it like research, a research article or like an organization that you know about.

1425
02:38:16,890 --> 02:38:22,860
And it's good doing a good job, but you don't want to necessarily like kind of go willy nilly.

1426
02:38:25,200 --> 02:38:33,480
The other thing here that's very specific to academia is this issue of preprints and peer reviewing before things are like ready for prime time,

1427
02:38:34,620 --> 02:38:38,070
and that's predatory practices a little bit different.

1428
02:38:38,220 --> 02:38:45,150
But this arsenic life example is that it's kind of a strange example,

1429
02:38:45,150 --> 02:38:52,410
but it's basically like there was this article saying like article like that arsenic could actually start to create life.

1430
02:38:52,740 --> 02:39:03,600
And it was this like sort of obscure like genetics article, but people kind of picked it up and started it became like a big thing.

1431
02:39:03,600 --> 02:39:06,629
And then the paper was retracted because it was sort of faulty data.

1432
02:39:06,630 --> 02:39:17,130
So again, similar to like the scientific misconduct stuff, it really, you know, came out before this paper was published.

1433
02:39:17,130 --> 02:39:22,740
And that does happen. And there are like preprint sites that you can put papers up.

1434
02:39:22,740 --> 02:39:31,320
And so I think just like being cautious about siting those papers, putting your papers up, retweeting papers that are like pre peer review,

1435
02:39:31,710 --> 02:39:39,030
even if peer review, as we'll talk about in a few times, takes a long time and it's painful and it's imperfect.

1436
02:39:39,030 --> 02:39:42,479
Like it's still kind of the most rigorous system we have for science.

1437
02:39:42,480 --> 02:39:46,620
And so I think we talked a little bit about those predatory journals.

1438
02:39:46,620 --> 02:39:53,909
And so just be do especially if you're if you're really like, wow, this is an awesome paper or like this is a main point.

1439
02:39:53,910 --> 02:39:55,049
Like, I feel passionate about this.

1440
02:39:55,050 --> 02:40:03,100
I want to retweet it just like check your sources because you don't want to be that person who has the example of like, oh my gosh, this tweet I know.

1441
02:40:03,120 --> 02:40:07,020
And it was all blah, blah, blah. So arsenic life, I think was a good example of that.

1442
02:40:08,250 --> 02:40:09,990
And just be careful.

1443
02:40:12,040 --> 02:40:23,290
And then this is like now older data, but this is like why also and I know you would not do this, but who is just sort of and again ten years ago.

1444
02:40:23,290 --> 02:40:28,179
So I think we've all become more accustomed to social media behaviors.

1445
02:40:28,180 --> 02:40:36,729
But these things do happen, you know, and things like, you know, discriminatory language, profanity, intoxication,

1446
02:40:36,730 --> 02:40:42,370
such as a like this is all students, but these students are in med school and so they are going to become professionals.

1447
02:40:42,370 --> 02:40:45,040
And so it's just like when I would say to any like high school student, you know,

1448
02:40:45,040 --> 02:40:55,060
like you can always put out there, you know, and then this was just sort of this quote about social media.

1449
02:40:57,010 --> 02:41:06,100
Okay? And again, I think I've talked about most of these, but like to kind of get oriented in like your academics based on social media,

1450
02:41:07,000 --> 02:41:11,110
following hashtags from people following conferences.

1451
02:41:11,110 --> 02:41:14,979
And then I like these like research conundrums take questions.

1452
02:41:14,980 --> 02:41:21,910
People are like, hey, researchers of a certain area I'm trying to measure X like, what have you guys done?

1453
02:41:21,910 --> 02:41:30,100
And I think there's so much of that good stuff on Twitter and I think people are really genuine and helpful that it's I

1454
02:41:30,100 --> 02:41:38,920
think it's kind of worth like delving in and then just sort of like looking for for people who you respect on there.

1455
02:41:40,060 --> 02:41:43,270
And I think, again, any career path that one would take,

1456
02:41:43,540 --> 02:41:51,490
this is a thing and probably even more if you're working for an organization and you're trying to keep them on message and in the public high.

1457
02:41:54,010 --> 02:42:04,089
And then I think this is yeah, perfect. This is like the last one. So this is just examples of, you know, the kinds of things.

1458
02:42:04,090 --> 02:42:13,270
And again, that's like a pretty innocuous tweet and that's like a good way to start saying you're like, you know, going to an organization you trust.

1459
02:42:13,270 --> 02:42:15,460
You know, they do good stuff. You follow their work.

1460
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:22,780
They had an offense, you know, you like it tweeted and you like contain it with whatever tags they put up there.

1461
02:42:24,740 --> 02:42:32,469
And I don't know if people like follow Paul or or Bill on Twitter,

1462
02:42:32,470 --> 02:42:42,640
but it's so funny because they both tweet a lot like I used to tweet more in a tweet sometimes, but I do a lot of Twitter.

1463
02:42:43,210 --> 02:42:48,130
And it's just funny because Bill definitely has a lot more like personal kind of posts,

1464
02:42:48,130 --> 02:42:51,880
but he's kind of like a he's almost like a personality at this point, I think, on Twitter.

1465
02:42:51,880 --> 02:42:57,580
And it's often tied to like social or public health context.

1466
02:42:58,690 --> 02:43:01,930
But then he does a lot more of like personal tweets, but I think it kind of fits.

1467
02:43:02,050 --> 02:43:12,280
It's like he's his own brand kind of at this point. And then Paul tweets a lot about his clients, which is something that I think is really great.

1468
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:15,310
And [INAUDIBLE] be like today in class we discussed, you know, blah, blah, blah.

1469
02:43:15,340 --> 02:43:21,129
Here are the readings. Here's the discussion. And he just has this very thoughtful way of like distill.

1470
02:43:21,130 --> 02:43:27,940
It's like that distilling of the key points of every of any given class discussion week.

1471
02:43:27,940 --> 02:43:30,610
So I think that he does a really nice job with that.

1472
02:43:31,390 --> 02:43:39,100
And then actually at the faculty orientation meeting this summer, somehow the three of us were chatting and they were like,

1473
02:43:39,100 --> 02:43:44,979
Oh, well, you know, we do check in with each other about the tweets. I was like, you do you check in to see like how the tweets go?

1474
02:43:44,980 --> 02:43:47,470
You know, like I said, I tweet this, how should I phrase it?

1475
02:43:47,550 --> 02:43:53,380
I was like, that makes me feel so much better because like, you guys are both really planful about your tweeting.

1476
02:43:53,410 --> 02:43:58,600
So anyway, that's just sort of something to know. And they're both saying like, I think it's good on Twitter.

1477
02:43:59,710 --> 02:44:03,610
And Bill, what was it? He had some tweets that was about.

1478
02:44:06,390 --> 02:44:10,020
Oh, I know. It was at the Oscars. The Oscars happened.

1479
02:44:10,770 --> 02:44:17,280
And he basically I don't know how he did this. And this is where I'm like, how much time do you spend doing this?

1480
02:44:17,700 --> 02:44:24,120
Which I said to him before. But he I don't you know, I don't even know how I did this.

1481
02:44:24,120 --> 02:44:31,469
But he did something where he did like the like he pulled out public health findings and like represented graphically,

1482
02:44:31,470 --> 02:44:38,459
like, here's the number of, you know, you know, people who are experiencing homelessness or something.

1483
02:44:38,460 --> 02:44:41,700
And it was like a graph in blue that looked like that or something like that.

1484
02:44:42,060 --> 02:44:45,570
And he mapped it on to everybody's Oscar outfits.

1485
02:44:45,580 --> 02:44:48,750
And so you have like a dress that was like this blue shape of a dress.

1486
02:44:48,750 --> 02:44:55,770
And he had this graph that was like a public health fact graph. And he'd have and he did like ten of these in this tweet.

1487
02:44:56,250 --> 02:45:01,680
And I think that went like insanely viral. And so he, you know, got a lot more of these.

1488
02:45:02,310 --> 02:45:05,490
You know, how many Twitter followers Bill has at this point. But it was so funny.

1489
02:45:05,490 --> 02:45:11,580
And I just was like, okay, that's something I cannot even I just can't even imagine how to pull that all together.

1490
02:45:12,030 --> 02:45:18,060
But I think he's just he's got, like, super creativity and he like, he can see it on his Twitter account.

1491
02:45:18,090 --> 02:45:22,080
So it was a good one to follow for that reason, too. It's just like interesting.

1492
02:45:24,480 --> 02:45:33,809
Oh. And then the final thing I think is that this if you do have like a study that comes out and you feel like this is great,

1493
02:45:33,810 --> 02:45:36,810
I'd love to, like, tweet this out. Totally do that.

1494
02:45:38,280 --> 02:45:46,739
Do it at you because they'll likely tweet up you for you, but have the, you know, check in with the mark on people and say, like,

1495
02:45:46,740 --> 02:45:53,010
I want to do this like news release or study release or like sometimes they'll do it where they feature a study and they'll

1496
02:45:53,010 --> 02:46:00,330
ask you for a quote so that then they can like do that thing where they make it big and they put a link to the paper.

1497
02:46:02,280 --> 02:46:07,220
They just did that to me and I for me and I, but I didn't, I just wasn't,

1498
02:46:07,230 --> 02:46:11,070
I was I dashed off the quote and I wasn't really thinking and I felt like I had a typo or something.

1499
02:46:11,070 --> 02:46:14,160
So I was like, Alison, take a minute to like focus.

1500
02:46:14,880 --> 02:46:24,480
You're doing this and don't do it in a rush. So, okay, so that's like all all this social media stuff, I think.

1501
02:46:24,480 --> 02:46:27,480
But I know it's on Internet just so you have it.

1502
02:46:30,850 --> 02:46:43,900
Uh. Okay. So I think if you guys wanted to sign up for that, you know, I might actually sign up for that training so that I can see what they say.

1503
02:46:47,180 --> 02:46:50,270
So I'm going to vote my mail and see what I just said to you guys.

1504
02:46:53,250 --> 02:46:57,840
It's great. And I. He was like, Don't talk to me.

1505
02:46:57,840 --> 02:47:02,460
Who will write the letter?

1506
02:47:05,980 --> 02:47:09,980
That's what they were allowed to have. Oh, yeah.

1507
02:47:10,430 --> 02:47:14,240
That's what it is. And then it's also like no [INAUDIBLE].

1508
02:47:14,400 --> 02:47:22,760
You know, if they could grab the formula of an agent they didn't want because they're all there set up to say, oh, I see.

1509
02:47:22,760 --> 02:47:27,890
Which is addresses like. But you figure out the guy is a little black.

1510
02:47:29,230 --> 02:47:34,150
Talk to us about this thing. And don't ever you know anybody.

1511
02:47:37,320 --> 02:47:43,330
Mm hmm. I think that's really that's interesting.

1512
02:47:43,330 --> 02:47:48,780
And that is, like, so. Much to avoid all of these.

1513
02:47:49,830 --> 02:47:54,360
And there there the federal government funded. And if you guys like.

1514
02:47:55,790 --> 02:47:56,750
You're too young to.

1515
02:47:57,700 --> 02:48:08,319
First she news cycle about AIDS and act up and but there are some amazing documentaries about this but like he was so in the news in

1516
02:48:08,320 --> 02:48:19,090
the AIDS era in the really in the eighties era of AIDS around not kind of moving fast enough on clinical trials to test medications.

1517
02:48:19,090 --> 02:48:26,900
And so there were so many protests. I think it was just and I was on the hot seat because he was coming in the mix and.

1518
02:48:28,030 --> 02:48:36,930
I wonder if some of that is a reaction to that or other similar kind of events that are just becoming learned over time.

1519
02:48:37,780 --> 02:48:40,960
And I think that's part of the reason that there was another.

1520
02:48:41,430 --> 02:48:44,600
It's about. Oh, yeah. The singer.

1521
02:48:45,650 --> 02:48:49,040
Yeah. Because it used to be open before that.

1522
02:48:55,160 --> 02:48:58,460
Yes. Yeah. I mean, animal researchers like this.

1523
02:48:59,350 --> 02:49:04,270
Goes like triple for animal, you know. Like any any controversial research topic.

1524
02:49:04,270 --> 02:49:08,290
But yeah, I mean, like they're threatening to like a message back to like from day one.

1525
02:49:08,290 --> 02:49:12,010
It's like, do you want your phone number or your personal address on your CB?

1526
02:49:12,460 --> 02:49:17,860
And I would say no, just because you just don't know and like people are.

1527
02:49:19,670 --> 02:49:29,310
People are intense and. I think it's really important to kind of just have a have a plan.

1528
02:49:29,520 --> 02:49:33,720
And so it's kind of nice if your organization's like, no, because then, you know,

1529
02:49:33,780 --> 02:49:41,190
but then if kind of the business of being in public health is like, well, we want to get good stuff out there.

1530
02:49:42,900 --> 02:49:51,080
And I mean, the other big the other kind of big risk, so to speak, is like if you have something kind of like this, like self-regulation, regulation,

1531
02:49:51,120 --> 02:49:56,129
eating thing I was talking about, like I kind of feel like and I have always felt this way,

1532
02:49:56,130 --> 02:50:00,250
but like, let's, let's put the intervention dollars toward something else.

1533
02:50:00,270 --> 02:50:05,040
Like, even though that's like my research area and I've been funded to do a lot of that, I think it was good research to do,

1534
02:50:05,200 --> 02:50:11,429
especially where it's kind of like come to the conclusion of like maybe fund other things now because we've

1535
02:50:11,430 --> 02:50:16,560
done a lot of research on this and like there's some signal that like I think it would be stronger over here.

1536
02:50:17,040 --> 02:50:23,579
That's another important thing and that's really hard. That's like what like Laura Brosnan that does this like disseminator of not dissemination,

1537
02:50:23,580 --> 02:50:27,389
the implementation of things that maybe aren't working as well.

1538
02:50:27,390 --> 02:50:31,680
That's like, a lot harder to figure out how to manage to because.

1539
02:50:33,420 --> 02:50:37,799
You know, you don't want like an intervention to get out there.

1540
02:50:37,800 --> 02:50:42,120
That could be three guys that know that term iatrogenic, like causing harm.

1541
02:50:43,140 --> 02:50:46,410
And so a classic example is like in the eighties and nineties,

1542
02:50:46,410 --> 02:50:52,920
like these peer based interventions with kids who had behavior problems or eating disorders is another good example.

1543
02:50:52,920 --> 02:50:59,640
Like you don't want to necessarily do peer based interventions because in groups of kids who have a lot of behavior problems,

1544
02:51:00,090 --> 02:51:06,749
they might be trading tips about that. Or like people with eating disorders who are in peer based counseling are saying, you know,

1545
02:51:06,750 --> 02:51:10,680
trading tips about how to continue an eating disorder even if you're in serious counseling.

1546
02:51:11,280 --> 02:51:17,339
So those would be I after genic ways to do interventions and so like it could be possible like something gets

1547
02:51:17,340 --> 02:51:23,490
out there in social media is used and maybe it just doesn't work because they didn't do it the way that it was,

1548
02:51:23,670 --> 02:51:28,950
you know, originally designed. And they forgot key elements or the key elements didn't get translated.

1549
02:51:29,610 --> 02:51:34,080
So it's. Complicated for sure. You have to.

1550
02:51:35,410 --> 02:51:39,590
It's like it makes sense. I don't think that you're saying that it out.

1551
02:51:42,340 --> 02:51:45,470
What was that? I think they were. They're kind of.

1552
02:51:50,660 --> 02:51:55,000
Safely in my. Came out on Twitter and like that was giving out.

1553
02:51:55,750 --> 02:51:58,820
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

1554
02:51:59,380 --> 02:52:05,940
Completely jumped to it. Yes. Different than when I thought I knew exactly what they were talking about.

1555
02:52:05,950 --> 02:52:13,670
I didn't even think. What was the quote that they sent in and what does the project?

1556
02:52:13,700 --> 02:52:18,920
There was something like a harm reduction, right? Right. They were not would.

1557
02:52:27,620 --> 02:52:31,500
Yeah, but it was, I guess it was federal funding.

1558
02:52:32,510 --> 02:52:36,530
And so it became a big thing because there are places that have been doing it for a while.

1559
02:52:37,160 --> 02:52:45,270
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. And then people tend to. I was handing out.

1560
02:52:45,300 --> 02:52:48,330
Yeah, I know. I was going to try to find a over. It's interesting.

1561
02:52:48,330 --> 02:52:51,760
And it does. There's a new documentary about how she.

1562
02:52:51,840 --> 02:52:57,800
But there's one called like. Something of truth.

1563
02:52:58,780 --> 02:53:02,860
Dutch embassy. I should.

1564
02:53:07,080 --> 02:53:13,760
She cries, which is. Manufacturers.

1565
02:53:14,340 --> 02:53:18,870
There's something about this, the 40 like story of how he kind of went through this.

1566
02:53:22,070 --> 02:53:27,980
This is thing is really intense. But yeah, I should pull out that example, the harm reduction stuff.

1567
02:53:28,490 --> 02:53:34,690
People go wild and I mean, it's like political capital and it's so sensationalism.

1568
02:53:35,030 --> 02:53:41,509
Like, that's an area where for sure somebody needs to have, like, good media savvy to be able to do that work.

1569
02:53:41,510 --> 02:53:45,890
And like, yeah, when you and I did the Vancouver Seattle record came out,

1570
02:53:46,220 --> 02:53:52,910
it was in the news a few months ago or something for a while, and there was I remember one of the researchers talking about it.

1571
02:53:54,700 --> 02:53:57,519
Because it's like a longer might have been like a fresh air something longer.

1572
02:53:57,520 --> 02:54:01,540
But she had sort of space to kind of give her context and she was like and she was telling stories.

1573
02:54:01,540 --> 02:54:05,290
She was like, I did addiction research for forever.

1574
02:54:05,290 --> 02:54:09,309
And like, addiction treatment and clinics are like, it doesn't work and here's why it doesn't work.

1575
02:54:09,310 --> 02:54:15,020
And then had stories of individuals who like through the harm reduction type methods and.

1576
02:54:16,300 --> 02:54:20,140
Yeah. That's that's a great example of like a really controversial.

1577
02:54:21,000 --> 02:54:24,620
And very central to public health, kind of. Please.

1578
02:54:26,030 --> 02:54:32,989
Let alone all the more overtly political things we did so well.

1579
02:54:32,990 --> 02:54:44,389
I signed up for the for the watch con. Media training so that athletes don't get to meet a multitasker in their next meeting.

1580
02:54:44,390 --> 02:54:55,400
But frankly, I'll look at the video. But yeah, it's really so I think yeah, I think there's like so much around this.

1581
02:54:56,160 --> 02:55:01,950
Space. That's really. Twitter. Yeah, I mean it.

1582
02:55:02,090 --> 02:55:08,230
Yeah. I mean, I think it it's fun to make one and then go, like I said, like kind of, you know.

1583
02:55:08,300 --> 02:55:11,450
Yeah, yeah. I follow people follow Bill, you know.

1584
02:55:12,020 --> 02:55:15,830
But in my mind, I was going for Macs and so.

1585
02:55:18,510 --> 02:55:25,680
Oh, yeah. He's on Twitter. Yeah, he does. Yeah, I should add him right now, but.

1586
02:55:26,120 --> 02:55:30,949
Mm hmm. Yeah, I think it's good.

1587
02:55:30,950 --> 02:55:34,609
And, you know, clearly, like an information finding thing.

1588
02:55:34,610 --> 02:55:42,470
So, like, if there's something coming out in your space and you follow certain people or hashtags, and you kind of like if you.

1589
02:55:42,620 --> 02:55:47,720
Yeah. Create one and then follow and they can see like what he's tweet tweeting out and.

1590
02:55:49,850 --> 02:55:53,030
Yeah, I think it is. You know, I don't like go there.

1591
02:55:53,030 --> 02:56:00,320
I think I get I don't know what you mean or you're like, I don't know how to be.

1592
02:56:03,660 --> 02:56:07,110
I want to make. Oh, yeah, I think.

1593
02:56:07,110 --> 02:56:13,210
Yeah, that's good. So then you can just. Oh. Yeah.

1594
02:56:13,490 --> 02:56:16,550
I've definitely gotten lost and I'm not sure.

1595
02:56:16,730 --> 02:56:24,810
But like I said, there's really not professional. So really dramatic effect.

1596
02:56:25,850 --> 02:56:38,620
So I. Some of the things I follow too, are like people who are like, I'm living the, you know, like a lot of this colonial stuff around.

1597
02:56:38,620 --> 02:56:44,800
Like, I live in Georgia and I. Teaching critical race theory and like, what do I do?

1598
02:56:45,310 --> 02:56:47,290
And then I'll be like all these, you know?

1599
02:56:48,870 --> 02:56:55,310
But if it doesn't get picked up by the local control people, then there's like really helpful, thoughtful responses.

1600
02:56:55,650 --> 02:57:02,520
So thing I do, I think probably people who are feeling like isolated to really more and it's a really important context for.

1601
02:57:07,930 --> 02:57:13,090
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1602
02:57:13,420 --> 02:57:20,840
And, um, again, I don't know the mechanics behind the lightning and everything you can see.

1603
02:57:24,690 --> 02:57:27,810
You know, I don't have a private.

1604
02:57:35,420 --> 02:57:41,780
I think it's like. I think he was interviewed by somebody about something.

1605
02:57:41,780 --> 02:57:44,780
And that's what. It's like, Oh, yeah, I just found him.

1606
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:48,270
Like, it's a series of, oh my God, now, I don't know.

1607
02:57:48,340 --> 02:57:52,300
Like, it's not my professional life.

1608
02:57:53,660 --> 02:57:57,160
It's like, Oh, right, cool.

1609
02:57:57,180 --> 02:58:00,920
Well, we will, I guess, but next week.

1610
02:58:04,010 --> 02:58:10,550
Next. Next week is weeks.

1611
02:58:10,690 --> 02:58:15,920
Oh, next week we'll do research topics. And then we'll have Christine.

1612
02:58:22,370 --> 02:58:28,120
All right. Well, we should.

1613
02:58:31,900 --> 02:58:43,630
For sure. From time to time you can get very, very just to make sure that it was going in the opposite direction so that.

1614
02:58:47,050 --> 02:58:50,860
Yes. And I mean, that's think we're.

1615
02:58:50,860 --> 02:58:58,530
Well, you know what if they were on a sunny. We did write out some.

1616
02:58:58,610 --> 02:59:04,330
Yeah, that's perfect. Thank you. Would you mind looking at something from Feinstein for people.

1617
02:59:32,530 --> 02:59:44,870
If. You know, we got to get this through.

1618
02:59:45,850 --> 02:59:59,390
We've got. He was among those five other leaders who.
