1
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:27,030
I mean. Hey, good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:32,580
Welcome back, hope you had a restful, enjoyable, relaxing Oliver.

3
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:40,410
Winter break, I guess without sharing any details that anybody get to escape the great cold of Michigan.

4
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:45,300
Hey, congratulations, excellent. You can like we are. Thanks.

5
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:52,620
Maybe living vicariously through those of you that got the excuse that it's still so cold and great.

6
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,630
Come on, give us a break already. All right.

7
00:00:56,630 --> 00:01:01,350
Uh, environmental, health and policy. So our agenda for today?

8
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:06,240
Well, this is going to be kind of a new structure for the next several class periods

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,260
where I will present maybe some base level material around our case study today.

10
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:20,310
It's going to be drinking water quality specifically led in water in Flint, Michigan.

11
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:24,240
And then I have there's a short video that we can watch.

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,100
We'll go ahead and do our kind of like five minute, you know, middle class period break.

13
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:34,200
And then when we resume, we'll have our student led discussion.

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:39,420
So any any questions before we get going for today? Okay.

15
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:45,510
None. And then any questions at all just about because I was looking at the schedule, I was looking at the syllabus.

16
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:51,640
This doesn't make sense. Clarification. All right.

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:58,690
Well, as you come across those or come up with those questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me and let me know.

18
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:09,730
All right. So first off, I posted this article last evening that I came across kind of as an ESPN the news topic,

19
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:21,940
and it's around the amount of time of COVID related medical waste that is being generated globally.

20
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:28,390
As part of the pandemic, medical waste was already an issue prior to the pandemic.

21
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:34,780
With COVID, it's now even more of an issue. So maybe you had a chance to look at the article?

22
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:41,680
Maybe not. But even if not, let's go ahead and step through this process just out loud.

23
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:49,180
What are some of the environmental health policy related issues that come to mind through any

24
00:02:49,180 --> 00:03:02,090
point of this process related to medical waste and specifically the layering on related to COVID?

25
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:09,540
Well, for one, it's a biohazard experience like not just plastic and pollution, but for people of Typekit office down the road.

26
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,360
It's not the kind of stuff I mean potentially could be infectious material as a hazard.

27
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:25,100
And so absolutely. So we're dealing with potentially infectious related hazards in addition to the simple kind of pollution context.

28
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:32,730
Excellent. What else? Yeah. So depending on where things are done, it's like where water levels are.

29
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:38,730
Absolutely. So, yes, there's there's trash you might physically see it or be able to count it.

30
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:44,310
You know, the article title is the same times, similar in the article it has how many times it's so huge.

31
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:51,000
Impressive number, of course. But then what happens to it writes, are things that maybe leach from it.

32
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,160
Maybe it partially degrades. Where does it go? Good one.

33
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:06,990
What else comes to mind? Kind of related to the biohazard comment like just that in the beginning,

34
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:13,620
we didn't really understand like how infectious things were like what could or could not be reused appropriately,

35
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,540
and that just created such a larger volume of waste that it isn't normal circumstance.

36
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,750
Yeah. So single use, right? Like use it once and and throw it away and don't even think about we're using it.

37
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:29,610
Absolutely. I feel your hands are kind of like, where is it going? Like, How is it being disposed of?

38
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:39,300
Like, it even says, come at the bottom of they're like, is it being burned like disposed of in like a proper like biohazard manner?

39
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,640
Like, who was able to like, dispose of it in like the proper way?

40
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:52,860
Absolutely. So this was an issue prior to COVID, right, is how to manage medical related waste.

41
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:58,080
And it's even more of an issue now, adding Koven on top. And we can talk about Burger so far.

42
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:08,700
We're talking about the environment, right? How it's impacting our water supply, you know, plastics, all these other things, infectious components.

43
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,330
But you know, this person is actually sorting through it, right?

44
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:18,270
So think about it from an occupational perspective and through all of the many processes of this where,

45
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:24,740
you know, occupational hazards come into play and policies related to that.

46
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:32,630
Any others that the folks can think of? Disparities and life.

47
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:37,450
Yes, where things are being done this time is not really poor countries.

48
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,560
Absolutely.

49
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:49,750
It's us sending our trash overseas to that great point, and this was one of the primary points of the article if you had a chance to look at it.

50
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,190
And this is nothing new, right?

51
00:05:51,190 --> 00:06:01,930
Unfortunately, is that in wealthier countries that are consuming the most products and then looking to dispose of them or even recycle them,

52
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:10,900
they're often ending up in in less wealthy countries that are left to deal with it and less able to deal with it, honestly.

53
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:20,350
And so the addition of COVID and all of the additional medical related waste that has come with it is basically adding that burden onto those same,

54
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:28,290
you know, low income countries and in increasing that disparity, that's in place.

55
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:39,910
Any other just comments for those of you got a chance to look at the article, any other comments or reactions?

56
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:46,210
And they kind of goes to show that, like, I think a lot of people kind of like parallels to climate change,

57
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:53,020
to how COVID was like a quick moving disaster and climate change is a slow moving disaster, and then it kind of goes to show the link.

58
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:59,380
COVID probably is only exacerbated the previous issues that we had, and it is not an easy solution to that.

59
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:04,700
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. I agree with your context there.

60
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:11,140
Uh, it's not a it's not a new problem that we didn't know about. It's making an existing problem worse.

61
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:20,140
But then also just kind of highlighting that it's a challenge and it's going to continue to be heard for quite a while, right?

62
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:20,440
All right.

63
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:28,660
So I'll conclude by just reminding you, if you come across articles that are that are interesting, please don't hesitate them to shoot them my way.

64
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,310
I'll make a little slide. We can discuss it for a few minutes at the beginning of class.

65
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,630
All right, let's move on to our topic for today.

66
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:52,240
As I mentioned, we're talking about letting drinking water and specifically around Flint a little bit of background before we focus in on Flint.

67
00:07:52,240 --> 00:08:02,380
This is looking at this. A couple of pieces of information here. So starting over here on the right, historically or typically, uh,

68
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:16,300
there are disparities based on income of how people are impacted by different environmental contaminants or, in this case, chemical hazards.

69
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:25,810
And so actually, people with more wealth or higher income are impacted at greater rates for certain chemicals.

70
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:37,640
Some of the per fluorinated compounds BP three mercury arsenic all actually impact higher income folks to a greater extent.

71
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:45,040
So we're going to talk about Mercury as a case study in itself, and I think maybe three weeks out.

72
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:52,900
But in that case, you know, Mercury, a lot of the exposure comes from high levels of mercury in seafood, right?

73
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:59,320
So seafood as a source of sustenance tends to cost more.

74
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,540
Right. Compared to other food sources.

75
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:08,260
So it's really with people with more wealth or higher income that are in position to buy that seafood in the first place.

76
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:19,480
So in those cases, there's higher mercury exposures in general and folks with higher income historically for cadmium and lead,

77
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:23,380
the burden has been borne on lower income, folks. Right.

78
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:29,950
Well, I think there's a slight coming in in a minute or two looking at the history more recently,

79
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:35,590
where low income housing that has lead in paint, for example,

80
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:47,060
right, as a as a source in a lot of residential settings for exposure to lead this table over here on the left, and that's a little bit hard to see.

81
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:52,030
The font size is pretty small, but it's it's a really cool study.

82
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:58,660
It's bold at this point. It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine back in 1983.

83
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:04,930
But one of the reasons why I like it is it's from one of our emeritus faculty here in Environmental Health Sciences,

84
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:16,750
Jerome Ragout, who is one of the most widely published researchers in the world around lead contamination and led exposures.

85
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:25,000
And he postulated in this paper that lead poisoning could have contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire two thousand years ago.

86
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,740
And through his analysis, his exposure estimates that he came up with.

87
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:37,840
You looked at kind of the aristocrats with the Libyans and any kind of slaves, slave know income going from high to low and this table.

88
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:43,270
And it was really his estimates of wine consumption right at the high income

89
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:49,660
folks had access to that contributed to this huge increase in light exposure.

90
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:56,890
So in this case, it's actually reversed. Right. It's it's an example of potentially high levels of exposure,

91
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:04,990
more disparate exposures in the high income group and perhaps that contributed to the fall of the Roman Empire.

92
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:13,750
We're talking about health effects here in a minute. So fast forward two thousand years we talked about lead in paint,

93
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:22,450
so older homes were led is the paint is kind of chipping away and there's paint chips that fall to the ground,

94
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:26,380
primarily children, small children who spend a lot of time on the ground.

95
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,600
There's land in these dust particles,

96
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:38,700
all of the hand-to-mouth action that's very common in small children contributing to lead being ingested in this case.

97
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:53,160
There are abatement strategies in place in terms of policy, housing policy, letting gasoline in this country back in the 1970s.

98
00:11:53,160 --> 00:12:01,230
We were purposefully adding lead to gasoline can then be burned in cars can then come

99
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:06,480
out the exhaust pipe and to be very efficiently distributed throughout the environment.

100
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:16,500
Terrible. Right? So yes. So the good news is, is that we realize this land as an additive in fuels is now banned.

101
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:22,890
It was added because it basically increase the efficiency of combustion, the combustion process in cars.

102
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:29,490
But we we that in terms of the health impact and made the call to actually remove it.

103
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:40,770
Lead is no longer added to gasoline and hasn't been for the last several decades led in aging municipal water systems.

104
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:51,720
Right. So a lot of the infrastructure in this country is aging with regards to municipal water infrastructure.

105
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,780
There are lead pipes,

106
00:12:54,780 --> 00:13:12,210
lead solder and so forth that over time is able to leach out of the water and into the water and be present in drinking water for cooking,

107
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:25,620
drinking, even bathing. And so this is where we kind of move into where our case study run point today, a little bit of background on Flint.

108
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:36,120
So going back to 2014, the city was not doing well financially as part of being faced with bankruptcy.

109
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:46,350
The state appointed an emergency manager who had all kinds of authority around financial decision making.

110
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:50,040
As part of that was a little bit of background about water.

111
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:59,760
For many decades, Flint had received the source of its water from the City of Detroit Water and Sewage Department,

112
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:05,550
which actually sourced the water from Lake Huron, which is a relatively good, good source of drinking water.

113
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:09,570
And this is actually pretty common. It's not specific to Flint. To this day,

114
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:13,920
many communities that kind of surround metropolitan Detroit still receive their

115
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,370
their water through a contract from the Detroit Water and Sewage Department.

116
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:26,400
As part of this, this pending bankruptcy and the powers of this emergency manager.

117
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:37,230
The decision was made to to save some money to switch the source of water for drinking for the municipal system from Lake Huron,

118
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:45,900
contracted through the city of Detroit to the Flint River, which actually winds right through the community.

119
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:55,230
And this was meant to be very temporary because there was already in place a new pipeline that was being built

120
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:01,980
from Lake Huron straight to Flint so that they would no longer need to contract with the city of Detroit,

121
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:09,150
that this would be within their own hands and also saving money going forward.

122
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:17,580
So it was meant to be a very temporary measure until this new pipeline would be put into place in 2016.

123
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:28,280
Really quickly after that switch was made and sourced, water from Lake Huron through the City of Detroit contract to the Flint River residents,

124
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,320
the game began to notice the very drastic differences in the color of the water.

125
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:44,760
The odor of the water. How it tasted, as well as how it affected skin through lake rashes and so forth.

126
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:51,870
First, there were bacteria detected in that municipal water to levels that resulted

127
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:58,800
in violations of the Safe Water Drinking Act in response to that bacteria.

128
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:06,540
There was additional disinfection measures put into place generally with chlorination as the option for disinfection.

129
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:15,360
And as a result of that, some of the byproducts of that chlorination resulted in increased levels of trace of methane,

130
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:22,490
which was yet another violation of the Safe Water Drinking Act.

131
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:28,910
So now shifting more specifically to back to lead in terms of its impact on our health,

132
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:38,900
it's long been known well prior to this event and Flint that it impacts developmental and biological processes,

133
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:46,130
primarily outcomes related to intelligence behaviors and even outcomes for overall life achievement.

134
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:59,180
The more exposure you are to lead lesser levels of intelligence, increase in adverse behavior and then lower overall life achievement.

135
00:16:59,180 --> 00:16:59,660
This has,

136
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:10,910
as we already started to talk about disproportionate impacts for land on low income communities and children and especially minority children,

137
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:22,360
and highly. Unfortunately, the effects of that exposure to lead are, for the most part, irreversible in terms of impact on health.

138
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:35,140
So that brings us to blood lead levels in Flint, so this is looking at a comparison of blood lead levels.

139
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:45,580
But before that switch in the water source, so kind of the orange color to post the switch in the water source and the yellow,

140
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,890
I guess in Ann Arbor, we call it Mays Call Caller, perhaps.

141
00:17:50,890 --> 00:18:01,300
And you can see it starts over here on the left is looking at outside of the Flint community, relatively low levels right compared to the other three.

142
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:10,360
And then it's passing those blood lead level data by measures of lead in the water itself.

143
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:17,650
So in areas where there were high water lead levels in the municipal drinking water right,

144
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:24,700
it resulted in the highest levels of letting for very logical and makes perfect sense, right?

145
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:30,970
And then kind of looking specifically at the pre and post water switch, right?

146
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:35,800
It's basically doubling or tripling in terms of the blood.

147
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:42,880
So over a very short time period.

148
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:51,730
Basically the same data, but just looking at it spatially, and it's showing that it's really in kind of the heart of this city,

149
00:18:51,730 --> 00:19:06,570
the oldest infrastructure, which happens to be the lowest income, the highest minority population in terms of specifically child blood lead levels.

150
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:17,300
And again, that's after this, which I wanted to highlight really quickly, I was able to to be a participant to actually lead.

151
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:23,780
I was the pi of a project that was funded by US CPA as an environmental education grant.

152
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:29,660
It was very short. It was only one year back in 2016 and 2017.

153
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:34,100
And interestingly, it was there was an RFA put out by us EPA.

154
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:42,950
We responded to it and our project was the only one funded. So this is like a couple of years after this event had occurred.

155
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:47,720
The community is just crying for help, right?

156
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,700
And you know, a couple of years later, EPA finally gets around to pointing out and we're like,

157
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:58,550
OK, how can we fund great efforts to get in there and and help this community?

158
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:05,300
And, you know, we were happy to receive the funding. We were disappointed. We were the only ones to receive funding.

159
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:14,900
So the project was titled See for Yourself and we partnered with community based organizations Endpoint as big as like the Genesee

160
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:25,100
County Health Department and some of the health systems to like faith based organizations in different locations within Flint.

161
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,050
And the goals of the project were really to were several fold,

162
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:37,610
but it was to increase environmental literacy on all aspects as many aspects as we could around.

163
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:47,600
Where does their drinking water come from? Where are the opportunities for it to be good quality or low quality?

164
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,100
And we targeted specifically not just community members, but students.

165
00:20:53,100 --> 00:21:00,590
So the 12 students with the hope that we can educate the children, right,

166
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:07,210
that they will be bringing that information home in addition to, you know, in general, it's always a good thing to educate children.

167
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:18,920
So and then, you know, hopefully encourage actions and behaviors that enhance local water quality,

168
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,150
improve their own water quality, decrease exposures.

169
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,440
And again, this was the only study funded by US EPA.

170
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:33,980
So we were basically tasked with as you designed this program,

171
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:39,590
don't just have it be beneficial to Flint created so that it's a model that could

172
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:45,980
be transferable to to another community or other communities going forward.

173
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:54,470
So we work with five community based partners to sponsor a series of face to face experiential trainings across Flint.

174
00:21:54,470 --> 00:22:06,110
These were recorded and made available on the web. And like I said, it focused on water quality, the drinking water delivery system, if you will.

175
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:11,420
If we turn on the faucet and we we kind of take it for granted, right?

176
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:17,120
We have access to to clean water, to fresh water, to save water for all of its uses.

177
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,510
And when it's no longer safe, it's it's kind of like this mysterious black box, right?

178
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:30,950
Like what the heck is going on that's making that faucet that I've counted on, you know, forever to be safe, to no longer be safe.

179
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:43,550
So really, there were some, some aspects of water quality that the drinking water delivery system, how you sample water, right?

180
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:49,430
What types of things you test for. And once you get results, how do you interpret those results?

181
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:54,620
There was a lot of free testing going on at the time, a lot of filters being distributed, right.

182
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:00,890
So learning about kind of the science behind how helpful are things if you can get that free testing?

183
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:09,530
Here's a report. But if there's nobody there to help interpret what that data, what those numbers mean, it's just not very helpful, right?

184
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:15,370
So we we aimed the program around that and then, yeah, I'll talk about that.

185
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,720
I have some photos here in a minute.

186
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:25,370
We've worked with students to build this physical scale model to actually help community members kind of visualize how

187
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:34,880
a municipal water system works and specifically how it works in Flint prior to it reaching that attack in their home.

188
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,920
So, yeah, so this is here's that scale model. Here's the water tower.

189
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:50,060
Here's the street with the homes inside, there's faucets that people turn on, but it was basically built over kind of an aquarium tank.

190
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:55,370
They showed all of the underground distribution, right? Where's that water coming from?

191
00:23:55,370 --> 00:24:01,700
Where are the means? How does it connect right there? We're talking about contaminated pipes at different locations, right?

192
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:05,450
So if it's contaminated upstream, then it's.

193
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:14,420
Reaching all of the households, right? If if the source of the contamination is on your street, then it's only affecting a much more vocal group.

194
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,630
So being able to walk through the infected ahead, you know, water with a little bit of dying and you could,

195
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:24,660
you know, push a button and you see the water flow through the system and so forth.

196
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:32,390
And neither does pictures of of some of the kind of environmental education sessions that were held

197
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:40,610
during this time with with residents from from different areas of the city and again utilizing those,

198
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:50,090
you know, these were held at that at churches, right? Or at different local health communities that people were already familiar and trustworthy.

199
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:54,260
I think, yeah, I think that was, I think, into my slides.

200
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,470
I you have a video here that I want us to watch together.

201
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:04,010
Any questions and I'm actually going to be hesitant to answer them because I don't want to step on the toes of our, ah, student led discussion.

202
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:11,690
That's coming, but any any questions and what's been presented so far. All right.

203
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:39,290
Let me see if I can pull up this video. The preloaded this.

204
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:51,700
So let's see. Quick background, This is a 60 Minutes segment that's about a year ago, so it's relatively updated.

205
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,960
I think it's about 30 minutes long, so we'll go ahead and watch it together.

206
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:02,740
I'll do a volume check here in a minute and make sure that we everybody can hear my father.

207
00:26:02,740 --> 00:34:50,170
You. It's.

208
00:34:50,170 --> 00:39:25,320
This. So let's see a couple quick comments.

209
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:31,110
So Sandra Jones was a member of our Project Steering Committee, which she's fantastic.

210
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:38,760
Dr. Mona, who coincidentally is a graduate of this School of Public Health.

211
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:46,650
The slides that we were looking at the data, the blood donor level, right, those were her publications, her data that she released ahead of time.

212
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:53,100
I have a little bit of editorial on that. They're going to ask her like, you know you, you broke the rules.

213
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,680
Actually, not. Not really.

214
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:10,560
Their research that involves human subjects or human subject samples goes through an institutional review board on i IRB review,

215
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:14,610
and it needs to be approved the protocol that this study is going to follow.

216
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:21,480
And it's actually in there that says that if there is something learned as part of the study or as part

217
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:30,540
of the analysis where there's known harm being done like in real time to specifically to those subjects,

218
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:38,490
but even more broadly, the public, uh, you are expected to come forth with that information prior to,

219
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:43,990
you know, waiting until the final analysis either done or for it to be reviewed by somebody and so forth.

220
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:52,950
So in terms of IRB, she did exactly what anyone doing health related research should do.

221
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,620
Uh, I thought it was a great synopsis.

222
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:09,280
I thought it was worth watching here. Any any questions before we before we break and kind of get ready for our student led discussion.

223
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,400
Yeah. I don't know. I'm an optimist, explores here with, um.

224
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:23,210
Yeah, I don't know if anyone else is in this class it, but it is interesting to hear more about like that and sort of like aspects of this.

225
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:29,690
Yeah. And what this could mean even for women who have not yet have children and like the epigenetic impacts of that.

226
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:34,420
And I was wondering if, you know, if there's any sort of research that's been happening.

227
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:40,090
I mean, they are looking at like children in utero, but look even more so like that.

228
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:48,010
Sure. Yeah. Yeah, it's it's a couple, a couple of responses one.

229
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:53,540
I mean, they're highlight, you know, they're interviewing Dr. Mode as they're holding her research.

230
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,520
They're we're talking about the teeth, right? There's forty nine teeth being analyzed.

231
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,060
This is like a drop in the bucket. You know, type stuff, right?

232
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:07,630
And that's expensive. So it costs money to do relatively small studies.

233
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:13,690
So what needs to be done are much larger studies, which you know, most,

234
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:22,780
most large scale public health research utilizes data convenience, right, like the end, you know, long term data collection.

235
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:29,890
And hey, we can after the fact to look back and do, some do some analyzes.

236
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:38,950
Obviously, yes, there needs to be much more done on this and then that this is a little more of a commentary that I think Dr. Mona was getting at.

237
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:43,930
But I'll I'll highlight it was such a short time period, right?

238
00:42:43,930 --> 00:42:48,340
And such a what we're thought of as a very minor decision to save.

239
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:52,810
Relatively speaking, not that much money. And oh my gosh.

240
00:42:52,810 --> 00:43:01,110
Right. That the effects were not just what happened in that brief period of switching.

241
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:06,640
It's like you mentioned Victoria. It's you know, the word. This story was seven years after the fact.

242
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:17,770
We're now eight years after the fact, and they're still like new programs being created to try to address the issue just in this one community, right?

243
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:26,410
We we know that it was a problem there because data was actually collected, samples were analyzed and it was reported.

244
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:33,190
And you know, like Dr. Mona alluded to, they referenced the um, the Newark, New Jersey.

245
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:39,800
Right. This is the aging infrastructure across this country, and it's going to continue to be an issue.

246
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:46,960
They put a dollar figure right on replacing the pipes just in Flint. It's like three hundred million dollars.

247
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:53,440
There's a current case unfolding on the city and the state's west side in Benton Harbor,

248
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,880
where there are high levels of lead exposure that have been going on for a couple

249
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:02,410
of years now and trying to address that same type of the response responses,

250
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:08,500
bottled water, like the numbers, we're talking about the medical waste, right, just few minutes ago on a tonnage related to that.

251
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:15,190
This is like a community of, I don't know, depending on whether you're like the city proper or the greater Flint area,

252
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:22,480
like between 50 and 100 thousand people, right, like relatively small and a huge percent of these people are using,

253
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:29,290
you know, half liter bottled water as their source for everything drinking, cooking, bathing,

254
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:36,590
etc. Anyway, I'll start with the editorial that any other, any other comments or questions.

255
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:43,510
There's no question about more, like the biomechanics of legs. So I know for the kids those are the adrenaline because blood level,

256
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:50,050
but like we're going to accumulate over chronic exposure to look at the bone bone, but they're not in bone.

257
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:54,910
I mean, is looking at lifetime like osteoporosis often and people like to lose bone density.

258
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,500
Is there any evidence that like low that it can start in bone can then get re mobilized?

259
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,310
Absolutely. Yeah. Now this is this is the problem, right?

260
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:11,950
Is that and this is why it's uh, even if it's an acute exposure, it can be a chronic effect, right?

261
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:19,880
Because it has accumulated and now it can basically leach out for a long time and continue to impact, you know, organ systems and so forth.

262
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,580
Yeah. Kind of going along with that is the SEER registry in Detroit like that?

263
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:33,970
How many people were like from Flint? And it's like because I know this is a registry, so it does not gather information from childhood.

264
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:41,110
Yes. And I confused. And so potentially in like 10 years we could already see or 20 years or however

265
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:44,660
many years sure to be getting all sorts of different forms of cancer as well,

266
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:53,440
I guess, right? And you know, looking looking way out, I mean, led specifically isn't necessarily looked at as being carcinogenic.

267
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,390
It's more related to kind of the neuro toxicity of it.

268
00:45:58,390 --> 00:46:03,010
But yes, you're right. I mean, just from the, you know, the chronic long term and those, you know,

269
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:08,670
those outcomes like overall life achievement, you can't measure that into, like very far into the future.

270
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:21,030
Right to even begin to to assess it. Any other comments or questions?

271
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:29,070
All right, so, yeah, there's a lot to unpack here, and I'm happy that we can just stop here and save a lot of that topic for further discussion.

272
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:38,280
Let's see. It is one eight. Let's go ahead and take our five minutes reconvene like one fifty four, let's say.

273
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:52,758
And I'll invite the group to come up and get set up however you need to, and I'm here to help.

274
00:46:57,289 --> 00:47:03,409
The floor is yours, if you can.

275
00:47:03,409 --> 00:47:31,319
Yeah, I think we're ready to get started. OK, so we have our presentation on the Flint water crisis.

276
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:38,789
So just like a little bit deeper about some health impacts of the Flint water or of lead and water.

277
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:48,869
Short term impacts are abdominal pain, headaches, constipation, loss of appetite, memory loss or pain and tingling in your hands and feet.

278
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:53,519
And then also pregnant mothers can expose the child to their unborn children,

279
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:59,429
damaging their nervous system and affecting baby's behavior and intelligence.

280
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:03,959
It can also cause miscarriages, stillbirths and infertility.

281
00:48:03,959 --> 00:48:10,319
Prolonged exposure to lead can cause high blood pressure, heart disease and kidney disease.

282
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:20,579
And then children exposed are also at risk of lower IQ scores, developmental delays and behavioral issues during and after the lead exposure.

283
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:26,129
And then from a survey done on Flint Adult Residents, there is a reports of lots of skin rashes,

284
00:48:26,129 --> 00:48:33,239
hair loss, depression, anxiety and also PTSD from the crisis.

285
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:41,579
And then so Flint, as a city, it's about fifty seven percent black population, thirty seven percent white and four percent Latino,

286
00:48:41,579 --> 00:48:45,809
and then more than 40 percent of the population lives below the poverty level.

287
00:48:45,809 --> 00:48:52,199
So the black population in Flint represented a substantial burden of the excess cases of harmful

288
00:48:52,199 --> 00:49:00,049
and physical or harmful physical and mental health outcomes from the blood in their water,

289
00:49:00,049 --> 00:49:06,299
or almost double the amount of black adults in Flint reported skin rashes and

290
00:49:06,299 --> 00:49:12,569
other harmful effects compared to white respondents in a certain survey done.

291
00:49:12,569 --> 00:49:18,029
Many people believe that there's also implicit biases on older cities in poverty,

292
00:49:18,029 --> 00:49:24,819
with majority minority communities such as flight that allowed the crisis to happen and go on for so long.

293
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:31,679
And there is this tweet from the president of the and and ACP that said environmental

294
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:41,789
racism plus indifference equals will head in the water and blood poisoning Flint's water.

295
00:49:41,789 --> 00:49:51,029
So we found this video the box made basically just sound like a quick overview of how the water became contaminated,

296
00:49:51,029 --> 00:50:08,919
how the city was before and after. And I just think it's more engaging and entertaining than just speaking the images of power.

297
00:50:08,919 --> 00:53:40,239
I. Oh.

298
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:45,549
Sorry, that stuff happened, so.

299
00:53:45,549 --> 00:53:52,999
Switching gears to the legal side. The class action lawsuit that was briefly mentioned at the end of the video, a little bit of background.

300
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:57,339
It was called Cohen's Middlesteins Flint Water Crisis Class Action Lawsuit.

301
00:53:57,339 --> 00:54:01,689
And like the video said, the whole thing happened in an effort to save money for Flint.

302
00:54:01,689 --> 00:54:06,279
Flint water supply was switched over to the Flint River while waiting for here on River Pump to be built.

303
00:54:06,279 --> 00:54:11,559
This led to several events that caused nearly 8000 small children permanently harmed by the lead and

304
00:54:11,559 --> 00:54:16,659
over thirty thousand of the city's housing units rendered worthless due to damage and unsafe pipes.

305
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:21,999
And just damage overall like their houses were just quite literally disgusting.

306
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:26,949
In 2016, the initial lawsuit was filed against Lockwood Andrews and Newman and Viola,

307
00:54:26,949 --> 00:54:33,129
who were professionals in the water and piping business and gave terrible advice about switching to the Flint water system.

308
00:54:33,129 --> 00:54:40,119
On top of that, the rotting pipes. These businesses also suggested doubling the water systems dose of fat chloride,

309
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:43,899
which is a highly acidic chemical, which only made the situation worse.

310
00:54:43,899 --> 00:54:50,019
The class action complaints were filed against Allen, which was black, but Andrews and Newman Viola,

311
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:58,869
Gov. Rick Snyder of the City of Flint and their officials and the state of Michigan, and then how that had ended.

312
00:54:58,869 --> 00:55:04,989
It was kind of interesting. It granted in part and denied in part the defendant's motion to dismiss,

313
00:55:04,989 --> 00:55:10,119
stating that certain government officials disregarded the risk of the water posed an increasingly clear threat.

314
00:55:10,119 --> 00:55:16,329
The public face protected themselves with bottled water and rejected solutions that would have ended the crisis sooner.

315
00:55:16,329 --> 00:55:20,169
An important point that I thought was interesting. It narrowed certain elements of the suit,

316
00:55:20,169 --> 00:55:28,479
including dismissing allegations against Gov. Rick Snyder with Leave to amend the complaint and as of November of last year.

317
00:55:28,479 --> 00:55:36,379
So it's pretty recent. The federal judge agreed to six hundred and twenty six point five million in civil lawsuit settlement.

318
00:55:36,379 --> 00:55:40,239
And these people that were paying or charged was the state of Michigan.

319
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:43,959
I think City of Flint officials and private contractors that were mentioned in the last

320
00:55:43,959 --> 00:55:49,599
slide while other lawsuits still prevailed against former former governor Rick Snyder.

321
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:54,159
Today, I know an example is the one I listed Carson versus Snyder,

322
00:55:54,159 --> 00:56:02,859
and their position was that Rick Snyder knew that these populations are particularly poor neighborhoods was suffering,

323
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:05,829
and while he was aware of this,

324
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:12,969
he didn't really seem to care about it because it wasn't like his white counterparts and there was evidence to back that up.

325
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:18,309
I know there's more cases against him, but that one was specific, specifically interesting to me,

326
00:56:18,309 --> 00:56:24,519
and I think that's still in motion because he hasn't, as far as I know, been charged of anything yet.

327
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:29,409
OK, so kind of getting more into something like the law aspect and policy aspect,

328
00:56:29,409 --> 00:56:33,399
kind of like Carney was talking about with some of the class action lawsuits.

329
00:56:33,399 --> 00:56:38,649
There's actually a current ongoing lawsuit filed by four children have been

330
00:56:38,649 --> 00:56:44,349
shown to have neurologic damage because of their exposure to lead in Flint.

331
00:56:44,349 --> 00:56:54,429
And so they're filing against viola and land and then also a company called Laddy, which is the agency, the Leo, a daily company.

332
00:56:54,429 --> 00:57:04,329
And so basically, that's more trying to show that the these court corporations were committing professional negligence

333
00:57:04,329 --> 00:57:09,519
and specifically with Viola to kind of give you the sort of like history and background.

334
00:57:09,519 --> 00:57:17,619
There was actually a third party vendor that was hired by the Flint Lake city government to like study

335
00:57:17,619 --> 00:57:24,429
like how to improve like water quality data and like the water quality of like drinking water in Flint.

336
00:57:24,429 --> 00:57:28,269
And so they did like a full scale like water quality analysis.

337
00:57:28,269 --> 00:57:33,789
And so even though they like sound and like understood that the drinking water

338
00:57:33,789 --> 00:57:38,739
wasn't necessarily safe for residents to consume and that they like corrosion,

339
00:57:38,739 --> 00:57:43,359
they recommended like corrosion measures to like, mediate the issue.

340
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:47,199
They didn't really include it in their final report to the city,

341
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:53,289
but they did mention it like briefly, that like this is something that they want to look at.

342
00:57:53,289 --> 00:58:03,219
But ultimately, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality said that no likeness measures were necessary to remedy corrosion control.

343
00:58:03,219 --> 00:58:07,689
And so like and so the professional negligence it's like they're looking into.

344
00:58:07,689 --> 00:58:17,589
If basically Viola had a duty to, you know, like, really push that the city like, fix the corroding like pipelines.

345
00:58:17,589 --> 00:58:22,119
And so it's like it gets into a little bit of the weeds, which I'm not going to get into.

346
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:28,959
But like, it found that in 2014, because Viola was also contracted by the city of Flint,

347
00:58:28,959 --> 00:58:40,209
like for another project that they didn't have any duty like in that year, but then in 2015, when Flint officially switched over to the Flint.

348
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:51,069
River, that that Viola had a duty to let them know, but unfortunately in the have know,

349
00:58:51,069 --> 00:59:00,129
it claims that imposing this duty could actually have some Lake Lake native drawbacks because they say

350
00:59:00,129 --> 00:59:07,779
that it will violate Lake Professional Lake companies that offer services to lake public to public,

351
00:59:07,779 --> 00:59:12,369
the public sector, silver example lake water drinking water.

352
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:22,659
And they said that like it violates lake public policy and like letting them not be necessarily like they don't have a duty because then in theory,

353
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:29,249
they will have a duty to all residents of the U.S. So it's just that's like if you want to get into Lake, the more lethal stuff like you look it up.

354
00:59:29,249 --> 00:59:38,259
But yeah, it's a lot to explain. But yeah, and so but the there's an article from the Detroit Free Press that covers that right now.

355
00:59:38,259 --> 00:59:43,899
It's actually like the trial is ongoing. Before, it was just a summary judgment and that moved forward.

356
00:59:43,899 --> 00:59:53,109
So yeah, on March 1st, that's when they started introducing their evidence and starting and giving their case for that.

357
00:59:53,109 --> 01:00:05,109
So. So for like overall water policy in the US as a whole.

358
01:00:05,109 --> 01:00:13,029
So there is the 2015 virus, which is water of the unites water of the United States and it's in select states.

359
01:00:13,029 --> 01:00:23,229
I read it and it sent about Michigan is included, but it's in about 12 to 15, so not a lot of them,

360
01:00:23,229 --> 01:00:30,579
but it basically just defines the types of waterways that are protected for that qualify for federal protection.

361
01:00:30,579 --> 01:00:35,289
And under the Trump administration, he pulled back a lot.

362
01:00:35,289 --> 01:00:41,599
I think it was like twenty five percent of the types of waterways that can be that qualify

363
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:47,739
to be under this act because he wanted to agriculture people that work in agriculture,

364
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:53,069
urban planning and then big businesses that are near like a river were also complaining

365
01:00:53,069 --> 01:00:58,119
because they wanted to be able to have control to do what they want with that water supply.

366
01:00:58,119 --> 01:01:04,539
But right now, it's starting to be changed and redeveloped since the Trump administration.

367
01:01:04,539 --> 01:01:10,449
So before it used to be navigable, I feel like I'm saying this word wrong,

368
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:21,369
but navigable just of the airport waters were was kind of like the qualification for what could be controlled under the federal government.

369
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:26,199
And now it's basically any body that can hold water.

370
01:01:26,199 --> 01:01:38,229
So even if it's temporarily holding water, so maybe it's a lake or a pond that develops in the spring and summer, but then it's gone by the winter.

371
01:01:38,229 --> 01:01:44,949
If it is there for that period of time, the federal government has control over it.

372
01:01:44,949 --> 01:01:52,719
So that's something that is being has been developed but is now being redeveloped under the Biden administration.

373
01:01:52,719 --> 01:02:03,519
And then Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality drafted new rules after the Flint crisis regarding flood.

374
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:13,239
And basically just a big aspect of these new rules was that all facilities private owned or publicly owned doesn't matter.

375
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:22,479
And all of the pipes that are used in that vicinity needed to be replaced.

376
01:02:22,479 --> 01:02:25,359
Wait, let me make sure I'm saying this right?

377
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:34,899
And so but all of the facilities, private or public again had to pay their own costs for doing this lead pipe replacement.

378
01:02:34,899 --> 01:02:49,219
So that was a very heavy cost for various companies, but that was under the new rule that was developed to.

379
01:02:49,219 --> 01:02:55,189
So we have some discussion questions kind of related to what we just presented on.

380
01:02:55,189 --> 01:03:04,309
So the first one? What are some potential policy implications of the socioeconomic makeup of Flint?

381
01:03:04,309 --> 01:03:20,249
I mean, regarding how the water crisis kind of came to be or just the general?

382
01:03:20,249 --> 01:03:29,189
Claire, so one thing I'm thinking about is that like the model from earlier in the semester about like who influences policy,

383
01:03:29,189 --> 01:03:33,989
so for thinking about a group that's already disadvantaged either from socio economic

384
01:03:33,989 --> 01:03:37,589
status or from like races which are obviously like intertwined in this case,

385
01:03:37,589 --> 01:03:43,679
too, they would have less agency to advocate for themselves even once the problem was found out.

386
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:49,259
But like, you know, like we've heard this example many times about like this happened in a white neighborhood and everyone's always like,

387
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:57,479
no, because even if they found out, the change would have happened more quickly. And yeah, I think that that's relevant to the policy.

388
01:03:57,479 --> 01:04:04,829
Yeah, definitely. They're kind of going off of that. I think the fact that the involvement of the emergency manager is like kind of huge to

389
01:04:04,829 --> 01:04:09,649
this entire case simply because it's kind of fundamentally undemocratic structures.

390
01:04:09,649 --> 01:04:13,709
So like the ability for Flint to make their own decisions to influence their own

391
01:04:13,709 --> 01:04:17,909
policy when they have an emergency manager is kind of non-existent to some extent.

392
01:04:17,909 --> 01:04:22,049
And I guess why he saw the hiding and the observation like that.

393
01:04:22,049 --> 01:04:29,439
But I didn't have like the poor water quality tests because it wasn't like a oh, the city of Flint decided to go use Flint River.

394
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:35,939
It was a small group of people decided to use that. And so they're like, Oh, shoot like, this comes directly back to us.

395
01:04:35,939 --> 01:04:40,349
Maybe we have to hide this. And so I think that kind of is why there's such a delay in addressing.

396
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:45,539
Then it kind of goes to show letting go by not empowering people to have worse outcomes.

397
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:55,579
Yeah, for sure. Any other thoughts on this question?

398
01:04:55,579 --> 01:04:59,809
OK, the second one is why do you think charges and allegations against the former

399
01:04:59,809 --> 01:05:03,619
governor were excluded from the class action lawsuit that I had discussed?

400
01:05:03,619 --> 01:05:08,719
And do you think personally that you should have been accountable, held accountable?

401
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:15,049
Because personally, me, I even just reading things? I didn't fully understand why he would be excluded.

402
01:05:15,049 --> 01:05:25,669
And that's why he hasn't been charged specifically himself for everything.

403
01:05:25,669 --> 01:05:32,449
He actually was charged with something like last week, literally a year ago, but it was a misdemeanor charge.

404
01:05:32,449 --> 01:05:38,779
I don't know if that's why he was excluded, no class action lawsuit, but it was a misdemeanor for this whole thing.

405
01:05:38,779 --> 01:05:47,119
So I don't know. I think there's like a lot of privilege there, and standing in the state of Michigan right now is kind of like a little bit.

406
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:54,749
My personal answer to that was kind of going off the privilege and the power and stuff like that.

407
01:05:54,749 --> 01:06:02,489
Not really know much about legal stuff, but who were other government officials like implicated in the class action lawsuit?

408
01:06:02,489 --> 01:06:07,679
Was he like one of the only like political leaders who were?

409
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:13,919
I don't really know how class action lawsuits work in terms of like accountability of like public figures.

410
01:06:13,919 --> 01:06:17,699
Not excusing any of his actions, but I also believe you should be sort.

411
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:21,839
So like me myself, I had to look up like a class action.

412
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:30,509
And if I'm mistaken, it's a group of people, correct? And in the article that I had used, it mentioned other city officials.

413
01:06:30,509 --> 01:06:36,479
So I don't know if it's different for necessarily a governor or federal governments.

414
01:06:36,479 --> 01:06:42,119
I'm not sure as well. And that was something that was kind of interesting to me because I'm not familiar on this topic,

415
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:52,479
and I feel like there's no clear cut answer as to why he is kind of escaping a lot of things, even though he was charged with a misdemeanor.

416
01:06:52,479 --> 01:06:56,669
Yeah. Just to add on to that because I just googled, I'm not going because I'm like,

417
01:06:56,669 --> 01:07:05,669
I know what I am and eight people in Rick Snyder than eight people, other people who had criminal charges from MySpace, right?

418
01:07:05,669 --> 01:07:13,469
I just was like, And where are they now? Um, so a lot of them, like seemed like the junior felonies or various other things.

419
01:07:13,469 --> 01:07:18,059
So there's a willful neglect type sort of lives.

420
01:07:18,059 --> 01:07:23,549
Hmm. So what I think is probably the closest that you can get to justice in this case,

421
01:07:23,549 --> 01:07:30,759
if you're going to assume justice can be provided by a person like a punitive system in the first place.

422
01:07:30,759 --> 01:07:35,799
But it's more than I think we can say for most of the things that have happened to our government leaders,

423
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:42,609
a disservice to intentionally disenfranchized their citizens.

424
01:07:42,609 --> 01:07:52,029
I would also say with this sort of logic, governor should also from Georgia should also be charged or something similar.

425
01:07:52,029 --> 01:07:57,099
It's going to bounce off that. That's kind of almost a while ago. But like the Lord moves very slowly.

426
01:07:57,099 --> 01:08:05,039
It's always good. But I remember seeing some of the the most intense charges actually work due to the blood

427
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:10,449
heels due to the eight to nine people died of Legionnaires disease because of incompetence.

428
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:16,089
And the most intense charge was it for Michigan health director who was charged with involuntary manslaughter,

429
01:08:16,089 --> 01:08:24,309
which is like obviously a very big charge. And I think it's just I mean, like I think obviously as my career is going to be like,

430
01:08:24,309 --> 01:08:28,509
I think Governor Snyder definitely should be held accountable simply because when do you?

431
01:08:28,509 --> 01:08:32,859
He was the person who appointed emergency manager, and that's like just a direct line to him.

432
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:40,119
It's not like it was evil or the Daegu that has like that managers and other people on board and like,

433
01:08:40,119 --> 01:08:45,279
it's kind of just like the forecast to stop the governor. I mean, it just goes.

434
01:08:45,279 --> 01:08:50,379
But yeah, I feel like unfortunately kind of the same.

435
01:08:50,379 --> 01:08:54,609
But the people bringing the class action lawsuit were probably just embarrassed

436
01:08:54,609 --> 01:09:00,189
that they had no chance of winning the suit if he was promptly excluded from it.

437
01:09:00,189 --> 01:09:04,809
I would assume just because that would probably be a less direct chain,

438
01:09:04,809 --> 01:09:13,329
at least in legal terms of being able to prove in a court, and even though I also agree that he should be held accountable.

439
01:09:13,329 --> 01:09:20,199
Right. And I think, on the other hand, it really puts it like, Oh, also I like, that's something that's also coming to light.

440
01:09:20,199 --> 01:09:29,329
And like the current look towards a case of like how it's like there's a lot of pointing fingers like to because like like viola and like the other,

441
01:09:29,329 --> 01:09:32,019
like private companies are saying, like, you know,

442
01:09:32,019 --> 01:09:36,219
like the government shut us out of like a lot of meetings like, you know, we were trying to tell them.

443
01:09:36,219 --> 01:09:39,909
But then a lot of like government officials are like, Oh, they never shared this with us.

444
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:46,359
And so I feel like some, like some of that kind of like pointing fingers or not knowing what like for stories

445
01:09:46,359 --> 01:09:51,069
like also like letting some people like me because you can't like they can't like.

446
01:09:51,069 --> 01:09:58,269
It's hard to prove that like they knew about it or they didn't know about it. And so like, I feel like that's what happened was like Governor Snyder.

447
01:09:58,269 --> 01:10:01,599
And there's like happening a little in like the current case to us.

448
01:10:01,599 --> 01:10:05,989
So yeah, so then I think, what are we trying to look at?

449
01:10:05,989 --> 01:10:16,479
When I was like, we all recognize the tragedy, a failure of our financial system, but which is kind of pretty exception.

450
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,939
In some instances,

451
01:10:18,939 --> 01:10:29,259
we have probably the most lethal response from the fact that we got a district judge to even distribute water to people was kind of insane.

452
01:10:29,259 --> 01:10:35,229
It was a miracle that it's not going to produce very often.

453
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:38,699
And it kind of, you know, they're trying to you right now.

454
01:10:38,699 --> 01:10:46,369
And they may have more luck because it's a private entity, but the amount of insulation that political figures and people like this,

455
01:10:46,369 --> 01:10:53,079
you know, emergency actor Gary, under things like the Clean Water Act, it's kind of insane.

456
01:10:53,079 --> 01:10:56,889
You know, it's a complete failure of our legal system to hold anyone accountable.

457
01:10:56,889 --> 01:11:05,769
I mean, you know, we can blame things like, you know, the government of Flint or, you know, Rick Snyder, and that's fine.

458
01:11:05,769 --> 01:11:14,289
But under U.S. law and you know, the Clean Water Act 90 percent, our rules are technically not really doing much wrong.

459
01:11:14,289 --> 01:11:22,119
They're being incredibly shifty about it and hiding a lot of stuff. But they're allowed to do this and they're allowed to get away with it.

460
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:26,719
So, you know, obviously, we can be terribly angry at that point.

461
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:37,749
We all deserve better. But, you know, by suing the government of Flint for these various factors, but really just, you know,

462
01:11:37,749 --> 01:11:47,469
making people who pay taxes in this area anymore, it's just you have to, you know, cover those costs for people who pay taxes to the government.

463
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:51,129
So when I see a case like Flint,

464
01:11:51,129 --> 01:12:03,299
I'm really just it's just it just disappointing how fundamentally our legal system fails to protect the well-being of individual citizens.

465
01:12:03,299 --> 01:12:10,359
Yeah, so I agree with your point that you make it harder to make these charges stick to the government.

466
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:18,699
And I also do not like the way the water sampling system is set up to allow things like this to happen, like that's an important part.

467
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:25,199
So like, recognize what you're talking about. Like, how this all happened is that they actually found the higher levels of.

468
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:32,219
They could just ignore them in the report that they put out. But I also think specifically regarding the class action lawsuit,

469
01:12:32,219 --> 01:12:37,739
I feel the class action lawsuits are kind of different because if the goal is accountability,

470
01:12:37,739 --> 01:12:44,699
but it's also getting a settlement that is enough money to undo some of the damage if it's possible.

471
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:51,909
So I think late for class action, you're going to want to focus on companies that can pay you a lot of money rather than an individual,

472
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:55,169
like you should spend more of your time where you can get money out of it,

473
01:12:55,169 --> 01:13:03,339
rather than like holding one person accountable, because that's more like criminal charges or.

474
01:13:03,339 --> 01:13:10,539
I think also in the context of where potentially we might have people in our class and our platform in the School of Public Health

475
01:13:10,539 --> 01:13:20,439
who end up going into position like positions of political problems feel like elected or like they're put into that in the future.

476
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:23,769
So like considering at least when we were going on this, my mind like,

477
01:13:23,769 --> 01:13:30,069
let's say one of us is embroiled in some sort of scandal in the future because of a missed service or disservice

478
01:13:30,069 --> 01:13:38,529
of people like why would we expect of our peers and colleagues if they were to be in that sort of situation?

479
01:13:38,529 --> 01:13:41,529
And what sort of leadership will we expect them to show?

480
01:13:41,529 --> 01:13:51,189
And I think like in this case, like Dr. Moniz, alumni of this board obviously did what they needed to do to make sure that forward like safe,

481
01:13:51,189 --> 01:13:55,599
but that's not as easily about one side of the school.

482
01:13:55,599 --> 01:14:01,169
So what would we expect of other folks and then what?

483
01:14:01,169 --> 01:14:06,189
Well, I was just thinking about leadership for health 5:16.

484
01:14:06,189 --> 01:14:16,169
But um yeah, it's kind of like.

485
01:14:16,169 --> 01:14:23,639
Oh, so okay, then for the third discussion question.

486
01:14:23,639 --> 01:14:30,719
Do you guys have any policy ideas for clean water regulation like anything that you think could

487
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:36,389
have been in place before that could have either prevented this or just to put in place now,

488
01:14:36,389 --> 01:14:40,539
and it doesn't have to just be regarding Plan B.

489
01:14:40,539 --> 01:14:50,609
Just overall, well, it's not OK, you then then you at these temporary precautionary things going place,

490
01:14:50,609 --> 01:14:58,119
so like testing pipes and infrastructure like annually or something like that,

491
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:05,529
so you can try to test when they would be occurring and becoming worse that we would be able to prevent it.

492
01:15:05,529 --> 01:15:11,109
And like, I don't know, more of a precautionary way as opposed to reactive and afterwards.

493
01:15:11,109 --> 01:15:18,249
Hmm. I think it's interesting looking at like the central power plant and like the transportation system, kind of.

494
01:15:18,249 --> 01:15:26,409
It's like a public example of like community action, the like, perhaps like an inspiration like in terms of all,

495
01:15:26,409 --> 01:15:33,249
like the forms they held about it, like the public, like comment periods, like having some.

496
01:15:33,249 --> 01:15:35,979
Obviously, I think there's a lot that can be improved with that.

497
01:15:35,979 --> 01:15:44,289
But I think that that's like a good first step in terms of like educating the public when there's like a major change because there

498
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:51,669
was absolutely no sort of like communication or education about like the switch and water and like why that was even occurring.

499
01:15:51,669 --> 01:15:57,469
And I think that's like a good first step to like, allow public to, like, even know what's going on.

500
01:15:57,469 --> 01:16:06,279
I mean, it's like the bars on the floor, but you know. Yeah, I think that education is like clear communication like we were talking about.

501
01:16:06,279 --> 01:16:14,559
Last class is just like absolutely key, especially when everyone's everyone's health is being affected by it.

502
01:16:14,559 --> 01:16:18,249
Yeah. The pros to cons can't take the words of an off of like honestly like incorporation

503
01:16:18,249 --> 01:16:22,269
of more of the precautionary principle and like something like drinking water,

504
01:16:22,269 --> 01:16:25,809
which you think there would never be something like that to be a lot more

505
01:16:25,809 --> 01:16:30,189
prevention testing requirements to so with that before it even gets off the tap.

506
01:16:30,189 --> 01:16:36,339
But then also transparency. And I think one reason was as transparent was because it was the city of Flint making the decision.

507
01:16:36,339 --> 01:16:38,559
It was the emergency manager making the decision.

508
01:16:38,559 --> 01:16:46,929
And obviously, like more forums and more like, Hey, maybe you should be able to google my water quality at any moment and say, like the local reason,

509
01:16:46,929 --> 01:16:53,859
tests and stuff like I know for cannabis testing, you can literally go to the bottom of the package and find out the test result.

510
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:59,379
And like, it's pretty difficult to find local water quality test results depending on their miscellany.

511
01:16:59,379 --> 01:17:02,519
But I mean, ultimately, the when I first started the case, I thought,

512
01:17:02,519 --> 01:17:11,979
was just astounding that the amount of leeway the administrators of water supplies have in like deciding what is OK, what is it like?

513
01:17:11,979 --> 01:17:17,529
I was really surprised. There isn't like a moment where they realize like, Oh, there's a lot when there's water,

514
01:17:17,529 --> 01:17:24,999
like there's a federal, it's like, Don't pass, go like immediately. Notify your residents, shut off operations and then call the EPA or something.

515
01:17:24,999 --> 01:17:31,729
But they're able to keep going on and like, I think it's also really where their negligence comes from, where I mean,

516
01:17:31,729 --> 01:17:37,359
if there isn't going to be, if they're going to be held to a high standard because maybe they're I mean,

517
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:41,169
if they're going be held to a high standard for other actions that there needs to be a really stringent

518
01:17:41,169 --> 01:17:46,509
protocols in place to maybe take away some of that choice if there is people being harmed by the water,

519
01:17:46,509 --> 01:17:59,399
I think. But. To continue the of education when it comes to, you know, corrosive substances, water.

520
01:17:59,399 --> 01:18:07,419
I think the really important part is educating new students who are getting involved in water treatment on personal evidence.

521
01:18:07,419 --> 01:18:15,749
I'm going to take a few courses at university about water treatment, and in my first words, we never talk about my second.

522
01:18:15,749 --> 01:18:23,129
It was the acting professor included. I wasn't even there are times when it's pretty new and actually I want to pick.

523
01:18:23,129 --> 01:18:28,559
The measuring came out of this case from students at Virginia Tech.

524
01:18:28,559 --> 01:18:37,079
So it's really important to focus on that experience in the future. It just kind of a field in water treatment that we just don't fully understand.

525
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:45,689
And to the point about those really high barriers, you know, maybe the box video And this players actually in walkers.

526
01:18:45,689 --> 01:19:01,079
So her taxes were like seven times at certain points and then as much as like 10000 parts per billion, which is like fifteen point four billion value.

527
01:19:01,079 --> 01:19:11,099
And I think, you know, formatting policy that those numbers aren't allowed to exist is crucial because it's fine if you know,

528
01:19:11,099 --> 01:19:18,479
X percent of the presidency or a township are within that bubble and safe.

529
01:19:18,479 --> 01:19:26,159
But you know, you start to consider every individual, right? And obviously, you can't protect every person equally and financially, by the way,

530
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:34,819
you have to at least consider how their health is going to be impacted.

531
01:19:34,819 --> 01:19:42,629
I have both. Go ahead. I was like, you know, we both went and we jersey,

532
01:19:42,629 --> 01:19:52,799
it's very clear that the government officials don't feel threatened by the potential applications and lawsuits based on that.

533
01:19:52,799 --> 01:19:57,869
And obviously with emergency management, that kind of gives the director full power,

534
01:19:57,869 --> 01:20:03,329
which you know, is useful in that situation where you're trying to curb that emergency.

535
01:20:03,329 --> 01:20:11,189
But I think it's very easy to prove that the water system has clearly a very severe impact on the health of the entire population.

536
01:20:11,189 --> 01:20:15,839
So I think things like that would maybe like, you know, emergency management may like,

537
01:20:15,839 --> 01:20:19,859
shut down all with the Partizan stuff, and that's fine, you know?

538
01:20:19,859 --> 01:20:27,989
But I feel like water has such a wide blandness on it that I think that many people, even emergency situations, need to be held accountable.

539
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:35,069
So making policies that, like, you know, are like, Oh, you need to test water twice a year, if not, you're immediately removed from his position.

540
01:20:35,069 --> 01:20:41,429
And just making that like there's no no room for abuse that they have to complete those requirements,

541
01:20:41,429 --> 01:20:52,559
I think is the best way to scare them and to actually do what needs to be done. Just briefly going off of that point, too,

542
01:20:52,559 --> 01:20:58,489
I think that there's so many like environmental policies that don't really have teeth and that are more of like a couple.

543
01:20:58,489 --> 01:21:03,269
Well, you should believe and oh darn didn't that really sucks.

544
01:21:03,269 --> 01:21:14,759
Try better next time. And I think that having like accountability measures that actually even have some sort of policy like punishment, but, you know,

545
01:21:14,759 --> 01:21:22,949
incentive to actually follow these regulations is absolutely necessary because I mean,

546
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:26,819
the reason that the water was switched in the first place was to save money.

547
01:21:26,819 --> 01:21:34,199
And if there's no sort of like incentive to make sure that there's safety alongside of the savings,

548
01:21:34,199 --> 01:21:40,319
then obviously what is going to be the priority, which is sad, but that's the one we live in, unfortunately.

549
01:21:40,319 --> 01:21:47,999
But yeah, kind of going off that, like you said all the time when the federal government is trying to incentivize something like threatening

550
01:21:47,999 --> 01:21:53,639
federal national transportation money and like that that states all worried and stuff and like you said,

551
01:21:53,639 --> 01:21:57,629
that used for. Sometimes, I think, very meaningful, important policies.

552
01:21:57,629 --> 01:22:03,389
But then sometimes it gets kind of thrown in just whatever is maybe politically expedient, but like maybe something like that for.

553
01:22:03,389 --> 01:22:05,819
I mean, water and air quality is something like, Hey,

554
01:22:05,819 --> 01:22:17,019
you're going to lose this big federal money if you don't provide safe water to your citizens, like on something like that.

555
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:24,099
I was going to say kind of going on public policy of not having a lot of teeth like the EPA has to work so slow on something

556
01:22:24,099 --> 01:22:30,959
like a huge loss just because of like how did the EPA was created and like what how policy dictates they have to operate.

557
01:22:30,959 --> 01:22:34,419
So I think like reevaluating that would help with clean water.

558
01:22:34,419 --> 01:22:41,859
It would help, like so many other things, like the way that EPA operates now is like it's underfunded and it's just slow by design.

559
01:22:41,859 --> 01:22:52,409
So I think that would do a lot for clean water. And even if you like trigger an environmental review, whoever is in charge,

560
01:22:52,409 --> 01:22:57,239
it makes it it doesn't even have to listen if they don't want to, because that's how it works.

561
01:22:57,239 --> 01:23:01,919
They don't want to listen. You know, you tell them, Well, you know,

562
01:23:01,919 --> 01:23:09,689
we think it'll cost $20 billion to take out the service lines and we value the human life of 10 million dollars.

563
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:13,229
You know, even people will die if you don't do this. You know, it's totally valid.

564
01:23:13,229 --> 01:23:20,719
For whatever reason, it's hard to say. Cool. OK, I'm going to keep in the place and, you know, because it's going to save me money.

565
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:28,709
So, yeah, the fact that they're not policy under a lot of contradictions, just like, Oh, here's what we have to tell you,

566
01:23:28,709 --> 01:23:40,869
and you don't have to listen at all, because that's how we set up this kind of stuff to be service to people.

567
01:23:40,869 --> 01:23:45,249
This is fantastic discussion. I mean, we're not done.

568
01:23:45,249 --> 01:23:46,619
I just want to like,

569
01:23:46,619 --> 01:23:55,679
like try really hard to not speak up because I want to respond and comment on all of these great things and all this great discussion.

570
01:23:55,679 --> 01:24:07,079
So before I forget and I'd like on a couple of points, I wanted to throw out there, uh, first, uh, uh uh, the comment that you made a few minutes ago.

571
01:24:07,079 --> 01:24:12,059
Well, I think is worth exploring. Added preparedness lies on it.

572
01:24:12,059 --> 01:24:14,519
The group here hasn't specifically.

573
01:24:14,519 --> 01:24:23,729
But let's maybe talk about the water infrastructure, the distribution system in the first place, and hopefully we can remember this race.

574
01:24:23,729 --> 01:24:31,559
So feel free to check me on it. Actually, going back, let's go back to Professor Rogers 20 years ago.

575
01:24:31,559 --> 01:24:33,479
Exposure assessment analysis, right?

576
01:24:33,479 --> 01:24:44,399
So, you know, the the ancient Romans are basically credited with, you know, the foundation of today's Western society, right?

577
01:24:44,399 --> 01:24:49,019
And one of their greatest feats was water distribution, right?

578
01:24:49,019 --> 01:24:53,039
The ability to hold it and distribute it.

579
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:56,939
And they used all lead pipes. Right.

580
01:24:56,939 --> 01:25:02,179
This was how it was all distributed. And you know, some fun facts.

581
01:25:02,179 --> 01:25:10,529
Uh, so the chemical symbol for lead right is P B, which is Latin loved one bomb,

582
01:25:10,529 --> 01:25:14,999
which basically is where the term plumbing comes from, right when we talk about the plumbing.

583
01:25:14,999 --> 01:25:24,479
And so, you know, fast forward from thousand years, we have this water distribution infrastructure throughout the country.

584
01:25:24,479 --> 01:25:36,479
Um, it's not 100 percent when plumbing that we use, but there are a lot of important locations in the water distribution model that is present.

585
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:40,769
When you see some of those images and you guys had some on your side of the pipes,

586
01:25:40,769 --> 01:25:47,969
right, where you have a cross-section, so nasty stuff on the inside. Some of you probably take Professor Gee's course, right?

587
01:25:47,969 --> 01:25:52,109
And he studies biofilms right and asks you to like,

588
01:25:52,109 --> 01:25:59,099
unscrew this drain on your faucet and stick your finger up there and you feel this slimy, nasty stuff or whatever right to the biofilm.

589
01:25:59,099 --> 01:26:03,989
It's there. It's actually protective enough for a case like this, right?

590
01:26:03,989 --> 01:26:06,779
So it builds up over time,

591
01:26:06,779 --> 01:26:17,489
and it's basically coating the lead in anything else that's in that plumbing system for being able to reach out into the water.

592
01:26:17,489 --> 01:26:22,199
So with the switch from the Great Lakes water to the Flint River water,

593
01:26:22,199 --> 01:26:29,429
the Flint River was at a higher acidity level and it began to basically strip

594
01:26:29,429 --> 01:26:33,809
away that kind of protective biofilm that was throughout the plumbing system.

595
01:26:33,809 --> 01:26:43,139
That was where, you know, all the biologicals were being detected, and it's triggering violations of the Safe Water Drinking Act.

596
01:26:43,139 --> 01:26:50,939
And then the response to that was to put, you know, an even more corrosive disinfection in my containers into the system.

597
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:58,259
And that's where the trial of methane is as a byproduct of the coronation, which triggered another violation of the Safe Water Drinking Act.

598
01:26:58,259 --> 01:27:02,069
But anyway, you're basically stripping away that protective layer throughout the process.

599
01:27:02,069 --> 01:27:09,029
And so now those toxic metals primarily lead in this case are available to be leached by

600
01:27:09,029 --> 01:27:14,969
the higher level of acidity and actually get into the water vapors being distributed.

601
01:27:14,969 --> 01:27:19,949
Anybody want to check me on that description? So it is my commentary.

602
01:27:19,949 --> 01:27:24,059
Yeah, I mean, there's nothing inherently wrong with the first water right now.

603
01:27:24,059 --> 01:27:29,969
There wasn't any treated this issue, and in the sense that it was treated with minor graduation,

604
01:27:29,969 --> 01:27:37,259
what the fair requirements for and then chlorine disinfection.

605
01:27:37,259 --> 01:27:44,339
And you can't. It certainly kind of smacks of women with chlorine.

606
01:27:44,339 --> 01:27:54,509
I'm sorry our chlorination because beyond a certain point minutes on track of Americans and you said it's not safe, you can't continue.

607
01:27:54,509 --> 01:28:03,929
So you can go back up the steps and you can coagulate more, which removes more of those salts, which is, you know, the brown stuff you see usually,

608
01:28:03,929 --> 01:28:11,939
which, you know, I saw if you buy space for bacteria to hide, you know, even down to corn, it's much easier to choke off bacteria.

609
01:28:11,939 --> 01:28:22,439
But all this changes the opportunity of the water, which means blowing up when you start dissolving more of that inner piping, which is off.

610
01:28:22,439 --> 01:28:31,529
And then you're also, you know, you can impact the overall putrid water and keep us wondering why it doesn't require some treatment for facilities

611
01:28:31,529 --> 01:28:40,409
while you're getting basically just from two to four points now in the city and decreasing going to which?

612
01:28:40,409 --> 01:28:48,019
Two facts are just eating away the pipes that people are relying on to get watch their house.

613
01:28:48,019 --> 01:28:57,519
All right. I don't know. I don't know if I'm following this correctly. I'm not because I like it a lot, but um, it sounds like I mean,

614
01:28:57,519 --> 01:29:03,909
this is kind of leading to the increased levels of water as we continue to go on to

615
01:29:03,909 --> 01:29:08,769
become an increasing issue because we have an increasingly open water everywhere,

616
01:29:08,769 --> 01:29:12,819
right? And so that if we have these older pipes or even newer pipes,

617
01:29:12,819 --> 01:29:24,939
and if we have to do all of these things to increase the water and chemicals or various for various reasons, which will obviously very well.

618
01:29:24,939 --> 01:29:29,829
Is this just going to become an increasing problem throughout the country, no matter what?

619
01:29:29,829 --> 01:29:33,429
Is that kind of missing? No, I think it's a great point.

620
01:29:33,429 --> 01:29:39,399
And you know, we'll explain it. And I think that's a pretty important take home message, right?

621
01:29:39,399 --> 01:29:50,019
Is that it's very you know what? My view is very minor changes to the system that can have dramatic downstream effects.

622
01:29:50,019 --> 01:30:01,419
It's not done properly and monitored very closely and alerted subsequently.

623
01:30:01,419 --> 01:30:08,589
So but but yes, this is, you know, we're using Flint as a case study is terrible, right?

624
01:30:08,589 --> 01:30:13,719
The group that everyone's talked about, how it's it's not like Don, it's not like we were looking at it, though.

625
01:30:13,719 --> 01:30:17,259
Yeah, that was terrible. But glad it's over with because it's not.

626
01:30:17,259 --> 01:30:21,429
It's still ongoing. But yeah, that what what.

627
01:30:21,429 --> 01:30:27,819
Hopefully, you know, this awful, tragic event can do is inform us going forward,

628
01:30:27,819 --> 01:30:35,049
right for all of the other communities that haven't yet experienced this because if not managed properly.

629
01:30:35,049 --> 01:30:44,469
Right. The same potential, you know, threats are are there kind of a lot of things that I really enjoyed your chemistry explanation.

630
01:30:44,469 --> 01:30:47,559
I was obviously a refresher, but like step back.

631
01:30:47,559 --> 01:30:55,119
Like, I mean, ultimately, like for my understanding, you can safely use our land type of structure because it's been a very long time.

632
01:30:55,119 --> 01:31:00,469
I mean, if I was looking for a day or two over like, maybe we should replace those in the future, we can use that safely.

633
01:31:00,469 --> 01:31:05,619
And ultimately, the flood water crisis was a human competency administrative problem.

634
01:31:05,619 --> 01:31:11,139
I don't think that it from that. I mean, it wasn't inevitable that the switch to Flint water wasn't a problem.

635
01:31:11,139 --> 01:31:16,659
It was, if properly administered, you could have used the Flint water. And I mean,

636
01:31:16,659 --> 01:31:19,749
there might be more technical challenges associated with that kind of comes

637
01:31:19,749 --> 01:31:23,799
down to like almost a political question of how much do we value our water,

638
01:31:23,799 --> 01:31:29,049
how much money everyone put into it versus like cost putting in all of the kind of water saving stuff.

639
01:31:29,049 --> 01:31:35,319
And it just it just enrages me that it I mean, it was ultimately a completely 100 percent preventable crisis.

640
01:31:35,319 --> 01:31:42,399
And I think a lot of people, I mean, I kind of forget sometimes like the big like, it wasn't necessarily the flint water.

641
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:46,009
That was the problem is the people who were in charge of the situation. I was the problem.

642
01:31:46,009 --> 01:31:54,519
And like, I just all right. So to Josh on that.

643
01:31:54,519 --> 01:32:01,619
I was just going to say that reminds me of how like the Native American population, you know, they obviously have a lot of issues as well.

644
01:32:01,619 --> 01:32:09,569
And I think somewhere, you know, I think they have been all these issues that they face and that just makes them trust our government,

645
01:32:09,569 --> 01:32:14,819
even less so when we are actually Americans that are meant to help them.

646
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:19,109
The more we lose their trust, the less likely they are to be effective and actually work.

647
01:32:19,109 --> 01:32:22,019
And that makes it really difficult for them not to go.

648
01:32:22,019 --> 01:32:26,069
I mean, obviously, you want to stop those bad things happening, but there's no clear answer for that.

649
01:32:26,069 --> 01:32:33,179
And I think that in this community as well, because the people are still using bottled water, even though they've switched to a safer source of water.

650
01:32:33,179 --> 01:32:38,819
And I think a lot of it is a policy that they won't be effective because it involves

651
01:32:38,819 --> 01:32:46,889
the community as well if it doesn't trust the policy to actually protect their health.

652
01:32:46,889 --> 01:32:56,719
Every time I go there, I forget, like I was another person to the professor and oftentimes I would talk about trust.

653
01:32:56,719 --> 01:33:02,979
It's kind of I think it is a global health crisis that there's horse.

654
01:33:02,979 --> 01:33:11,169
And they are saying, you know, it's not necessarily like these are trusting of us, it's that we haven't done anything to deserve their trust.

655
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:17,979
And so I think that it's also like how many more failures of government can there be and how can we

656
01:33:17,979 --> 01:33:22,449
fault communities for not trusting us in the first place if we're going to be poisoning their children?

657
01:33:22,449 --> 01:33:25,669
And it's especially true like a case of environmental racism,

658
01:33:25,669 --> 01:33:32,199
where that gentleman or the older black man who was like on screen but who was widowed, he had four kids and he was like talking about this.

659
01:33:32,199 --> 01:33:40,539
Just like talking to that, you don't you don't have anything to say when I'm like, You can't really say that he's wrong.

660
01:33:40,539 --> 01:33:45,749
So it's like, I don't know. I guess it would be like, how do you earn trust at that point?

661
01:33:45,749 --> 01:33:56,749
How do you make people trust? It was you made a comment a few minutes ago, Victoria, about which totally resonated with me.

662
01:33:56,749 --> 01:33:59,219
Actually, here I wanted to. This was I had three things I try to remember.

663
01:33:59,219 --> 01:34:08,639
Here is the second one and the most recent class action lawsuit that you all were talking about that just started like last week or whatever, right?

664
01:34:08,639 --> 01:34:10,739
I just read this morning.

665
01:34:10,739 --> 01:34:21,159
So I guess it would have made it like yesterday's news that Snyder has been subpoenaed to testify at this class-action lawsuit.

666
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:32,069
His lawyers are already or whatever it is, making the motion to the judge to not have him have to respect the subpoena.

667
01:34:32,069 --> 01:34:39,749
And Snyder came out and made a statement yesterday that said If I am forced to testify, I will plead the fifth.

668
01:34:39,749 --> 01:34:45,359
So yeah, so anyway, that was my update over some reading this morning.

669
01:34:45,359 --> 01:34:52,769
But I wanted to come back to your point a few minutes ago, Victoria, where you are basically saying.

670
01:34:52,769 --> 01:34:59,459
OK, so let's contrast this with we haven't talked about it in class and with anybody a

671
01:34:59,459 --> 01:35:06,959
participant in the dark waters and the viewing and panel discussion couple weeks ago.

672
01:35:06,959 --> 01:35:10,679
Anyway, so, uh, Dow Chemical Right.

673
01:35:10,679 --> 01:35:18,959
So you can look at like the chemical industry and you know, their their industrial operations are highly contaminating some like nearby waterways.

674
01:35:18,959 --> 01:35:28,559
And that and that sense and that situation is really easy for us, for people as citizens to point the finger right and say those those terrible,

675
01:35:28,559 --> 01:35:37,379
money grabbing industry people that are hiding, you know, all of this information that they knew about for a long time.

676
01:35:37,379 --> 01:35:43,859
And you know, we're bearing the brunt of it through, you know, poor health in this case.

677
01:35:43,859 --> 01:35:52,019
Your question that I interpret it, a victory is like it's basically us in this situation, right?

678
01:35:52,019 --> 01:35:59,639
It's people at the death queue, which is now called eagle rape at the State Department of Environmental Quality.

679
01:35:59,639 --> 01:36:08,389
Basically, uh, people that are serving in government positions, whether they've been elected or appointed.

680
01:36:08,389 --> 01:36:14,459
Um, you know, I I can't imagine this emergency manager guy was like a terrible person, right?

681
01:36:14,459 --> 01:36:22,769
Like inherently like he was given this right, really challenging task, which in my mind makes this case much tougher, right?

682
01:36:22,769 --> 01:36:26,669
Because you're not pointing out that a money grubbing, you know,

683
01:36:26,669 --> 01:36:32,699
terrible people that are evil by nature and they don't care about, you know, how they're impacting nearby communities.

684
01:36:32,699 --> 01:36:42,059
This is this is all people like us, right? You know, future us, uh, that are in these positions that how did this don't happen, right?

685
01:36:42,059 --> 01:36:53,789
And how would he how do we improve it and do it better? It's a it's an excellent question, and it's it's very fair.

686
01:36:53,789 --> 01:36:57,929
I was thinking about that, too, I don't know top of your training there,

687
01:36:57,929 --> 01:37:02,509
but we're talking so much about like accountability and transparency within government,

688
01:37:02,509 --> 01:37:07,889
and yet obviously that is like one of the last things that we see like at every level.

689
01:37:07,889 --> 01:37:16,739
So it's like, how do we make it okay to be transparent and not like to admit when maybe a wrong choice was

690
01:37:16,739 --> 01:37:23,639
made early on in the process enough that it doesn't affect people's health and well-being?

691
01:37:23,639 --> 01:37:29,249
Like when is it OK to admit to making mistakes and like a position of power?

692
01:37:29,249 --> 01:37:34,319
Because I think that we don't really have a culture where that's OK?

693
01:37:34,319 --> 01:37:35,849
All right.

694
01:37:35,849 --> 01:37:45,059
And in this case, like if that mistake was like, Oh, that too early on, like, we wouldn't be seeing all of these like health effects on children.

695
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:50,129
Like years later, we wouldn't see people still like lining up for bottled water.

696
01:37:50,129 --> 01:37:55,529
Eight years after. So I know it's more like a question, but there's not really like an answer to that.

697
01:37:55,529 --> 01:37:59,189
Like how you make transparency and communication.

698
01:37:59,189 --> 01:38:08,519
OK? Early on in the process of owning up to making poor choices and, you know, hopefully with good intentions, but I don't know.

699
01:38:08,519 --> 01:38:18,269
Yeah, I mean, well, and Bridget both highlighted a few minutes ago that the process happened the way it's allowed you, right?

700
01:38:18,269 --> 01:38:29,089
So where's the mechanism to interject? Uh, you know, an alternative to that process that can be more effective, I guess is easier said than done.

701
01:38:29,089 --> 01:38:32,339
But like I think ultimately it kind of is an issue of like lack of education of the

702
01:38:32,339 --> 01:38:37,679
public or understanding of environmental health issues and then also lack of value.

703
01:38:37,679 --> 01:38:44,369
For those things, rights as a whole didn't seem like we really value maintenance services such as like trash, water or air.

704
01:38:44,369 --> 01:38:48,029
All those kind of things are just very basic, but they're not flashy. Don't make money. I mean,

705
01:38:48,029 --> 01:38:52,379
and the reason why water was on the chopping block in the first place was because

706
01:38:52,379 --> 01:38:56,519
it wasn't seen as a political priority to spend a lot of money on clean water.

707
01:38:56,519 --> 01:39:04,109
And so that's why I mean, the emergency manager was willing to maybe just posted measures for Flint water versus like they maybe didn't necessarily.

708
01:39:04,109 --> 01:39:05,279
I don't know because Flint,

709
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:10,169
but that maybe they didn't have to look at the police or this other stuff and all that kind of comes down to political priorities.

710
01:39:10,169 --> 01:39:14,659
But all that comes from the bottom up where the people who vote for them, the power.

711
01:39:14,659 --> 01:39:20,699
So I mean, if there was more of an understanding and appreciation of who clean water and air is very important,

712
01:39:20,699 --> 01:39:27,309
like maybe this would have happened in the first place, but it's not. It's not easy.

713
01:39:27,309 --> 01:39:33,309
So that a little bit, just like the clean water and air support, that's something that was definitely true.

714
01:39:33,309 --> 01:39:40,419
Like in the 70s, when you're trying to get whatever the Clean Air Clean Water Act, it's something we've kind of forgotten about.

715
01:39:40,419 --> 01:39:45,399
I think we're really starting to realize that again, that those things are important.

716
01:39:45,399 --> 01:39:54,969
We don't have enough protection for all those things. I think starting with where it was when we first meet all these laws.

717
01:39:54,969 --> 01:40:02,079
So I just want to check with the group. I think I did what I was really hoping to not do, which was hijack the entire conversation.

718
01:40:02,079 --> 01:40:06,879
Please tell me you don't have like 20 more slides. OK, I'm sorry.

719
01:40:06,879 --> 01:40:15,789
Go back to. Yeah. So I yes, I agree with you.

720
01:40:15,789 --> 01:40:22,249
Yeah, and I just like going on all the time, but like just to quickly like plug like so like I heard about like the most recent case because I'm

721
01:40:22,249 --> 01:40:27,889
in an environmental law class and how it's undergrad and grad students with Professor Noel Hall.

722
01:40:27,889 --> 01:40:35,959
He was like one of the attorneys I was appointed to like, like work on the first like, like lawsuits against like Flint and like the Lake.

723
01:40:35,959 --> 01:40:40,289
Finally, city officials and he's like, he's an adjunct professor from like one state law.

724
01:40:40,289 --> 01:40:45,979
So like his like, I definitely recommend taking this class. It definitely complements what we learn in this class, too.

725
01:40:45,979 --> 01:40:50,549
And like, you get one to like the legal weeds, which I didn't go to too much debt.

726
01:40:50,549 --> 01:40:56,039
So. Thanks, Arianna.

727
01:40:56,039 --> 01:41:00,569
I think we're was just about a third class, really.

728
01:41:00,569 --> 01:41:07,469
We are, yeah. Did you guys have any, any wrap up or this was kind of it that which is fantastic.

729
01:41:07,469 --> 01:41:15,839
So let me just take a minute. Great job. You guys like excellent presentation and digging into the material a little more deeply right?

730
01:41:15,839 --> 01:41:19,049
As like additional background. Great questions.

731
01:41:19,049 --> 01:41:29,459
And holy cow, thanks to the class for just like amazing engagement and really, really thoughtful ideas and questions.

732
01:41:29,459 --> 01:41:34,859
This stuff isn't easy, right? This is like with apologies for the rest of the semester.

733
01:41:34,859 --> 01:41:38,729
Very few of these discussions are going to end with boy. All right.

734
01:41:38,729 --> 01:41:42,899
I think we have all the solutions identified and like, we're all going to feel good, you know?

735
01:41:42,899 --> 01:41:46,949
So apologies for that. But it's really, really important.

736
01:41:46,949 --> 01:41:53,039
And yeah, back to your point, Victoria, it is. It's, you know, future you guys that are going to be out there.

737
01:41:53,039 --> 01:42:03,539
So and that's why I'm so passionate about having you be able to dig into this as much as you can now, Typekit said as part of your background.

738
01:42:03,539 --> 01:42:26,384
So I guess I'm a formal thank you for. I think and I think, yeah, we can be done.
