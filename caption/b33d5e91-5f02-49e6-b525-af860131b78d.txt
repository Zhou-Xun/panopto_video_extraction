1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:24,500
Okay. As in the good.

2
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,770
And then next weekend and being stuck into a week, then cold again.

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,850
So. Working?

4
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,470
Yup. Oh, I see. So welcome back. I said before.

5
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:49,900
Very aware that people are coming in and coming out and they're looking at the courses and everything else they're taking.

6
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:59,590
Kind of easy for today and some good, but they're not actually getting stuck into the meeting rooms of all of us.

7
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,490
But I hope I'm piquing interest again.

8
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:11,290
Any questions? Any thoughts about the syllabus? It still can be modified if you want to have actually topic areas and things like that.

9
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:20,200
So keep that in mind. We started doing our definitions and we remember last time we went through like colonization,

10
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,950
we talked about how different fields explain things in different ways.

11
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,950
We which are balance pathogenicity.

12
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:37,870
If you remember, we talked about how it makes sense that a always doesn't want to necessarily kill its host unless it has an alternative strategy.

13
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:41,020
And we covered that. There's two kinds of alternate strategies.

14
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:46,659
One, living in an either organism, or, two, having an escape strategy to live in the soil and to come back.

15
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:53,649
Another way to have variance factors is basically talk about what a virulence factor is,

16
00:01:53,650 --> 00:02:01,430
how we can have problems identifying if factor in the lab because the lab isn't you,

17
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:09,249
you, me, it's the lab is a synthetic environment, a glass tube a and a microscope.

18
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:14,709
A slide isn't behaving the same way. We ended on this often because I knew this way,

19
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:20,770
and I kind of scared you a little bit by talking about how scary showers are and microorganisms existing in showers.

20
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:25,840
And there you go. You go in the shower and you breathe in because it's lovely in warm when you're inhaling all these nasty organisms.

21
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:31,570
And the whole point here is that if you are immunosuppressed or you're getting older,

22
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:37,900
your body can't fight off organisms that are generally considered innocuous.

23
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:44,709
You know, they are ones that, you know, don't really cause disease.

24
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:52,480
But once your immune system starts getting challenged and overloaded or nonexistent in case of some drugs you can be taking for cancer,

25
00:02:53,800 --> 00:03:01,600
those organs, as all organisms, microorganisms are become opportunists, is an opportunity.

26
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:06,309
Hey, hey, let's take it. Right. So that's what can happen here.

27
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:14,020
And we're realizing that not only can Microgreens be opportunistic, but we're giving them opportunities such as showerheads.

28
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:20,980
Though now worry that having a shower in a hospital if you're immunosuppressed, means you inhale organisms that can cause disease.

29
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:27,190
Any questions on that as we ended up last time? Okay.

30
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,660
So think about the steps in the disease process.

31
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,690
I mentioned this last time, I said balance pathogenicity.

32
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,760
This is three steps that we mustn't disturb to to to cause problems.

33
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:47,380
And it's colonization, invasion and dissemination of what's going in doing its thing and getting out again.

34
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,500
Okay. And if you don't cause the host enough damage, then obviously the extreme is death.

35
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:01,809
Then that's actually a good thing for balance pathogenicity. So colonization, some bacteria just attach and grow pretty mundane.

36
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:09,850
It's actually grow often with the release of toxins which cause local tissue damage and that's about it invade.

37
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,920
But that can extend, of course, the ocean and then getting into the bloodstream,

38
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:18,520
extending in the body in last weekend's dicey invasion of epithelial cells and intracellular growth,

39
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,480
this can actually occur and that results in being dicey, getting further into the host and causing damage.

40
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:32,950
But again, in balanced pathogenicity that is limited dissemination though is through the

41
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,750
host and out of that I'm basically this can result in systemic infections.

42
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:46,900
So ultimately if you have this whole process leading from colonization to dissemination and causing a lot of damage we're going to

43
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:54,310
stage with a host can actually be deleterious the infected obviously die but that's the three steps few of the disease process.

44
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,780
Okay then obviously have a little note down here.

45
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:06,520
I have a components to the process include the microbes and being studied before it can be just a fairly

46
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,580
innocuous always one cause huge amount of damage to extend all these values that you might not even know.

47
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,620
But if you sound like I know, for example, we're talking about the gut, then you'll know about it.

48
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,979
Trust me. You, me in the bathroom. But good for you. How is every every few days?

49
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,810
Right. So there's different levels. Yes. I'm trying to to push this point here.

50
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:35,020
And of course, the other thing to mention, as I said, right beginning of last, last time that we are walking talking bags of bacteria.

51
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,120
So that could be other back. To fighting those bad guys off.

52
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,030
It's. I couldn't resist this.

53
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:56,120
I'm sorry. Hey, we know who this guy is. Bear Grylls, intrepid, British Explorer, if you ever see them issue shows.

54
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:59,300
And if you haven't, I tell you to look at some of them.

55
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,470
Yes, he does drink his of urine and he claims it sterile.

56
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:07,059
Well, of course, when we first watched it, my kids are now it's time to raise my hands for.

57
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,920
That's not true. He's drinking some bacteria that you.

58
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:15,070
It isn't sterile. How sterile is sterile?

59
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:22,420
So let's go to these bullet points and we'll get to that points in a minute. So regions normally colonized in microbiology.

60
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:28,940
Microbiology, by the way, is interesting word I to say that in the old days.

61
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,610
It used to be called the normal flora. What's wrong with the word flora?

62
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,180
It's kind of associates with plant life, fauna, flora.

63
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,879
Right. So kind of avoided that.

64
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,530
And then we'll go into what's the word microbiota. Okay.

65
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:52,839
To be a bit more specific to tiny microorganisms that are not just, you know, historical perspective,

66
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,920
go back to the early 1900s, people used to think bacteria were related to plants.

67
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,569
That's where all comes from, which is kind of true. Trust me to read some of these books back then.

68
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,190
That kind of nutty. Anyway, moving on, second bullet point.

69
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,120
Exactly, the skin, the mucous membranes, the mouth, the upper respiratory tract,

70
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,760
the gentle tract, and the alimentary canal like that normally colonize.

71
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:19,840
However, there are regions of the body that if you get a medical textbook,

72
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,380
medical textbook or microbiology textbook or some other kind of immunology textbook, you might get different answers in this.

73
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,200
But basically most other regions of the body, including the blood and lymphatic systems,

74
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:37,480
are considered to be normally sterile with no natural microbiota.

75
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,460
Hence my joke about that stating that oh yes, you're in is sterile.

76
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:47,079
Actually, it's not. It's all about what you think is sterile.

77
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,730
What is your classification?

78
00:07:48,840 --> 00:08:00,549
Okay, so if you were to tell us to pee in a cup and experiment this and then take a sample of that and put it onto an egg plate,

79
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,960
you probably wouldn't culture anything,

80
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:10,110
but if you take all that p pass it through a filter to capture anything that's left, it was concentrate the sample.

81
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:15,040
I bet my bottom dollar you have a few microbes, is it not really.

82
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,180
What we're saying is they are very, very low cell densities.

83
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:22,800
Okay. Nothing to be alarmed about. Okay.

84
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:26,140
It's like we get the dogs and they give you a blood culture, right?

85
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,630
You should come back and nothing there. But if it does, that means you've got something to be concerned about.

86
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,799
And usually if you got a block of blue culture in back, it means that like infective endocarditis,

87
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:45,310
there's that bacteria being deposited into your blood is meant to be sterile ish and the numbers are going up.

88
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:53,680
So it's all relative. It's like I think I said in class last time that there's about 10 to 5 bacteria per milliliter of water that you drink.

89
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,360
I can see a cup you get. What if that many bacteria in water and the answer is yes,

90
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:08,170
but in blood you point down to about 1 to 10 bacteria per you're lucky and so you in less than one minute per 100 miles.

91
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,550
The point is there is still bacteria in there. Okay.

92
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:17,860
It's all relative. Now let's talk about you.

93
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:28,690
Let's talk about me. Let's talk about the types of organisms that are growing in their numbers planet so that diversity and numbers of microorganisms.

94
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:32,499
When I called you all walking, talking bags of bacteria and by the way,

95
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:37,480
I call myself that a lot because I mean, I truly believe that actually you see it.

96
00:09:39,570 --> 00:09:40,860
What do we actually talk about here?

97
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:48,270
Well, depending on the literature, good back about five, six, seven, eight years ago, people would say about ten times more bacteria than human cells.

98
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,670
That makes of dogs strong and stable about the same. That is twice as many bacteria that are human.

99
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:59,300
So. So flip flopped. So really, I just tried to give you a gauge here, the rough estimate.

100
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,430
But either way, we're talking about a lot. Okay.

101
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:10,380
So normal, healthy individuals have extremely large numbers of bacteria, healthy individuals right on them.

102
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:18,000
A 2013 published estimate of an adult human was about 3.7 times 10 to 13 cells.

103
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:27,570
Okay, we're talking talking millions, tens of billions in the trillions range here.

104
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,610
Okay. So cells by 2006 estimate is about 3.9, 10 to 13.

105
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:38,700
So numbers are getting a bit more stable now. We're actually seeing that and that's inhabiting the body.

106
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:47,520
So essentially, though, as many bacterial cells as human cells, and that's why it says as many human cells of bacteria.

107
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,750
So, yes, there's 3.7% of the 13 human cells are bacteria.

108
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:55,560
So that's the number to look at really here.

109
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:05,440
He spent the second. So spend your piece of or try and get a message and trying to say is we in the trillions

110
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,690
of cells in this case that you've said that 40 trillion tubes and 30 trillion.

111
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,330
How do you use those numbers or use these numbers?

112
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:25,360
The point is that there's a lot of bacterial cells there and they are on par, if not slightly exceeding the number of human cells.

113
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,500
Do you agree with that? Yeah, good question.

114
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,390
Well, the bacteria are much more smaller. I agree with that 100%.

115
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:43,270
You know, you've got a huge serious cell. You can send a microscope here and do that bacteria cell attached to it.

116
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:48,130
But it's very, very small. So, yes, they are smaller.

117
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:51,669
So bio volume, biomass or the word you want to use?

118
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:56,680
Yes, the bacteria are smaller and as a consequence, the bacteria have less genes.

119
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:03,250
Okay. Let's take into account now. Okay. Human genome is about 4 billion base pairs.

120
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,570
That's about a thousand times large. An E coli. E coli. But.

121
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,340
In the human genome, the spaces between the genes actually junk.

122
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:16,180
There's just no genes that is into gene space. Nothing of relevance.

123
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:22,490
So basically you go about roughly eight times more genes than E coli.

124
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:26,930
Not all of them go, okay, but that's just E coli.

125
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:32,620
So 30,000 human genes versus E coli. But do you think you just completely covered in E.coli?

126
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,340
No, because staph aureus, staphylococcus aureus is difficult.

127
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,270
Epidermidis create a vaccine for Ebola, pseudomonas pe.

128
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:49,060
All of these other organisms are throughout your body. So we start taking that into account actually on a per gene level.

129
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,680
The bacteria later the way more genes. Okay.

130
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,620
Now think of. Why is that even vaguely important? You had been listening to genes.

131
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:11,360
Well, genes means capability. So these organisms are able to adapt and do things that your own body can't do.

132
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:19,840
It makes sense. So let's think about your gut for a second. You might have had a healthy breakfast this morning.

133
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,409
You might have gone to McDonald's and had a really interesting beverage this morning. I don't know.

134
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,129
We are eating habits, but one thing I do know is that whatever you eat this morning,

135
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:34,210
I'll bet my bottom dollar there's something in it that your body couldn't absorb unless a bacterium had the genes able to do it.

136
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,680
All right. So these microcosms are important.

137
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:46,590
We have these genes and they actually complement our own ability to host a neighbor on hard survival.

138
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:57,120
Pretty cool, huh? So I guess what I'm getting at here, this these slides weren't really in the previous time this class was taught before me.

139
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:03,510
But I think this is really important because I need to establish that not all white causes are bad and actually courses.

140
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,170
Your body can do good things and they're actually essential.

141
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,230
And when we start thinking about disease processes,

142
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,730
we need to think about what they are doing because first and foremost, they could be helping fight off disease.

143
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:21,420
I'll give that a few minutes. But but also balancing venting you to fight off disease, keeping you healthy.

144
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:29,810
It's kind of cool. And I'm pushing this point here.

145
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:34,180
Have a look at this. If you sit here with the slides, I take you through this, you know,

146
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,129
all these different phyla of organism cuties, proteobacteria, and she didn't break it down.

147
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:43,690
Here is Alpha, Beta, Gamma. And if you look at these different curves, the different types of.

148
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:51,740
Five Phyla testing two types of microorganisms where you are in the body takes the abundance.

149
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:59,540
Yes. Has anybody ever tried to estimate the mass of bacteria in our body?

150
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:06,770
Like how much? By weight? We are bacteria, probably.

151
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:17,270
I don't know. Actually, I don't think about seeing that. I guess a member of a man, especially the gut, like all the other stuff in there as well.

152
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,640
But it wouldn't surprise me so much to do this, and we try to point that out.

153
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:30,200
But certainly from a standpoint of genes cells, we are kind of not winning.

154
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,280
I convinced you. Yeah. Okay.

155
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:41,900
So that's two, replacing the body skin. You've all got skin, right?

156
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,330
So as to what is that?

157
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:50,860
And that's a bunch of jackasses make a joke about having skin in the game. But anyway, let's talk about skin.

158
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,130
So the skin is the most important general defense barrier against infection.

159
00:15:56,280 --> 00:16:02,170
You don't agree with that? Why is the first layer of protection if you bacteria can breach the skin?

160
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,540
That's a good way to get into the body.

161
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:13,440
So part of the innate immune system, it's there all the time and that's the natural barrier to microorganisms, is composed of several tissues.

162
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:19,470
You should know this within the absence of some sort of high school class of anatomy as epidermal,

163
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:25,410
connective, nervous and muscular components, more microbes other than commensal.

164
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,370
Now, here's a quick question.

165
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:37,380
If it brackets in here is ever no commence with our sex very quickly commences are better word innocuous just that it's no time.

166
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:43,590
The truth of matter is, human beings don't like to admit to the fact that we don't know the answer.

167
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:51,680
And I think some scientists came to work on them too, because it's like we're just recording something that I'm sometimes good that they don't.

168
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:57,149
We supposedly do anything, but I would argue they do, but we don't actually know the what we do right now.

169
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:02,390
So we call them this weird word, commensal. That means that they're not doing anything damage.

170
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,120
But I tell you that good description.

171
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,380
It's indigenous microorganisms stay all the time.

172
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:16,500
And so all organisms that are not indigenous.

173
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:24,460
I'm alluding to a word in a second I'm going to get to it, but those tend to be inactivated very, very quickly.

174
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,710
So. But it could even escape. Eat it. I shouldn't be there. Salmonella shouldn't be there.

175
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:34,110
They'll die within 20 minutes. Okay. So let me get these words.

176
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:48,780
As I said, indigenous. Actually, the actual word I was alluding to is residents and transients.

177
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:56,640
And these are often invaders, indigenous or commensal. These are transient, often also known as pathogens.

178
00:17:58,170 --> 00:18:04,920
All right. Again, how bizarre or different feels, different people's words, different ways of describing.

179
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:16,049
So the indigenous term these more for an ecology standpoint the residents is more actually of a medical term as is transients typically in the

180
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:24,870
realms of anti-immigrant antimicrobials and the salon doctors and health practitioners would talk about pathogens and healthy microorganisms.

181
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:30,000
So residents and Chinese residents are convinced that reside there.

182
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:36,690
Okay, the transients are the ones that shouldn't be there and they die really pretty darn quickly.

183
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:43,620
Now, why do they die? I mean, what's going on is processed is kind of cool.

184
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:50,910
And this actually, I should tell you what we like to do in chapter one is basically this book in a nutshell.

185
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:57,360
It's a really cool book. If you ever want to have a just kind of subject matter, it's not part of the class.

186
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:01,920
I shall be paying the first set of papers to read and have a look at shortly.

187
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:07,290
But basically this book, if you ever get to get into it, is awesome.

188
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:12,990
It's by Michael Wilson. Microbes actually have been pretty well for as long as like 20, 30 years.

189
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:22,290
Well, yeah, so that's true. In the in 19 two, I got to meet him and he, he wrote a really good book on this kind of stuff.

190
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:28,920
And actually these pictures are from this book. My apologies for terrible formatting is me trying to get a scan of this book.

191
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:43,830
So yes. And essentially they die because your body your hands and your hands and your arms and there's there's these dynamics,

192
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:47,100
if you will, in their sebaceous glands.

193
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:54,090
And these pits produce sebaceous material, which are basically fatty acid seeping like material,

194
00:19:54,390 --> 00:20:01,500
which actually causes the page to drop and page to go to 5.5.

195
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:13,680
Okay. Which makes it inhospitable for many organisms, apart from the things I want to know in the commercials as anti-microbial is in there as well.

196
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:16,880
So basically when we called them commensal,

197
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:25,140
we're not really it's not true to said it is that if they are adapted to be there, they've gotten used to being there.

198
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:31,980
And the other organs that come into the pathogens are not used to being there and just they die.

199
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,850
That's the truth of the matter. Does that make sense?

200
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,670
I like these images. I love this. Do you see a pattern there?

201
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,900
Yeah. So this is doing a study of actual micrograph.

202
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:58,440
And what you actually see is, say the head to head cells grabbing at cell junctions of a skin head.

203
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:06,310
And here you see that growing and then that nesting for a really cool nesting at the cellular junctions.

204
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:12,710
All right. So it's pretty cool dive in any these aureus is very common stuff.

205
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:23,259
They do I mean it's very common to give skin like proportion will be there that won't be there because eco salmonella pseudomonas,

206
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:29,469
which knows it's of Asia. These are nasty beasties in general that you really didn't want that in the first place.

207
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:38,470
And basically through the nature of your skin and the microbes on there, they would survive fatal regressions.

208
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:47,080
Yeah. For people with actually dry skin, are they more at risk for an infection?

209
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,230
Yeah. Yes, absolutely. Yes.

210
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:56,319
So it's been quite an experience, actually, in the winter time.

211
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:03,700
I always get red face and use the cold weather. I get like actually using my face to to my not ugly stuff.

212
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:08,079
And that is because of the saying that you basically have skin drying out.

213
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:13,630
Yeah. The effectiveness of all of that pushes getting all the commensal bacterial cells actually dying.

214
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:24,070
It is a problem. Yes. So I think that, uh, actually, I should mention if you go the opposite direction.

215
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:32,709
So if I told you before about the chronically with Christopher Reeve in the last lecture I mentioned about how had a chronic wound that was because it

216
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:39,940
was a very moist environment where his patients would wait on the the wheelchair

217
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,860
and that in a college like audience at home because you have problems.

218
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,400
I think it is a balance. Um, but yeah.

219
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:53,230
Dry skin, not a good thing. Good question. Any other questions we could say for.

220
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:59,950
Okay. I love this picture for two reasons.

221
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:08,350
One, okay, so I should mention I cite a lot and this and I do that.

222
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:14,229
So I get the benefits. When I get things quote, I do it. One, because I mean, no, I'm not faking it.

223
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:22,450
So I make it kind of thing. I'm joking. But my point is that I'm going to try to give you a so to show you that I've gone to the actual source,

224
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:25,930
pulled it out and I'm talking about that and it's a real thing.

225
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:32,440
And not only that, but from a copyright standpoint, I like to try and from an intellectual standpoint,

226
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,670
I like to if I knew where something came from and look at it, forget how I could put it in that cited.

227
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:45,250
And I like this because this diagram shows not only the basic structure of the skin, but bacteria on it.

228
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:49,800
And that's missing from this picture. But the gross anatomy you,

229
00:23:49,990 --> 00:24:01,389
me on this is the same as this copyright because my sense of humor that this pictures in 1980 copy twice over so I

230
00:24:01,390 --> 00:24:06,940
don't even need to say it but I did where they get it from 20 of US edition of Gray's Anatomy of the Human Body.

231
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,409
Don't ask me how I got that picture, but if you look at that and compare that to this one,

232
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:16,600
not much has changed apart, for one thing, inclusion of microorganisms.

233
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:25,390
And we've become really aware now of the importance of those microorganisms in preventing disease,

234
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:30,400
promoting health or in the case of pathogens coming in causing disease.

235
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:41,209
Okay. So I feel I just put that there's a bit of a as a fun thing that not much difference what we know in the 1900s of gross anatomy.

236
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,800
But the microbiology has covered leaps and bounds.

237
00:24:47,150 --> 00:24:53,690
Sound good? Oh, like my favorite place in the body for my research.

238
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:57,860
Anyway, the oral cavity in your pharynx. So this bit.

239
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,120
Okay, let's talk about this for a few minutes. Then the skin must move on to the mouth.

240
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,959
So back to the most numerous, about 10 to 10 inhabitants.

241
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,320
The normal mouth and throat and yeast and protozoa code.

242
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:16,460
Many individuals, yes. So I use that. If you think of antibiotics or you immunosuppressed, we have a certain set of certain conditions.

243
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:23,240
The yeast can outgrow the bacteria and you can get all thrush also affected oral

244
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:30,710
candidiasis but in general of bacteria when it's both a good thing and a bad thing,

245
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:37,220
the bad thing is in most instances, what good things it keeps the other things at bay that is our and yeasts.

246
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,160
The bad thing is they can go a little bit long.

247
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:50,450
What I mean by that is the microorganism have now some of them can start causing disease and it's not their fault.

248
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:54,240
I would argue as a very powerful statement to make no extremity second before

249
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,490
way to actually say I'm going to be talking to this one organism in a second.

250
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:06,690
There are quite a few of you right now, about 500 species of bacteria in each of your mouth.

251
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,450
I don't care if you have babies chewing gum. I don't care if you brush your teeth with X, Y, Z products.

252
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:15,560
You go about 500 species in your mouth right now, all interacting with each other.

253
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:24,770
You do something else I want to get into now, and that is you have good old health, better than mine.

254
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,280
But it's my I told you before when my own health isn't brilliant.

255
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:41,780
But one thing that I do know about the American commercial world and I know this because my children seven and 13, what do they have in common?

256
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:46,550
Can the fizzy drinks they love that stuff, right?

257
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:53,569
As a consequence of sugars being put on more of a lot of foods, you consume it and expect a lot.

258
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:57,080
Processed foods and peas has sugar in it.

259
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:05,310
Why? It can be sugar in all these things. Additives we've seen explosion in the developed world of a growth of microwaves.

260
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,440
It really shouldn't be. Doing much in our mouths is called streptococcus mutant.

261
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:14,600
Streptococcus mutant is actually have eugenic or carrier eugenic meaning.

262
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,030
Posh word meaning causing tooth decay.

263
00:27:18,450 --> 00:27:30,650
So in your mouth you have all these organisms because of our modern day society, encouraging or encouraging nay, providing all these foodstuffs.

264
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:35,220
You should doing it. We have a big problem.

265
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:40,770
And these organisms thrive. How do they thrive and produce?

266
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:50,340
Do you have some sucrose? Quite a few cans. That is basically sugary polymers, long chains of sugary stuff.

267
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,090
Okay. I won't go with the actual words you use right now.

268
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:55,590
I will tell you that later on.

269
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,500
But if you have in my previous classes on the say EPS estimates, one aspect of this is the basically long sugary stuff that makes me sticky.

270
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:09,280
So stick to your teeth. And I should mention that I won't show it here.

271
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,700
We've actually got images in my lab showing bacteria that should be turned into sugary environments,

272
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,010
coming down onto surfaces and sticking with images.

273
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,630
Image in 3D. And it's absolutely shocking to see how quickly it doesn't.

274
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,150
But not only that, it's making this sticky layer okay.

275
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:35,009
It also produces acid. It breaks down sucrose to make lactic acid, which cause your teeth into minerals.

276
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,540
And OJ you now have tooth decay. And this is a huge problem.

277
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:46,230
Okay. And this makes it more interesting because that shows that the other bacteria in then get incorporated

278
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:53,850
in and it becomes a big sticky mess of actions not down here shoulders and big sticky metastable,

279
00:28:54,270 --> 00:29:01,920
huge pyramids. And these bacteria can then basically form these bubbles, if you will, of bacteria,

280
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:08,639
big masses underneath because of that, breaking down the sugar, making acid that minimizes the sequence.

281
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:14,310
We have white spots of your teeth and elsewhere in the body at back to the other

282
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:18,570
stuff to make it stick to get to your mouth so it can stick to your tongue,

283
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:20,100
your cheeks. Okay.

284
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:27,990
We went to purchase a little poison ivy that we can get into fairly recently because we always find them as a bacteria in your mouth.

285
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,180
Okay. Even so, send me the general dental work.

286
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:42,350
But even vigorous toothbrushing can actually lead to transient bacteria.

287
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:47,220
That's the beginning of our class where I said that. Bacteria in your blood.

288
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,950
Guess what? I think you.

289
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:56,310
If you were to sample your blood after dental work, you would find more bacteria in your blood than you would before dental work.

290
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:03,350
I don't know. Blow your mind for one more second. They've been shellacked in this class.

291
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:06,800
Last time at Ford, O'Neil used up tacos, go down the aisle and went, hang on.

292
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:13,760
So no laugh. We were attentive. Always include Streptococcus, Gordo, anything related to streptococcus new tax.

293
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:21,840
It's called deal one. Interesting story behind that.

294
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,640
His original name wasn't dropped because Forward is the one.

295
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:34,290
It was one before that it was vv2 88 and before that it was chalice chalice in all these numbers before.

296
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:40,140
Now why chalice that the original name Chalice was the name of the person that died from that bacteria.

297
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:49,709
It was a dental organ and this individual had poor health spent from his gums to his heart, gave infective endocarditis killed over.

298
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,010
He died, they said, would be dying because of his chest.

299
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:56,399
But what's all this white stuff? White said it was like dental.

300
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:04,230
Black was covering his heart. That's what it was. Kind of icky, but true.

301
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:11,430
Okay. Obviously, over the years, we're like, oh, maybe we shouldn't really call it name and organ after dead person.

302
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:19,770
So that is also the reason why is a biosafety level two always in a biosafety level one which most Americans are because they can it now.

303
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:24,600
That's not to say does that this person I think but I've never seen that in long time.

304
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,760
This was a long, long time ago. We're talking about in the 1950s, I think it was.

305
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:37,210
But either way, the point I'm trying to make is. You have to remember second class.

306
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:42,690
We have a magic about that. You can say the eyes of the doorway to the soul.

307
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:46,790
Your mouth is the doorway to your heart. Think about it for a second.

308
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:51,470
So, yeah, all these things can be pretty scary in the mouth.

309
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,130
Now, when you think about scary, have it in here.

310
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:59,450
No. I think I skipped a bit. I took the slide out, but I move it.

311
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:08,660
I did move it and move it today. So I will tell you right now, though, and a slide up is a little later on the I put some activity into this.

312
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:16,879
I've got a feel of it. How many people do you think have got tooth decay in the last half century?

313
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:25,450
Face have or had. Creating a billion.

314
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,030
Dublin 2 billion.

315
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:41,420
Over 2 billion people in this world have or have had tooth decay, and the vast majority of them got it when they were just children in Michigan.

316
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,260
You have actually got children who have active tooth decay.

317
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,670
They can't even chew or talk properly because of it. Okay.

318
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:54,860
This is actually from The New Yorker. So these issues we're talking about are real.

319
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:58,100
Yes. What is the cavity again? Yes.

320
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:02,719
Thank you. So a cavity caries is cavities.

321
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,070
Cavities is tooth. Decay is all the same. It just depends, again, who you're talking to.

322
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:11,180
That's a great question. Thank you. Yes. So that's exactly what it is.

323
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:17,930
After I have I've had two fillings. Of course I had a British accent joking.

324
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:24,030
But yeah, it's very, very common. Yeah, I don't there's a clear answer to this,

325
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:30,410
but how do you balance using antimicrobials during treatment to prevent this bacteria

326
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:37,710
and then actually making sure that you don't typically wipe out the microbiome?

327
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:44,460
Great question. So what you basically want to preserve the microbiota, but also within entering the bodies every time I say.

328
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,680
Yeah, that's a great question.

329
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:54,750
So entry into the body, I think that really, unless you're doing severe dental work, the amount of entry is hideous and it's also about sustained.

330
00:33:55,110 --> 00:34:02,070
This person telling about Janice actually to be brutally honest, always and I think got in there for a different reason.

331
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,580
Yep. Disease, not not tooth decay.

332
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,909
Actually, you had periodontal disease in the class.

333
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:14,010
When it comes, just the tooth decay can happen. The bacteria under the gum suspect that way.

334
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:22,709
I think it's all linked by not brushing your teeth and good oral health, but getting it into your body is a big problem.

335
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:28,090
I think if you're doing major work because then it's all about dosing and longevity of the dose.

336
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:32,640
So when you have wisdom teeth pulled, then you might consider taking antibiotics beforehand.

337
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:37,829
Yeah, yeah. Like you said, I'm actually in dental school and that's a thing they talk about.

338
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:43,410
If your patient is immune compromised, they'll treat with antibiotics before like a large surgery.

339
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,950
And it's just a feeling it's usually fine, but yeah, very, very scale.

340
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:54,420
Like definitely you'll get an antibiotic before, especially because that's kind of the major setback for endocarditis.

341
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,680
That's the main. You heard about the good news story from Chris in class.

342
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:03,950
I didn't know he didn't care about that. You're not going to potentially like that.

343
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,610
A group of us, Howard Jenkins, if you're going to be told what you doing, have a history of these organisms.

344
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:12,839
But it's fascinating. You think about it. So you've had a good chunk of this before.

345
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,709
That sounds good. Yeah. It's fascinating when you think about it,

346
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:27,360
just how organs can be opportunities and how we are changing our overuse in our bodies based upon the the world that is right now.

347
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:33,520
You know, sugar wasn't really in our diet. Go back a good few hundred years ago, okay.

348
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:39,000
And see those cavities, tooth decay cavities back then.

349
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:48,900
Now it's a big, huge problem. Yeah, that's like antiseptic, but not floss is a big difference in that balance between good bacteria.

350
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,880
Yes. With the caveat being and which ones you use.

351
00:35:54,930 --> 00:36:06,030
So there's Listerine, there's Colgate, there's all sorts of different companies that Listerine is Johnson,

352
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:10,200
Johnson, Colgate in the collection, for example, total toothpaste.

353
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:16,890
P&G is Crest. They all have slightly different ingredients and claims they want to have different effects is

354
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:22,120
actually that's actually a completely different topic and I guess my big five or seven classes.

355
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,860
So yeah that that is good question. It all comes down to your regimen of community and flossing as well.

356
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,720
So all okay, so let's move down to your general treatment.

357
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,980
So you tend to view it as normally sterile.

358
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,499
Okay, anticipation is flushed with you and every our invading microbes we have problems

359
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:48,450
in gaining access and becoming established in the bladder is flushing out.

360
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,959
You know that could be gave up, right? So that's where we flush out our blood pressure.

361
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,610
Any invading always as it might have up at some level. Okay.

362
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:04,709
However, bladder infections are 14 times more common in women compared to men is probably because of the female you.

363
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:10,600
Reflex is due to the bladder is about 50 say five centimeters long versus about 20%.

364
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,660
Keep yourself in the male. It's clear anatomical point here.

365
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:18,269
But also infections.

366
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:28,349
Are men and women more common in the elderly and certainly immunocompromised individuals because obviously we can't fight off that much.

367
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:33,240
And actually, as you get older, you can be more dehydrated as well. So that's what's going on there.

368
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:38,040
I start to come in pictures here and I really would like to talk about this a little bit later on.

369
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:44,220
E-coli, there's something really terribly cool.

370
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:54,780
I mean by that is how beauties develop is all about how E.coli can actually hide in cells and form intracellular by them,

371
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,790
break out every so often spread around, cause damage to think about can like anything it's really cool.

372
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:07,799
So does that sound pretty cool to you guys to later on the glass okay and then I like to do is what they told me about

373
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:16,860
I mentioned in the silver family how okay like how do these bacteria take molecular tie in how these things stick.

374
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,120
It's really cool and actually polite in general.

375
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:29,420
There's always different classes. Somewhat even. Not only the user stickiness, but like microbial lapses that nights and the lands.

376
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,350
They go off each other with labs things, bacteria do the same thing.

377
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:38,210
So I'm using this as a tool to give you some indication of what's in the future.

378
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:45,440
Uh, in vagina, vaginas with vagina has no particular surprising mechanism.

379
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:52,370
We call that what's happening right now. How often? Puberty men and boys of vaginal epithelium contains glycogen.

380
00:38:53,190 --> 00:39:00,650
That's interesting. As basic, which is metabolite metabolized again, much like in the skin by certain commensal organisms.

381
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:06,170
The sensitivities, the vegetables are lactobacilli lactic acid species.

382
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:11,570
Okay. And they basically make lactic acid.

383
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,870
Does that ring a bell? I just took that lactic acid in the mouth.

384
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:20,640
Streptococci. Break down sugars and carbohydrates to make lactic acid with.

385
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:25,760
Same thing is happening in the vagina. And that produces lactic acid.

386
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,620
And lactic acid has a page about it. And together with other parents metabolism.

387
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:40,220
This inhibits colonization by all but the lactobacilli and a few less about a select number of to species that are really low numbers,

388
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:45,890
hard to even culture and we don't know much about in regards to their their behavior and genetics.

389
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:52,940
Many lactobacilli also could use hydrogen peroxide.

390
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:59,680
So not only are they lowering the H, but they're also producing hydrogen peroxide,

391
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:03,909
which, as you probably all know, hydrogen peroxide we use as an anti-microbial.

392
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:10,420
We use it when we have a DNA agent. Most isolation that we there's actually two of now washes that use hydrogen peroxide.

393
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:19,660
It's a Colgate product. So these organisms that are protecting the vagina basically produce compounds and product protection system.

394
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:25,900
So pretty cool, huh? This can be used for destruction of adjacent organisms and mixed cultures,

395
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:32,290
particularly in presence of folks thinking that, hey, I don't want it to last, but here we got enough to figure that out.

396
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:42,460
You remember the hydrogen peroxide. Okay. That's the maybe it causes the the the killing of the other organisms.

397
00:40:43,450 --> 00:40:50,800
Okay. And the hydrogen peroxide kills it. The bacteria, fungi, viruses and even cancer cells.

398
00:40:54,600 --> 00:41:03,180
As a consequence, secretions usually contain about 10 to 8 bacteria so super high, but enough to offer protection.

399
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,110
Any questions? Okay.

400
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,590
Or intestinal tract. Okay. So the stomach is still the stomach moving way down.

401
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:22,310
Okay. Despite large numbers of bacteria which can enter the stomach mixed with the food, that low gastric funa,

402
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:29,739
that stomach stomachs and acidity kind of feel take in these what is to have as you

403
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:34,990
guys take these carbonate tablets after seven so yeah so you chose ourselves is to

404
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:40,510
remove to to reduce acidity begin me though in normal healthy situation it's less

405
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:45,909
than two to by the way is decreasing level we're getting close battery acid level.

406
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:54,730
Okay a sufficiently anti-microbial though that only low counts of lactobacilli tend to tend to overeat.

407
00:41:57,380 --> 00:42:07,760
Now, not to be silly can be expensive and then come back to do some easing of the back to actually tell an audience of some time to come.

408
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:17,390
Basically, inhospitable environment is incredibly acidic and those organs that are in there also produce anti-microbial compounds.

409
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:24,990
Thought that what foods contain high numbers of contain high numbers of lactobacilli.

410
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:30,000
You know, some of the things that comes up yogurt.

411
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,380
So every time you'll go, right, um, that is exactly it.

412
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:40,920
So if you take large amounts in yogurt, you're potentially bolstering the number of lactobacilli in your stomach.

413
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:45,750
And further down in the small and large intestines as well is actually a good thing.

414
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:50,010
There's been some beautiful papers done by a gentleman called Gregor Reid.

415
00:42:50,430 --> 00:43:00,809
Gregor Reid actually mixed lactobacilli with E Coli and showed really this and it's really cool that they had to be specifically recognized,

416
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:04,920
ignored or explicitly recognized. E.coli binds to it and to.

417
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:11,050
It's not cool. So if you are getting E.coli infections, eat yogurt.

418
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:17,110
I kind of joke that part of me is not joking. It's an interesting story is developing right now.

419
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:28,220
Um. Okay. Another key thing here is interesting as well as conditions which increase then allow survival of increasing numbers of types of organisms.

420
00:43:28,490 --> 00:43:33,850
So if you make it less acidic, yes, you will get other organs and then colonizing.

421
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:41,740
So you have to ask the question if somebody is perpetually taking out the sound system, is this something else?

422
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:50,480
To baseball. Tums. Tums. I've never been taking this step, but we seem to wonder what happens if you do.

423
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:55,460
Because then you're potentially reducing your stomach acid.

424
00:43:55,490 --> 00:44:02,150
You won't be dissolving food in the same way. And that might cause you to survive, which then can go into your small or large intestine.

425
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:07,820
Is the thought process there being 21 volunteers?

426
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:16,040
The exact doses. Oh, by the way, I should say this. What I'm about to tell you was not done like yesterday or last year or the last decade.

427
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:20,269
Okay? This would not happen past university stages.

428
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:23,060
Nowadays, we have to take an institutional review board.

429
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:30,050
If you did this now, I wouldn't be on board the institutional biosafety committee, so I would not be happy.

430
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:37,400
Um, but, yeah, so they give you this gives you that money to come on target audience as you drank different doses of Vibrio cholerae.

431
00:44:37,690 --> 00:44:42,169
That's. Oh, wait, that's not good side percentages. So give you a color.

432
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:51,379
It causes cholera suspended in 60. My colleagues it's a milliliters of saline demonstrated 10,000 fold increase in sepsis ability to

433
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:58,730
cholera if neutralizing sodium bicarbonate was included with the dose containing the bacteria to words.

434
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:10,700
This study gave people cholera and said, Drink this and if you happen to have the cup that also has the bicarbonate in it, you probably get cholera.

435
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,460
But if you don't, you won't. So drink up.

436
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:22,520
The point being for the study was to show that you see the acidity of your stomach actually protects you from harmful organisms.

437
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:26,630
This study was done a long time ago. That's what I'm going to say on that one.

438
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:31,130
And it wasn't done. It was not done by me. Okay.

439
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:40,370
Um. So there's going to be a whole study in contrast to give me a color line, however shigella species I want to revisit.

440
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:50,500
She got a huge head of shigella here. One. Anyone else should get a actually better way of thinking, but it is very similar to E coli.

441
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:56,170
It doesn't sound as scary as eco and I don't know why hasn't been jumped on this.

442
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:59,560
Oftentimes you hear the CDC warns there's an e coli outbreak.

443
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:05,530
Chances are it's a minor and she got up. But unfortunately, the name sticks and it works.

444
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:10,600
Stick with it. So people haven't really. People haven't really adopted that name.

445
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:18,340
So in contrast to Vivian Conway, she got a species of tape of causing disease upon ingestion of a very low dose of bacteria.

446
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,680
How low we're talking about here, you know, large amounts of vibrio.

447
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:30,550
We're talking like thousands. Substantial perception of volunteers interested in it.

448
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:35,270
Not that basically fed ex dysentery aspects.

449
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:41,830
No. So I got ill from doses of 100 to 500 bacterial cells.

450
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:47,270
And 10%. Good luck. Got even this ten months out.

451
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:51,140
Does that tell you something? How infected this organism is. Okay.

452
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:55,910
And it's not clear why humans are so susceptible to these low doses.

453
00:46:55,940 --> 00:47:02,470
I mean, one theory is they should get particularly resistant to gastric acids back to that whole thing about you can

454
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:10,540
actually have a nice acidic stomach and especially when you get out in station face to face in a station face.

455
00:47:10,770 --> 00:47:15,230
You know what I mean by that a little bit is if you grow a bacterium.

456
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:23,549
Edit2 Why? It's not a good one. All right, so you start off with and then suddenly explodes.

457
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:29,190
Not really getting rid of apathy and all the nutrients are used up and it's going to stop growing.

458
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:35,250
So you have played that graph of that out as time is cells.

459
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,040
It looks something like that. Does that ring a bell?

460
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:51,640
Yeah. So that stationary phase, it's an exponential phase is rapidly drag.

461
00:47:55,610 --> 00:48:02,570
Also referred to as locomotives. I use that as well.

462
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:07,219
And this down here, you're wondering what is called and that's getting used to things.

463
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:11,090
It's called blackface. Okay.

464
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:19,790
Everyone's seen or heard this work. Yes. Is it kind of like the carrying capacity of it or is it different?

465
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:25,400
Because you're actually is an interesting point because maybe that's what really goes overboard big time today.

466
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:31,309
This is COO discussions. So what you see here and that's said nothing's really growing.

467
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:37,070
That's actually not true. Some are dying. Some are growing, but there's no net increase anymore.

468
00:48:39,020 --> 00:48:42,380
So when you said that, I got me thinking is carrying capacity.

469
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:47,090
Kind of think of it that way. But it's basically there's no overall growth anymore.

470
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,390
Loss is equal to gain.

471
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:00,379
Any questions? Yeah, it's just a general question and I'm sure we'll cover it more in the future.

472
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,110
But how? Why do we have so much bacteria in our gut?

473
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:07,400
It's so difficult for so many to enter through the stomach.

474
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,860
And then it's also difficult to handle to let people in your track with vaginas.

475
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:15,110
And so it's a great question.

476
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:18,590
It's down to pure biomass and rate of movement to it.

477
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:20,059
So you've actually preemptive.

478
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:28,510
And it's like in a minute when I talk about in a small intestine right to the top, it's moving fast throughout the stomach into there.

479
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:35,329
Who's fast is that speed? And because everything still hasn't really been digested yet, the bacteria aren't really multiplying.

480
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:42,170
They're getting much of it. Normally bacteria appeared. As you get further down, things slowed down and then go back to cells.

481
00:49:42,170 --> 00:49:48,829
Unique species is shooting up because the big mass, you know,

482
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:56,870
their body can't how to even treat that you know why that why they move them because in fact the microbes is doing a good task.

483
00:49:56,870 --> 00:50:00,140
So it's just a total mass thing.

484
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:06,740
Okay, great question. So I said here, what is stationary phase here?

485
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:12,560
Stationary phase is this. And I should mention, is this in a cell to slow, very stressed out.

486
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:21,790
Okay. And because they're in this phase, it's been shown that they are actually much harder to kill than when this vaccine.

487
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:33,860
The best analogy I can have but this is that something that is highly active is like and gets injured is likely to get incredibly stressed.

488
00:50:33,950 --> 00:50:37,700
Stress is usually what kills things, not necessarily injury.

489
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:41,180
Okay, but it's stationary phase.

490
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:44,209
There's more going into like a dormant lethargic state.

491
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:49,670
They don't really care. It means the that the stress responses are sort of muted a little bit.

492
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:53,420
So therefore you try and treat these guys.

493
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:59,030
They don't respond to the same way, more recalcitrant, more tolerant to and to my goodness sense.

494
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:05,250
Okay. All right. Yes.

495
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:13,410
I'm small. He was a big star of the 1990. Observed that most while being also fairly acid resistant.

496
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:19,600
That makes perfect sense because she got an equally incredibly closely related and often misinterpreted to be different.

497
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:25,050
The ID is a bit confused and I'll get to the ID business next.

498
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:29,640
I'll be going to talk to on genetics. Okay.

499
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:39,440
I'm not sure. She mentioned the theory that she got to survive by rapidly if they think that she cannot be themselves.

500
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,750
And that is true as well. We'll get into that.

501
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:49,010
I think that's going to be on a one or two lectures, depending on progress we make and see thinks of how the organic nature of that super scary stuff.

502
00:51:49,250 --> 00:51:53,870
I like that maybe in that topic. So you seven good topic one right now.

503
00:51:54,860 --> 00:52:01,520
Okay. So let's talk about the intestines, the small intestine.

504
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:04,790
Great question about you know, these are all things that are in there,

505
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:10,990
the flowing through the gut intestines in this case, the stomach and the small intestine.

506
00:52:12,550 --> 00:52:23,240
And then it goes into the large intestine. And then the flow rate of the gut contents is greatest at the top of the small intestine.

507
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:33,200
Michael On notification of the contents, we cannot usually overcome the weight, the organisms having moved the masses by peristalsis pushing down.

508
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:39,950
So really once I get some words, is biofilm versus planktonic.

509
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:46,070
So if you know much of a biofilm as a biochemist basically start off oral discussions in class,

510
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:51,980
it's bacteria to stuff, to a surface to planktonic plankton like just floating around.

511
00:52:52,880 --> 00:53:01,900
If you've got high flow rates, bacteria can't contain on biofilms and then quickly moves downstream and common sense.

512
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:06,740
Right. And that's what's happening right on top of small intestine.

513
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:12,230
Limited biofilm growth, high throughput, and also just push down.

514
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:20,040
But as it starts slowing down. So it's not slowing down.

515
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:25,410
Then you start getting deposition of bacteria on the surfaces and forming a biofilm.

516
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:32,430
That would be further down the end of this whole intestine and towards the large, large intestine.

517
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:39,930
So therefore, the small yet the small intestine has very little microbial camps where the lower small intestine contains

518
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:45,270
a microbiota that much more closely approximate the large intestine slowing down before it's too large.

519
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:48,660
The larger orders compact. Something like a big trash compactor.

520
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:52,770
Nice description. Sound good?

521
00:53:55,620 --> 00:54:04,060
Not a large intestine where all the fun happens. It contains about 3.9 to 1013 back to the most bacteria.

522
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:10,750
So if you had a say in your body where the most bacteria is in your large intestine and

523
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:18,940
is consisting of several hundred bacterial species and most of these are anaerobic okay.

524
00:54:19,950 --> 00:54:31,020
In healthy hosts coexist with that one to a human having done this basically I think there's a whole mixture and actually some beautiful work.

525
00:54:31,290 --> 00:54:40,890
I think of a name as one struggling. And I was saying that she's at Cornell Loose Life Professor Ruth living a lot of work on this.

526
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:51,630
Um, and to me looking at the gut microbiota in humans and animals and actually asking the question of what do you mean by healthy?

527
00:54:52,410 --> 00:55:03,990
And that's a really tough question to ask because of what you might consider healthy or the US surgeon might consider,

528
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:10,710
uh, healthy may not be what the European countries had surgeon want to say.

529
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:24,760
You look at the gut microbiota of individual say in some small Leicester countries it's different I so some reason but we don't have enough data.

530
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:35,160
Okay. So does the absence of that mean that they, uh, that we are no longer healthy out of it is obesity is on the rise in the US.

531
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,800
So what proportion of the US population do you think is now obese?

532
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:45,170
Or at. It's worse than I think it's pretty good.

533
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,360
40% are now obese.

534
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:52,080
Now, one can make the argument that because you're obese, I mean, you know, healthy.

535
00:55:52,230 --> 00:55:58,920
I agree with that. But we start looking at the change in the microbes in the gut, and that's what we've been doing.

536
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:06,820
And she's been showing that that is a change between two dominant roles in what's called bacteroidetes and infinitives.

537
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:12,930
And their balance is shift according to obesity and being overweight.

538
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:21,330
And there's also association these organisms for some general health as well.

539
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:25,140
So it's all up in the air. And right now, people don't really know.

540
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,750
And it's really right now about they're saying, what is the one thing that is missing?

541
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:34,440
Key question, why are they there?

542
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:44,220
So, for example, you just say that Femi Kuti is associated or some accuse him of are associated with individuals that are overweight.

543
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:52,320
Is that because of the famine or is that because of a guy taking the active is going on here?

544
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:59,280
And so there is no play on. It's just purely right now but like stamp collecting where they basically say,

545
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:04,350
let's go over here and figure out what's stamped always with this individual has this one here.

546
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,219
This is an interesting observation. Does it hold it in scientifically reproducible?

547
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:12,210
Was the advertisement bigger, so, so forth? We're at that level right now.

548
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,060
What's fascinating is when you think about it,

549
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:21,989
if we could potentially craft our own communities to do certain things in health and disease, and I'll get that in a minute,

550
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:27,970
as well as something else, as are the other complex ecological systems,

551
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:37,200
the initial microbial types inhabiting a baby or previously germ free in a way that has no microbes in the baby's gut.

552
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:41,040
So what's the big sector change?

553
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:50,390
From birth. And there's an environment. In the environment, there's a succession of different microbial communities, not organisms, communities.

554
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:56,080
The progression to a stable climate stage is reached. I think it's a really good question.

555
00:57:56,520 --> 00:58:03,720
What else do we do in the developed world that is less often seen in the developing world when babies are born?

556
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:11,249
U.S. C-sections as well. That's coming to light right now.

557
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:14,880
But I'm thinking beyond that, thinking about nutrition.

558
00:58:15,230 --> 00:58:19,740
Restaurant, you said it's just baby food versus baby food.

559
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:26,220
Yeah. So do you think that mother's milk is similar in composition to baby food?

560
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:34,770
Nope. Okay. And that it's been the subject of intense scrutiny over the last few years as well.

561
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:39,080
So. Actually, I don't think so.

562
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:45,210
Full disclosure, this was in my lab. So you notice in the cabinets we have for our growth media.

563
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:48,690
Did you ever look at top baby as baby food there?

564
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:53,430
So we started a study admitted covariance. We gave out and we got to give it to him at another time.

565
00:58:53,670 --> 00:59:02,190
But we're thinking about what organs growth best own egg containing baby food versus other kinds of food substitutes and things like that.

566
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:08,190
Right. So you could imagine that different kinds of nutrients provide support for different kinds of microbes,

567
00:59:08,550 --> 00:59:15,040
and that would then set the stage for these communities to then be altered and potentially lead to an altered adult community.

568
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:20,850
Pretty cool, huh? Uh, again, no one knows.

569
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:25,430
I thought put that out there because I'd be willing to open this business document from

570
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:33,660
this paper from the at points and Hurriyet and they talk about in utero birth defects,

571
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:45,960
gastrointestinal age, birth mode, the C-section with the, um, breast milk formula changes, differences in the community reading age and so forth.

572
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,700
So getting what is healthy. All right. Okay.

573
00:59:51,570 --> 00:59:57,700
All right. Any questions? Large intestine.

574
00:59:58,150 --> 01:00:01,330
There has been an explosion of information on the large intestine.

575
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:06,550
The this reveals the plague and health and disease, but we still don't know what's going on.

576
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:12,250
A few bits of information. One of the interesting observations about the gut microbiota in different individuals and different animals.

577
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:17,890
There was huge variability at the higher taxonomic levels there.

578
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:21,970
Only a limited number of predominant hints of this a few minutes ago.

579
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:33,960
The bacterial thing that is funny as well as having agency or down here is that the bacteria he said have barbecue's very good so.

580
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:42,010
And of course as a consequence of that but are really interested in those divisions.

581
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:51,160
Now. We think about what's happening in the name of skin in your mouth.

582
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:56,170
Okay. There's a really interesting paper being put out by Realme and I'm going to put this paper up.

583
01:00:56,170 --> 01:00:56,940
We have a look at it.

584
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:05,920
I'll just describe it and if you put it under the car reading, but if you you just need to have a quick look at which is this one figurehead.

585
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,490
I mean, you look at and I'll explain it to you and if you don't understand it,

586
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:13,660
go back and read the paper goes up, have a look at it, but I'll take you through it.

587
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:17,380
It's a really interesting concept. It's very easy to understand.

588
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,810
And here we go. So please think about the body, for example, of a skin.

589
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:28,200
Okay, you have moisture. So sebaceous glands, rhizomes.

590
01:01:29,050 --> 01:01:31,270
Okay, about that question earlier, what about skin? Right.

591
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:40,930
So you have community not don't think of as individuals thinking think like cities of microbes like cities and microbes that exist.

592
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,520
Okay. Um, and they are growing there now.

593
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:51,600
I kind of like think of these cities as being mobile cities, okay?

594
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:56,440
And that's not in mobile per say, but in their composition.

595
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,810
So species can then disappear, other ones can come in, and therefore they cater to different conditions.

596
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:09,540
So this mobile here basically is a bit like a sheet of paper, okay?

597
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:15,250
A landscape, if you will, and you have a community settling in in particular condition.

598
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:19,390
And it's hard to change that community composition.

599
01:02:20,050 --> 01:02:21,760
It's robust. It settles in there.

600
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:29,500
It's like a ball and a piece of fabric for this game is that kids used to play the ball and then the whole I mean, these are like a nice thing.

601
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:38,020
Okay, but if you have bigger movements, the ball will move and this ball moves to stable state to stay in that position.

602
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:45,790
And that is how we should think about community, to think of communities as being this complex multi species thing.

603
01:02:46,270 --> 01:02:50,829
It takes a lot to move and change and it moves in, changes.

604
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:57,580
You occupy a new position. A new steady state is the best way to think about it.

605
01:02:57,850 --> 01:03:04,450
Is this you think, in a bowl, on a clock, rolling around states associated with health or disease.

606
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:15,490
So if you have a community that is in your mouth, say, by him analyzing it and it stays that you drink coffee, go to problem.

607
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,809
Okay, it's embedded. It's in there, not physically in itself.

608
01:03:20,810 --> 01:03:27,070
What you see inside, it's stable, drinking coffee, brushing your teeth.

609
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:30,490
It doesn't really change that community composition, but that needs to come.

610
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:34,270
An interest in Cigarets you stop smoking heavily.

611
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:45,070
That is a sustained shaking like effects like you mentioned that of the standpoint really changes the composition as it moves into a steady state.

612
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:50,560
To get back to steady state one, you're going to have to stop smoking.

613
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:57,910
And if you are lucky, lucky, it might go back, but it might not because that makes sense.

614
01:03:58,750 --> 01:04:04,270
So really stick a device in the land and you've got to move the communities and different divisions.

615
01:04:04,270 --> 01:04:09,160
But it has to be a substantial change in the environment, the conditions and when it moves,

616
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:15,219
not only do you figure it is like movement, first of all, Cooper is actually changing as community.

617
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:22,450
So in case of smoking, this community, this here could be thought of as a streptococcus.

618
01:04:22,450 --> 01:04:26,950
Which community? What do we know about smoking? You don't do disease, bleeding gums, right?

619
01:04:27,790 --> 01:04:33,190
That new community poisoning. But historically speaking, it's moved.

620
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:37,200
Obviously it hasn't moved in two, but it has changed. We were more stable.

621
01:04:37,210 --> 01:04:41,230
Now we're about gingivitis in there, causing it on a disease.

622
01:04:43,030 --> 01:04:49,180
What this message basically is saying is that when you have a stable community, it's hard to change it.

623
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:53,800
But if you do enough perturbation, you'll change it and you may not get it back again.

624
01:04:55,250 --> 01:05:00,910
So that makes sense. And. That's where things can get really dodgy.

625
01:05:02,110 --> 01:05:07,600
I'm sure this is where this slide is it? Let's go through some guidance examples.

626
01:05:07,780 --> 01:05:10,300
So effects. It doesn't gut microbiome before it changes,

627
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:17,730
but some of the dietary data can rapidly altered gut microbial communities in a rapid diet specific manner.

628
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:21,940
You change your diet high fat, high carbohydrates, the community, your gut will change.

629
01:05:22,150 --> 01:05:26,020
That's a dramatic change because you change your diet in a big way that you carried on just.

630
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,340
If you raise the amount of fat that kept other things there, the community wouldn't change.

631
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:34,720
That is a big change to see the community composition change.

632
01:05:35,380 --> 01:05:39,490
And rocky states are implicated in testimony like my version of obesity.

633
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:47,410
That's why we need to reform the whole idea of you have individuals that are overweight and obese, the community changes.

634
01:05:47,830 --> 01:05:52,540
But then the question also is being held back, saying to the community, change, you need intervention.

635
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:56,670
Did you change your dogma? This is not the issue, isn't there?

636
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:04,840
I mentioned the F actually the affirmative strategy I mentioned earlier.

637
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:09,250
Sucrose is a chief example. Here it is here.

638
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:15,700
So we go from position where maybe you lived at home for the first time in your life.

639
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:21,550
Your parents didn't like having candy. You went off to university and it all went completely wrong and you became a candy fiend.

640
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:29,259
And as a consequence, your community will change. I will have to share her story with you as the National Institutes of Health.

641
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:34,330
When I came to America, I worked at the NDDC and National Institute of Dental Craniofacial Research,

642
01:06:34,630 --> 01:06:40,570
and when I was there, I met my future wife and I have no stopping share.

643
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:46,840
So since we have been going with metal mesh dot com and had a great time and during that time, separate to all that,

644
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:51,669
we were sampling all our metals in the lab and my streptococcal community changed

645
01:06:51,670 --> 01:06:55,900
from a European streptococcal community to Americans and a couple of community.

646
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:04,340
So clearly that was a change in State of I to perturb my steady state community with milk and milk.

647
01:07:04,430 --> 01:07:12,610
American lifestyle is insidious of joking, but the point is you can see changes in community due to changes in lifestyle.

648
01:07:13,150 --> 01:07:16,230
Okay. And I mentioned earlier on that.

649
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,930
So if you go to say some smaller developed countries where sugar,

650
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:24,820
especially countries that are have communities that are separated from the developed world,

651
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:30,580
you see individuals with very few dental caries and I mean none of the developed world.

652
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:38,680
There's the billion bit, 2.3 billion people affected with caries because of this change in our eating habits.

653
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:44,370
So there's been a shift. From here.

654
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:52,980
No cavities, no septic, obvious mutations. Two year now carries an associated change, with September set to come with mutants being in the mouth.

655
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:59,230
You stop taking candy, you're valuable, that kind of stuff. It is possible and probably both of you.

656
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:04,020
I think we'll go back to health again because the other bacteria, your body,

657
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:11,910
your mouth will fight off the subject because when you sense obviously you won't have a close around to it to be there anymore.

658
01:08:13,870 --> 01:08:23,870
Okay. The marketplace of intestines would introduce by abdominal injury to normally sterile regions.

659
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:29,000
But you can access an opportunistic pathogen and cause disease that normal for doing this.

660
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:36,920
Responding to environmental changes and injury and really these kind of changes from a

661
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:42,200
commensal to a pathogen can occur if there's a breakdown in normal host defense systems.

662
01:08:43,720 --> 01:08:49,100
As usual. I think if I needed to have a, uh, an image from the dental school here,

663
01:08:49,640 --> 01:08:53,810
I just put this information in before telling us about this particular is pretty cool.

664
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:03,570
Yeah. Think on what it all helped me.

665
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:12,170
Why does it matter? Risk factors, the sugar, tobacco and o the numbers change.

666
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:22,340
That's not to say say 3.5 billion is paid on for disease and caries and we actually have to define the amount is not super huge,

667
01:09:23,150 --> 01:09:27,050
but cheap healthy benefits, tooth decay, dental caries. Okay.

668
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,210
Any questions so far? Yeah, sure, I'm sure.

669
01:09:36,030 --> 01:09:41,960
Let's consider the sugar capacity to make cheese.

670
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:47,730
So what is the sucrose? So you're asking how much sugar would you have to do?

671
01:09:49,590 --> 01:09:53,640
Okay, so how much sugar would you have to take to court to cause tooth decay?

672
01:09:53,670 --> 01:09:57,600
This would blow your mind a little bit. Hang on. What's his name again?

673
01:09:58,190 --> 01:10:03,810
Oh, the white knight. Uh, I know.

674
01:10:03,870 --> 01:10:08,310
Stop talking. I said I can't remember them. Remember? Um, Stefan.

675
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:12,890
Stefan's kind of so. There we go.

676
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:20,810
So basically talking 5 minutes permits for the new map to drop.

677
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,920
I do this for a little bit of sugar. Mm.

678
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:29,060
Yeah. I mean, it's pretty, pretty surprising.

679
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:38,450
Is that correctly? Yeah. So there we go.

680
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:49,820
As possible. 5 minutes. Um, you basically take a drink with, um, sucrose in it, and flaxseeds goes about 6.5.

681
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:54,590
That's about five. Once you get it, below 5.5 is when it starts analyzing.

682
01:10:55,550 --> 01:11:01,280
And if you just take a swig after about 10 minutes to get back up to date.

683
01:11:03,230 --> 01:11:10,430
So from the standpoint of the of the divots and the community changes by the Bellman paper,

684
01:11:10,910 --> 01:11:14,209
that's not substantial change to move the debate to change community.

685
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:18,770
But if you keep swigging all day long, you're going to have a change.

686
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:22,720
And you also are going to have. Yeah.

687
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:28,270
That gradual change and you kind of bring water or something along side.

688
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,830
Yes. Because that's going to be buffering, buffering capacity to water.

689
01:11:31,840 --> 01:11:41,200
So during that know bring that whole thing forward, if you will, to make like 6 minutes because it's sort of his time as well.

690
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:48,310
Um, actually measurements have an interesting thing because companies talk about visions time in relation to the effects of their time.

691
01:11:48,460 --> 01:11:56,650
If you see the mouthwashes that say O has 24 hour effects, that's because they're using sticky, which is advancing like obesity.

692
01:11:56,650 --> 01:12:01,510
And they know that you have increased the residence time of that being, you know, which is pretty cool.

693
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:08,630
I was just going to get ways out of the alcohol.

694
01:12:08,630 --> 01:12:18,430
More alcohol doesn't harm your teeth. There's been age associated with oral cancer and I'll be very careful about what I say.

695
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:24,969
There was an association between alcohol containing mouthwashes and oral cancer,

696
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:31,810
and that is why there was a there was a big concern given that ten years ago companies started changing from like Listerine,

697
01:12:31,810 --> 01:12:37,210
from alcohol contain mouthwashes to otherwise that study that came out in Australia, I don't believe that.

698
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:43,929
I think ultimately you're having large amounts of alcohol sustain your mouth again,

699
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:49,930
this whole trauma thing and that can lead to cancer, the alcohol at the concentrations that took men to their own health care.

700
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:53,150
Even wine isn't that anti-microbial?

701
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:58,360
We need to be above 30%, 30% in the case of any any any possible anti-microbial effects.

702
01:12:59,690 --> 01:13:09,069
Yeah. So just to add on that, that the thing that they tell us is like alcohol mouthwashes are a little bit acidic.

703
01:13:09,070 --> 01:13:16,870
So if you use that very frequently, you're actually internalizing that, which is basically kind of what,

704
01:13:17,260 --> 01:13:21,820
you know, streptococcus mutants, that's that's how they really get in infiltration.

705
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:25,719
So it's not at the levels that you would want it to be antimicrobial.

706
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:30,010
Like it's just going to be harming your teeth more than anything. Yeah, I didn't know that.

707
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:38,590
I said it is going to be something. So yeah, you don't know that. So yeah, I'll go back to the fluoride.

708
01:13:38,710 --> 01:13:42,640
Is that word by word that I have heard.

709
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:51,100
So yes and no. If you speak to some people like Michelle, who in terms of the 1970s, Michelle Promotions at reception,

710
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:56,860
they would tell you that fluoride ions can have some anti-microbial effects.

711
01:13:57,310 --> 01:14:04,360
Um, it all comes down to though what we view them as being is it hard to answer that question?

712
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:16,600
Completely honest. The fluoride the main purpose of fluoride is actually for, um, enhancing the architecture of your teeth,

713
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:22,420
preventing demons that you haven't repaired to minimize teeth. So that's the main function.

714
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:31,509
So they talk about if you look at the active ingredient or a.k.a. secreting fluoride sodium chloride to make them I have to be is happy to talk to you

715
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:37,960
about that because that's not your my but I think it's more the real strong

716
01:14:38,620 --> 01:14:43,030
compounds are used though actually my courtesy which will get into into one.

717
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:48,070
But yeah, there's all sorts of interesting things happening right now. It's a good question.

718
01:14:49,270 --> 01:14:54,710
Okay. Um, I. Protective Cabinet is left.

719
01:14:55,130 --> 01:15:02,060
Oh, that's interesting. That be quite a bit.

720
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:13,680
Okay. Also, I'm thinking about this. So we're talking about pathogenic and normal microbiology.

721
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:21,000
So we're talking about how things can go wrong, how the community can change based on the conditions I alluded to from the research this point here.

722
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:25,350
How else can normal microbiology become pathogenic?

723
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:35,429
Well, Western hypotheses and the antigen tests of a normal gut bacteria involves molecular mimicry and an autoimmune response of multiple sclerosis.

724
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:44,940
So the bacteria come to the community, can produce things and then actually be involved in changing the immune system.

725
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:55,800
Also, there's a paper by Wang. It's how the gut microbiota metabolize or this a protein in the diet in a way that promotes cardiovascular disease.

726
01:15:56,040 --> 01:16:03,210
So your gut microbiota is important if we're changing our gut food changes in our diet.

727
01:16:03,450 --> 01:16:10,109
We don't really know what the long term effects could be, and that's actually the beginning of getting them into the second metabolic activity

728
01:16:10,110 --> 01:16:14,800
of intestinal microbiota can increase the risk of cancer in a large bowel metastasis.

729
01:16:15,090 --> 01:16:20,730
Then a second clinical picture. An additional role of cancer comes from the reported primary chow.

730
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:29,390
But gut microbiome is the bio practical applications that interfere with immune system efforts to eliminate liver tumor cells.

731
01:16:29,400 --> 01:16:32,310
And I'm going to put this little paper in. It's just a shorter picture more than anything else.

732
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:38,550
Again, it was important, first and foremost, to be this is really not to not be promoted.

733
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:44,450
Just look at the pictures. I'm taking you through. I'm focusing on the slides.

734
01:16:44,460 --> 01:16:48,750
If you don't stand, look at the paper and then ask the questions if you want.

735
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:56,309
But in short, that you because you don't have too much, you got Clostridium in your gut.

736
01:16:56,310 --> 01:17:02,820
Right. And Clostridium has the ability to turn primary bile acids into secondary bile acid.

737
01:17:03,060 --> 01:17:06,840
And primary bile acids are extremely important.

738
01:17:08,580 --> 01:17:19,920
Basically, they can actually have anti-cancer effects, an accumulation of basically in the body, healthy in the liver.

739
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:26,100
So this is a little bit confusing. If you take antibiotics, you can reduce the number of Clostridium.

740
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:32,280
If you keep producing them, they don't go enough to make secondary bile acids and you keep the primary bonuses.

741
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:36,180
The primary bias is actually on the cells in the liver.

742
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:42,930
You don't need to know any of this. This is why I'm trying to highlight in yellow something for you.

743
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:52,080
The paper or I want you to know is that it essentially modifies the body to deliver to prevent tumors.

744
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:52,920
Okay.

745
01:17:53,100 --> 01:18:02,280
So I take you to the text here to show the species prevention, effective immune response to primary liver tumors and particular liver metastases.

746
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:10,290
Okay. No, by themselves producing metabolites that cause it by actually modifying the host own bile.

747
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:14,370
So essentially that auxin breaks down bile.

748
01:18:14,580 --> 01:18:18,990
That bone normally prevents liver disease through tumors.

749
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:24,300
Okay. But that does that organism breaks that bile down so that doesn't happen anymore.

750
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:30,600
So consume species as soon as they sort of commence with species, but can be opportunistic pathogens at high numbers.

751
01:18:31,380 --> 01:18:35,760
Okay. And it's been on and on for today. So this can happen.

752
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:42,239
Right. So process you follow I'm trying to say here how it's basically modifying your body and as it's modifying the

753
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:47,370
secretions of your body is preventing your body from maintaining how fast the message you're trying to get here.

754
01:18:47,640 --> 01:18:52,380
Okay, this happens in the liver, but how should monitor that?

755
01:18:53,220 --> 01:18:57,060
We're talking about something here that could be happening over years.

756
01:18:58,220 --> 01:19:12,580
And there's a really interesting word. I mean, picking up the phone and doing some research for your thinking about this and it's called the exposure.

757
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:21,100
You heard of that. And the expose on basically means that it could be diseases associated with long duration,

758
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:29,800
oftentimes lifetime exposures to something that results in a ultimate disease, like, for example.

759
01:19:31,690 --> 01:19:35,260
Prolonged use of antibiotics. What does that do to your body?

760
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:40,719
How does that change in microbiome? What's the downstream effects of that? Does that mean that you might be losing back to the force in your gut,

761
01:19:40,720 --> 01:19:48,250
could be preventing cancer formation, could be enhancing your immune system when you're older?

762
01:19:49,130 --> 01:19:53,440
So I'm going with this. So this is a big deal.

763
01:19:53,600 --> 01:20:06,690
And when your your natural community shifts and that persona, if you live in that community changes or community persona changes and things like that.

764
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:12,550
Okay. With that, I will end for today.

765
01:20:14,590 --> 01:20:19,300
Yep. We spent 2 minutes over. I apologize. Any questions that sound good looking?

766
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:24,579
We're taking some time from this and we're going to finish up topic two on one.

767
01:20:24,580 --> 01:20:34,479
So on Thursday, I'm planning to do a quiz once you've finished topic one, but I'll take you through all that and it'll be crispy in a week's time.

768
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,600
We can half time some of that. Some useful. Are you guys getting quizzes.

769
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:42,220
Yeah, I not. You're kind of like, just taking it easy. Yeah, that's the best one to do.

770
01:20:42,460 --> 01:20:49,450
Okay. Um, and then at some stage the next few weeks, I'd like to think we have to start talking about plans for my midterm.

771
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:56,770
I want to make sure that I know we've got different undergraduate graduate areas with different

772
01:20:56,770 --> 01:21:02,710
agendas and trying to get the midterm to be some time when it doesn't cause your stress.

773
01:21:03,570 --> 01:21:08,110
Does that make sense? So if we get time, for example, like one day you have like five midterms.

774
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:12,120
So I'm quite happy to fit that. Accordingly, we can all sit down and go to like hundreds.

775
01:21:12,710 --> 01:21:16,480
Okay, so let's go back the way one beginning. I mean, ask questions.

776
01:21:16,480 --> 01:21:21,610
All good, good. I will see you all on Thursday.

777
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:26,590
I'll upload a couple of papers for you to have a look at if you want to, and we will go from there.
