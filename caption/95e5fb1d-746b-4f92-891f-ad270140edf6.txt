1
00:00:00,276 --> 00:00:06,906
In this section, we're going to be talking about healthy relationships and we're gonna cover some topics like boundaries and communication.

2
00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:11,766
All of this still falls under social supporting squad.

3
00:00:11,766 --> 00:00:17,556
We know now that we need it that it's important, but often we come from very different backgrounds.

4
00:00:17,556 --> 00:00:25,406
We have different models, both culturally, but also in our families and

5
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:30,746
often if we're moving out from our families and into different environments, we're starting to now look at our families and be like, OK, what was the strengths?

6
00:00:30,746 --> 00:00:34,476
What were we doing really well? What have I seen modeled really well in relationships?

7
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:40,656
And what are the things that we for example learned that don't work so well so that we can form our own

8
00:00:40,656 --> 00:00:45,826
habits, values, ways of being in relationships and

9
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:46,796
In our young adulthood,

10
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:53,606
it's so important to be thinking about this and working on this because it's harder to change habits as we go, in the beginning

11
00:00:53,606 --> 00:00:58,486
it's hard to change because we're used to certain things. So we got to ask ourselves questions

12
00:00:58,486 --> 00:01:04,396
figure out what's most what is healthy for us. But once we started developing pattern with people, it's harder to change those patterns.

13
00:01:04,396 --> 00:01:12,406
So this is a really great time to be thinking about things, and trying new things.

14
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:23,026
So let's talk a little bit about what healthy relationships look like. In American culture, we really, really, really value independence.

15
00:01:23,026 --> 00:01:30,656
So we both talked about it like rugged independence, rugged individualism, we kind of have this idea that you're born

16
00:01:30,656 --> 00:01:34,436
completely dependent and then he moved completely independent.

17
00:01:34,436 --> 00:01:42,746
And in reality, what we found in research and relationships is that the healthiest place to be somewhere in between

18
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:50,766
completely dependent and completely independent. It's a healthy interdependence in that place

19
00:01:50,766 --> 00:01:55,096
we're getting our needs met we're relying on other people for something.

20
00:01:55,096 --> 00:02:01,336
We're also taking care of ourselves in some areas and we're also contributing back and helping other people.

21
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:04,866
And this really creates communities

22
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:12,386
where it's much more likely that everybody's needs are going to be taken care of and everybody feels OK having needs.

23
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:24,216
So let's talk a little bit about what this looks like in practice, it can get a little bit hard to figure out how to do in everyday life.

24
00:02:24,216 --> 00:02:28,876
So I don't how one here, but the same way I showed you the glitter bottle.

25
00:02:28,876 --> 00:02:34,016
I have balls like that glitter balls and sometimes I think our internal world.

26
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:38,486
One of those glitter balls. And so imagine that these pictures are actually three dimensional

27
00:02:38,486 --> 00:02:47,636
cause we're looking at something like the. So on the left, we have ourself that's kind of our glitter ball

28
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:54,056
and we're responsible for ourselves. We're responsible for our thoughts, the way that we perceive a situation

29
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:59,166
the stories that we tell ourselves about ourselves and other people in the world.

30
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:05,896
We're responsible for our feelings, our body sensations, our behaviors, and our weakness and our limitations.

31
00:03:05,896 --> 00:03:09,896
Now responsible for is different than completely in control.

32
00:03:09,896 --> 00:03:12,886
I can't control every thought that I have or every feeling that comes into me,

33
00:03:12,886 --> 00:03:19,866
but I am responsible for what I do with them and responsible for managing them.

34
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:28,876
So then there's other people in our life. And when we think about other people, we're not responsible for them or except

35
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,826
you know, if we're if we're a parent of a child under 18, then we're responsible.

36
00:03:32,826 --> 00:03:37,566
But most people were just responsible to them.

37
00:03:37,566 --> 00:03:45,496
Interdependence, it means that for most people are our main responsibility is just to do no harm.

38
00:03:45,496 --> 00:03:52,096
But then as people get closer to us maybe we choose to be more

39
00:03:52,096 --> 00:03:58,006
responsible to them to share needs and support and resources.

40
00:03:58,006 --> 00:04:06,756
These will be your family or friends. Every relationship, we usually have some amount of responsibility to them and we want to check in on each relationship

41
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:11,656
what's realistic to be responsible to them.

42
00:04:11,656 --> 00:04:17,646
We know from the other things that we've been talking about being perfect, meeting all of their expectations those aren't realistic.

43
00:04:17,646 --> 00:04:22,356
We want to kind of figure out what makes sense.

44
00:04:22,356 --> 00:04:31,626
But they are responsible for their thoughts, their feelings, their body sensations, their behaviors, their limitations and weaknesses.

45
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:38,766
And sometimes we get this blurred and we start taking responsibility for their thoughts, feelings.

46
00:04:38,766 --> 00:04:43,866
Trying to control everything so that they never feel uncomfortable.

47
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:51,386
Or maybe we are always feeling uncomfortable and overwhelmed because we're taking all responsibility.

48
00:04:51,386 --> 00:04:56,036
You want to think about how this shows up in your life and you also want to think about what you've been taught.

49
00:04:56,036 --> 00:05:05,696
There's a difference between collectivism, where we take care of each other and starting to take responsibility or other people.

50
00:05:05,696 --> 00:05:13,596
That's when we start to see habitats that look kind of like codependency, which is different than interdependence.

51
00:05:13,596 --> 00:05:19,476
Codependency means the lines between the two glitter balls are getting a little bit blurry.

52
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:30,806
And it's a little bit harder to figure out. Responsibility to is kind of a healthy way of being in community being in collective taking responsibility for

53
00:05:30,806 --> 00:05:41,046
other people usually means that things are going to get a little bit messier and difficult to manage.

54
00:05:41,046 --> 00:05:52,216
And most of us know we know hard enough time to us for ourselves to take responsibility for other people's behavior.

55
00:05:52,216 --> 00:05:59,626
So I'll start at that, this, like little bottom section with the green words, interdependence and mutuality.

56
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:07,696
What we want is a give and take of empathy, empower and respect in our relationships

57
00:06:07,696 --> 00:06:10,386
we're giving them back and forth it might not always always be 50/50.

58
00:06:10,386 --> 00:06:18,446
It may switch a little bit from week to week season to season, this season, but they're flowing back and forth in both directions.

59
00:06:18,446 --> 00:06:22,726
Where I'm taking responsibility for my own feelings. I'm regulating them.

60
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:30,856
Sometimes when I need support I ask for it and I get a hug or things that like a really great conversation

61
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:35,856
and it helps me regulate. I'm not just asking other people to take care of me emotionally

62
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:40,056
I'm doing my part. I sometimes show up and support somebody else.

63
00:06:40,056 --> 00:06:45,946
So there's a blend of self-regulation and coregulation

64
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:57,806
in these relationships, both people get to be whole. You know, person B gets to go and pursue their dreams, have their own thoughts and beliefs.

65
00:06:57,806 --> 00:07:06,146
And I get to have my own two and we collaborate. We support each other, but we don't try to control or push our agendas.

66
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:09,456
on other people were really cheering them on to be whole.

67
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:16,746
So think about this, like in which relationships do you feel like you can be your whole self and in what relationships do you feel like maybe people are,

68
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:27,196
even if they're doing it from what seems to be caring place where you feel start feeling smaller, where you feel like you have to kind of

69
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:37,176
take on their wishes and wants. And the last part is that you acknowledge where there is differences in power and responsibility.

70
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:43,796
So, in some relationships, your professors role is different than your role.

71
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,096
And you just acknowledge those those differences and you acknowledge sometimes

72
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:52,166
where you are the mentor and you have more responsibility and more power,

73
00:07:52,166 --> 00:08:00,886
you acknowledge that and you use it in a way that makes it misusing power.

74
00:08:00,886 --> 00:08:08,296
So these are all those signs on, there are all signs of health. It would be really good, like even think about your relationships.

75
00:08:08,296 --> 00:08:17,366
Also think about some of the friends and the families that you've seen on TV shows, like what is the signs of a family really functioning really well?

76
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:23,006
A show like This Is Us, what signs when it's getting kind of off kilter.

77
00:08:23,006 --> 00:08:26,276
Similarly with Friends, like a show, like It's A Cure

78
00:08:26,276 --> 00:08:31,206
what are the signs that the relationship is really healthy and what are the signs it's getting?

79
00:08:31,206 --> 00:08:37,236
Probably now the more that you watch TV, you'll see where they think they're really off kilter a lot.

80
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:44,796
With codependents your seeing the relationships are chronically out of balance, that empathy and respect is not flowing back and forth.

81
00:08:44,796 --> 00:08:49,416
One person is doing more of the work taking more of the responsibility.

82
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:57,876
The other person is not one person isn't taking the steps that they can reel in their toxic and harmful behavior.

83
00:08:57,876 --> 00:09:05,556
Those are signs that things are are out of place. Think about what this looked like in your family growing up.

84
00:09:05,556 --> 00:09:17,096
Think about what it looks like in your friendships and relationships now. Some of the important questions to just kind of think about is

85
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:22,286
often we're doing something and we get really worried about what's happening in the other person's glitter ball.

86
00:09:22,286 --> 00:09:28,606
If I tell them no, you're going to think and feel all of these things.

87
00:09:28,606 --> 00:09:39,186
But the thing is, you're responsible for you, and if you need to say no, then you probably need to say no and not try to take responsibility for what happening.

88
00:09:39,186 --> 00:09:44,496
So sometimes when we're working through this and we're trying to think about it

89
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:50,896
It can be helpful to ask, OK if if they're mad at me if they think I'm selfish

90
00:09:50,896 --> 00:09:59,426
what does that mean about me? So if the glitter balls aren't overlapping, then I can say like

91
00:09:59,426 --> 00:10:04,686
Oh they're mad at me because I'm not dropping everything and showing up for them

92
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:08,706
but that's OK I'm still OK, just because they think  I'm selfish

93
00:10:08,706 --> 00:10:13,596
and that's in their glitter ball doesn't mean that it has to show. I can be sad that they feel that way

94
00:10:13,596 --> 00:10:19,256
that can be mine. These two things can be separate, so often

95
00:10:19,256 --> 00:10:24,906
we learned to worry about what's happening in everybody else's glitter ball and just

96
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:34,276
take those feelings on our self, take those labels on our self, and it starts to shift how we think and feel and how we behave as opposed to

97
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:41,866
doing what's really best for us and choosing how we show up and support people.

98
00:10:41,866 --> 00:10:46,036
So what are their rights and responsibilities and what are mine?

99
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:51,956
So sometimes we have to remind ourselves. OK, they're upset but that's that's kind of their responsibility to work.

100
00:10:51,956 --> 00:10:58,206
I actually have the right to speak up for myself.

101
00:10:58,206 --> 00:11:06,756
One of the things that you can do after this and this will come up in one of our following ones about communication, is Google assertiveness

102
00:11:06,756 --> 00:11:11,226
Bill of Rights, and you'll see tons of them that come up. But it's good reminders

103
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:15,656
of things I have the right to change my mind. I have the right to make mistakes.

104
00:11:15,656 --> 00:11:20,316
And sometimes if you print off a list of them and see which ones you believe in and which ones you don't,

105
00:11:20,316 --> 00:11:26,076
it can be useful because it'll show you sometimes maybe why you're behaving in certain ways, because you don't believe

106
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:32,986
that you have certain rights and responsibilities. And you're not giving people back their response.

107
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:39,496
Sorting these things through can be helpful.

108
00:11:39,496 --> 00:11:43,336
The last one is how is their glitter ball affecting mine?

109
00:11:43,336 --> 00:11:51,016
So if they're mad at me, I might be feeling anxious. I might start to think, what's wrong with me?

110
00:11:51,016 --> 00:11:58,626
I might start second guessing myself. I might start doing more for them than what I really have to do.

111
00:11:58,626 --> 00:12:01,716
If I notice that that's how it's affecting me, I can go back to my self care,

112
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:10,736
my self coaching, get good healthy social support and say, OK, I'm responsible for me.

113
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:19,406
What do I need to do? And I can give them back some of their responsibility for their self, but also how is my

114
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:27,446
glitter ball affecting theirs. If I'm learning to be more healthy, that might make them feel anxious there's change.

115
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:35,596
But I don't I'm not responsible for. Taking care of that, I can communicate with them about it.

116
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:42,196
I can ask them questions to see if there's a way that we can kind of mutually figure things out.

117
00:12:42,196 --> 00:12:48,916
But we want to make sure that we have a clear sense of how this is happening so that we can take care of ourselves

118
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:54,346
as best as possible and we can support the other person while letting them take responsibility for what's in

119
00:12:54,346 --> 00:13:05,146
their glitter ball. The last piece of this, especially what they're doing, is kind of having a negative impact on us.

120
00:13:05,146 --> 00:13:12,196
We want to acknowledge that it's having an impact. We want to acknowledge that they have weaknesses, limitations, just like us.

121
00:13:12,196 --> 00:13:15,846
There are times where we want our parents, our romantic partners our friends,

122
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:22,146
our professors to be things that just really aren't in their wheelhouse right now.

123
00:13:22,146 --> 00:13:29,476
They have limitations and weaknesses and we don't get to force them to change not change at our pace.

124
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:33,476
We just want to acknowledge that is not that

125
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:36,986
there's something wrong with that or that we don't maybe deserve better. That's where they're at right now.

126
00:13:36,986 --> 00:13:43,886
So we want to try as much as we can to accept that everybody has limitations, even where their limitations are.

127
00:13:43,886 --> 00:13:49,766
Sometimes we have to change how we interacting with them, like having too negative of a impact.

128
00:13:49,766 --> 00:13:54,836
We may interact with them less. We kind of figure that out

129
00:13:54,836 --> 00:14:02,496
we'll talk a little bit more. And lastly, we want to take care of ourselves its not fun when people who are negatively impacting us.

130
00:14:02,496 --> 00:14:07,116
And it will have an impact on our thoughts and feelings and our behaviors that make sense.

131
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:12,196
But we want to go back to our self care and figure out given how this is impacting me.

132
00:14:12,196 --> 00:14:19,806
What do I need and what can I do to meet those needs. So often when we're first seeing all of this

133
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:26,936
it can feel kind of complex. It's really useful to go into the TV shows, into examples in our life.
