00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:02,820
Going into this course,

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:11,760
I had thought that I had a pretty good understanding of environmental injustice and its implications on marginalized communities.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:19,800
However, this course really opened my eyes to some kind of deficiencies that I certainly had in that regard.

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,060
Like many of my classmates, my six Americas quiz result.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:31,950
I don't want to be alarmed category. And so, you know, most people, it seems that 29 percent fall under the concerned category.

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:37,950
However, I think certainly with a group of public health kind of professionals who are pursuing this degree,

7
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:46,410
certainly all of us, you know, armed does make sense. I think for me, being able to focus on a marginalized population of interest,

8
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:53,520
which for me is the Native American population, my experience really is with the Navajo population and Navajo Nation.

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:59,640
But being able to expand that to a variety of Native American tribes while I worked on these assignments was certainly

10
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:06,660
very eye-opening as the material progressed from kind of the basics of environmental injustice to resiliency.

11
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:15,120
And then finally, the kind of the science and how to articulate that science to policymakers, laypeople, et cetera,

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:22,650
I really felt like the material was incredibly engaging and kind of kept me interested and really thought well on one another.

13
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:28,650
In the first week, I was able to really take that time and dove into the issues that face this population,

14
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,740
which dovetailed really beautifully into the second week and looking into what

15
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,930
makes this population so resilient in the case of the Native American populations,

16
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:42,750
you know, it's things that kind of bring them back to the land of different agricultural practices or potentially,

17
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:49,500
you know, the resiliency of having to move your community to a safer place due to the environmental issues facing you.

18
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,140
You know, I used to get a little bit depressed by these things because with these communities being marginalized,

19
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,360
they're not the ones who are creating the environmental problems, but they're kind of the ones who are having to deal with it.

20
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:09,060
But moving into weeks three and four and kind of learning about one, the science behind it, but also kind of how to conduct good,

21
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:16,680
solid science so that when you come to the table and you discuss this with others, you're backed by good information, good research.

22
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,840
I, instead of feeling depressed about it, kind of started to feel hopeful. You know, it's certainly one.

23
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,030
There's people out there doing this and to that in this cohort of people who are interested in this as well.

24
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,540
And we'll kind of make a career out of doing this and, you know,

25
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,600
the various modalities and kind of assignments that we had with writing podcasts videos.

26
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:42,492
I think it really helped me to communicate those things as well.
