1
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:27,380
Anti-racist teaching, at least for me,

2
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:33,769
and I'm always honest in these types of conversations because I think that - things I've told others, like sometimes I show them and I'm like, Oh yeah.

3
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,569
I'm like, I'm doing this whole anti-racist thing today. Other days, I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing.

4
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:42,229
Like, this feels like I'm trash. Like someone else should be doing this, not me.

5
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,400
I am reckless. I am irresponsible. I am having no impact on these students.

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,879
This is like a terrible conversation. I should have read more books.

7
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:57,140
I should have just gotten a PhD in something else. Like, a lot of days I show up not really knowing and not really feeling like,

8
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,390
you know, like I'm really, like, giving the work and doing the work justice, right?

9
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,910
But for the most part, I'd say that for me,

10
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:12,520
anti-racist teaching is really about trying to connect everything that we talk about in public health, right, because I think public health, you know,

11
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:18,620
it's really so wrapped up in numbers and the empirical things and bar charts and regressions and models and effect estimates and,

12
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,120
you know, different methods and stuff like that. I think the key for me,

13
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:29,450
and when I engage in classroom students is trying to connect everything that we see in health to historical and political,

14
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,970
political, social context and the power relations that produce the help that we're seeing.

15
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:41,180
So we're going to talk about the history of redlining. We're going to talk about the Federal Highway Act of 1956.

16
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:44,450
We're going to talk about racially restrictive covenants. We're going to talk about zoning and land use.

17
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:48,500
And before we even get to anything that says anything about asthma inequities,

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,420
they're going to understand that there is five they're going to name at least five policies that

19
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,950
structurally shape the reasons why black and brown folks are exposed to like more traffic pollution.

20
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:03,829
Right. Because it's irresponsible and it's racist to just talk about the inequities that we're

21
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,520
witnessing and not connecting it back to the reasons we're witnessing those inequities.

22
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:12,950
If our curriculum is not capable of doing that, it's not required to do that, and we don't have anywhere near an anti-racist pedagogy.

23
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:20,060
Students need to be able to understand that every thing they see data wise, number wise,

24
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:27,320
because public health is so about data and numbers and metrics and things of that nature, students need to understand everything they ever see.

25
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,880
That's a number. It's a life and it's not one life.

26
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:39,740
It's multiple lives. It's a life course, intergenerational thing that they're observing when they see numbers in public health.

27
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:48,440
And if they want to really make sense of those numbers and to really do those lives justice, to appreciate that they that they're human beings,

28
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:55,190
you know, they humanize their work and they need to be able to put those numbers into historical context, into a current social global context.

29
00:02:55,850 --> 00:03:01,520
And I think having an anti-racist lens and an anti-oppressive lens to public health training is fundamental

30
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,410
to that. Anti-racist class should be about doing that, should be about unpacking those threads,

31
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,690
it should be about unpacking power relationships. And if we're not doing that in public health,

32
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:15,620
then I don't think we're producing the future scholars and practitioners that we're going to need to actually move us forward.

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,920
We have this discourse in public health about like achieving health equity as if we're going to be able to get to this point.

34
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,459
We're like, we're done. We achieved it like, no. And so for me, it's it's about get your mind right and then get your gear right, show up,

35
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:34,760
make sure you do the read, like do your own work, do your inner work and, and do your homework.

36
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:39,170
So for me, when I think about what an anti-racist classroom looks like, part of it is that honesty and transparency.

37
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:45,650
I think one of the worst things we can do trying to lead this work within the classroom is to show up as if we know everything,

38
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:53,780
to show as if like, you know, I think that professors, in my experience, for the most part, with some really great exceptions for sure,

39
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,079
they act as if they're just like beyond that, they're just professors.

40
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,399
Like, they're just like, these robots, right?

41
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,490
Like they're not human beings with flaws and like babies that don't sleep through the night and, you know, like we're full human beings.

42
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:11,180
And I think that when we do this work, we have to be okay being a full human being.

43
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:16,700
And what that means is that we don't know everything. We're scared, we're uncomfortable, we're nervous.

44
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:20,479
We're unsure. We have doubts. We have regrets.

45
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,559
And then there's also moments where we like we feel like we slayed it, and we're proud about it no matter what you tell us.

46
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,530
Right? So I think that that's how I try to show up in the classroom.

47
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:36,139
And I think that that's what we really need to be centering on for training future educators and scholars and practitioners that like it's never ending.

48
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,840
And if you're not comfortable with that and just don't even get in the race. Right.

49
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:45,900
Anti-Racist teaching is incredibly important to me as someone who was in school for entirely too long.

50
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:52,950
I have firsthand experiences on what it looks like to live in a racist teaching environment and to try and

51
00:04:52,950 --> 00:05:01,529
learn despite those environments and to try and make it easier for people who are coming with good ideas,

52
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,830
who are interested in learning, who want to contribute to the field of public health,

53
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:14,100
to try and remove as many structural barriers as they can to just basically let them be great in ways that was often difficult for me.

54
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:18,210
I think that is a prime motivator for the work that I do.

55
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:29,590
You know, it really it comes down to I continually see examples of ways in which we are not doing what we set out to do,

56
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:37,440
ways that we're not living into the missions as public health schools and programs that we say that we want to.

57
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,820
And so it's a part of everything that I do. It's a part of how I engage in classrooms when I was a student.

58
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:52,680
It's a part of how I teach now in trying to provide the kind of inclusive and anti-racist environment that I always wanted when I was a student.

59
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:57,040
It's in the ways that I try and work with those that want to do better and

60
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:01,000
continually strive to do better regardless of where it is that they're starting out,

61
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:06,100
whether they are trying to respond to something that they said that caused more harm than they realized,

62
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:11,020
or whether it's something that they've been doing for a long time and they're just continually trying to get better.

63
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:18,370
It's in the ways that I try and make sure that the ways that we form curricula isn't just privileging one kind of knowledge,

64
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,550
but is rather getting at multiple ways of understanding.

65
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:29,049
It's in the ways that I continually ask students to think about who is being represented, why are they being represented?

66
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:36,400
Who's not there? Why are they not there? And what are sort of the implicit intentions of all of the things that are being presented to them as fact?

67
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:51,860
For me, anti-racist education is also about including the experiences of different groups and making sure that those perspectives are reflected.

68
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,389
For me,

69
00:06:53,390 --> 00:07:02,890
anti-racist teaching is sometimes doing a little bit of extra homework because these groups may not be represented in most of the research studies.

70
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:10,850
And so I may have to find scholars who are experts in that area so that I can adequately represent

71
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:18,710
and introduce my students to the literature and relevant knowledge for those particular groups.

72
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:27,490
Anti-Racist teaching is important because without it, I think we

73
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:39,160
land at a potentially skewed view and understanding of how the world works and operates and what are the factors that influence health.

74
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:51,160
I think it's really important to be able to talk about how the social determinants of health are, what contributes to these factors.

75
00:07:52,150 --> 00:08:02,320
Because if we don't include all groups, if we don't talk about the inequity between groups, if we don't talk about the policies and actions.

76
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:11,170
I mean, how can you talk about policies and actions if you don't even understand what the differences are between groups?

77
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,370
Anti-Racist teaching is important to me because I feel like so many of our public health problems can be traced back to racism.

78
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:28,110
And in fact, some of our academic institutions and even public health institutions have perpetuated racism over time.

79
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,249
And so, it's important as faculty, when we're teaching students,

80
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:41,940
that we model anti-racist principles and practices so that our students know how to use those when they're becoming public health professionals.

81
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:49,400
And I also think that anti-racist teaching is really important for building a more diverse public health workforce.

82
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:54,330
When you have a more inclusive classroom, then students feel more comfortable in the classroom,

83
00:08:54,330 --> 00:09:04,409
they're more likely to pursue a public health education. And that allows us to create a workforce that really represents the communities

84
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:09,630
that we serve and the communities that are most impacted by health disparities.

85
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:16,420
My hope is that if we all can use more anti-racist teaching principles in our classroom,

86
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:25,420
that we as a field can really own up to the fact that we have caused harm in a lot of the communities that we work in and that we can

87
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:33,579
train public health professionals how to undo that harm so that we can actually train them in what anti-racist public health looks like,

88
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:42,850
that we can train them how to create interventions that address structural racism, create policies that are more equitable,

89
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:48,190
and really solve some of the complex health problems that we haven't been able to solve yet.
