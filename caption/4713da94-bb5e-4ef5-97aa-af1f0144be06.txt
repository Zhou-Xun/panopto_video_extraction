00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:06,210
My name is during comments in this interview with me. Yes, yes.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,229
Hello. Miss me. How are you today? I am fabulous.

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:18,240
How are you doing? I'm pretty good. Good to hear. So I'm just interested to start off and why are you interested in this position?

4
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:24,990
So I am really passionate about small scale agriculture and organic farming.

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:28,260
Specifically in my educational background,

6
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:35,880
I studied pesticides and fertilizers and how they're pretty detrimental to people's health and also to the state of the environment and agriculture.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,580
And I really respect this organization's mission of trying to promote smaller scale agriculture

8
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:49,170
and trying to steer away from industrialized and larger scale agricultural practices.

9
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:58,349
I have experience both with working with farmers themselves and trying to mitigate the adverse health effects of constant pesticide exposure,

10
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:04,079
as well as experience with my own boots on the ground working on an organic farm myself.

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:11,340
And I think that being able to integrate the experience that I had working on the farm,

12
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:19,050
as with my educational background in pesticide exposures, would really help to further this organization's mission.

13
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,090
Awesome. Thank you for that. And then moving on, what are some of your strengths and weaknesses?

14
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:29,020
So I would say that I am a very adaptable worker.

15
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,359
I have a lot of international work experiences in various capacities.

16
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,569
So I worked as an English teacher in Spain for a while. I worked in the Bahamas and I've also worked in Thailand.

17
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:46,559
And I think that through all of those different positions, as well as my degree in diversity, equity and inclusivity,

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:58,320
I've learned to be able to accept a lot of different cultural variances that aren't standard in the United States, I guess.

19
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:06,270
So just being able to work at a pretty wide variety of people and also troubleshooting with different types of people.

20
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:11,340
People have different perspectives, work backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses.

21
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:18,239
Some of my weaknesses, I would say my biggest one is that I'm kind of a perfectionist when it comes to my work,

22
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:26,129
which just means that sometimes it takes me a little bit longer to complete assignments than maybe some others.

23
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:33,480
And that's just because I want to ensure that the quality and integrity of my work is sound before I submit it.

24
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,549
And I have been working on this and I've been working on managing my time a little bit better

25
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:43,440
to try to get these assignments in a little bit faster while keeping the integrity of my work.

26
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,840
Awesome. Thank you. And then lastly, why should we hurt you over other applicants?

27
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:56,220
So I mentioned before that I have a pretty diverse work background in a lot of different countries internationally.

28
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:00,250
And so I think that gives me a pretty unique perspective in this field.

29
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:08,879
I also have a degree in public health, which gives me more of a physiological educational background on top of the farming practice itself,

30
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:16,300
which could help me to focus on the health of the people themselves on top of the health of the environment.

31
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:23,010
So I think just my educational and diverse work background could help me to further this company's mission.

32
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,860
Thank you and thank you.
