1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:14,980
All right. So here is where it is going to be.

2
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,610
And we're talking about autism out of our future conversations starting this last week, next week.

3
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:33,720
Well, the pyramids was one of our first class guests and speaking about often more information about your prior.

4
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:38,709
And so this will be a good opportunity to ask questions about three years,

5
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:48,130
but also about like the reality of life and health and sort of like what's one of these services that is starting this conversation?

6
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:56,650
What about services today that we're going to talk about the autism epidemic specifically, sort of like what it is, why it is.

7
00:00:57,100 --> 00:01:04,929
And we'll talk specifically again about how this year and hear a lot of echoes from the idea about social factors that we talked about.

8
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:09,130
We've probably two or three of this class. So those things are be coming back today.

9
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:11,830
Or as a reminder, your check point number four,

10
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:18,280
which is your stakeholder table is due on the second to is due on Wednesday, but we will not be meeting on Wednesday.

11
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:26,650
You paid off. I can't I have to be out of town and I'm literally giving a talk at the exact same time as this class or otherwise I would zoom class.

12
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:29,770
So I'm sorry about that. I enjoy joining.

13
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,010
Okay. So questions about your questions about checkpoint reform.

14
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:44,240
So the other thing I want to remind you of is that you are when you are working towards a paper.

15
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,509
You all, as students of the school public health, are taking your class in the School of Public Health.

16
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:57,260
Student Have access to the school public health writing lab. I think this is she's still probably doing mostly remote.

17
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,440
But I do want to encourage you to reach out and get connected with her.

18
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,800
Everyone can get better at writing. Everyone can get better at writing.

19
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,520
So just kind of improve that. Even if you don't necessarily feel like you need help, I encourage you to check it out.

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,939
Okay. So the other thing I want to say before we get to the actual content is that I want to just clarify some terminology.

21
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:25,420
So you're going to get a lot of as you know, I show a lot of graphs in class and I'm going to show you some different I mean,

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,030
many of those graphs are going to have a term on them that is original to the graph, but I'm not going to see that work.

23
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,180
And so I want us to have but I want I also don't want to erase that word because that's what the intro.

24
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:44,120
So let's just get on the same page. So I'm going to use the term intellectual disability multiple times during this class.

25
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,099
And what do I mean by that? I mean a disability characterized by limitations in intellectual functioning,

26
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:53,479
by which I mean reasoning, learning and problem solving and an adaptive behavior.

27
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:01,850
And if that disability originated before the age of 18, by adaptive behavior, I mean things like conceptualizing skills.

28
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:10,819
So this might be things like language and literacy. So being able to communicate orally, communicate, it also may involve social skills.

29
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:18,290
So being able to interact with other people, social problem solving, ability to follow rules,

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:29,450
etc. then also practical skills like being able to live on your own, manage your finances or you know and navigate public transportation, etc.

31
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:35,299
So it's important. So this is all from the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities.

32
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:42,830
And so it's important, I think I'm going to tell you today is how we've talked a little bit about differential diagnosis.

33
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:51,860
For example, in the video I showed you briefly, the first video I showed you last week, little girl, where she talked about,

34
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:58,310
you know, many of the children in that video talked about feeling anxious or feeling difficult, attention, etc.

35
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,010
And that's that's a differential diagnosis between, for example, autism society.

36
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,290
Right. But there's also a differential diagnosis between autism and intellectual disability.

37
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:11,960
And especially if your child is young or is having trouble expressing themselves verbally, this is a really difficult thing to do.

38
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:19,880
So that's another level of differential diagnosis that we're going to talk about in questions about this.

39
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:30,979
So the other thing I want you to remember from last time, which is that almost all of our data are autism, specifically.

40
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:34,250
Almost all the data I'm going to show you today about the autism epidemic are

41
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:39,139
coming from some sort of official reference that's in our health care record,

42
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,170
that it's in somebody's medical chart on education record.

43
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:48,230
That is there's something that's been indicated on by the school that the child has spectrum disorder.

44
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,469
And so what that means is that when we talk about autism, everything I'm going to show you today about autism,

45
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:59,000
we are not talking about symptoms that are reported by the individual who has autism or

46
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,229
symptoms even reported by the parent who has autism or the parent of a child who has autism.

47
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:07,850
But instead, what I'm talking about is the way you get into the numerator of any of the data I'm

48
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:13,190
going to show you is that some health care provider or some educator educational system,

49
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:18,900
etc. identified you. All right. So that's important to us when we talk.

50
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,330
And so that's an important thing to distinguish.

51
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:27,740
So under understand so this is not the same as when we talked about depression and I showed you all those bars.

52
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:31,220
So you've got depression and it's more common among women than men.

53
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,640
That's not depression as diagnosed by a doctor.

54
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,080
That's depression as assessed using the skills that we did in class.

55
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,110
Okay. So that so that's a totally different way of measurement.

56
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:53,030
So now again, when I say this, what I mean is a a person who has been identified by either a health care provider in their record or an educator

57
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:59,510
or kind of social services type system that this person needs additional support because of their autism.

58
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:05,930
Okay. The reason we have that, the reason this is true is that there is no national data on autism.

59
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:13,520
And so we have this kind of like specific things that are trying to capture autism in different communities captured by SS.

60
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,889
But there is no national data on autism. There is no big survey of autism diagnosis.

61
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:26,870
The United States. The other thing I want you remember from last time is that the early signs of autism are very challenging to identify.

62
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,589
So remember, children start walking on average about 12 months of age.

63
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,770
They start talking about 24 months of age prior to.

64
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:40,000
That all communication is nonverbal. See, we now have.

65
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:45,040
And children. Really? So that's the average. There's always variations around that average.

66
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,610
And we also talked about last time when we assess children.

67
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:55,780
So, again, setting aside the case definition, but when we assess kids on whatever you don't ever get like your kid has,

68
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,889
sort of your child has a high likelihood of a diagnosis of autism.

69
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:06,700
Instead, what you get is your kids in like the 25th percentile on like kind of social interaction.

70
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,230
And so and and we know that children who are in this at your at that kids age,

71
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,030
there's a likelihood that they might go on to develop ASD but it's not this is not asd,

72
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:23,380
this is it's not like depression where we say, okay, well she's got five, nine symptom groups, then we get to this diagnosis instead.

73
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:29,440
When we're assessing kids, we're always assessing it on this continuum because there's so much heterogeneity in development, there's plenty of kids.

74
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:39,129
So we're going to be not talking at 24 months and will indistinguishable from children who we're talking at 16 months are like as adults,

75
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:44,120
they will be indistinguishable. That is, there's not going to be it's not like a 16 month old precocious or anything.

76
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:55,230
Okay. The plan, the last thing I'll tell you that I want to remind you from last time is that older parental age is associated with ESD risk.

77
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,330
And we talked through a couple of causal and potentially non causal explanations.

78
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:08,670
So a non causal explanation is that older partners may causal older, older parents, which means that if you're more socially awkward,

79
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:13,230
it may take longer to find a partner, romantic partner that you want to have a child.

80
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:21,290
Okay. And so the this is a non causal explanation because the parents are already kind of have some social difficulties getting

81
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:27,860
to especially they have some signs of SD because social deficits in social interaction are part of the diagnosis of SD.

82
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:37,229
That's part of what is going on with the first. They're having a hard time following the kind of social interactions this is.

83
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:45,090
This doesn't mean I understand, for example, that the last that I talk about this doesn't necessarily need to be pathologized,

84
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,910
but it is also the case that the symptoms of our social, which are our social symptoms,

85
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,409
the second we talked about older parents being more likely to have short space burst.

86
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,930
This is a potential causal explanations is around, for example, the folic acid deprivation that you talked about.

87
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,600
I didn't show you data on this, but I told you the older parents are also more likely to use assisted reproductive technology to conceive.

88
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,300
And that does look like there are some forms of HRT that are associated with risk of autism later.

89
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,910
And we also talk about older parents have older term cells, which again is a potential causal explanation to the mechanism of mutations.

90
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:22,680
But the other thing I told you and I didn't tell you why I was telling you this, but it will today,

91
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:31,109
is that older parents are also much more educated and have higher ethics at the time when they have children so older.

92
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:38,729
The older you are, when you have kids, the more likely it is that you have finished college, that you have a higher income of older parents.

93
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:42,500
So what and why is this? Because people are in your shoes, right?

94
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:46,390
They're going to school. They're going to go to grad school afterwards, etc., and then they're going to have children, right?

95
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,740
They're kind of planning out life. So they're going to have children on average older.

96
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:58,050
So they are more educated. Right. And they've they've already they're starting to kind of develop develop their careers.

97
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:04,460
Okay. So questions about this before I tell you stuff, I want you all these things in mind today.

98
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:16,270
Yeah. I don't know if this is exactly true, but I think that like, people are getting married older and so like,

99
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,410
could you potentially something like this, could you predict that they're going to be more cases of.

100
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,550
If. If there's a car. If it's driven by a horse. Sure.

101
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,860
So. But if it's driven by something, it's not cause I'm not.

102
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:42,860
Yes. No, it is. And and I will also say that I think to kind of spoiler alert, I like some all of these things can be true at once.

103
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,080
Right. All of these and almost it's almost true that it's probably likely that all of these are true.

104
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:52,250
And in the population as a whole, there's all of these things are operating.

105
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:56,420
The question is, though, which of which is drug companies driving the epidemic?

106
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:04,420
Having to tell you today about how this is driving the epidemic, that older parents are more likely to be higher, educated.

107
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,640
Higher. So that's the that's so. But it doesn't mean that this doesn't mean you get this.

108
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,140
And therefore, these other things don't matter.

109
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:17,580
It's just that when I talk about it, why is there so much more autism today than it was 30, 40 years ago?

110
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:29,330
This is a big part. I think Russians saw a start in 1980, which, of course is the year that.

111
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,620
Thank you.

112
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:40,040
So so Beyonce was born but also I think you I know you've got all these like you're juggling like six balls of your head in your mind right now.

113
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,040
But I'm going to add two more to more. Okay.

114
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:52,760
So and the thing that I need to tell you about is the difference or remind you of the difference between incidence and prevalence.

115
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:57,410
So before I do that, maybe I'll ask, can somebody define prevalence for me?

116
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,820
And so what I was supposed to be.

117
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:09,729
I was supposed to be here. You could tell. Okay, let me someone define incidents for me or tell me how incidence is different.

118
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:16,170
The prevalence prevalence of yes incidents is the number of people who get some points,

119
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,990
develop something in a certain time period or do people get it?

120
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:24,820
So it's very important elements of the definition. So so incidence and I'm going to show you this on a slide.

121
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:32,320
The incident refers to new cases that is among people who did not have it in the past within a certain timeframe.

122
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:43,660
So there's an element of newness and within a specific time, those two features are are somewhat represented in prevalence, but not always so.

123
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:50,769
But first of all, prevalence is just the proportion of people who have a specific characteristic at a given period of time.

124
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:56,350
So we could estimate, like, how many of you are left handed? So this is the prevalence of left handedness, right?

125
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,320
Two divided by four Like that's the prevalence, but that's not number of new left handers in the room.

126
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:10,720
Right. But that is the prevalence of left handedness in our approach. Okay. So what what if I wanted to know the incidence of left handers?

127
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:21,630
What I need to do. You need to find.

128
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:34,280
It's like toddlers or something that are like learning how to use writing utensils and then using those up and following them over time.

129
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,430
So we have two out of the 40 students in this class.

130
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:43,030
I don't know about 40 people in this room, but let's imagine that this the prevalence is 42 out of 40.

131
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,810
Is the incidence of left handedness larger or smaller of this number?

132
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:56,490
Smaller. Why? Why is it small? I just feel like it's smaller because.

133
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:04,790
For something like, look, something like this doesn't make sense for, like, a condition that lasts a long time.

134
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,230
Yes. How long? Like, forever.

135
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:15,020
Right. And what's an equation that we learn? What is pregnancy?

136
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:23,840
What is prevalence? Approximately equal. It's quite a few incidents and prevalence.

137
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:35,180
So. So here. So we know we know the prevalence of left handedness in our class.

138
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,440
It's two out of 40. That's one out of five. Okay.

139
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:46,729
You don't have to know anything about the biology or why anybody gets left handedness or becomes

140
00:14:46,730 --> 00:14:51,950
left handed or is left handed to know that this the incidents must be for actually needed.

141
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,500
One thing you need to know that left handedness doesn't kill you. Right.

142
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:01,850
So presuming that people don't die from left handers, which they don't, then you must know that this must be higher than this.

143
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,930
Or sorry, this must be lower than this. Can't be that. The incidence must be lower. Why?

144
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,360
Why must the incidence be lower than the prevalence?

145
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:17,270
Yes. If people associate cases of left handedness gets added.

146
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,590
Yes. Yes. Because these are all people who are left handed. Right.

147
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,130
This is forever. This is. But this is only the new cases.

148
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,819
And so the new is subsumed by the old. So this number must be smaller than this number.

149
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,040
It could not be bigger than this number.

150
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:38,060
It also can't be the same as this number, because unless people like it, this left handedness and that leave the population.

151
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:42,320
It's you become a better right then. They don't mean to be someone.

152
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:47,809
But the point is, I know this has to be less than things. I don't have to know anything else.

153
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:56,960
But as long as I know that it doesn't kill you, it has to be less. And the equation that I'm referring to on the right is wrong.

154
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:10,610
No distinction. If the equation I'm imagining is prevalence is approximately equal to incidence times duration.

155
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:19,400
So duration for left handedness is lifetime. And this is to one out of 20.

156
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:25,880
And this number is, you know, whatever. What what is our average age, 78 years.

157
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,510
Right. You can you could back calculate what the incidence must be.

158
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,999
Right. You can back calculate this, but I'm not going to do that.

159
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,860
But, you know, it's a [INAUDIBLE] of a lot smaller than that because I can multiply that number by seven or eight and still get that number.

160
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,710
Okay. So it must be smaller. Why am I doing this?

161
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,950
So the reason is that almost all of the data that I'm going to show you.

162
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:55,580
Not all of it, but most of it is dealing just with prevalence, just the proportion of kids who have autism.

163
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:03,730
So, for example, you will see statistics like this, like 5% of children under age eight had a diagnosis of autism in November 2021.

164
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,510
That doesn't mean that five out of 100 kids got autism that year.

165
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:18,470
That specifically does not mean that that means five out of 100 kids that were seen had autism.

166
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,290
Some of which might have had it for the last ten years. Or I guess they couldn't have had it from more than ten.

167
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,240
They could have had it more than eight. Right. Because they're under age eight years.

168
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,079
But so some of them might have had it for seven years and some of them might have had it for seven weeks because it's both new and existing cases.

169
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:39,299
Prevalence includes both new and existing cases. I can also say this in the year, this is an example of period problems.

170
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,200
In the year 2000, 5% of children under age eight had a diagnosis.

171
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:51,350
I can also say this, which is usually what most of the statistics this is what, for example, I'll show you what an image reports on their website.

172
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:56,930
They report this 5% of children and their age have ever been diagnosed with autism.

173
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,610
So that this number is much, much. This is a lot.

174
00:18:03,630 --> 00:18:10,310
This is a crazy number that gets people very concerned. And the reason they get concerned is because we're confusing prevalence with incidents.

175
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,350
But this has ever had a diagnosis at any point.

176
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:21,120
All right. And because autism is not associated with higher risk of mortality, that number is going to increase over time.

177
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:29,720
So the most if all of this is sort of like just remember this prevalence includes both new and existing cases.

178
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:37,630
That's the most important thing to remember. Incidence, again, is the number of new cases during a specified time interval.

179
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,510
So a statement like this, I could have a statement like cumulative incidence where I say in the year 2000,

180
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:45,740
5% of children received a first diagnosis of autism.

181
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,740
I can also say among a sample of 100 kids under age eight observed for two years, none of whom had a diagnosis of autism.

182
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:58,840
In the beginning, there were five cases of autism identified in the way I would calculate the incidence rate,

183
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,479
because I would say, okay, well, I've got two years of people, I'm sorry, but 100 people.

184
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,230
I observed them all for two years. That means I have 200 person years,

185
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:17,020
which is a strange term that epidemiologists use for figuring out how do we measure person observed time persons that are observed over time.

186
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:25,509
The numerator is a number of new cases. That was five, so the incidence rate is not 5% of this cumulative incidence.

187
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:32,440
Instead, the incidence rate is .250 to five per one person year or the way that we typically would represent it.

188
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:39,579
We just moved the decimal point over that there's 25 cases per thousand person years and again the way to think about

189
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:48,100
a person here is like the number of you can have 100 people observed for one year and that gives you a person years.

190
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,420
We can have one person observe for 100 years, but also can you see, okay,

191
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:03,309
this is the most important the but what I want you to take away from it is that incidence is not the same as prevalence.

192
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,600
That incidence is much lower than prevalence if a condition is not fatal.

193
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:16,870
So what does the CDC and other other agencies, what do they say about autism?

194
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:21,939
Like how much autism in it is there? So they represent this as prevalence.

195
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:29,020
How do I know that? Well, one, they call it prevalence, but then you can tell there's no there's no denominator in terms of time.

196
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:36,000
So we go from in 2000, a prevalence of 6.7% or sorry, 6.7 per thousand.

197
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:45,399
Pardon me, so not 6.7%, 6.7 per thousand to now this is over double like three times here right of 18.5 and 26.

198
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:52,389
So this is what the so and then this number goes from you can imagine it's about one in 150 kids at autism.

199
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:58,660
In 2001, 150 kids had ever gotten a diagnosis of autism in 2000.

200
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:06,190
Now, the most some of the most recent data is about one in 54 kids has ever had a diagnosis of autism.

201
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:11,320
So that's the way to these are not incidence data. These are prevalence data.

202
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:23,440
This is another way to to show it. Again, showing you now just by when the kid was born, what's the prevalence of autism by when the kid was born?

203
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,419
And so you can see this is the epidemic.

204
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:35,820
When people talk about the autism epidemic, they're talking about this number cratering over a 16 year period that is going from one in 50 to 1 in 54.

205
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:42,520
I mean, the denominator cratering and they're talking about graphs like this and this gets people terrified because like,

206
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:45,190
what the [INAUDIBLE] is going on? Why is there so much more autism?

207
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:52,900
Why is it the case that kids are so much more likely to be diagnosed with autism today than they were 20, 30, 40 years ago?

208
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,000
Right. So this is and this is what we're talking about.

209
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:06,849
But I'm sorry. Again, I know you've got all these balls in your head, but the thing that we sort of need to what makes this complicated is that you

210
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:12,160
can get an increase in prevalence without getting an increase in incidence.

211
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:19,780
So prevalence is, as this equation shows, is approximately equal to incidence times duration.

212
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:28,210
So just based on this, how can I get an increase in prevalence if the incidence rates because yes, people are living longer, so.

213
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:36,880
Right, so people are living longer. So somehow I get like an increase. They can get an increase in in duration.

214
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:45,040
Right. And this doesn't necessarily this this makes more sense for something like an episodic condition.

215
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,730
So like a depression or something like that, or maybe like the episodes are lasting longer, something that you can get an increase in this way.

216
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:57,430
But there are other ways to get an increase in prevalence that are unrelated to incidence.

217
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:03,360
So I could call more things autism as a person.

218
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:07,440
I could just have a broader case definition of what autism is.

219
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:13,500
And just by doing that, just by doing that, I will get an increase in prevalence.

220
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,340
I don't have to have any change in incidence. I just have to call more things autism.

221
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,850
I can get better at finding autism even if I don't change what autism is.

222
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:30,149
I could just get better at finding it. Again, the incidence can be exactly the same, but if I'm define it better.

223
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,710
Imagine this is like you've got like a more sensitive metal detector, right?

224
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:39,120
There's a same amount of like pieces of metal on the beach, but you've just got something more sensitive.

225
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,920
You're going to find more. You're going to think like, oh, maybe there was like more people were throwing things overboard.

226
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,420
No, you're just getting better at finding it. Okay.

227
00:23:48,000 --> 00:24:01,530
You could also change the social desirability of the diagnosis with something that is a a more desired condition to have relative to the alternatives.

228
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:08,430
What are the alternatives? You know, I'll tell you in a minute.

229
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:14,160
Right. So if you can change, if you can make this a more desired diagnosis relative to other alternatives.

230
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:21,780
Again, even if I don't expand the case definition and even if I don't get better at identifying it,

231
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:33,720
if if I can make this something that is more socially desirable or potentially rectify a the diagnosis being completely socially undesirable,

232
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:40,380
then I can get that change even without expanding what I call autism or getting better at defining it.

233
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,100
Because how do people get to a diagnosis of autism?

234
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:54,190
Is this a survey that I'm doing on that? No, they are the health care providers making the diagnosis or a school is making the diagnosis.

235
00:24:54,240 --> 00:25:01,920
Okay. So again, there's some there's remember we read about David Mechanics, the idea that you would seek out a diagnosis,

236
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:05,790
you would seek out a specific type of health care provider because you've decided you were already sick.

237
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,440
It is not that the doctor who is telling you you are ill, it is you have decided you are ill.

238
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,710
When it comes to mental health. And therefore you were seeking out care.

239
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:18,749
Yes. So if you're calling more things autism, then you're like finding them.

240
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:24,420
Are those not like cancer cases? So it and so they are.

241
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:29,429
That's a great so they are new cases. But that is not that is not incidence.

242
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:37,230
That is not a true increase in the risk of the condition. It is just that I'm expanding what I'm calling it, so I will get it.

243
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:40,800
And so what I and what I mean by that. So this is that's a great point.

244
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,450
So. So even if.

245
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:49,930
This sort of affects both of these proportionately.

246
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,370
The fact is, like, this is the thing that's going to really explode because I'm going to find a kid.

247
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:01,260
So at age four, ten years ago was not diagnosed, but now he's 14 and all because I've got this expanded definition.

248
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:08,080
Maybe it's more like now I'm going to find that case and then the incident has already happened so I can get an increase in prevalence,

249
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,710
even if there's no increase in the actual risk of autism. So remember, I guess the other thing that this is trying to compute this is trying to.

250
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:27,800
The alternatives are the alternatives for explaining why this graph looks the way it does is it added more food additives.

251
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,469
That's why. So there's been a true increase in it since, right?

252
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,070
When you think about like the kind of environmental factors that people argue are related to this.

253
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:40,100
It seems like there's more additives in our food. Therefore, there's more the you know, the literal risk of autism is greater.

254
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:45,650
So the incidence is greater. That's why this looks like this graph or this is vaccines.

255
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:51,260
This is all these vaccines that the CDC wants my kids to have that's driving the increase in incidence, not the increase in prevalence.

256
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,730
They're arguing that that's actually increasing the risk that your kid develops autism.

257
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:58,450
Right. Or pesticides or these other things,

258
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:04,720
these environmental risk factors that people are sort of generating out there because they're not trying to explain why the prevalence is higher.

259
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:13,210
They are arguing that the incidence is higher. And what I'm going to tell you is that the incidence is not high, but the prevalence is higher.

260
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:20,079
And IQ is that increase in prevalence without any change in incidence, even if there may be some modifications to the earlier point of like,

261
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,950
well, aren't older parents like now this from older so that maybe there's more of a mutation?

262
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,700
Sure. Like that could be happening. But that's not why this graph looks the way it does.

263
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:31,390
The way this the reason this graph works, the way it does is because of changes in practice.

264
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:44,060
So I got to your point so you could we could get an increase in prevalence if we get you causal risk factors emerge.

265
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:50,100
So this is what people are doing. This is vaccines, right? Or if existing causal factors became more common.

266
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:59,070
So this would be, for example, like I bet if it turns out that de novo mutations inspire increased risk of autism if that is the case.

267
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:05,630
Because there are more older fathers. Now, this will have this is not a new risk factor,

268
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:11,240
but it's just that that's more they're more older that so therefore I can get an increase in prevalence because this risk factor,

269
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,880
which was always there, especially was always there. It's just like there weren't that many old dads now and now there are.

270
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,269
So I can't get an increase in the prevalence of this.

271
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:28,570
But when people talk about like vaccines, they're arguing that this is a new risk factor, that they took the limit or they made the MMR vaccine.

272
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:36,230
Right. There was a time when we didn't have these vaccines, like they're arguing that these are things that are causing a change in the incidence.

273
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:46,490
Both of these scenarios, what would result if true incidence and increasingly incidence is the actual risk.

274
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:53,560
So this is these will result in an increase in the prevalence, even if the risk is is the same universe as this.

275
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:02,520
Okay. Let me tell you let me tell you what I know. Okay. So. One more piece of preamble.

276
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:07,590
If I ever write a novel, it'll just be like 25 chapters of lead up and then, like one chapter of action.

277
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:17,600
But okay. The other thing to understand that this is this has become so obvious to us in some ways because of COVID.

278
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,920
But epidemics don't happen outside of social connections.

279
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:26,510
They do not operate. You cannot transmit things if you are not socially connected to other people.

280
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:31,940
So how do social factors relate to the diagnosis of autism or mental disorders more generally?

281
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,219
The first is through social desirability,

282
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:42,680
which is the willingness to accept or even to seek out a specific clinical explanation for what is going on with you.

283
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:49,040
Okay. So social desirability I want you to think about is the willingness to accept or to even to seek out,

284
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:54,800
to proactively seek such a diagnosis or explanation for your signs or symptoms.

285
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,129
There's also the argument of social networks, which is a treatment.

286
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,690
Imagine this through transfer of knowledge, resources and behaviors about mental health.

287
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:07,940
So this is how people get access to like, Hey, I've got a great therapist, you should go see them, right?

288
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:15,110
Like, that's why you transfer through that therapist to somebody who's then very good at detecting autism.

289
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:21,350
This is something that they are able to kind of really help bring out with you, right, in terms of understanding what's actually going on.

290
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:26,690
And then the other thing is social status, which is which has to do with who gets access,

291
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:32,390
who has greater access to the health care goods, these which are finite in their supply.

292
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:37,310
So I have a good friend I saw last week whose son has AZT.

293
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:44,000
She has been trying so her that this diagnosis came after 18 months of assessment in a school,

294
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:52,910
18 months of observation and assessment this year she's at a this time was at a private school in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

295
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,540
This is like all it going to take, all the boxes of the story I'm going to tell you today.

296
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,000
But even now, she's trying to get her child seen by an autism specialist.

297
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:05,630
She's been on the waiting list for nine months. This is a fine.

298
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:10,490
There are very finite goods. These are not even for people who have lots of resources.

299
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,770
It is not easy to get this diagnosis.

300
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:23,540
So what I'm going to ask you to think about is like how these population, parent patterns of the diagnosis of autism relate to these two populations.

301
00:31:25,850 --> 00:31:31,400
Okay, so first thing now. Now that's I mean, ask questions about that.

302
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:36,600
We tell you some data.

303
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:46,979
So the first thing I want to tell you are most of this data I'm going to show you are coming out of California, where this group, led by Peter Berman,

304
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,719
has taken all of the social service registration records for kids who had an

305
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,080
autism diagnosis and also kids who have an intellectual disability diagnosis.

306
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:59,340
And not only links them over time, but geocoding them all.

307
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:02,700
And we're going to I'm going to show you data from all of this incredible dataset.

308
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,250
So let me bring you into this graph. The x axis here is here.

309
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:18,270
So this is the age of the kid. Okay. So we started to the y axis is the incidence that is a new case of autism autism diagnosis.

310
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:23,940
Okay. And each of these lines represents the year that kid was born.

311
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:30,820
So this kid was two, was born. This is the line in 1992.

312
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,230
So they're two in 1992. They're three in 1993.

313
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,979
Right? Etc. So no, they're born in 1992.

314
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,760
So this is this is 1994 when they're two. Just to hear their voice.

315
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:47,460
This is. But you can see for each of these years, the kids are born.

316
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,850
This is the year they are. Okay. So what do you think the darkest line is?

317
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:59,760
1992. So those are children born in 1992. And this green line is kids born in 2000.

318
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:06,330
So all these kids are age three, but they're age three at different years, four years.

319
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:15,280
What do you see? What does this graph show? Why is the likelihood of getting a diagnosis of autism?

320
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:23,980
Yes. More likely to get diagnosed as your age. One more time, real quick.

321
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,050
There's more like they're more likely to get diagnosed with autism.

322
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:35,940
You're like the diagnosis rate. So they're more likely to get diagnosed at an earlier age.

323
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,690
Yes. It's like the date kind of gets more recent.

324
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:46,840
Like more individuals are being diagnosed or leaders like each of them.

325
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:53,510
There's a higher diagnosis. So, so and so as time moves.

326
00:33:53,520 --> 00:34:00,480
So a kid born in 1992, the likelihood that they get a diagnosis of autism is here at age three.

327
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:07,470
But a kid born in 2002. So a decade later, what's the likelihood that kid gets a diagnosis of autism at age three?

328
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:12,540
It's way up here. So would that.

329
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:17,490
So but then you kind of go out to these later ages and now there's not much difference.

330
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:23,520
Right. So these kid a kid born in 1992, there's really no much more less likely to get a diagnosis,

331
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,660
more or less likely to get diagnosed with autism because a kid born in 1998.

332
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:35,580
So what this means is that the diagnosis of autism is happening at earlier ages, in more recent cohorts.

333
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:43,120
The diagnosis of autism. Kids are kids are getting diagnosed at younger ages in more recent years.

334
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:50,890
So I told you, autism doesn't kill you. So what's the way? But what is the net effect of getting an earlier diagnosis?

335
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,290
If you're diagnosed at age three as opposed to age ten.

336
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,430
Yeah. Because they can have, like, therapy or help.

337
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:07,110
And like, if a kick a dog knows that each time, they'll probably, like,

338
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,700
have gone through a lot during school, especially, like, I guess learning disabilities.

339
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:18,830
Sure, sure. Yeah. What's going to happen to this? It increases the incidence it's going to.

340
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,280
So it doesn't increase the incidence. Yes. What is it? Longer duration.

341
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,810
I'm going to. So I what I'm doing is I'm starting the clock sooner. So I'm starting that.

342
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,379
So autism, a lifelong diagnosis.

343
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:37,310
So if I start the clock at age three instead of age ten, I no matter what you live to age 80, you have a longer duration of autism.

344
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:43,730
Because one of these scenarios, you lived with autism for 77 years and another one, you lived with it for 70 years.

345
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:50,479
So did I. So that means since prevalence is in this same situation I diagnosed earlier,

346
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,440
I can get an increase in prevalence even if there's no change in the incidence.

347
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,830
Just because I can make, I think I can start the clock sooner.

348
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:06,260
Okay. So the first fact is that kids diagnosed today in earlier,

349
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:15,410
more recent cohorts are diagnosed at an earlier age than kids diagnosed in the past hundred percent because something is happening,

350
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:22,160
there's some sort of animation that's failing. But it just it's just I'm sure it was to say what I just said to you.

351
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:27,740
There's another way of looking at that. So this is from a different data.

352
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:32,610
This is not California data and it doesn't go out quite as far, but the Y axis here.

353
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,920
So the X axis is the year the kid was born. So it's a different way to think about this.

354
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,690
This is now the year you're born and the Y axis is the age at which you get your diagnosis of autism.

355
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:45,890
So in 1992, on average, kids got diagnosed about four and a half.

356
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:51,200
Fast forward to 2000. Now they're getting diagnosed on average a whole year earlier.

357
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,559
So again, I can get an increase in prevalence cause I'm starting the clock sooner.

358
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,980
So I will get as long as people are living the same amount of time,

359
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:03,930
I will get an increase in duration which will result in an increase in prevalence even if there's no change in India.

360
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:13,760
So both of both this graph and this graph are consistent with an idea of like earlier or better chemical detection.

361
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:20,390
I'm not showing you data on that. But certainly the idea that like people are starting to look for autism and guess what they're finding?

362
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,560
Now, what type of autism are they finding?

363
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:37,980
Remember back to the group are the Kennedy Krieger videos and we talked about how relatively subtle some of the signs that people were looking for.

364
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:47,500
So what type of autism? So if a child has very severe autism, let's remember back to the videos.

365
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:53,060
I'm going to videos I showed you of the families. Right? So there's a kind of BBC like very artistic.

366
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:59,320
And then there's a family who's woken up in the middle of the night with their son who has this repetitive behavior like serious health injuries,

367
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:04,120
problems, etc. That child had. I got a feeling that kid had problems even when he was much younger.

368
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:10,870
Okay. So if it if a child is more severe, it's they're going to get this diagnosis at a younger age no matter what,

369
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:16,750
because it's more obvious that there's something going on. We might not call it autism, but there's more eyes that there's something going on.

370
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:22,030
So what I'm showing you now is birth cohort. So again, this is the year the kid is born.

371
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:29,140
The odds of the Y axis, the odds ratio, that is the relative likelihood that they got a diagnosis of,

372
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:34,780
in this case, high functioning autism, which is going to be the more subtle,

373
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,610
more difficult,

374
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:45,310
more kind of nuanced diagnostic procedure is required because these are kids who are not going to be having severe repetitive behaviors.

375
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:51,580
Right. These are not these are the kids who are having the sort of you know, I just really, you know, my shoot of this pair of shoes,

376
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:57,370
I feel like because the feelings are hurt, I also feel like all my children must be looking at this work, you know?

377
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,060
And I would play with the ones that weren't my favorites, you know.

378
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:07,050
So but anyway, I don't know what it says about me, but I got lot in this room in terms of that attitude anyway.

379
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:12,160
So the, like, the what I'm, what I'm showing her is what's the likelihood you get diagnosed with high functioning autism,

380
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:18,940
which is more subtle, more difficult to diagnose because the symptoms are more nuanced versus low functioning autism,

381
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:26,500
where this is going to be the serious repetitive behaviors not able to even verbally express right that in autism has got a whole range of things.

382
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:30,520
What do you see? Where where is the big increase in autism happened?

383
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:40,800
High functioning, but more difficult to diagnose. So the likelihood that you get diagnosed with low functioning autism is higher.

384
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:47,070
Right. It's about four times higher. If you were born Edgware Tube and if you were born in 1992, that's still an increase.

385
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:54,510
But the likelihood that you were diagnosed with high functioning autism is 15 times higher than if you happen to be born in 1992.

386
00:39:55,460 --> 00:40:01,400
So I know she's working on this, but the first thing to understand is that this increase.

387
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:07,609
Sorry, this is all of them. This is increase the prevalence of autism.

388
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:13,790
This is everything. This is high. Low functioning. Doesn't matter. This is not. So this is this big, this increase in the diagnosis of autism.

389
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:23,270
But what I've just told you is that that increase is being driven by higher functioning cases of autism,

390
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:28,310
which are also more difficult to diagnose because they are more subtle.

391
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:36,800
Okay. Yes. Did something happen between 2004, like diagnosing a functioning autism like that?

392
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:41,290
Oh, I don't I don't think so.

393
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:47,480
There wasn't a change in the diagnostic criteria, and night in 1994 is where we get Asperger's.

394
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:52,500
So this may just be like a one data. If I'd have to see more data to see if it's if it's really true.

395
00:40:53,180 --> 00:41:03,660
That's a good question. I don't know the answer. Yes. Like support for security for autistic children changed over time.

396
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:09,760
Like also how I understand the difference in like the scale.

397
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:15,990
But how in this data do they like set that separation, I guess.

398
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:22,480
Yeah. So there, there there is. That's sort of how they do so at this point so we don't get.

399
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:27,610
So the other thing to remember is that we don't get the term autism spectrum disorder until 2012.

400
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:34,510
So it's not even represented on this graph. So this is the autism diagnosis at the time it was understood.

401
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:40,810
And so what we now have are sort of like needing a lot of support, needing some support, needing very little support.

402
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:47,080
But they also to this point argue that like you can have them much, you might need little support when you're younger,

403
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:50,890
but then when like peer relationships become more important, you might need more support.

404
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:55,750
So it is part of it is that the kid's symptoms, even if the kid's symptoms,

405
00:41:55,750 --> 00:42:01,209
don't change the environment and the kind of social factors they're trying to navigate do change, right?

406
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:05,530
Like a five year old is not nearly expected to be very as nearly as independent as a 15 year old.

407
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:10,030
Right. Or have the kind of social relationships. Right. So does that answer your question?

408
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:15,070
Yeah. Okay. Oh.

409
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:27,220
So. So, again, all of our estimates about the autism epidemic are based on prevalence, which we've we've talked about the past 15 to 20 years.

410
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:31,970
Two things have happened. Cases of ADHD are being diagnosed at significantly younger ages.

411
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,750
I just showed you that. And the cases that are being diagnosed today are much more likely to be higher functioning,

412
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,650
that is less impaired in children that get diagnosed decades earlier.

413
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:45,960
And so these are two facts, not the only two facts, but we do have to keep in mind.

414
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:55,760
Now let's talk about I told you another reason that you could get an increase in prevalence is if the social desirability of the MSD,

415
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:03,170
your autism diagnosis versus other things that you could diagnose the child with is these changes.

416
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:13,480
So this is also happened. So prior to the 1970s autism, I want to use the word SD understanding that that SD that term didn't exist at this time.

417
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:22,310
We just called it autism. Okay. But prior to the 1970s, autism was a highly stigmatized diagnosis to receive.

418
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:33,440
Why is this? Because the hypothesis as to why children developed autism at the time was because their mothers didn't like that is the explanation.

419
00:43:34,910 --> 00:43:40,190
Can you imagine somebody putting an Autism Speaks puzzle piece on the back of their car in 19,

420
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:43,729
set for a diagnosis which was now informing the world that they did not love their

421
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:49,400
child enough because that was the working understanding of why children had autism.

422
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:54,740
So this is coming out of the 1950s and sixties, like psychoanalytic tradition.

423
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:59,569
That's where this is coming from. But we don't know what causes autism.

424
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:04,100
But at the time this was the belief as to what cause autism. The moms did not love their children.

425
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:10,200
Let me be like this wasn't like I'm not reading between the lines. This is Leo Kanner.

426
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:20,370
In 1948, after 1949, he art writes that he hypothesized that the mothers of autistic children had just happened to defrost enough to produce a child.

427
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:28,650
And then Bellingham had wrote this book, The Empty Fortress, where he says he compares the diagnosis.

428
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:35,640
He compares the household situation that is a living situation of a child with autism to living in a concentration camp.

429
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:44,560
So this wasn't like people were trying to be subtle like this. They were very explicit that you caused your kid to get this right.

430
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:50,640
That was the actually. So what parent would go to a doctor seeking this diagnosis?

431
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:57,030
Who would ever accept this diagnosis if a doctor said that this was what was wrong with your son or daughter?

432
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,460
I know what the answer is. No one.

433
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:13,410
So what happened is that this diagnosis prior to the Beyonce being born is so stigmatized that no one would accept it, no one would seek it out.

434
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,870
Okay, so so well, what did these kids get diagnosed with instead?

435
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:26,950
I'm glad you asked. They were diagnosed with intellectual disability. So what I'm showing you here, this is the year of birth.

436
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:30,060
Now we're going earlier, so I'd be. I'll take a seven. Okay.

437
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:38,160
And the Y axis here is the prevalence per live births. This is the prevalence of autism in 1987.

438
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:41,970
So here it is. Right? It's there, but it's held a lot less common.

439
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:52,770
And the prevalence of intellectual disability and what happens over time and these are now essentially I don't want to speak out of turn.

440
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:59,340
So you see, at the same time as the autism diagnosis is becoming more socially acceptable.

441
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:04,320
The fact is we're getting this increase in prevalence.

442
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,430
We're getting a decline in the diagnosis of intellectual disability.

443
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:13,170
This matters because we also don't know what causes most forms of intellectual disability.

444
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:18,400
So if pesticides or let's just let's just let's just for the sake of argument, you know,

445
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:22,040
it's the mercury in the past and the vaccines, whatever the [INAUDIBLE] is, right?

446
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,200
Whatever, whatever people think it is. What is that doing?

447
00:46:26,070 --> 00:46:32,070
It's hoarding brain damage. Right. And that brain damage would be occurring regardless of whether it was intellectual.

448
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:35,669
We called it intellectual disability or we called it autism. Right.

449
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:36,720
Because that's not what's happening.

450
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:43,590
It's not that there are more children born that have neurological problems, is that there are more children born with autism specifically,

451
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:47,009
and that they're getting this diagnosis at the same time as there's a decline

452
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:50,340
in the number of children getting this other neurological situation going on,

453
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:56,760
disability that is declining over time. But if the environment out there is just full of these these terrible thing,

454
00:46:56,790 --> 00:47:02,670
these terrible environmental exposures that are damaging children's brains in utero, it shouldn't matter what the diagnosis is.

455
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,970
Right. Both of these should be increasing. Right.

456
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:17,900
And indeed in 1987, the likelihood that you've got a diagnosis of autism with no actual disability was the same,

457
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:23,690
because if you had diagnosis just because and instead what then what has happened over time is that there's been an increase.

458
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:29,630
This goes to 1994. So this is essentially the beginning of those other charts I just showed you, which started in 1992.

459
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:37,100
So we've had an increase in the prevalence of autism without intellectual disability and a little bit of an increase,

460
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:47,000
but not nearly as much of the prevalence, which is again consistent with the data I just showed you that the time that the autism being diagnosed to

461
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,110
date is much more likely to be high functioning relative to the autism that was diagnosed 27 years ago.

462
00:47:57,010 --> 00:48:00,360
Here's another way to look at that. So this is a proportional Venn diagram.

463
00:48:00,370 --> 00:48:05,650
So the size of the circle is the number of cases that we're talking about.

464
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:14,590
Okay. So and then the that overlap shows you how many cases have both diagnoses in the chart or sorry,

465
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:21,190
in this case, this is in the middle and this is in the education record. So the first thing you notice is this in 1992 and 2005.

466
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:28,900
So in both cases, intellectual disability is far, far, far more common in these these school records and these social service records.

467
00:48:29,170 --> 00:48:34,210
And there's autism. Okay. So the circles for intellectual disability are much larger in the circles for autism.

468
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:43,030
The second thing you notice is that the overlap of autism and intellectual disability in 1982 is almost complete.

469
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:48,850
Almost all of this autism circle is is also shared with the intellectual disability circle.

470
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:52,270
Fast forward to 25. It's the exact opposite.

471
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:57,490
Very little of the autism circle is now overlapping with the intellectual disability circle.

472
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:01,750
So people have a term for this. It's called diagnostic switching.

473
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:10,510
That is that in a world where a child is two, three, four years old, they may be having trouble communicating verbally.

474
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,140
What is the preferred diagnosis for that child?

475
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:18,220
In the 1970s, the preferred diagnosis for that child was intellectual disability.

476
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:22,780
Why? Because autism meant you didn't love your kid enough. Now,

477
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:27,040
what is the preferred diagnosis for that kid who was just three or four years

478
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,550
old and isn't able to communicate very well or maybe has problems socially?

479
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,880
It's it's autism. Why is that a preferred diagnosis?

480
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:48,540
Yes. There's like a thick and there's just like a bigger spectrum of, well, autism, like, so it's it's more acceptable.

481
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:52,020
Right. What else? Yeah. You'd still be highly functioning.

482
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:56,220
Yeah. So it's more functional. What else? Yes.

483
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:03,010
It's like more coping mechanisms and support systems there.

484
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,250
There are there are more treatments for autism and for intellectual disability.

485
00:50:08,850 --> 00:50:13,920
So as a parent, to accept the diagnosis of intellectual disability does not necessarily mean that.

486
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:16,709
But like, of course, there's a lot of variation.

487
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:20,760
There are many people with no actual disability that are able to work, that are able to live independently, etc.

488
00:50:20,790 --> 00:50:30,120
Right. By the way, the narrative, the social narrative around autism is that there are things that you can do and that you must do.

489
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:36,840
Right. Schools must provide services for kids who have either one of these diagnoses to help them fully actuate.

490
00:50:37,290 --> 00:50:44,369
Right. So there again was this what was the preferred diagnosis in a world where autism was so highly stigmatized

491
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:50,130
and and in a world where it's very difficult to come to a to a diagnosis because kids are verbal.

492
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:54,810
Right. Or they're not necessarily if they're not able to explain why they're not following your finger

493
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:58,970
or why they're really obsessed with this phone or why they want to play with these other kids.

494
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:02,250
Right. The kids don't aren't able to verbalize that kind of stuff.

495
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,440
They don't even have that kind of insight into their own behavior.

496
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:13,349
So you can either one of these is a viable diagnosis, essentially, especially for a kid where four at the time,

497
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:19,500
especially in the early nineties, almost all of these kids with autism also had a diagnosis of intellectual disability.

498
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:24,870
But now we've got this new group of kids who are getting this autism diagnosis that simply we're not getting it before.

499
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:28,829
Maybe they're are getting anxiety or maybe they were getting ADHD or something else.

500
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:34,649
Right. But they weren't getting autism. Yes.

501
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:41,040
This is again, this graph is kind of lousy to look at, but the title says at all that while the incidence of ESD has increased over time,

502
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:47,790
the incidence of intellectual disability has remained stable. And again, this is completely inconsistent with a story of.

503
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:53,940
There's food additives, there's pesticides. All those things probably do cause some health problems.

504
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,490
But I don't think they cause autism. Okay.

505
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:06,180
Because if they were causing neurological damage in utero, that should show up on all sorts of every outcome that a kid can have, not just autism.

506
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,860
Okay. So. We have this.

507
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:16,820
And as the epidemic has unfolded beginning in the 1980s,

508
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:21,890
we have this growing separation between the diagnosis of DSD and the diagnosis of intellectual disability.

509
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:29,750
The increase in the diagnosis of ASD has been greater than among the increase of that autism

510
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:33,829
diagnosis has been greater among cases that do not also have intellectual disability,

511
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:38,390
which is consistent with what I showed you earlier about higher functioning versus lower functioning cases.

512
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:46,370
And again, the fact that the prevalence of intellectual disability has declined while the incidence of intellectual disabilities remains stable,

513
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:50,750
suggests that older children with intellectual disability are being diagnosed with ASD.

514
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:55,580
And this is this argument of diagnostic switching between intellectual disabilities and ASD.

515
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,840
So you have you get a diagnosis of intellectual disability when you're three or four or five years old,

516
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:06,379
you get an older as you get older, children are switching over or they're getting a co-morbid diagnosis.

517
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:12,110
It doesn't mean that they're leaving this behind or they're getting a new diagnosis, an additional diagnosis of autism.

518
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:21,330
Okay. Questions about this? Yes. Can you give other examples of diagnostic switching?

519
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:27,780
Sure. So. So there's diagnostic switching between major depression and bipolar disorder is very,

520
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:33,479
very common for people to get initial diagnosis of depression, get on antidepressants for many years.

521
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,049
And sort of the mania is never well treated or not well understood.

522
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:46,320
And then we we finally get to an appropriate diagnosis. You'll also see, I want to distinguish this between another sort of situation we have,

523
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:50,430
which we call kind of typical versus somewhat typically continuity.

524
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:55,050
So anxiety in children does not look like our anxiety.

525
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,770
So anxiety in children is expressed things like.

526
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:10,660
Bedwetting, you know, school refusal, you know, sort of the specific types of behaviors that adults typically don't experience, don't express.

527
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,719
That's how they express their anger or bellyache. So they're very common.

528
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:17,200
Like the most common kind of anxiety symptom in children is like, just like g.i. Problems.

529
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:25,270
Okay, so now those symptoms may eventually get called generalized anxiety disorder in adulthood or panic disorder or something like that.

530
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:29,980
But we don't give a kid like a six year old would never get a diagnosis, a generalized anxiety disorder.

531
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:45,310
Right. Because. But but we understand that a sort of early signs of how children express anxiety and even understand how this diagnostic

532
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:53,530
switching is a particular problem with kids when they can't report either because they're too young to talk to.

533
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:58,120
They can't report because they can't actually they don't understand that, like the voice in their head is them.

534
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:01,870
Right. Right. I mean, these are these are children who still have imaginary friends.

535
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:06,400
Like, remember, back to what kids remember back to your childhood. I remember back to seven year old you.

536
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:12,250
How much insight did you have about your feelings and the reality of those feelings?

537
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,640
So who is getting this diagnosis? Are the kids?

538
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,379
It's the parent. Okay, here it is,

539
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:27,270
the one who is getting the kid to the different specialist or the school that's getting people to the different specialists to get this diagnosis.

540
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:31,720
Okay. This is not. There's no kid saying, like, mom, I think I should talk to a psychiatrist.

541
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:36,399
That does not how this happened, but a question about this.

542
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,880
Can I tell you one more story? All related.

543
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:46,719
It's all going to me. All right. So another thing that is also true is that we've had a changing case definition.

544
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,960
So I told you at the beginning, like you could get an increase in prevalence if you just called more things autism.

545
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:57,570
So in 1980, Beyonce was born with an autism, which also has this requirement that symptoms onset by age 2.5.

546
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,700
That's not true anymore. So again, we get this changing definition.

547
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:04,350
You can see in 1994, you get this kind of much broader set of things.

548
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:07,750
This all collapses down into 2012 or we just get autism spectrum disorder.

549
00:56:09,970 --> 00:56:14,950
This is just kind of like take my word for it that there is some evidence that just the

550
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:20,209
changing diagnostic criteria in and of themselves would have caused an increase in prevalence.

551
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:25,840
So just a change in the diagnostic criteria, you don't even have to get better at finding what's there.

552
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:30,430
You just have to call more things autism. Okay. But we did also get better at finding things.

553
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:33,490
We did start screening for autism. All these other things did start happening.

554
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:38,560
But even if they had it, if I had just sort of expanded what the definition of what I call autism,

555
00:56:39,430 --> 00:56:45,060
I would have got, I would have skipped this just for the sake of argument.

556
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:49,580
I mean, other than to say it's. Conferencing time.

557
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:58,309
So the other thing, as I mentioned, that the people who are seeking these diagnoses or are accepting these diagnoses or

558
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:04,459
are responsible for sort of getting kids to the place where they might get diagnosed,

559
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,050
are parents, are grownups. Okay.

560
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:16,160
So what that what has happened is specifically with the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act and other subsequent pieces of legislation,

561
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:28,310
is that if you have a some sort of disability, public schools must provide what are called individualized education plans to help support their work.

562
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:37,520
That is what this means. This is not true. If you have a diagnosis of depression, it's not true if your mom has a diagnosis of depression.

563
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:39,560
Right. But those things also might impact your learning.

564
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:44,929
But if you have a diagnosis of intellectual disability or an autism or any of these sorts of things,

565
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:51,979
you are eligible for an IEP, which is going to give you a individual.

566
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:57,140
It's going to potentially get you a classroom and it's going to get you more resources within the school.

567
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:03,170
These include here you might get speech or language, you might get speech or occupational therapy.

568
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:10,390
And again, they even say like that treatment for specific symptoms often does not need to wait for a formal diagnosis.

569
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:16,970
And there's this emphasis that you must intervene early. You must intervene early, because if you wait until they're ten, it's too late.

570
00:58:17,210 --> 00:58:23,930
Okay. So not only is there an emphasis on early detection because we're screening in health care systems,

571
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,229
but from the school systems perspective and from the parental perspective,

572
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:33,080
there's an emphasis on early detection, because then I can do early intervention and the schools have to provide the early intervention.

573
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:40,309
So there is a good tie to that. So that means if you have a choice between your son having the symptoms of autism and not

574
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:45,560
having a diagnosis and your son having the symptoms of autism and having a diagnosis,

575
00:58:45,560 --> 00:58:48,350
only one of those get you access to this health care. Good.

576
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:54,920
So this is going to drive a diagnosis even if the symptoms are always there and have become no more common.

577
00:58:56,870 --> 00:59:03,199
This is showing you just how out of whack the increase in autism has been relative to what was predicted.

578
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:08,209
So there was a predicted increase. And this is demand for developmental disability services.

579
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:11,330
So this is the predicted projected increase in 1992.

580
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:17,540
And sure enough, they projected an increase. And of course, they can argue they were off even two years in the future at that point.

581
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:25,110
Right. But it's like it was out of whack, right? There was like there's this was not proportional to what they had ever seen before.

582
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:28,340
So this is, again, not diagnosis of autism.

583
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:34,010
This is actually the number of kids who are getting services for some sort of developmental disability.

584
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:37,940
I going to hurry up. Okay. So diagnostic criteria changed over time.

585
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:42,380
And these laws in particular, the ADA,

586
00:59:42,590 --> 00:59:50,390
have established programs that emphasize early interaction and early intervention and they are legally bound to provide those services to your kid.

587
00:59:50,930 --> 01:00:05,930
So what does this have to do? So one of the things that's really important and is very both alarming and confusing as an epidemic is that there are

588
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:13,970
clusters of autism diagnosis and they are much more likely to cluster in higher income areas and autism clusters,

589
01:00:14,390 --> 01:00:17,510
richer areas in more educated areas.

590
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:23,390
So what I'm showing you here is the probability of an autism diagnosis on the Y axis.

591
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,799
X axis is here that this line is for neighborhood.

592
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:33,080
So the 10th, so that this is the price of the homes. So these homes are in the 10th percentile of property value.

593
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:43,520
So so the line is 90th percentile property value. So in higher income areas, autism is more likely to be diagnosed than in lower income families.

594
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:51,740
This is showing you not only is it that that the the income of your area, that autism is more likely to be diagnosed.

595
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:56,720
This is showing you the age of diagnosis. If you're a higher income household or a lower income household,

596
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:04,940
what you see is that while that age at autism diagnosis has declined over time for all kids,

597
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:09,410
it was always lower in the higher scores, kids in the higher S6 families.

598
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,700
Why? Because they have access to the health care. Because they have greater access to health care goods.

599
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:17,950
But that decline has has continued to be steeper.

600
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:27,260
So now we've got almost over a half a year earlier diagnosis and higher risks, families relative to lower families.

601
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:35,540
This is, again, showing you that. And where are those? What type of autism do those kids have?

602
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:41,600
They have higher functioning autism. So the red line here I put on because it's indicating an auto ratio of one.

603
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:45,930
So any value above the line increases that you're more likely to get that diagnosis.

604
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:49,280
Any value below the line. So you're less likely to get the diagnosis.

605
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:54,680
So people who are highly educated or have high property, high live in expensive homes.

606
01:01:54,950 --> 01:02:00,230
They are more likely to get a diagnosis of higher functioning, less severe autism.

607
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,460
And people who live in lower property homes or have less education.

608
01:02:04,940 --> 01:02:08,990
So not only am I getting that diagnosis earlier, if I had higher socioeconomic status,

609
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:19,200
the diagnosis I'm getting is more likely to be high functioning. Now, the other thing that's interesting because we didn't.

610
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:25,980
So I told you last time, genes are a strong risk factor for schizophrenia or for autism,

611
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:30,720
that the heritability of autism is estimated to be about 70 to 80%.

612
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,760
And it is it is also correlated with things like schizophrenia, but unlike.

613
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,930
So you've got this genetic correlation and all of that suggests that it should be

614
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:44,150
that lower CAC families have more likely to have autism because lower estimates,

615
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,580
families are more likely to experience schizophrenia. That is true. That is a fact.

616
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:53,160
But what we see is that not only is higher incidence, especially with earlier age of diagnosis,

617
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:57,630
it's also associated with the early the higher functioning, which, again, is less impaired.

618
01:02:57,810 --> 01:03:03,230
More difficult to diagnose. And then you get stuff like this, right, where you get this help.

619
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:07,440
This is from environmental health measures, which is not a real news thing.

620
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:18,000
And if you get like updates from this like ages, I encourage you to stop because this is just like this is not a real this is like my trying to say.

621
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:26,610
Like imagine like the exact opposite of your like political spectrum and like start start subscribing to those types of things.

622
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:30,990
It's like that level of like extremism. Okay. So anyway, but you get these things, it's like you get these clusters.

623
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,980
All these clusters. Why is that? Well, why is that?

624
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,760
Why did it why does this map look like this? Yes.

625
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:46,670
You said earlier that like parents who are just more aware, like no child is asking to be diagnosed.

626
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:54,360
So like just parents who are more aware or like they're more aware, clusters of people who are they have more resources they can get to the provider.

627
01:03:54,420 --> 01:04:00,450
Right. Yes. Now, let me like there's like let me show you like one of my favorite graphs and graphs.

628
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:07,710
So this is from this. So this is showing you I'm going to show you like it's not my favorite graph,

629
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:11,879
but what I want to show you is, again, this clustering, geographic clustering of autism.

630
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:19,440
So this is the proximity of a kid with autism last year and the probability that you get a diagnosis of autism.

631
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:27,660
So the closer you live to a kid who had autism in your neighborhood last year, the more likely you are to get a diagnosed with autism this year.

632
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:33,960
So that's that's that's the spectrum. So again, and that's what this that's what geographic clusters look like.

633
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:37,620
Okay. So what clusters in space?

634
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:43,049
So it is true that like maternal life, like environmental risk factors cluster in space,

635
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:48,540
things like golf courses which use a bazillion pounds of pesticide a year cluster in space.

636
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:52,019
Okay. So I'm not saying that environmental factors don't cluster in space,

637
01:04:52,020 --> 01:04:58,560
but the evidence that we know about those, again, all developmental factors should be clustering in space.

638
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:07,650
So what I'm showing you so again, if it's pesticides, if it's something in the water, then and that's causing neurological damage in utero,

639
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:09,630
then that should cause neurological damage,

640
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:14,700
no matter whether we're talking about autism as the ultimate diagnosis or something like intellectual disability.

641
01:05:14,700 --> 01:05:18,719
But what do you see? What you see is that this is how close I live to that kid.

642
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,720
So this kid is within 200 kid with autism.

643
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:26,220
What last year had autism and the likelihood the y axis, the when I get autism, I get a diagnosis of autism.

644
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:31,080
This is a kid who lives within 250 meters of p. So he's my neighbor. He or she is my neighbor.

645
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:34,529
Okay. This is a kid that lives over five kilometers away from me.

646
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:40,950
Okay. So this is not my kid is three miles away. What you see is that but living near a living,

647
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:47,940
having a neighbor who had autism last year is positively associated with the likelihood that I will get a diagnosis of autism this year.

648
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:51,720
So this dotted line here is an autistic one, which means no affect.

649
01:05:52,050 --> 01:05:58,770
Well, if it's in the water, since we're drinking the same water and that should also be true if the kid had intellectual disability.

650
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:03,060
Right? If there's something in the water that's causing neurological in utero damage.

651
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:07,290
But what do you see? If I live near a kid who has intellectual disability last year,

652
01:06:07,530 --> 01:06:11,189
what does that have to do with my likelihood of getting a diagnosed national disability this year?

653
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:12,270
Absolutely nothing.

654
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:25,630
So you see clustering of autism, the autism diagnosis, not a clustering of these generic kind of, you know, early life learning challenges.

655
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:31,170
Clustering is stronger when parents are more highly educated. And this is it.

656
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:34,210
This is my group. Okay. So I know. I know. I'm running out of time. Stay with me.

657
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:41,349
Stay with me. Okay. So the x axis here is the relative odds are interesting about the risk.

658
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:47,800
The risk that I get a diagnosis of autism in your t premise, say, 2022.

659
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:51,850
So the likelihood I get a diagnosis of your t. I'm at five year old.

660
01:06:52,390 --> 01:07:02,590
Okay, I'm over. What's the likelihood I get not diagnosed with autism in 2022 as a function of living near someone who had autism in 2021?

661
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:08,260
Okay. But that person, there's three types of persons that I kind of live near.

662
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:14,680
I could have lived in or somebody who did not move away or closer or nearer for me, they stayed in their house.

663
01:07:15,070 --> 01:07:22,360
I could have lived near a person who moved closer to me between 2021 and 2022.

664
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:26,140
Or I could have lived near somebody who was farther away from me. But I'm staying put.

665
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:30,220
And so the question is, is this other kid with autism with autism last year?

666
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:34,360
Do they live over here? Do they move closer to me or do they move farther away?

667
01:07:36,430 --> 01:07:41,500
If what is happening? What if what's what's driving the autism?

668
01:07:41,950 --> 01:07:49,089
Part of what's driving the autism diagnosis is the social factors in terms of seeing other kids at the playground who

669
01:07:49,090 --> 01:07:54,520
are also behaving in the same way that your kid is behaving or having the same teacher who happens to know that like,

670
01:07:54,520 --> 01:08:01,509
you know, last year I had Jonny in my class and this year I have piano and both of them had the same thing and Jonny got a diagnosis of autism.

671
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:05,889
So maybe I should talk to Brianna's parents because I think maybe they should get their daughter evaluated for this.

672
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:09,370
Right. So what are things that cluster in social space?

673
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,520
Right. Are those types of information. So what do we see?

674
01:08:12,790 --> 01:08:21,999
So the first is that if you live near a kid who had autism, the first half of this graph, okay, the closer I live, the more likely I am.

675
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,720
So values greater than one indicate I'm more likely to get the diagnosis.

676
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:35,500
So the closer I live to that kid, the more likely I am to get the diagnosis because I go from like less likely if they live away from me to 250.

677
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:40,050
So my neighbor. Now that kid move closer to me.

678
01:08:40,860 --> 01:08:46,640
Now, this is a kid who in 2021 at a diagnosis of autism and lived in Ann Arbor.

679
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:52,950
I live in Dexter. They moved to Dexter. You see the exact same clustering, the exact same relationship.

680
01:08:54,090 --> 01:08:59,200
Now, that kid moved away from me. So they were living next to me in 2021.

681
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:03,820
They were living in Dexter, and now they've moved to Ann Arbor. Nothing.

682
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:10,989
There is no relationship. But I used to live in Dexter, so if there's a problem with the water in Dexter, this graph should look the same.

683
01:09:10,990 --> 01:09:14,020
There should be no difference because I'm always exposed to the same thing.

684
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:21,670
So what is traveling with that other kid information and parents who are sharing that information?

685
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:34,090
So sorry to have to operate. So there's a causal relationship between neighborhood level diagnostic resources and the spatial patterning of autism.

686
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:40,600
So that the notion that where are these neighborhood resources?

687
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:48,760
This is the schools, this is pediatricians, this is playgrounds, these are the places where people are able to share that information.

688
01:09:48,790 --> 01:09:51,370
Now, it is not the case that now when we make it clear,

689
01:09:51,640 --> 01:09:57,070
it is not the case that my autism is somehow not real autism that I got diagnosed with in 2020.

690
01:09:57,130 --> 01:10:03,400
It is not the case that that is not real. It is a real thing. But the question is, am I calling that autism or is that just my behavior?

691
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:09,969
Because what is being transmitted here is not the behavior. It is the calling of that behavior, the diagnosis of that behavior.

692
01:10:09,970 --> 01:10:17,620
And what did I tell you what a diagnosis is. It is a procedure for deciding that a specific disease or disorder is present.

693
01:10:18,130 --> 01:10:22,960
A diagnosis is not a characteristic of the patient. It is a diagnosis is a procedure.

694
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:26,800
Right. So that that was way back. And we want to go back and look at those results.

695
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:31,180
Okay. So I will stay for a couple of minutes.

696
01:10:32,350 --> 01:10:35,590
It's not that. Oh, sorry. This is let me say I'll leave you with this.

697
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,129
So this is again in The Lancet. There are like autism clusters in people now.

698
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:44,460
And yet in this article, in this article, this one explains exactly what I should've said,

699
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:49,600
played with it, and then told you about why I knew this was true. I just wanted our immediate circle.

700
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,630
We had a child with autism. I probably would have recognized it earlier.

701
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:57,100
This is the transmission of social information in this case.

702
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:01,110
I said I'm okay. Thank you all. Wait.

703
01:11:01,330 --> 01:11:02,320
I'll see you on Monday.
