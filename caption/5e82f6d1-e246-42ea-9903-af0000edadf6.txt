1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:15,600
Perfect score for breaking and recovering from stress and stuff like this.

2
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:33,540
I know I said this first because it sounds like I texted or else it would have put together what I had the game.

3
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,230
So I see like, okay,

4
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:48,240
so today I'm going to start talking about and just go over what we had quite a few quizzes that you had plenty of time to answer the questions.

5
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,040
And then I have some other announcements, so I forgive you.

6
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,850
So the first question was about a patient.

7
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:04,320
She has type two diabetes. She has a history of a BMI over this threshold of 40.

8
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:15,180
This individual has an appointment to see the primary care physician, and she's got difficulty controlling her blood glucose.

9
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,630
It's likely she's on several different medications and she refuses to be weighed.

10
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,910
And I gave you a bunch of choices wise in terms of why is it important for the decision to know the patient's weight?

11
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:38,170
Well, the correct answer and we've talked about this class, you need to know the dose of medication to control glucose.

12
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:46,440
So with diabetes treatment, they're going to titrate a certain amount of particular medication to get this right.

13
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:54,570
And it is really important to know the patient's weight, to know where to start these titrations.

14
00:01:55,350 --> 00:02:07,020
And so this is the rationale. And if somebody comes for a visit, a weight record is important and bothersome to that individual.

15
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,450
Just tell them what their weight or have them face the other way so they can't see the scale.

16
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,700
The information here is for the physician to properly dose medication.

17
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:30,360
Okay. Second question. So you talked about the different methods for body composition assessment.

18
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:39,690
And and one of the slides looked at or discussed which tools could be used to determine

19
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,740
body typology or whether or not you had a male or female pattern of adipose tissue,

20
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:56,670
adipose tissue distribution and or to it. And the correct answer was to shift ratio, very simple and straightforward.

21
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:07,909
And then finally, the last question you talked about addressed this issue of thresholds for BMI,

22
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:13,910
cutoffs and and definitions about racial and ethnic groups.

23
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:18,060
Why it's important to consider racial differences.

24
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:25,040
So we talked about cutoffs. And the correct answer was the BMI thresholds for health risk like incident.

25
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,250
Diabetes varies by race. And I showed you this slide.

26
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,690
We talked about how it's cutoffs can vary, but it's thresholds to vary by race and ethnicity.

27
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,850
This study is controlled for socioeconomic status.

28
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,229
I did mention that in the last lecture. So easy quiz.

29
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:54,550
You had plenty of time to answer it. The material in class gets a little more challenging as we get to the middle portion of the course.

30
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:03,340
There's no quiz next week, and I will announce ahead of time whether or not you're going to see a quiz for the following week.

31
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,980
Okay. Any questions about the quiz one.

32
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:11,000
Everybody got all the. No problem. All right.

33
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:18,390
I may be using on purpose just to make sure that everything was working and people are familiar with this material.

34
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,660
All right. Perusal reading.

35
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:28,110
So there's going to be there has been changes made to the perusal.

36
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:36,689
And the issue was going for perusal either through canvas and some students were going through perusal or just going through canvas.

37
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:41,759
And the grade was a reporting and the grade book for reasons that I don't understand.

38
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:45,810
And I asked for help on this to get this straightened out.

39
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:51,149
And so they changed the setting.

40
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,750
So in order to get to the perusal reading, you have to go to assignments.

41
00:04:55,450 --> 00:05:01,800
If you go to assignments, you'll see that perusal button was taken down on the side, first of all.

42
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:13,019
So you've got to go through assignments and the link to perusal is going to be see a little video screen and then you'll see the tool.

43
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:17,669
This tool needs to be rotated in a separate window and then below that you'll see the name of the read.

44
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:23,190
If you click on that button, it'll take you to a paper that's been uploaded.

45
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:39,820
So let's hope that this fixes the problem and that I can easily upload the readings using this change and the perusal program will see.

46
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:47,160
I will be uploading. I'm reading for next week's class this afternoon, so let's hope this works.

47
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:56,130
Any questions about perusal? Yeah. And you also upload a PDF of the documents because we can't print from perusal.

48
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:59,250
Oh, okay. Sure. Thanks.

49
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,060
Do you find it easier to read the PDF than to read it on screen?

50
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,830
Yeah. Yeah, I do too. I think it's anybody.

51
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:18,030
Is it just me or do you read a lot faster when it's a printed document or PDF rather than something that's on the screen?

52
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,440
A lot of people are going to be too. I'm not sure why that is, but.

53
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,860
Yeah. Okay. I could do that. All right.

54
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:34,980
Today we're going to talk about weight bias. Many of you had already had the weight bias course by show of hands.

55
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:41,520
How many of you have had the weight by scores? More than half or about half.

56
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:45,660
Okay. All right. So for today, here's the learning objectives.

57
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:49,870
Understand the complex relationship between psychological factors.

58
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:59,280
Your mind. It should be able to describe the impact of obesity on mental mental health based on stigma.

59
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,400
And we'll talk about external internal stigma.

60
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:09,630
Understand the harmful effects of weight stigma and describe strategies used to prevent weight, stigma and clinical practice.

61
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:18,419
And then I had read a paper on assessing responsiveness to stressful stimuli, people with internalized weight,

62
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:25,500
stigma, and we'll talk about that, the results as we get into that meat of that presentation today.

63
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,390
So here's some key terminology in terms of weight stigma, weight bias.

64
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,920
So weight bias stereotypes.

65
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:48,300
These are generalizations about people who have overweight who or who have obesity, and they're negative stereotypes.

66
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,080
And so here are some examples.

67
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:55,170
Lazy, gluttonous, incompetent, lack of willpower and so on.

68
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:05,880
And these can have significant negative health effects on individuals in which these ideas are put on.

69
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:18,920
So there can be these these feelings are of an individual, a friend, a family member, a health care practitioner can be overt.

70
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:26,879
And somebody might say something that is prejudicial or biased or they can be implicit to the

71
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,740
behavior of the individual interacting with somebody who has these different conditions.

72
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:40,980
And people are very observant, and they can tell whether or not someone is biased against them and making them feel uncomfortable.

73
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:46,530
The level of engagement, for example, can be perceived as a bias.

74
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,290
So there's implicit and explicit, explicit weight bias,

75
00:08:53,010 --> 00:09:03,030
and it has it's the negative attitudes of the individual that might have these feelings towards somebody who's overweight or who has obesity.

76
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:14,720
So wait, stigma here. The social devaluation and denigration of a person because of their excess body weight can lead to negative attitudes,

77
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,120
stereotypes, prejudice, discrimination.

78
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:27,050
And then weight discrimination is the weight based prejudice and unfair treatment toward persons with obesity are overweight.

79
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:34,290
And there are many consequences of this which we'll discuss. And then finally, I mentioned already implicit biases,

80
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:41,030
automatic negative attributes and stereotypes existing outside of the conscious awareness of the individual.

81
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:48,440
Okay, so that's the terminology. And that sets up the rest of the things we're going to discuss today.

82
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:57,090
So. We have certain expectations about how what people should look like and we shouldn't.

83
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:09,900
And this leads to a prejudice. So we have this idea that a person should look to have a certain appearance, they should have a certain body size.

84
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,999
And because not everybody meets these expectations and we see that in the social media,

85
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:29,850
we see in advertisements for all kinds of different things clothes, cosmetics, people engaged in different types of activities.

86
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,959
We have this perception that everybody should look a certain way.

87
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:36,120
They should have a certain body size that shouldn't exceed certain limits.

88
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:46,560
And because of this, this causes us to have a prejudice, an unfair expectation of people based on just their body size.

89
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:59,350
So. And with this, there's this stereotype or the stereotypical views of people who don't meet these expectations.

90
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:10,300
So again, the stereotypes are listed here in terms of the characteristics of individuals just because of the body size here.

91
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:21,170
The belief is that people will be lazy, not intelligent, lack self-control, noncompliance to treatment due to lack of commitment.

92
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:27,610
These are some examples of some negative stereotypes associated with weight bias.

93
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:34,120
These are common. And as you get into the rest of the talk, we'll see how prevalent this is.

94
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,590
And then as a consequence of this prejudice, these stereotypes,

95
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:49,160
people who don't fit or meet these expectations for a particular body size are discriminated against.

96
00:11:49,550 --> 00:12:02,420
They're unfairly treated. And if it means that someone isn't chosen for a particular employment, someone is excluded in someone's social circle,

97
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,700
someone is excluded for many other reasons,

98
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:17,360
causing all kinds of issues with leaving out a huge segment of our society from participating in regular life.

99
00:12:18,330 --> 00:12:23,520
So we is a significant problem.

100
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,750
And the United States as well as other countries.

101
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:35,350
And. It's one of the it's rarely challenged, I guess I should say.

102
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,189
It's something that happens very frequently and commonly,

103
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:47,380
and people are less apt to correct somebody else who has said something disparaging about somebody's body size.

104
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:54,630
So it's it's rarely challenged. And this is highly problematic. It is.

105
00:12:54,690 --> 00:13:07,530
This is prevalent. So when you look at BMI classifications and you get a sample of people who have experienced weight stigma or weight bias,

106
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:11,460
it increases as you go up the BMI chart.

107
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,610
Now, this is just one particular survey that I mentioned here,

108
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:26,970
and this is a 2006 study by Rebecca Poole looking at people who have described their experiences from others and regard to weight bias.

109
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:36,270
So about 20% people in class one BMI of 30 to 35 and about 42% for people who are in this class.

110
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:44,690
Three are BMI, 40 and over. So another important statistic in terms of prevalence.

111
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:52,790
There's this high percentage of adults with overweight and obese who experience internalized weight bias.

112
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,990
They feel that they're less of a person.

113
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:02,710
They believe this prejudice. They believe these stereotypes because of their body size.

114
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:12,650
And this is the first time we have in the last 50 years experience in terms of this,

115
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,980
that the prevalence of people who have a BMI of 30 and over has increased dramatically.

116
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:29,240
Yet you'd think that there would be less weight bias as a consequence because more people would be easy.

117
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,400
But know that weight bias appears to be increasing.

118
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:37,759
So this was based on a study that I'm going to show you here in a minute.

119
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:45,440
The results of another Rebecca full study, about a 66% increase within this ten year period of time.

120
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:55,220
And it's found in many settings in education and health care and family settings in all kinds of different situations.

121
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:05,820
So this is another study that looked at perceptions of weight discrimination,

122
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:11,070
the prevalence and comparison to race, gender discrimination in the United States.

123
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,950
So we're looking at rates of perceived discrimination.

124
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:23,579
So individuals who perceived discrimination by their gender, their race, their age,

125
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:27,780
their way, their height, their appearance or their ethnicity and nationality are shown here.

126
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,530
And this is people 25 to 74.

127
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:40,680
The blue bars correspond to men and the pink bar start, pink bars correspond to women.

128
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:51,989
And you can see here that that seems to be the most prevalent in terms of a perception of discrimination against women here and followed by race,

129
00:15:51,990 --> 00:16:00,360
where men experience a greater degree or they perceive a greater degree of discrimination and that age,

130
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,860
weight or height, appearance and ethnicity and nationality.

131
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:15,960
Okay. So we have more discrimination or perceived discrimination against women than men.

132
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:27,390
And this can vary by by race. So individuals of different races may experience discrimination if,

133
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:35,850
like women have a tendency to to feel a greater degree of discrimination than black women in regard to their body size.

134
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:49,790
This is the trend that I was telling you about, where you see an increase in perceived discrimination among adults here in the US.

135
00:16:50,840 --> 00:17:02,840
So the same kind of. Issues here, I should say categories on the X axis, gender, race, age, weight or height.

136
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:09,550
And we're seeing that between 1995 and 96 and 2004.

137
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:20,540
In 2006, we're seeing an increase in perceived discrimination, gender among women and this particular bar race,

138
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:28,610
age greater in women, weight or height, greater in women and ethnicity and nationality.

139
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:41,180
Now, this was 2008. I wish I could find a similar study done recently, especially since we've had this huge social disruption from COVID.

140
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:49,340
And this is the period between 2016 and 2020 where there is a lot of things

141
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:55,460
that happened in our society that in terms of discrimination and polarization,

142
00:17:55,550 --> 00:18:04,370
of political views and all kinds of other things. I would love to see a similar study done now with these different data points.

143
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:10,670
Yeah. Can you clarify the proposal there?

144
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:15,350
The purple here is that instead of it being mounted on the previous graphics.

145
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:22,970
1990 596. But does this color this this maroon?

146
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,430
Okay, the maroon color would be 2004, 2006.

147
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:36,770
So the point of this is to show that discrimination against waiter height has increased during this ten year period.

148
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,260
So these fires are not all in the previous chart.

149
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:48,270
Woman. Oh, yeah, I see that. Yes. Okay.

150
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:57,520
So this chart is about man and woman. Yes, I think it's.

151
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:06,540
So where does this come from? Where would you experience of interpersonal sting?

152
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:13,930
And this is broken down in this particular chart by percent by gender.

153
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:25,630
So this is sources of interpersonal stigma. The number one place where people experience weight stigma is with their doctors.

154
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:33,640
So women more so than men, but not much. And yes, it's family members.

155
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:41,860
So people feel pressured by their own family members for their body stuff.

156
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:52,840
And then if you're in school classmates, more so men than women and then all of the others.

157
00:19:52,860 --> 00:20:06,030
So you have sales clerk, your mother, friends, coworkers, spouse, restaurant servers, nurses, community members, father employers,

158
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:16,380
sister, dietitians, dietitians, brothers, teachers, authorities, police, mental health professionals, one daughter and others.

159
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:22,500
So a wide spectrum of different types of the personal inter interpersonal interactions.

160
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
The potential to experience weight stigma.

161
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:34,460
The people who know you the best might be the people who make you feel bad because of your body size.

162
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:44,720
As far as there is male doctors, the females know many women who experience this discrimination.

163
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:53,480
But let's say that sisters and daughters.

164
00:20:55,330 --> 00:21:00,970
Are the sources that journalists were prevented from using.

165
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:05,590
Yeah. The other thing about these types of graphs. The other one had bars, error bars.

166
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:11,350
We like to see error bars to see the rate, you know, standard error mean not necessarily standard deviation because they can be huge.

167
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:20,470
They don't show that here as well. So I would like to see that there was another hand that went up that comment.

168
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:26,440
Yeah, I did have a comment to what you said about bias coming from the closest members.

169
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,140
Um, they are also the people that affect us more. Right?

170
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:34,270
You could easily dismiss the comment from my own personal account.

171
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:44,210
Yes. People you you are interacting with probably more frequently than everybody else's like.

172
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:52,070
That can have long lasting effects in terms of chronic the perception or chronic stress.

173
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:56,210
To get to a little bit in more subtle ways, too.

174
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:04,700
Yes, that's an implicit bias. Why is this occur?

175
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,720
Why do we think that everybody should have a certain body size?

176
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,610
Well, you should appreciate the fact that everybody is different.

177
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:21,410
We have we have different genetic backgrounds. We have we live in different environments.

178
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,970
We behave differently.

179
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:33,740
Why do we have this bias toward people against their body size, particular people who reach a certain threshold to higher BMI values?

180
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:42,350
Well, with attribution theory that would explain that people think that people get that they deserve that.

181
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:53,750
If people who have obesity or who have that who have obesity, I apologize for that type of they're responsible.

182
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:57,559
Their own their own weight is their responsibility.

183
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:04,130
So it's due to their controllable factors that are responsible for them being overweight.

184
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:10,940
So this is the idea that you can control this, which, as I mentioned, is not true.

185
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:17,660
It's the causes of someone to be overweight or have to have obesity are complex.

186
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:23,360
It's not simple. It's it's it's not something that people can easily control.

187
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:33,230
Okay. Then there are the cultural values for thinness, and this will influence people's views on this.

188
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,110
And then there's the negative portrayals of persons with obesity in the media.

189
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:49,750
This can influence why people feel this way or they have certain expectations on people's body sizes.

190
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:58,170
And this can influence people, these expectations as well.

191
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:09,010
And then there's the negative portrayals with, as I wanted to show you,

192
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:14,950
a visual of this negative portrayals of persons with obesity in the popular press.

193
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:20,610
So this should be avoided. We have the headless body here as an example.

194
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:28,620
We have people shown here eating vast quantities of food.

195
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:34,650
And we have this is actually from the National Institutes of Environmental Health.

196
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:43,820
That's up from the IHS website, where they're actually measuring this guy's waist circumference and cutting off the rest of his body.

197
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:54,510
So this is an example of a negative portrayal of people who have overweight or excuse me or who have obesity.

198
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,740
And in this case,

199
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:04,590
they're just looking at this individual for their ways or measurements should avoid this type of imagery if you're making presentations.

200
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:11,700
Okay, I'm not going to show you this because I don't think you would get through it the rest of what we have to talk about today.

201
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,240
So the Weight of the Nation has a segment on weight stigma.

202
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:21,000
Rebecca Poole and Kelly Brownell are two experts in the field.

203
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:30,390
You can look at that and they can be described in very, very good detail about by weight discrimination.

204
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:34,920
And those are two very good experts in that field.

205
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:47,370
Okay. So weight discrimination, as I showed you, that that graph is common in the health care setting and only among doctors and nurses,

206
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:50,550
among dieticians, among everybody who works in health care settings.

207
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:59,560
It's common in education and the setting of primary schools in particular, and it's common in employment.

208
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:05,220
It can be experienced as explicit, implicit bias.

209
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:19,530
So in terms of the health care setting, where you are seeing a primary care physician or a dietitian or some other health care professional,

210
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:24,180
you're seeking help from these individuals to assess your health and help you make decisions.

211
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:34,590
And if a person has bias against you because of your body size, it's going to negatively impact how they work with you.

212
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,920
And if it's just implicit bias,

213
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:45,060
you can kind of tell whether or not this person is really interested in helping you or because of their implicit bias, they're disengaged.

214
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:50,399
They're going to walk through the process, which you perhaps but maybe not make eye contact with.

215
00:26:50,400 --> 00:27:03,060
You maybe have other types of social cues with their body that may make you feel that you're not worthy of their attention.

216
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:12,030
So it affects the quality of health care services. It affects the potential for social treatment.

217
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:23,940
Many health care professionals disengage and don't provide appropriate care because of their their prejudice, their expectations on somebody.

218
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:29,040
But they think that their behavior is it leads to their their body size.

219
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:40,559
And not only does this prevent people who are seeking care from getting appropriate care, it has a negative impact on the individual.

220
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,550
They feel unworthy.

221
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:52,770
So with that in itself can cause psychological, significant psychological effects, which you'll see here in greater detail here in a minute.

222
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:05,670
So the clients, the patients feel that they're not valued and or there's some type of an explicit bias that's downright insulting.

223
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:10,540
As a consequence, that individual might disengage.

224
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:19,740
Look, I'm never going there again, but when I go there, the seats I can't I feel bad because I can't fit in the seat that people look at me.

225
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,799
They're like, I'm from from outer space.

226
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:28,130
They look at me like I don't belong. My doctor won't spend enough time with me.

227
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:35,700
I came in to talk about my arthritis and all of right away they started to talk about strategies for weight loss.

228
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:43,710
And so these are the kinds of issues that people face all the time when they're seeking care from health care professionals.

229
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:51,060
So this is the type of bias that can cause people to disengage and it can cause psychological harm.

230
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:00,790
So it's it's common. There are adverse health consequences.

231
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:11,920
And then there's this ridiculous notion that, oh, people are shamed for their body size that will cause a change in their behavior.

232
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:20,590
It also has a negative impact on their psychological health, and it may actually have a negative impact on their health behaviors.

233
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:31,930
Internalized weight bias is particularly problematic because if people are treated in a certain way,

234
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:37,210
they start to have certain expectations about how other people will treat them.

235
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:43,120
And this can involve every aspect of their lives.

236
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,649
So, oh, I need to go see my doctor.

237
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:53,170
I need to have my medication adjusted. But I know that this is going to be an uncomfortable experience.

238
00:29:53,170 --> 00:30:00,430
They probably won't spend any time with me because I don't deserve it, because I've let myself get into this condition.

239
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:04,510
So these are the kinds of thoughts that go through people's minds, Oh,

240
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:12,369
I'm not going to go to my high school reunion because people are going to be have a

241
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:16,600
negative opinion of me because I've gained weight since I graduated from high school,

242
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:21,250
and therefore I probably shouldn't go and it's going to make me feel bad.

243
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:28,330
So these are some examples of internalized bias that affects people's behavior.

244
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,560
They're disengaging not only from health care professionals, but life in general.

245
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:47,930
So there have been lots of public health interventions encouraging people to live a healthy lifestyle to prevent weight gain, overweight and obesity.

246
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,740
And they don't work very well at all.

247
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:56,150
We're still seeing an increased prevalence of overweight and obesity in the country.

248
00:30:56,390 --> 00:31:04,910
These aren't working at all. So some public health interventions have used.

249
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:11,030
Number two, this one here as a way to motivate people for change.

250
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:16,250
And that's been probably a good example of that in the back in the second year.

251
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:21,320
And then weight bias can manifest social inequity.

252
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:28,160
So because of these, as I mentioned earlier, because of prejudice, because of this stigmatization,

253
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:34,520
it's going to cause people now that are seeking employment to not be chosen for a particular job or

254
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:40,850
to be paid less or to get less of a raise because of somebody else's bias against their body size,

255
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:46,430
or to not be included in different types of social gatherings and so on.

256
00:31:50,900 --> 00:32:00,830
So how does psychological help how is it affected by obesity and.

257
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:08,280
How is psychological help health affected by weight gain?

258
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:17,390
Obviously, people there's a relationship between obesity and psychological health and health.

259
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:27,320
We're talking about depression here. So specific populations might be more vulnerable to psychological stress.

260
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:36,710
Again, it depends on that particular social group that that person circulates and it can.

261
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:43,190
This psychological health, a negative impact, can be influenced by their race or ethnicity,

262
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:55,850
and whether or not somebody experiences a significant consequences of way spot bias can be affected by their their experiences.

263
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:03,800
So if a child who becomes an adult experienced an awful lot of stigmatization when they were younger,

264
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:07,910
this is going to have a long lasting, profound effect into adulthood.

265
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:22,700
So if you were to look at your life as an index of body size and look at people who have taken a test to

266
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:29,480
determine whether or not they have a clinical depression based on this diagnostic interview schedule,

267
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:39,680
you'd find that if you look at BMI scale, it really goes up or makes a turn upward when we get to that.

268
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:47,810
In terms of BMI size, as we get to the Class one and notice here, there are differences between men and women.

269
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,370
So women that's the graph is indicated by a blue line.

270
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:57,830
And for men, it's a red line and a growth increase with increasing BMI.

271
00:33:57,830 --> 00:34:02,150
But they really start to increase after you reach a certain threshold, BMI.

272
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:15,620
So these are the these individuals are greatly affected by this depression as a consequence of their being

273
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,900
exposed to weight bias and probably a lot of other things as well that might be occurring internally.

274
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:33,120
So here's an example of a negative or a poorly devised public health measure to

275
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:38,130
encourage or prevent or encourage healthy behavior and prevent childhood obesity.

276
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,720
So this ad appeared on a billboard in Atlanta, Georgia.

277
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,830
And this was in 2012.

278
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:53,550
This is from Children's Health Care of Atlanta. So you have different pictures of kids.

279
00:34:54,240 --> 00:35:01,470
And underneath each child is there in red warning and a different statement,

280
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:10,200
stigmatizing statement one about kids might not outlive their parents, that kids become fat adults.

281
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:17,960
Big bones don't make me this way. My meals did. And he has his father's eyes, his is and even his diabetes.

282
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:20,700
These are terrible messages.

283
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:30,660
These are something that can cause a very negative affect in individuals, especially children, when they see this type of imagery.

284
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:38,320
And unfortunately, you would think that somebody in the health care setting would know that, no, he would never do this.

285
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:44,580
But these appeared in billboards in the Atlanta metropolitan area in 2012.

286
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,630
Okay. Let's talk about, um, this, um,

287
00:35:54,200 --> 00:36:05,120
this negative feedback loop in terms of how weight stigma can cause compensatory behaviors that unhealthy compensatory behaviors.

288
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:12,050
Now, this is a generalization, and we're going to get into the reading that we talked about here in a minute.

289
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:18,200
But this particular figure pertains to pediatric obesity.

290
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:27,200
So the child may experience weight, stigmatization, teasing, bullying, victimization from other children.

291
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:33,979
And as a consequence, they experience physiological and psychosocial problems,

292
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:42,680
physiological stress and psychosocial problems such as depression, low self-esteem, social isolation and impaired academic performance.

293
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:51,000
And we'll see about the physiological stress that could arise from this type of experience.

294
00:36:52,350 --> 00:37:01,889
Now the theory is that in response to this stress, the individual seeks out a way to alleviate that stress and alleviate it.

295
00:37:01,890 --> 00:37:09,570
That stress might be due may may come in the form of consuming food that makes them feel better.

296
00:37:09,930 --> 00:37:11,880
And this could increase caloric intake.

297
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:23,790
And this is that this is a theoretical paradigm here and then and perhaps leading to decreased physical activity and and continuing the cycle.

298
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,670
Yeah. Kitty, you had a question or comment. So just because like this loop it.

299
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:42,280
I understand that the implications are negative as they would negatively impact a person, but this is by definition of positive feedback.

300
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:46,340
Right. Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. The implications are very good.

301
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:51,250
The implications are negative, but it's a positive feedback. Okay. Now, let's see.

302
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:54,640
Let's see if this is true.

303
00:37:54,640 --> 00:38:01,270
This psychological stress that one experiences can cause physiologic stress.

304
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:05,349
Okay. So, A, have you read this paper?

305
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:12,940
Because I thought it was interesting. There's a lot in here that doesn't come out as the way you might interpret this kind of information.

306
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,480
So the paper was on weight internalization.

307
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:31,389
Um, you're trying to now measure and put people in categories based on their internalized weight bias or weight bias internalization.

308
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:38,320
And you're essentially it's a measure of how much people agree with negative stereotypes and they had a different scale for this.

309
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:51,370
And based on that, they put people in different categories and they subjected to them, these individuals, to this trigger social stress test.

310
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:56,860
And they measured salivary cortisol at different time periods.

311
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:08,520
And they expected to find that people who had this higher level of internalized weight by to have to be very reactive.

312
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:16,139
In other words, if they experience some kind of some form of stress because they're always stressed that they should have a

313
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:24,600
higher reaction to that stress in the form of producing more cortisol through the hypothalamic pituitary axis.

314
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:40,560
But what they found was they found the opposite, and they found that people with lower internalized bias had greater reactivity to the stress.

315
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:48,730
And the stress test is essentially they have to give a speech to an audience that could be critical and they have to solve math problems,

316
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:57,959
which causes this stress response in individuals. The people who are in the middle in terms of their internalized bias were in the

317
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,700
middle and the people who had the highest level of internalized weight bias.

318
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:07,020
They they had a kind of more of a flat response.

319
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:12,929
So how do you interpret this data? And there were some explanations in the discussion.

320
00:40:12,930 --> 00:40:16,290
But I'm interested I've read some of your comments this morning.

321
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:30,240
But how do you how did you interpret this information? Like there's like this internal relations of.

322
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:45,870
They're become adaptive to us that they don't they don't have spikes like those like insulin resistance, like force increases.

323
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:49,420
They're unresponsive to the stressful stimuli.

324
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:58,179
Yeah. So there's this discussion about whether the chronic level of cortisol would be higher,

325
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:06,280
and maybe it is, but this tells you a lot about people's reactivity afterwards.

326
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:11,200
It's I'll say that this tells me that this is real.

327
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:11,860
Okay.

328
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:21,790
And that you can measure this type of response and draw the conclusion that this stress response in people that experience internalized weight bias,

329
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:29,110
their stress response is kind of burned out. They experience it all the time, and that's how potent it is.

330
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:35,890
You know who else would respond like this to different stressful stimuli?

331
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:44,480
Well, who else might respond? Who is who may have been exposed to chronic stress?

332
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:51,670
I've got Kitty. And then and then she actually she becomes a trauma for.

333
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,180
Yeah. Victims of trauma. Yes. Yes.

334
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:05,590
That's why I've seen this all the time is parents that they have to work and they have to look after the kids to see causes of psychological fatigue.

335
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:11,499
Yeah. And also parents who have children that may be ADHD.

336
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:16,000
So they have to do actual. So they have to be less react.

337
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:27,040
That's what I was thinking of, was post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans and war veterans.

338
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:32,170
They responded like that. So they were exposed to constant stress.

339
00:42:32,620 --> 00:42:41,020
And as a consequence, when they are exposed to other kinds of stress tests, stress test, they don't get a response.

340
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:45,460
And because of this being over stimulated for such a long period of time.

341
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:50,920
So this is real. This is a very stressful physiologic response that people experience.

342
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:57,790
Now, making the connection between this response and whether or not people overeat in response to this.

343
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:01,420
I've got to see a lot more data to see if that's true.

344
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:07,750
It sounds interesting, but I don't know what. That's what's driving this cycle for sure.

345
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:13,930
Okay. So that's that's something that is a is an important research question.

346
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:28,270
So if it's the cortisol that's driving the inappropriate behavior leading to weight gain, it sounds true.

347
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:32,230
And maybe in a in an animal model, you can demonstrate this.

348
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:40,630
But when somebody is experiencing constant stress, are they truly consuming over consuming calories?

349
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:47,020
Do they get a positive energy balance as a consequence of this type of response over here at home?

350
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:58,210
So you're saying that becoming or gaining weight would be a symptom of higher cortisol levels induced by stress?

351
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:03,760
It's not clear from what from the data that I showed you, it's more complicated than that.

352
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:09,309
It's more complicated than that. Somebody on the other hand.

353
00:44:09,310 --> 00:44:19,890
But I think really quick. I think it's I think this idea that it's just cortisol, you're responding to cortisol and you overcompensate.

354
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,980
I think that's a very simplistic explanation. But you see it all the time.

355
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:28,750
Okay. All right.

356
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:39,260
So it has a significant physiologic impact, a negative impact on individuals, and this can affect education attainment.

357
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:52,820
How do you think it can affect this educational attainment? People apply for admission to college through an online application.

358
00:44:53,300 --> 00:45:01,880
How do you think that's going to affect that? Someone once said that again,

359
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:12,229
if someone is losing class due to this rate this person affects and ultimately he might miss classes might not come to the university,

360
00:45:12,230 --> 00:45:16,460
for example, because of the stigmatization. Okay.

361
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:20,810
So this, of course, would affect them. You would be feeling low self-esteem.

362
00:45:20,990 --> 00:45:24,650
You want to be said thing that is unworthy, for example.

363
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:34,250
There are many ways. Yeah. Yes. And the last point is it's really important unworthy not even apply because they feel unworthy because of the self.

364
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:46,870
And the person is in many ways is as uniquely as someone who is overweight or obese or physically they would see this.

365
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:56,900
Now, if you do that here, do any of you remember posting your picture when you're applying to applications in Japan?

366
00:45:57,110 --> 00:45:59,920
Yes, in Japan they still do. They still do. Okay.

367
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:05,780
In other countries, a lot of times when I'm reviewing applications for students to come to the School of Public Health,

368
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:11,600
they'll have an application that they use for many different places that they're applying to,

369
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:24,830
and they'll have their picture posted, particularly students from other countries in around other Middle Eastern countries,

370
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:30,050
where else I've in Africa or else I've seen this.

371
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:37,150
Yeah. Mostly. Mostly the US and China.

372
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:41,020
Japan. Japan? Yeah. I'm not sure what China.

373
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:48,910
I know. So these are reasons why that there could be less education attainment, access to employment.

374
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:55,120
You there have been studies done for people with the same criteria, like the same same background,

375
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,810
same education level, same skill set, same levels of recommendation.

376
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:08,540
And they show up for the interview. And the person who has a higher BMI is denied and the person has lower BMI gets it.

377
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:15,700
Okay. This has been this has been shown on TV shows. And in terms of how this bias can affect our selection of people.

378
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:21,880
Do we want to. Who are looking for jobs? Socioeconomic status is a complicated thing.

379
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:29,079
Do people attain a lower socioeconomic status because of weight bias,

380
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:35,350
preventing them from getting an education and attaining a higher level of employment?

381
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:41,410
Or does the weight bias affect their performance?

382
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:50,800
And if they don't do it as well and as a consequence they have a lower socio economic status.

383
00:47:51,880 --> 00:48:04,540
So clearly if you look at data, looking at the prevalence of overweight and obesity, it's higher in people of a lower socioeconomic status.

384
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:09,939
And I think that says a lot more about the availability of food and the cost of

385
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:16,750
food and the cost of a calorie dense food as opposed to nutrient dense foods.

386
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:21,040
There's a lot there's a lot in there as well that I won't mention.

387
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:29,740
Health care delivery, as we already talked about, interpersonal relationships, psychological health.

388
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:42,680
Yes. So as far as are you are you able to find that it is more like a reverse causation so that the loss is impacting people's needs or.

389
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:53,889
Guess. Yeah. So so people don't get the job to begin with or they don't advance as much because of the job,

390
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:58,990
because they are feeling stigmatized against their performance.

391
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:07,810
They may disengage. That might affect their performance. It may cause depression and that might cause them to not reach as high,

392
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:12,880
high levels as somebody who doesn't have to face that level of psychological impact.

393
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:20,290
But like when you were referring to the cost of losing. Yeah, that's an investment and more like a reverse causation.

394
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,040
I think it could be. It could be. Or it's not.

395
00:49:26,050 --> 00:49:29,410
It is. It is clearly a two way interaction.

396
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:42,040
Okay. Yeah. Jimi, I just want to mention also like the whitewashing of like health foods and potentially people in Lower Isaiah's not feeling like,

397
00:49:42,790 --> 00:49:47,079
you know, any foods relate to like they're potentially culture.

398
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,280
And that could just be another thing that goes along with that. Oh, yeah.

399
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:54,040
Yeah. I have a whole nother lecture on food that will talk about these issues.

400
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,920
Okay. So I checked that I Googled this today.

401
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:08,550
And it's still true that in Michigan this is the only state now we talk about employment bias.

402
00:50:09,090 --> 00:50:17,040
It's the only state where there in Michigan that forbids explicitly forbids weight based discrimination in the state.

403
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:21,210
Still, it can happen. It can be an implicit bias. Right.

404
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:28,920
So for explicit bias, you cannot deny somebody employment because of their body size.

405
00:50:30,810 --> 00:50:40,469
And so here's here's the law. Michigan law prohibits discrimination or employment for education or housing for public accommodation,

406
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:47,430
law enforcement or other public services based on any of these criteria and weight is included in this.

407
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:53,790
Now, that doesn't mean it doesn't happen. But explicit bias against it.

408
00:50:53,790 --> 00:51:02,310
If somebody were denied a position or services because and they wrote and because of their weight will that against the law.

409
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:08,550
But implicit bias still does occur. 49 other states need to catch up with us in this aspect.

410
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:17,280
Yes, a lot of the. So if someone were to write down weight is the reason why.

411
00:51:18,090 --> 00:51:22,770
What are the consequences? So in the olden days. You.

412
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:35,190
If you were an airline, there might be restrictions on wait for items usually within flight attendants.

413
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:43,200
So there was a weight limit for flight attendants. So a person could be fired because they exceeded a certain weight.

414
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:48,770
Now, flight attendants, I believe, have a union now and they fought against that successfully.

415
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:57,480
So that's no longer a limitation. So the consequence would be to the employer would be that they would face a lawsuit, the discriminatory lawsuit,

416
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:06,720
and the person who is filed the suit would be compensated or they would be entitled for compensation in a court of law.

417
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:14,890
This has happened because it is okay to charge people more money for wired receipts.

418
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:21,100
That's a big that's a long discussion in terms of, you know, it seems unfair.

419
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,820
Okay. We're getting we're getting it right. Right. Yes.

420
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:30,280
And states are getting smaller. Right. So this is a really complicated thing.

421
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:33,549
So I don't know, have you noticed this in your lifetime?

422
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:40,930
The seats are getting smaller. They're getting and they're getting closer together and the spaces between the seats are getting smaller.

423
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,660
So what's that? That is expected because it's a lower cost measure.

424
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:49,750
Exactly. It's a lower it's a it's a cost issue.

425
00:52:50,140 --> 00:52:55,570
But more than anything else, it is a cost saving issue for these airlines to operate like this.

426
00:52:56,530 --> 00:53:05,230
Okay. So and then set this up. So it's a very long discussion as to what can be done and why this is unfair and so on.

427
00:53:05,290 --> 00:53:13,060
Go ahead. Just like example, like when I was younger and we would like me and my family would fly to Europe or like have a really long flight.

428
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:19,090
My parents would like purposely buy the bigger seats like if they are overweight, but just for comfort reasons.

429
00:53:19,090 --> 00:53:24,610
So I think like in that sense, yes, it's fair to charge more because you're paying for that amenity.

430
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:32,469
So I guess, like they're not necessarily, I guess like charging more for those seats because someone's bigger.

431
00:53:32,470 --> 00:53:36,400
But I would understand that someone bigger would have to pay for that seat.

432
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:42,090
So it's there's kind of like to answer it to. Yes, go ahead.

433
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:45,870
The bigger person just doesn't have access.

434
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:50,010
Yeah, that's fair. Yeah. Yeah. In terms of amenities.

435
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:56,009
Yeah. What we're saying. Is that true? Because of the cost lowering, they transition from, like,

436
00:53:56,010 --> 00:54:02,280
having an actual seat to having a teeny tiny little space where you're confined for like 12 hours.

437
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:11,180
No one wanted to deal with that is since obesity is considered a disease.

438
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,330
Wouldn't that be like in a medical accommodation? You would think.

439
00:54:15,110 --> 00:54:20,270
You would think it would be a medical a combination that wouldn't require an additional charge.

440
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:24,260
Right. But that's not the case. That's. They have to.

441
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:34,040
Oh. You can't fit in to see what you have to get. You have to get a seat in case three times as much money you need to cover a higher level.

442
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:38,540
So I think there are three levels down here from their all the last names of.

443
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:41,930
But yeah. One more more more common than we have to move on.

444
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:50,990
In terms of the weight bias, I do understand how legally there can be repercussions at the same time that doesn't affect the hiring process.

445
00:54:51,710 --> 00:55:01,470
So if they are to select what they would consider more desirable for marketing purposes, they will still do that.

446
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:07,610
Yeah, we've had it in regard to marketing.

447
00:55:07,610 --> 00:55:17,690
We've seen more diverse imagery, not only on body size and race and different types of ads that you might see,

448
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:25,010
but you're going to find that with ads and media, they're going to be tailored to you.

449
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:38,510
So if you're the kind of person who is always looking at certain types of popular websites and which include a certain body size,

450
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,809
a certain race, they're going to feed you that kind of information.

451
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:46,040
And you might not even see this other world that there are people of other

452
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:49,820
different other races and colors and different bodies that you might see that.

453
00:55:50,300 --> 00:56:02,230
So that's that's another thing you've got to consider with that, with our modern social media in terms of exposure to other types of imagery, we.

454
00:56:04,850 --> 00:56:08,989
Okay. If you've heard this already,

455
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:18,170
this is very common among health care professionals about negative opinions of people who are overweight or who have obesity.

456
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:24,530
This is data coming from pool and Brownell again to experts in the field.

457
00:56:25,640 --> 00:56:34,160
Rebecca Pool is now at the University of Connecticut and she is in the the Rudd Center and this is a great resource for you.

458
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,760
For more information on this Rudd Center. Kelly Brownell moves these things to individuals who were at Yale.

459
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,970
They've since most of different institutions. Kelly Brownell.

460
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:51,560
Last I heard, he was at Duke. He was more of an administrator of the department chair or director of a center down there.

461
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:58,159
So anyway, two famous people in the field, self-reported weight balance and a health care setting.

462
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,430
And this gives you an idea of how common this is. I already mentioned it.

463
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:05,870
I showed you a bar graph and it involves just about everybody in the process.

464
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,760
Yes, it's more common than you know.

465
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:20,929
I've known the case that they want. They went to a dietician and they used to like to step on the guidance and see that they didn't lose weight.

466
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:29,970
And they used to say, if you went for two weeks and you didn't lose any any weight, they used the same dimensions.

467
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:34,970
You're trying to make them feel guilty or something.

468
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:40,540
And one time, a dietitian used to tell them that if you don't lose weight again, I don't need you.

469
00:57:41,540 --> 00:57:48,720
So even more common among blacks is that they should be doing this right,

470
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:55,340
should be a source of encouragement and a source of help rather than discouragement and bias.

471
00:57:55,670 --> 00:58:00,480
True? Yes. Okay.

472
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:07,970
Similar descriptions of physicians reactions, patients who have obesity.

473
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:14,150
This comes from these two papers here. Note the language here.

474
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:17,810
Instead of with obesity, obese patients, and this is taken right out of the literature.

475
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:25,430
Less time to discuss options for treatment. And this is a very big deal here for individuals.

476
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:37,040
So when you have as I gave in in the example in the quiz, you have a woman BMI of 41 and she does a lot of your weight.

477
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:40,609
And that's to tell you something about somebody comes in, they don't want to be weighed.

478
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:44,840
She tells you something about their past experience with health in the health care setting.

479
00:58:45,110 --> 00:58:48,560
Hey, when you see that or you hear that. Pay attention.

480
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:52,159
Talk to that person. They don't have to know the weight when they come in weight.

481
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:57,770
And again, you need to collect that information to to appropriately administer medication.

482
00:58:59,250 --> 00:59:08,810
But if somebody comes in and they have this appearance of they're they're shy, they're they're not offering a whole lot of information.

483
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:15,330
It's going to take a while for you to listen to them, to get to know that person and to understand the issues that they're facing.

484
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:20,600
Okay. And this can improve interventions for treatment and it takes time.

485
00:59:21,380 --> 00:59:31,280
Don't assume somebody has a certain lifestyle that has led to their certain body size because of these negative perceptions.

486
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:40,610
Everybody's different. Everybody has a different story. Everybody has a different life experience, different or negatively.

487
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:43,640
We've already talked about this less desire to help a patient.

488
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:51,680
So this is another big problem with the individual and not enough time spent based on these assumptions about people.

489
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:56,960
Okay. And then that the feeling that it's a waste of time.

490
00:59:56,970 --> 01:00:00,650
Similar types of attitudes about dietitians that you mentioned.

491
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:12,050
And this is from Rebecca Poole. And responses of patients who experience weight bias in the health care setting.

492
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:16,969
They're embarrassed to be weighed. And the solution to that is turn around.

493
01:00:16,970 --> 01:00:22,280
They don't need to see that. That's information for the health care provider and that can address that issue.

494
01:00:25,400 --> 01:00:31,850
They're discouraged from making positive lifestyle changes because they might feel that

495
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:37,579
they're still going to meet with this negative or negative perception of the health care

496
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:44,120
provider because it might not be enough or their behavior change that they're proud of might

497
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:48,110
not impress the health care provider at all because all they can see is their body size.

498
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:53,509
They they'll avoid preventative care services.

499
01:00:53,510 --> 01:00:57,139
And this is the biggest problem associated with health care and weight bias.

500
01:00:57,140 --> 01:01:05,000
People just avoid going to see their primary care physician for regular checkups so that people who

501
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:13,400
are at risk avoid these interactions and it is more likely that they suffer severe consequence.

502
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:22,430
I can think of one example a while ago points in 13 years ago now I had a technician

503
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:29,990
who was applying to medical school and his mother who had overweight or obese.

504
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:33,970
I don't remember which she would read.

505
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:40,610
She would avoid health care. She was a social worker and she would avoid regular visits to her doctor.

506
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:50,660
And one day when this college aged father went home after work, he found his wife.

507
01:01:52,370 --> 01:02:03,680
She had died. She had died of sudden cardiac death in her bedroom, and his mother had avoided regular checkups.

508
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:15,100
And as a consequence, she died prematurely. And she could have, if she could have experienced this longer experience to life and to see her son, J.

509
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:23,180
And his goal to become a physician and and the greater Detroit metro area to help people like his mother.

510
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:28,070
So, you know, that's a that's a that's an all too common story.

511
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:33,650
People are avoiding care who are at high risk to suffer a significant consequence.

512
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:36,980
So.

513
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:52,520
So when people avoid or experience a bias, they might continue to engage in unhealthy behaviors or have a low or poor social or psychological affect.

514
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:57,940
And because of that, they disengage and socially isolate themselves.

515
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:01,550
They don't engage in physical activity,

516
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:13,490
might have little interest in changing their behavior as a consequence of the health psychological consequences that I mentioned.

517
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:23,780
And this happens all the time to folks. And if you look at that video and on whether the nation on weight bias with stigmatization,

518
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:33,740
you'll hear people give a bunch of different examples of people getting unsolicited advice about about weight loss.

519
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:37,370
So this can happen with family members,

520
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:45,259
with a physician who sees a patient who comes in and she has arthritis and they want treatment for their arthritis.

521
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:49,790
And they get a long spiel about weight loss interventions.

522
01:03:50,090 --> 01:03:54,650
And this is unsolicited advice, as happens in the grocery store where somebody is grocery shopping,

523
01:03:55,250 --> 01:04:00,530
they might have something in the cart that somebody feels is inappropriate and they may come up to them and say,

524
01:04:00,530 --> 01:04:05,150
you don't need that or something like that. This kind of thing happens all the time.

525
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:14,719
Yeah. You had a comment. I just wondered in terms of like a physician counseling, someone who doesn't see anything coming from another health issue,

526
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:22,220
isn't it because isn't there a code for insurance, code for obesity, anything that they can do?

527
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:29,150
Yes. So that comes. So, like when there's a regular thing that you go through.

528
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:36,079
The problem is that not that they're not discussing and not that they're not appropriately

529
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:42,890
measuring somebody's BMI and see whether or not they qualify for treatment based on their BMI.

530
01:04:43,370 --> 01:04:46,320
But that's the first thing that's mentioned, too. Okay.

531
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:54,980
Instead of let's go through the whole checklist and then the health care provider says, can we talk about your your your weight?

532
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:00,270
Instead of saying that first. That's the first thing they go to. And that's what the problem is.

533
01:05:00,390 --> 01:05:04,010
Okay. And if they say, you know, no.

534
01:05:04,020 --> 01:05:10,880
Well, there's that there's another paradigm, another menu that a physician would go through to to help that individual.

535
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:14,900
Ultimately, it's the patient's choice, what the what the treatment is going to be.

536
01:05:15,170 --> 01:05:20,170
Right. But they should walk through the whole thing and know and avoid stigmatizing language.

537
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:25,790
You know, I'll get to that at the very end. Last line. Okay.

538
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:30,820
So. How do you avoid or prevent stigmatization?

539
01:05:31,150 --> 01:05:35,650
Become of your personal, become aware of your personal attitudes.

540
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:43,989
Think about your reaction to people and how that might make them feel they're coming to you.

541
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:51,390
If you're going to be a dietitian, how how do you want that person to feel after they meet with you?

542
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:55,510
You want them to feel that you're you're a good helper.

543
01:05:55,960 --> 01:06:02,890
You can help them do better in terms of their their choice of foods that they eat or

544
01:06:03,290 --> 01:06:09,970
that the physical activity or the amount of and types of food that they're eating,

545
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:15,760
all kinds of things that you can positively effect by life in regard to eating behavior.

546
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:25,090
If you want somebody to come back to you after they've seen you for a couple of visits so that you can help them make positive changes.

547
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:29,170
So if you don't make eye contact with the person,

548
01:06:29,620 --> 01:06:38,560
if you have these internal feelings of bias against an individual because of their body size and assume certain things about their behavior,

549
01:06:38,830 --> 01:06:46,000
well, that's going to have a negative consequence. And they might not ever come back to you again or and might continue to have

550
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:50,440
problems in terms of making healthy choices with their food or their lifestyle.

551
01:06:51,940 --> 01:06:59,890
So the other things that needs to be done is a lot of listening.

552
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:02,290
So you need to understand their point of view.

553
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:09,610
Okay, you read about somebody's situation on a chart and it doesn't give you the full story of a person's history.

554
01:07:10,180 --> 01:07:14,410
So it's important to listen to them, to understand where they're coming from.

555
01:07:14,680 --> 01:07:21,280
Your experiences aren't going to be completely detailed and spelled out on a chart.

556
01:07:21,350 --> 01:07:31,780
You have to sit and listen, and in that way you can help them to develop strategies, to improve their behavior, to create a supportive atmosphere.

557
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:44,710
This could include an environment in which nobody has to feel ashamed for sitting in a chair or that that is confined or too small for individuals.

558
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:53,200
So a lot of times you will see in many of the patient offices in the University Medical Center hear that the seats are wide.

559
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,440
They can accommodate anybody size for somebody to fit into.

560
01:07:58,460 --> 01:08:04,220
And then adopt a sense of communication strategy, and that focuses on behavioral change.

561
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,470
What can this individual do to improve their health?

562
01:08:10,010 --> 01:08:13,040
Focus on that and ask them questions.

563
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:16,730
How do you want to proceed? Here are some options. How do you want to proceed?

564
01:08:17,090 --> 01:08:21,500
And then you can comment on, you know, best choices for the individual's current situation.

565
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:25,730
Okay. And, you know, somebody mentioned cultural sensitivity here.

566
01:08:25,740 --> 01:08:33,440
That's something that's also an issue among dieticians in terms of food choices, in terms of behavioral change.

567
01:08:34,930 --> 01:08:45,520
You have to understand somebody's choice of a particular food in a social setting and what's appropriate for that individual.

568
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:58,060
So if you were to say to somebody that you should avoid white rice, okay, that that could be has a very negative connotation.

569
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:03,820
What do you mean? I should avoid white rice. I, like I say, it's a staple in my culture.

570
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:14,280
I can I can choose to perhaps be less white rice and more vegetables, but I'm not going to avoid eating rice.

571
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:26,560
It's so important to my culture. Okay. So that's that's an example of being insensitive in terms of communication strategies that

572
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:36,880
respect diversity and avoid stereotypes that seem kind of covered this information already.

573
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:49,090
And this has to do with when you're presenting in public setting images of people.

574
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:57,430
Oh, this is this is important. It's the very last slide here. So this has to do with this last slide, this last couple of slides.

575
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:01,870
Respect, diversity and stereotypes in the media. Use appropriate terminology.

576
01:10:02,200 --> 01:10:10,180
Use avoid weight based stereotypes, present persons affected by systems in a diverse manner.

577
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:16,690
And you can go to the red center and choose images of individuals that are appropriate.

578
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:24,669
Yes, it is what I mention in our weight bias class. We talked a bit about the fat activism community, kind of reclaiming the word fat.

579
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:30,249
So there are, you know, just asking the person you're working with like what maybe language they prefer.

580
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:37,629
And some people want to say fat as if you say someone is tall or short rather than the person with obesity.

581
01:10:37,630 --> 01:10:42,520
And then other people might, you know, prefer the person with obesity person first.

582
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:49,120
So just kind of wanted to mention that. So with I'm I'm in the baby boom generation and nobody wants to be called fat.

583
01:10:49,150 --> 01:10:52,840
Okay. Something to be sensitive to that. Maybe it's younger people who are into that.

584
01:10:52,840 --> 01:10:56,260
Maybe, but the majority of us not know. Okay.

585
01:10:56,530 --> 01:11:05,100
Just so you know. Don't place too much unnecessary emphasis on some of these body weight.

586
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:13,170
And if for more information, there was this really nice seminar that I was watching, this is a webinar for health care professionals.

587
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:16,290
And here's the YouTube site that you can go.

588
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:21,780
The strategies for reducing weight bias in health care and education steps toward change.

589
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:26,880
And for more details, you can look at that particular video.

590
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:32,030
Yes, just one more thing from Heartbeats.

591
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:36,750
And I don't know if you've covered that in your weight bikes class and taken it. So I apologize in advance.

592
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:44,670
But you will also receive weight bias from your patients, from your colleagues.

593
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:50,159
So the same strategies that you will use to advocate for your patients,

594
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:55,410
I would say use them for yourselves because dietitians are treated differently like

595
01:11:55,410 --> 01:12:01,080
it's you're you're perceived to thin the patient is what you know you're to say.

596
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:06,360
Or if you're perceived having extra weight, a patient can say, what do you know?

597
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:12,840
You can't follow your own advice because of what they think you doing talking to your weight.

598
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:18,510
I've heard that from at least one alumnus. Our alumni. Alumni about that very thing.

599
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:22,440
Yes. Yeah. So that is certainly information.

600
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:27,730
What do you know? You're a skinny little white girl. I've heard that we're not.

601
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:33,990
Professor. I do have a few clients who are over £300, so I choose to visit.

602
01:12:34,710 --> 01:12:44,640
The committee is part time working. So I also have to think about when I do go out to carry this large table that can handle all these,

603
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:50,610
because they're very aware and they tell me that things will work as we want on the ground.

604
01:12:51,390 --> 01:12:52,980
And they they volunteer.

605
01:12:52,980 --> 01:13:01,110
They tell me they assess in your case is not that is advanced like lesion implant which you have to improve your liver you'll be fine.

606
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:03,690
So they start to interfere with the healthy stuff.

607
01:13:03,930 --> 01:13:11,970
So they volunteer and they wanted to I don't really want to change, but does that hurt their feelings that are don't charge?

608
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:17,160
I don't think so. I think you're just being you're being accommodating, which is which is important.

609
01:13:17,370 --> 01:13:22,650
And they appreciate that you okay change anything else before we close for today.

610
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:35,670
Okay. I will see you on Monday next week. Okay.

611
01:13:46,350 --> 01:14:04,620
So again, I just came back on my science project.

612
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:10,060
Yes, it's still working, so.

613
01:14:11,220 --> 01:14:18,000
Yeah, I wish I had to see yours.

614
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:22,860
I don't think I like your.

615
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:37,610
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

616
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:58,800
I mean, I think there are some beautiful things, you know, science class.

617
01:15:02,250 --> 01:15:28,060
But what's your message? I don't do it at all for, you know, and especially after the speech, because it must be like this where I stand in line.

618
01:15:28,290 --> 01:15:35,910
Yes. And it's just the people can't control it.

619
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:40,610
Right. We're also for housing, so.

620
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:42,879
Yeah, yeah, it is a good thing.

621
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:58,820
And I think when you put those public very closely to negative feedback messages, that feels like, yeah, okay, you're hoping to figure.

622
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:07,280
Almost as if those things are probably a little silly with me right now.

623
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:15,680
Yeah, there's a lot. See how I know? And they keep saying that it's worse if you like what it looks like we don't like.

624
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:20,910
I don't know. They do. I don't know what doctors think. I'm going to be accommodating.

625
01:16:21,090 --> 01:16:24,990
I am not a single person. That's why I mean, that's why I want to be someone.

626
01:16:25,100 --> 01:16:31,830
I know you have to do that like this. Yeah, because it's like I've had my friends and there's like, little girls.

627
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:40,250
I just. I drink, like, oh, you know, watch diet and exercise, you know, like.

628
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:46,410
Yeah, I feel like I was told it wasn't like this.

629
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:53,310
Yeah. And she's like, whoa. Like, gone through the real, like, I think over there for, like, an hour.

630
01:16:53,640 --> 01:17:02,190
Like, I was like, everyone probably has the other program, like, for cancer or something.

631
01:17:02,970 --> 01:17:07,830
Oh, yeah. I don't know about like she does.

632
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:14,990
And I'm like, well, you know, that's what I guess not.

633
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:24,420
We look at how they have been doing this. I don't think they started prescribed to have that kind of media.

634
01:17:24,630 --> 01:17:31,670
I know that biweekly. So like I know we can see with Sarah.

635
01:17:32,070 --> 01:17:37,620
Yes. What's different about this lecture?

636
01:17:37,710 --> 01:17:41,850
Like how we feel she'll be more apt to wait.

637
01:17:42,390 --> 01:17:45,510
What do you think is going to happen? Oh, absolutely.

638
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:49,770
And I value like caring when a lot of everybody does except a lot of people in that.

639
01:17:49,770 --> 01:17:51,129
I don't know. Generation.

640
01:17:51,130 --> 01:18:04,180
But I want to say also that when I was working at it and I was like, oh, he's like, don't be like, no, no, no, it's talk about next week.

641
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:07,640
Cause I'm like, I'm over the river. The saltwater comes out. Yeah.

642
01:18:08,610 --> 01:18:13,570
They get paid for the hard part.

643
01:18:14,000 --> 01:18:20,020
No, no, no. I think you're exactly right.

644
01:18:20,040 --> 01:18:25,740
Yeah. So we're going to be like, I quite like this person.

645
01:18:25,750 --> 01:18:35,700
Wouldn't know the word you're speaking. Oh, okay.

646
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:39,959
Yes, I am. You're so tight there with the accent email.

647
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:43,080
Probably while you're all in science. Science.

648
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:46,190
And just say hi. Yeah, we're stressed.

649
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:25,260
But. That's.
