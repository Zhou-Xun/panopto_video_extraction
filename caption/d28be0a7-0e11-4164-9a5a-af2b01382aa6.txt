1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:12,930
Yeah. So I was like, All right, sorry, I have to get situated here.

2
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:17,220
Well, thanks for your patience, guys. All right.

3
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:25,040
Well, where we were taking the corporate maps and you were giving us a nice example of what they are and some caveats.

4
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:30,060
Do you want to continue with the comments are potentially going on?

5
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:39,180
Sure. But with the different spatial areas, like even if a large area has low density,

6
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,980
it can skew like visual perception because it still takes up more space.

7
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:53,280
Great. Yes, of course.

8
00:00:53,300 --> 00:01:05,350
Plus, maps are shading of areas based on the value of a variable, and the variable could be account rate, risk ratio and relative risk and so on.

9
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:13,200
Right. And there are several caveats. One of them is this issue of large area taking up more space, and they tend to be less populated, too.

10
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:18,570
And that gives us more kind of visual information that may not be as relevant.

11
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,180
And to deal with that, cartography maps can be used to address that type of a problem.

12
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,020
Interest of time will move forward because I think the caveats are listed in your slides.

13
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:39,050
Let's talk about class integral selection. This is an important part of creating any type of core python map, right?

14
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,940
There are several ways you can choose where to put your cutoffs, how to create your bins or your categories.

15
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,009
Right. And we talked about costless intervals, equal intervals,

16
00:01:50,010 --> 00:02:01,290
quantities and purpose of can people give an example what each one means and an example of each one of what would be a class less interval selection?

17
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,400
Yeah. Really do. Although there's, like, no groups, like.

18
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,230
Each value is its own separate class. Excellent.

19
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:18,349
Yeah. Each value with its own class. You don't group them in any way.

20
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,740
And there's usually you can create a colored gradient based on the value.

21
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:26,960
Sometimes that could be useful if you have, like, limited number of values.

22
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:36,840
Um, okay. What about equal interval selection? Yeah, but it's like value on your numbers.

23
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:40,499
Like they found the same distance from one another.

24
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:48,780
So you can measure like how long it takes a person to drive to a hospital based on like the minutes and each minute it's a phone interval.

25
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,510
Okay, I think you're getting close.

26
00:02:52,110 --> 00:03:01,190
Uh, I think the idea here is that you look at the range of values and you divide up their range into equal intervals.

27
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:06,360
Let's see, the range is from 1 to 50. So you want five groups.

28
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,230
So the equal intervals will be 1 to 10, 11 to 20, etc.

29
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:21,540
Right. So in contrast to Quintiles, which everybody knows groups, it creates groups based on the number of individuals or data points,

30
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,190
equal number of individual data points rather than the values.

31
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:29,190
Right. And so what's the benefit of equal interval?

32
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:36,930
Uh, what do you think are equal interval selection good for non normal data?

33
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:45,600
No. You don't want to use it for non normal David's. You wanna look at the distribution quintiles of better for non normal data.

34
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,500
Okay. And what's the purpose of class interval selection.

35
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:59,130
Yeah. Just like breaking it up where the data kind of naturally.

36
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:11,040
Okay. Yeah. You could create natural brakes and you can also create breaks based on some kind of a standard or a priority information or an objective.

37
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:21,510
One easy example is, let's say you wanted to see if the rates of lung cancer are meeting or not meeting quality people, 2020 objectives.

38
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,530
Right. So you can create a purpose of break that objective milestone and then meet,

39
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:36,270
not meet could be a purpose of break and it could be other purpose of breaks based on, um, you know, other kind of standards.

40
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:47,910
Excellent. Now, what is the modifiable aerial unit problem that's talked about scale effects and zone effects of the modifiable area unit for.

41
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:17,739
Any takers? That generally causes results to differ, even when the same analysis is applied to the same data gradient.

42
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:24,280
Why would the results differ if you apply the same analysis to the same data?

43
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,180
So it was one less racially aggravated case.

44
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:34,450
So I don't remember the scale one. Yeah. Is like the difference here.

45
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:40,300
Does it matter? You are using county versus census tract level of results.

46
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:45,970
Excellent. Yeah. So the scale of analysis will reveal different variation in the data.

47
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,040
Right.

48
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:57,610
So looking at county versus census tract, the county level scale may hide some variation that you might see at the census tract level and so forth.

49
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,200
And how does note about zone? What is that?

50
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:12,250
Yeah. We were talking about like where do you draw those, like boundaries across the area and things like what your results are.

51
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:17,110
So if you draw a bigger area versus like a small area, may include people in that area.

52
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:20,589
Same rates are different versus. Yeah.

53
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:25,660
So it's zone up. The scale is about the same, but the boundaries are different.

54
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:35,980
And depending on where you are, the boundaries that counts for each cell in your map for each region will be different depending on the boundary.

55
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,680
And a classic example is gerrymandering, right?

56
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:53,260
You can create different boundaries for districts to create different rates of ethnicity or or Republican versus Democratic members or so forth.

57
00:06:53,660 --> 00:07:00,040
Okay. So, uh, it's a, it's a problem in, in all maps that we look at.

58
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:07,240
Now, let's think about Ecological Falls fallacy. How does that relate to this idea of modifiable aerial unit problem?

59
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:17,229
Yeah, I guess everything is on. First of all, there might be differences within that,

60
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:24,340
something that you're not able to see because you use a scale that makes them invisible at that level of analysis.

61
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,090
Yes. That has to do with the scale. Exactly correct.

62
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:36,560
And it basically has the idea where different scales will reveal different results in terms of variation of a variable.

63
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:46,190
The ecological fallacy states that you can't generalize, in effect, that one scale to another scale.

64
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:55,489
Right. So if you see a relationship between variable A and B at, let's say, the county level, you mean that you can't generalize,

65
00:07:55,490 --> 00:08:02,390
that you will see that same relationship at the national level or the census tract level or any other scale in between.

66
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:11,320
So it's a yeah. So any relationship you examine, especially in aggregate,

67
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:18,590
a data should be limited to results and interpretation should be limited to that scale of analysis only.

68
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:28,969
Excellent. All right. Now, let's talk a little bit more to I asked you guys to explore the US Census website to see if you

69
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:34,820
can find information about race in the city of a specific county in the state of your choice.

70
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,490
I just want to see if people were able to do that. Okay.

71
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:54,780
All right. Anybody want to share what they learned? How they answer this question.

72
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:59,939
How was it to navigate the census website to find this information was a relatively easy?

73
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:10,500
Was it confusing? Change their websites and classify it as hard, a little thrown off by by first logged on.

74
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:23,110
Then they have the new. The Search feature and categorization feature as an interesting.

75
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,550
And. But did you define what you were looking at?

76
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,290
Simply a little longer than I was expecting,

77
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:42,240
because I've done a lot of search a couple of months ago and I kept saying, yeah, I think this is different.

78
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:48,300
Alexia Exactly. It does look different. It seems to change every, I don't know, a year or a few months.

79
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:55,170
So last time I looked at it and looked at them to sort of figure out what to do to prepare for today's class.

80
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,659
But in the end, I think just the the first few pages looked a little different then.

81
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,400
It's kind of a similar process.

82
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:09,629
But the information and it was the idea was for us to just try to get acquainted with the census website, know it's, you know,

83
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:15,900
you can figure out how to get the data yourself but we're going to do today is actually download data from the census.

84
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:20,430
We'll look at tabular data, will download it, clean it up,

85
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:25,919
and then we'll look at boundary data, download that and then merge those two things together.

86
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:34,860
So that's going to be the plan for today. So this was just for you to get used to looking at the census website and then see if you can navigate it.

87
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:43,200
Okay, so let's do that. Let's get started for today. So today we're going to work on Census Data Lab 17 to 20, doing what I just mentioned.

88
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,200
And then we'll practice those lab activities on a state of your choice or counties of your choice,

89
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:59,190
you'll do an exercise that's using the same concepts, but applying it to HIV AIDS data from the demographic and health surveys system.

90
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,950
And then we will do the student led discussions and you'll work on the salmon to hopefully

91
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:10,440
you get at least about 45 minutes or so to work on your assignment to today in class.

92
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:14,700
Okay, that's the plan. Let's get started with the census work.

93
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:23,610
So as I mentioned to you earlier in class, the census organizes the geography of the United States into multiple levels.

94
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,950
Right. And we're going to look at these levels today.

95
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:40,230
Right. The state county census tract and block groups and try to see how the census organizes its data based on these levels of geography.

96
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:47,639
And the way the census and other governmental organizations organize geographic entities

97
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,200
in the United States is by something called a geographic identifier called GEO ID,

98
00:11:53,220 --> 00:12:06,090
the acronym. Sometimes that's underscoring it, but usually it's labeled geo I.D. and the UAD is a numeric code that uniquely identifies

99
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:11,940
all administrative and legal geographic areas in the United States of America.

100
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:20,549
And the census uses those geo IDs when it creates tables for us to look at like you did last week,

101
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:26,220
to look at county and state and national level data on race, ethnicity and poverty firsthand.

102
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:34,590
Yeah, I was just wondering, are you still reporting? So, you know, thank you for reminding me that I think I am, but I just want to double check.

103
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:40,770
I am recording, so we're good. Okay. All right.

104
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:49,960
So, yeah, so they're unique codes. So every geographic area in the US will have a unique geo I be referencing.

105
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:55,470
Okay, so each position in the ID is also important.

106
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:05,340
It signifies a level of geography and every digit is important, including the first leading zero in the in that I.D.

107
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,140
So usually you shouldn't be deleting the leading zeros, but sometimes you do too.

108
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:13,860
So if you want to learn more about what the geographic identifiers are,

109
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:19,110
there's a nice web page at the census website that you can get more information on it.

110
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,190
So this is an example of a census geo ID, right?

111
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:30,510
Usually the first two digits will denote the state zero one.

112
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:41,550
In Michigan, it was 26. Right? The next three digits are the counties in those states and then the next six digits represent the census tracts.

113
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:50,750
And then you have the block groups of the last digit and sometimes you will see a truncated version of the general idea.

114
00:13:51,660 --> 00:14:00,020
Let's say you you're looking at just a single state. The census may just give you information on the county census tract in Blackfoot.

115
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:04,469
Okay. But usually it's organized like this. All right.

116
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:14,100
So let's take a look at some census data and figure out how to download it and then process it out and download it.

117
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:23,760
So what I'd like you guys to do is we don't actually need our HB 80, 66 lab folder, but if you have a downloaded and.

118
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:33,420
Yeah, because I'm not using any father in that folder, but I think today we can populate some of that folder if you like.

119
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:45,899
So what I'm asking you to do is create a folder called census in your guys data folder, but you don't have to create that in that folder.

120
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:53,490
You can just create it on the desktop for now. Okay. If that's easier for you, if you haven't downloaded the HB 80 626,

121
00:14:53,490 --> 00:15:08,550
let's just create a folder on your desktop called Census of LED in asking us to do that, and I'm going to open up my hard copies.

122
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,130
So, all right. So let's do that.

123
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:21,020
So I'm going to right click on a new folder.

124
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:26,510
Then you're going to put stuff in the census folder.

125
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:33,170
So it says, go to the census data page.

126
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:43,820
So open your browser and type in W what is it?

127
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,750
The data. The sense of the.

128
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:58,140
Go to CBS.

129
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,629
I think if you just had data,

130
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:13,070
censorship should get you to this page and so we should all be at this page and you can type in information in this search field.

131
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,780
But I find that sometimes that's counterproductive.

132
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:21,980
If they just go straight to advanced search, that you can click on Advanced Search.

133
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,230
And when you do advanced search, you can create filters based on what you need.

134
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:32,540
All right. So what we're going to do is look at poverty data for the state of Michigan.

135
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:43,640
So that's what we're hunting for right now. So under advanced search, you can go to topics in income and poverty, poverty,

136
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:55,160
and then you take the poverty facts right again, go to filters and select geography.

137
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,600
We want county level data, so we'll select county that.

138
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,739
You can look at many different geographies here and download data.

139
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:07,520
Those geographies we want to just Michigan.

140
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,910
If you wanted the whole country, you can get counties for the whole country.

141
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:18,020
But we're just going to look at Michigan and click on Michigan and we want all counties within Michigan.

142
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:26,150
After that, you want to select the year. So let's say I want boom.

143
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:35,149
I chose 2019 here because we were looking at the state cancer profiles data and the data from there are up to 2019.

144
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:40,729
So I want to be, you know, temporally aligned with my other data for my poverty data.

145
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:47,510
So if you're doing work like this, you should get census data at the same time frame for which you have other data.

146
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:57,200
And then you want to go to surveys because we are using 2019 data.

147
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:01,250
It's very far from the 2010 decennial census.

148
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:10,610
So we wanted to choose the American community surveys, five year estimates, and I think we want to subject tables ranked.

149
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,700
So what that means is it takes five years of data to produce those 2019 estimates.

150
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:27,520
So we'll go from 2014, 15, 16, 15 to 19 and then create a summary of those estimates.

151
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,470
All right. And then you push search.

152
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:45,640
Okay. So we will filter all the tables and maps based on your what you selected your variety of different options for poverty data.

153
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:49,270
We want poverty status in the past 12 months of families.

154
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,080
So we'll click on yes, 1702.

155
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,670
That's the table number and they will take you to the table itself.

156
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:07,900
Okay. So you notice here the tables are organized by by the variable.

157
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:17,770
And if you think. You can't see the rest of the table, but all the counties are on the columns here.

158
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:23,170
So we want counties to be rows. So what you do is you transpose this data.

159
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,490
You click the transpose button. Okay.

160
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:36,430
So now the data are organized by counties as rows, and the columns are all the variables of interest in the table.

161
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:42,790
And what we're going to do is we're going to download this data in a zip form so you can click on the zip

162
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:54,640
button here in a little menu dialog box of pop up just to make sure 2019 is selected and click download CSP.

163
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:03,729
Okay, so pretty quickly the see the zip file is downloaded and would you like to do is extract that

164
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:11,379
zip file into the census folder you created on the desktop or anywhere else in the computer.

165
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:20,400
You placed it so you can go show in Finder and we'll show you that where the file was downloaded too, which is a folder.

166
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:27,280
And right click on it and then go to seven zip and see extract files.

167
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:36,650
Okay. So in secret extract files, you can place the extracted files somewhere.

168
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:49,250
The file to be extracted. So by clicking the three dots and we want to put it on the desktop census folder, push back and then push it again.

169
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:56,870
And if I minimize and look at my sense, this folder, the unzip folder is there.

170
00:20:57,020 --> 00:21:03,350
Okay. And if you double click on that folder, you'll see three different files.

171
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:08,720
One is the metadata file, which tells you about the data is data about the data.

172
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:18,110
There's a data file and then there is this notes file, which is some high level information of what this data are about.

173
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:21,760
Okay. So let's look at the metadata. Okay.

174
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,890
So let's double click on that. It should open up in Excel.

175
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:44,219
Okay. So this file contains a list of the variables that are in the data for this.

176
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:50,129
And each pro here is a variable and the first one is the column name.

177
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:58,080
Gilardi is the variable you will use to merge data with the boundary file will download later.

178
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,800
You can also use name because I think that's going to be the county names.

179
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,930
And then these are all the different variables you're looking for something related to poverty.

180
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:15,000
So what you could do is to find so control F will get the find option up and type in

181
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:22,500
poverty in that you the first variable to find is the one that we are interested in.

182
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:35,760
When I just expand this it's it read. So here it says all families with income below the following poverty ratio which is 150.

183
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:45,340
Percent below poverty. You know, that's 50% below poverty.

184
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:49,740
So I made a mistake. We should be looking for 150.

185
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,020
This one is what we should be looking for. We make sure that.

186
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,479
Yeah. That's the one we need. Okay, so it's real.

187
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:12,890
1 p.m. so when we look at the data file, will search for this variable.

188
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:18,230
Okay, you can just copy that variable. And then when we open the data file, which is the next step.

189
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:34,390
So click on the data file. Open data and you can control F again and paste the variable name and we'll find.

190
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:41,140
Okay, so column f, w, that's where the variable is contained.

191
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:47,470
So there is the estimate and then work the variable next to it is the margin of error.

192
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,350
So. Okay.

193
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,410
So we'll keep both of those variables in our data set moving forward.

194
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:09,660
So now that we've found the variables that we see, we'll do the next activity.

195
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:18,209
But I think what I would like you guys to do before we do that is just search on the census website using the same procedure we did,

196
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:23,580
but download counties for another state. Download poverty data for counties for another state.

197
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:28,229
Okay. And after you do that, you can do number nine.

198
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:32,370
You can search for other topics that might be of interest to you and see if you

199
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:37,060
can identify those variables and remove that data from the census website.

200
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:42,060
So I spend about a good five 7 minutes doing that.

201
00:24:42,150 --> 00:28:26,230
Shouldn't take two. All right.

202
00:28:27,040 --> 00:29:31,340
Couple of more minutes and then we'll wrap. Okay.

203
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:41,660
Start saving whatever you are doing and then we'll switch over to the lab activity number 18 and give you another few seconds.

204
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:07,950
Okay. So lab activity 18 is about cleaning up this table so you can make it in portable into this probe.

205
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:17,550
It's a similar to what we did with the state cancer profile data. We're going to delete variables in rows that we don't need.

206
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:26,220
Right. So first step is to save this file, save as and you can put it.

207
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,480
Save, as you can put it in the census folder of current folders.

208
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:51,730
Fine. And call it forward to Michigan and save it as an x x x 43.

209
00:30:55,450 --> 00:31:02,520
All right. So first thing to notice is, is you remember the first rule should be your variable names.

210
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,960
But here we have a second rule, which are the labels for the variable names.

211
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:10,440
So we don't need that rule, so we should delete that rule.

212
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:18,870
Okay. So delete rule number two. Next, what we'll do is delete all the variables that we don't want.

213
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:24,870
So the first variable. So the first two columns,

214
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:33,690
C and column de are important because those are the actual counts of all the families in those counties that were in the census.

215
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:42,030
So we need those for the denominator. All the values in these cells are counts of the number of families who are not race.

216
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:56,060
And then we said that we we found the variable that we need, which is in column f, w, so we want to delete everything up to that.

217
00:31:56,070 --> 00:32:01,680
So let's delete columns E to f w in favor of V.

218
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:08,100
So just pull shift down after you select the column and scroll to the right.

219
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:15,900
And we should. The lead up to v.

220
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,730
Okay, so f w is the variable we found earlier.

221
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:27,780
So right click and delete. So no info c d here.

222
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,739
Now for all the variables we need for this analysis, then you can get rid of the rest.

223
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:42,030
So you can get rid of from g to the end of the all the data pros and cons and.

224
00:32:51,920 --> 00:33:21,710
So is this. Or was the second starting point for column V three and A.

225
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:34,850
Yeah. If you just use the right arrow and scroll, that's probably going to be the easiest birth.

226
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:43,630
Okay. Ayman, call him Ayman and Billy.

227
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:47,590
So you should end up with just six columns of data.

228
00:33:47,950 --> 00:33:52,910
A a. Yeah.

229
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:56,570
How did you select all those rows of columns?

230
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:02,360
Yeah. You see, you push one column once and selected your whole ship down.

231
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,950
Okay. And you can use your arrow key and go all the way to the right.

232
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:13,040
But I think you measure it like that.

233
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:21,740
I mean, it's not necessary to delete all those columns, but it's useful because you don't want to have a huge data set that you don't need.

234
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,320
So I'll let you guys catch up on that because I think our concern.

235
00:34:30,470 --> 00:34:38,240
And. If you contribute to the problem.

236
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,800
Oh, okay. You seem to be all right here.

237
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:46,960
You need to stay here.

238
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:14,610
You. Why did everybody just, like, clean up their variables?

239
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:23,390
Oh, yeah. Anybody not done anything as opposed to the end of the second.

240
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,250
Ready for the second one for the second year old.

241
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,329
The second year for the fields that we didn't want.

242
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:44,700
It started it the G and then it ended with that and after now all the way to the end of the year we have.

243
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Yeah. So if you just select it then you could.

244
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:55,790
Yeah. It seems like the reason is simple.

245
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:04,240
Everybody. Does anybody need more time? Raise your hand if you do.

246
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:07,890
Don't be shy. I can't raise my hand. Okay, sure.

247
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:12,580
Three points. Based on one.

248
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:18,320
I like my values. Four, and they're all known. And I'll break it down.

249
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:26,570
Well, you might have. What's your table called? Does it have the same children, too?

250
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:33,800
Is it called? Does it have the same name as this one?

251
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:38,840
I'm not sure what to do with that answer. No. You must have deleted the wrong call.

252
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:45,060
I must have. So if you have the original data file, you can open it again and save as it.

253
00:36:45,890 --> 00:37:00,280
And right over the file that you were working on. I mean, if you also want, you can believe in piecemeal.

254
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:06,940
I didn't have to do it all at once. So. If.

255
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,829
Okay. So we'll get a chance to practice.

256
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:24,070
So I'm going to move on to the next.

257
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:29,980
Yeah. So geo I.D. is the geographic identifier we're going to use to join with.

258
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,970
And then those geo IDs, the linking variable, the merging variable needs to be a text.

259
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,900
Okay. So we're going to do is change A and B,

260
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:51,400
make sure they're in the format text or highlight columns and B and go to the format dropdown menu and change it to text.

261
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:59,980
Okay? And column C, D, E and F are numeric, so they should be changed to number.

262
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,240
Okay. After we do that.

263
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:16,150
Well, I did six and seven. Now let's rename the fields this to step five because these fields are kind of hard to understand.

264
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:22,450
So we're going to call columns C, that variable all families.

265
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:33,780
The variable in call and D will call all family's underscore and B for margin of error.

266
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:38,639
Then group E is poverty, right?

267
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,230
So we'll see P.O.V.

268
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:58,680
Or you can see poverty and every like family and then row F that variable will call it for underscore family fam underscore and make for margin.

269
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:09,389
Okay. So your table should look like this. Once you're done and then you can just say so.

270
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:14,190
Now it should be in a form that's usable by our pro.

271
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,540
And you've gotten rid of any extraneous data that you don't want at the moment.

272
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:24,600
You can always keep that data, which is no harm. It just takes up space on your computer.

273
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,419
And sometimes it's nice to keep extra data because you may want to look at other variables, right?

274
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:36,960
So it's totally fine to keep other variables. So if you don't want to delete all those columns, feel free not to.

275
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,980
If you know, the null values may cause a problem. So.

276
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:51,880
Yeah. It's a next. Let's go and get the the boundary data that we need.

277
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:59,860
Okay. So you've got the tabular data for counties. Let's get the boundary because the way you do that is a good Google search.

278
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:08,680
And you go to the the census cartographic boundaries website so you can type in w the what is it?

279
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:14,120
Yeah. Census. Dot gov.

280
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,830
Forward slash geographies.

281
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:26,780
H. T. O. Oops.

282
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:43,860
Something's wrong. Okay.

283
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:48,010
So you should land on this page. All right.

284
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:53,669
So it talks about all the different geographies and different files and tools that are present.

285
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:55,800
What we want are mapping files. Okay.

286
00:40:55,830 --> 00:41:05,190
So you go to mapping files on the left and you want we want 2019 mapping files because we want to download of 2019 data.

287
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:12,420
So you can click on 1219. Underneath there, there are going to be a variety of different files.

288
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:15,750
We want the cartographic boundary files.

289
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:27,629
The reason we want those is other boundary files may include areas that are not what we are used to seeing as boundaries of states.

290
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:34,080
For example, the state of Michigan. The boundary doesn't end at the shore of Lake Michigan.

291
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:39,930
It actually ends in the middle of Lake Michigan. And half of Lake Michigan belongs to Illinois.

292
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:46,230
The other half belongs to Michigan. Okay, so that kind of boundary is not useful for our work.

293
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:52,020
So we want boundaries that kind of end that the waterlines and the beaches and the shores and so forth.

294
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:56,450
Okay, so that's why we have these cartographic boundary blocks.

295
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:04,740
So if you click on those, you'll have options for dates, I guess for 2019, go down.

296
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:16,049
There are many different options. You can download Native American Land Census block groups, tracks, congressional districts, cities, counties.

297
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:22,860
This is what we want to notice. Okay, so you click on the second option.

298
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:35,220
It's 2.7 megabytes, click on chip bar and it should download a zip file for that shipper that contains a shape file and other information.

299
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,240
So again, open it into folder, show in folder.

300
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:50,850
You will see it shown in your download folder. Right click on it and extract, file and lift.

301
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:54,710
Extract that also to our census folder on the desktop.

302
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:10,160
You go back to your census folder. You should be able to see the folder that we just extracted there.

303
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:14,599
If you open that folder, there'll be multiple files in these.

304
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:22,520
This folder, there are many different shape files. And the one we're most interested in is the shape shape of the HP.

305
00:43:28,330 --> 00:43:35,470
Extension. All right. And step five, what we're going to do is we're going to now get started with merging things together.

306
00:43:36,190 --> 00:44:30,670
So let's open up our pro. And what we're going to do is we're going to create a new project for this work.

307
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:37,140
Okay. So what are the middle column options and create a new map.

308
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:42,030
Let's call that new map. Michigan poverty and my problem.

309
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:54,380
And we can save it. You can put it in your project's folder and the HP 1866 lab if you've downloaded that,

310
00:44:54,390 --> 00:45:00,750
or you can just put it in your census folder and under desktop if you have a.

311
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:46,540
Minister. Allow me to say that. Okay.

312
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:52,740
Yeah. So. Right.

313
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,010
So new map will show up.

314
00:45:56,010 --> 00:46:00,330
And then let's move on to where we're still on number four.

315
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:04,860
Okay. Now activity 90, number five.

316
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:17,990
They like to turn off these bass players. The next step is to locate your shapefile that you downloaded and drag it into the contents pane.

317
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:28,310
So to do that, you can go to folders, right? And make a folder connection, add folder connection to the census folder.

318
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:51,510
That's. And in the census folder you can go to the shape file folder and find the file with the extension HP, pick it up and drag it over.

319
00:46:53,720 --> 00:47:01,200
All right. So you should see. The Continental in Alaska, except for parts of the United States.

320
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:08,010
Yeah, sure. Which part? That the older connection?

321
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:13,200
Yes. So you right click on the folder in the catalog.

322
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:21,490
Hey, you can go to add folder connection and then you can choose the folder you want to add.

323
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:26,909
So I went to this P.S. Desktop and then Sensis.

324
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:31,050
And then push back. And then it created a connection to my expenses folder.

325
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:36,460
Okay. All right.

326
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:43,080
So now what we want to do is you don't want all these counties, so we want to just get the Michigan thing, okay?

327
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:48,480
So we're going to do start doing lab activity 20.

328
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,440
So from the previous lab, we're still working with this file.

329
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:56,340
We're going to create a new layer of Michigan counties only.

330
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:02,010
So you've done this before, so create a new layer of just the Michigan.

331
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,640
So the way you do that is going to be method and you will select by attribute, okay?

332
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:16,170
And you should input rows should be the shapefile, you just drag them in.

333
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:21,390
The new selection is correct. The field that we want is the state of P.

334
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:29,160
And the code is 26. Remember the fifth code for the state?

335
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:36,390
26. So you go to select by attribute input.

336
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:48,750
Roe should be the county border boundaries that we downloaded and input into our iPad pro where it should say state of P is equal to 26.

337
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,370
And if you push okay,

338
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:59,460
you'll notice that only the Michigan counties are highlighted and then we want to create a new layer of just the Michigan County.

339
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:09,390
So right click on the the layer we're working with and go to selection and say make layer from selected features.

340
00:49:11,070 --> 00:49:17,210
All right, so if I turn off the bottom there, I will only see the Michigan counties.

341
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:26,340
Okay. So now this is a temporary layers.

342
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:34,490
If you wanted to keep it and use it later, it will be in the project, I think, but it won't be in a geo database for use for other activities.

343
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:45,710
So if you want to make it a permanent layer, you have to export it so you can right click on the new selected add new layer that you just created.

344
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:51,820
Okay. And then you yeah.

345
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,010
You export the features, right? You export the features.

346
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:59,180
So go to data and export features.

347
00:50:02,630 --> 00:50:06,620
So the input features are the further new selection layer.

348
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:15,740
The output location is the geo database for the project that was created when you created the project folder and the output names,

349
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:21,280
as we can call it, Michigan Counties and counties.

350
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:26,180
2002. Okay. Okay.

351
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:35,270
It will move those that layer into the geo database and create a new layer on top.

352
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,940
So we want to work with the top layer.

353
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:54,260
And if you go to the Michigan poverty folder and look at the GEO database, there should be a new Michigan Counties feature class in that GEO database.

354
00:50:55,340 --> 00:50:58,550
Okay. Yes. Following. All right.

355
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:03,830
So we got the county boundaries. We got the table somewhere.

356
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:10,460
Now we had to put them together a region. So this is almost the final step here because we're on step number three.

357
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:20,360
You're going to join the Michigan Counties 2019 layer with the tabular attribute data in Michigan poverty Excel file.

358
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:25,880
Okay. So to do this, we need to use a tool called Join Fields.

359
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:33,620
So go to command search type and join Fields field.

360
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:41,360
Sorry, not fields. And the geo processing pane will open up for that specific tool.

361
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:46,370
The input table is the layer that we are working with.

362
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:57,800
Michigan Counties thousand 19. The joint field, as I mentioned earlier, actually, I didn't mention this.

363
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:06,260
It's the a f, f, g or I d if you if you right click on the layer and look at the attribute table.

364
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:13,660
You'll notice that the Gene Wilder is truncated here.

365
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:20,860
It doesn't have the leading information. And then the cell phone with the g.o.a.t.

366
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:24,630
Looks like this, right? So you want to find the right variable?

367
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:32,140
It may not be called the same thing, but the data here are aligning with these data here.

368
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:37,050
Okay. So the joint feel is f g.o.a.t.

369
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:43,660
And the joint table, you don't see it in the drop and you got to go find it.

370
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:53,530
So that are the brows and go to where you put that Michigan Poverty Excel file, which was in my case, it was in my census folder.

371
00:52:53,910 --> 00:53:07,570
Right. Uh, who was in the, the, the downloaded folder for the tabular data from poverty Michigan x x,

372
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:14,670
we double click that and then we'll look into that Excel file and tell you what are

373
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:19,810
the different sheets that are in there searching the Excel but is only one sheet.

374
00:53:23,110 --> 00:53:26,830
It should be called what it says done here at the bottom left corner.

375
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:39,720
All right, typical. Well, but click on that sheet or that phone and push.

376
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:47,090
Okay. In the joint table, field is called G.o.a.t Field underscore Heidi.

377
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:53,910
Right. You want to use transfer all the field so you don't want to change anything under transfer fields.

378
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:58,020
You can click, validate, join to see if everything's working okay.

379
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:07,910
And if you go down to this list, it said inputted 83 into a joint table of 83 seconds.

380
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,880
So that's correct.

381
00:54:09,690 --> 00:54:23,070
The push run and what you'll notice once the the video processing as run, if you go to that table on the right hand side of that table,

382
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:29,940
you'll have the information from the tabular data, the Geoweb, the name of families, etc.

383
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:35,940
Right. So this is how we merged poverty data from the census.

384
00:54:36,510 --> 00:54:39,750
The county data found gains from the census.

385
00:54:40,330 --> 00:54:51,410
Right. So now your GEO database, you have a permanent file there in the GIO database with this information.

386
00:54:51,430 --> 00:55:00,970
So what I'd like you guys to do next is practice. So spend the next 10 to 15 minutes and practice doing this for.

387
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:09,150
Lambert that you already did. Seven I loved that. 317 practice, right?

388
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,670
You download it poverty data for another state.

389
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:23,040
Now do the same activity in terms of joining enjoying the poverty data you downloaded to the counties for the state of your interest.

390
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:34,340
All right. So you have most of the stuff you need. Except you may not have this poverty data yet for your state, so you need to get that processed.

391
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:39,219
You have the shape files already for the whole country.

392
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:44,220
We download it using to select out the counties for your state.

393
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:57,900
Right. So do that for the next 15, ten, 15 minutes will stop at about four or five and then we will move on to an exercise.

394
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:08,670
Yeah. Yeah.

395
00:56:17,400 --> 01:00:36,080
And if you need help, just raise your hand. Help them by not. So I'm here at a retail town with a different from the as go through some of stuff.

396
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:47,810
That's. And I'm that know this in the sense.

397
01:00:50,340 --> 01:01:07,550
You create a connection with. Change.

398
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,960
So go back out there. Yeah, that's good.

399
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:23,300
And then. Here is the.

400
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:38,940
I think you can turn off. Uh oh.

401
01:01:40,650 --> 01:01:44,160
Yeah, I didn't.

402
01:01:52,620 --> 01:02:14,040
So. Good for you not to lose this left if you really had a chance to do in the Grand Slam.

403
01:02:17,890 --> 01:03:01,920
Oh, yes. Mr.

404
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:29,030
Like, I don't want to see that kind of thing.

405
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:56,770
To be a better. Every time it comes time to relax.

406
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:17,240
That's everything I want you to see.

407
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:29,960
Yeah, I know.

408
01:04:30,250 --> 01:04:33,490
Can create shorthand especially.

409
01:04:35,030 --> 01:04:40,760
Yeah. Thought of it. So I think that's just the way.

410
01:04:46,630 --> 01:04:57,900
Very intimidating and doesn't even think.

411
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:07,290
Yes. When it comes to the various forms, they need to be here.

412
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:24,520
I see the first question. You want a copy of this law with every kind of American and I think most.

413
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:37,210
Yeah. So there is a problem with the that you're so good.

414
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:44,810
N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A., N.A.

415
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:50,190
Right. So I guess you are if you can do it.

416
01:05:50,470 --> 01:05:58,030
Yes. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

417
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:13,570
Yes. Yeah.

418
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:19,780
This looks pretty good.

419
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:25,190
I know. It's a business away from you. Oh, just the business.

420
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:32,350
I mean, it was terrible.

421
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:40,640
I don't even know it. Oh, right, right, right, right.

422
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:46,200
I don't know. I don't think.

423
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:53,530
I don't recall how we used to evacuate.

424
01:06:54,040 --> 01:07:00,900
Oh, yeah. I really think you need to see what it is that everybody.

425
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:05,709
But it does not do anything.

426
01:07:05,710 --> 01:07:29,470
When it does, it does well, because what I know, it's just like places it feels to the you know how you know now I know I can go near the concert.

427
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:33,100
I right click to leave everything that is coming.

428
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:37,160
After that I have 1,000,030 3000 yeah.

429
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:44,330
You know what I was wondering about that? We're just not interested in that.

430
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,280
It was visibly shaken, you know, like, oh, no.

431
01:07:49,360 --> 01:08:02,410
But eventually, after, I should like just having them from an armored vehicle safe and I know, like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

432
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:08,090
That says, yeah, I know.

433
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:12,430
This is don't look, you know.

434
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:18,160
Yeah well we keep destructions like that.

435
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:23,470
Yeah. Yeah, it's absolutely.

436
01:08:28,540 --> 01:08:39,910
No, I don't. I just. We should have an idea to.

437
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:57,540
Words that I didn't expect to be right here to this point in time.

438
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:06,320
Yeah. I mean, they've got. She?

439
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:25,160
Yeah. Listen to this.

440
01:09:36,130 --> 01:09:41,870
No. Yea. Yea, yea.

441
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:09,460
Yeah. Yeah.

442
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:18,280
Oh. Did you do it with another company? Yeah.

443
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:33,740
Yeah. Yeah. No, just so I could see it.

444
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,430
The second one was very similar.

445
01:11:07,450 --> 01:11:18,100
Emergency rooms are very acute and you're not going to have a pretty well left, you know.

446
01:11:18,220 --> 01:11:23,710
You know, are you to on your thing and you know, I'm still on the street.

447
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:30,230
Oh, yeah. I you know, we had to do we had the zero for signs that we did.

448
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:38,019
We had a different number. So you didn't until like nine.

449
01:11:38,020 --> 01:11:46,299
But I don't know. Yeah. So seeing her is a wonderful, a nice day in my life.

450
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:54,879
I think my folks wanted to join in on that because I don't think that's happening to her.

451
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:58,480
And I'm like, What is in it? For me? It's only friends.

452
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:06,260
Maybe she had one friend. It's just when I was doing it and I started to.

453
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:15,610
I'd like you to find this number.

454
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:23,990
Let me try again. Yeah. So you go to this place and everybody goes his birthday cake so you can.

455
01:12:26,740 --> 01:12:36,720
Yeah. I feel like I just turned out okay when I realized that this information and from our early methods for the war.

456
01:12:37,150 --> 01:12:44,380
But I didn't know what I wanted to focus to be more time.

457
01:12:44,620 --> 01:12:47,410
Yes. Yes. So keep working on it. Okay.

458
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:58,360
If you're having trouble working with the Excel file, like getting it to show up on our kids pro save it as a CSB file.

459
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,880
This one student had that problem, which they didn't want to do.

460
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:13,070
So I did everything which I think is very close.

461
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:19,700
We can do that with the first one. So I really think that's a very good thing.

462
01:13:20,170 --> 01:13:23,710
You should do the educational. Yeah. I like.

463
01:13:23,740 --> 01:13:33,130
It's more. You okay? You're wearing something that you don't want to understand.

464
01:13:35,110 --> 01:13:38,760
I'm trying to figure out who would fill it with straight.

465
01:13:42,100 --> 01:13:49,680
Thank you for being with us and full back to you.

466
01:13:51,220 --> 01:13:54,940
I'm ready to take it.

467
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:08,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, I don't I'm not trying to make progress in the table.

468
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:12,650
I'm really on the side of him. Yeah.

469
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:18,600
You can always come back and say, Oh, I know why.

470
01:14:18,670 --> 01:14:21,730
I just did what I needed to try and I won't be.

471
01:14:22,540 --> 01:14:38,990
Yes. Placing fresh media prices in the latest innovation.

472
01:14:40,820 --> 01:14:49,290
Yeah, I thought it may have been going on here for three or four years, so yeah,

473
01:14:49,310 --> 01:14:59,240
you can expect to see it usually here, but I suppose I know I just need to keep these 15 minutes close.

474
01:14:59,300 --> 01:15:03,120
So I keep my three year old.

475
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:14,830
Yeah. For half an hour. Or would it close? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

476
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:20,380
I had to go through that.

477
01:15:21,220 --> 01:15:24,960
Yeah. So then do other things like this. Yeah, right.

478
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:38,200
Yeah. You're done. Okay, so folks who are done with this practice piece, you can move on to this exercise I'm going to talk about.

479
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:45,220
And you can work on either one. Okay. Whatever you feel like doing, if you can't do the exercise in class, you can do it at home.

480
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:51,250
But for this exercise, you're going to use the same basic procedures, but with the totally different data.

481
01:15:52,240 --> 01:16:00,040
Okay. The idea here is if you're working for a team that's writing a proposal to deliver preventive services for HIV,

482
01:16:00,670 --> 01:16:04,480
AIDS and treatment services and young men and women in southern Africa.

483
01:16:05,680 --> 01:16:16,120
Okay. You want to show provinces of greatest need using maps about HIV, AIDS, and one or more risk factors for HIV AIDS.

484
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:24,190
So creating maps about HIV AIDS and one more risk factors for Zambia and Mozambique.

485
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:32,920
So go to the DHS and Pep FA spatial data repository, which you can find by going to this link.

486
01:16:33,460 --> 01:16:38,840
I will see if I can open it. Okay.

487
01:16:39,170 --> 01:16:46,310
We will go to this page, which is the spatial data repository for the DHS program funded by USAID,

488
01:16:46,880 --> 01:16:50,450
and go to the indicators data link, which is this one.

489
01:16:51,200 --> 01:17:00,229
You can find these data from several places, but this is one way to go and you can go figure it out on your own.

490
01:17:00,230 --> 01:17:10,160
It's pretty self-explanatory. But navigate this and download data for the most recent years for both countries.

491
01:17:10,160 --> 01:17:20,040
Read the documentation, examine the data files, look at the data dictionary, the metadata, and find out what is included.

492
01:17:20,060 --> 01:17:25,280
The word what is missing. Identify variables you want to map right?

493
01:17:25,550 --> 01:17:28,760
And after making your map, explore the website for other information.

494
01:17:29,390 --> 01:17:38,330
So here what this website contains is is boundary files for the countries and their provinces or their states.

495
01:17:39,290 --> 01:17:51,979
It also contains demographic health survey data for the provinces and the country as a whole for important public health indicators.

496
01:17:51,980 --> 01:17:58,220
And some of them are HIV related. Okay, so you can go to many countries or a single country.

497
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:05,840
For example, if I click a single country, I can go here and look at Zambia.

498
01:18:06,800 --> 01:18:14,090
Okay? And these are the years that the Zambia data are available right click 2018 and push continue.

499
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:18,050
It will show you what indicators are available in that data set.

500
01:18:20,030 --> 01:18:24,170
Okay. And the ones reentry we're interested in are HIV related.

501
01:18:25,020 --> 01:18:30,890
It's a really the HIV testing HIV prevalence by men and women.

502
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:41,930
There's female education, literacy, etc. That type of information you push next, you can get national data or subnational data.

503
01:18:42,530 --> 01:18:49,220
You can get a shape files or geo databases and you can download it and then view it and examine it.

504
01:18:49,370 --> 01:18:58,280
Okay, so you should know everything you need to know to work with this data and try to visualize HIV related information from this website.

505
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:07,720
So I think we are running out of time. And I want to give you time to work on your final projects.

506
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:12,579
So how about you work on the exercise for the next 5 minutes?

507
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:18,220
Just explore, maybe get the down data downloaded that you need and you can finish the exercise at home.

508
01:19:19,090 --> 01:19:30,700
So in 5 minutes we will then do Oh, I guess we need a break and we'll take a take a short break and then do the student led discussions.

509
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:35,290
And then the remainder of the time we spend an experiment to look to just spend 5 minutes

510
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:41,110
wrapping up whatever you're doing now or downloading the data you need for this exercise.

511
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:49,640
And then we'll take a break. Yeah.

512
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:57,400
What? I wanted to make sure I couldn't do it for him.

513
01:19:57,900 --> 01:20:03,070
Some people felt like a problem.

514
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:10,900
Yeah, I kind of feel like it's.

515
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:16,120
Sounds that you can separate my own life.

516
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:21,140
I think that I didn't have to go. That other would say this is what this morning.

517
01:20:23,630 --> 01:20:29,020
Well, there you go.

518
01:20:29,710 --> 01:20:38,980
Be to ideal. So sometimes city and state officials claim that this is nothing.

519
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:47,170
This is very sad that I have got to do that.

520
01:20:49,530 --> 01:21:08,540
So every time I see what's going on in your own life, sometimes you get there and so on and so forth.

521
01:21:08,560 --> 01:21:14,620
I think, you know, all these things are.

522
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:23,390
Yeah, I think so, yes.

523
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:27,130
And I think you that it's just as prepared.

524
01:21:44,330 --> 01:21:50,420
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.

525
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:55,790
The download on this website.

526
01:21:55,810 --> 01:22:00,470
Yeah. Okay. I tried to download the and I got.

527
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:07,740
All right. So did you do what I'm doing here or did you try a different procedure?

528
01:22:08,790 --> 01:22:16,480
I did. You did? I did try to not download all that [INAUDIBLE].

529
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:28,290
Like Linda said before. But then I went to that and I was like, I don't think I want to go.

530
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:34,280
It also is in the census, what we did in the exact same year.

531
01:22:34,470 --> 01:22:38,710
You know, that's interesting. Okay, so let's try this method.

532
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:49,990
I'm going to do single country Zambia 2018 continue.

533
01:22:51,060 --> 01:22:59,820
Want to select them all because they're not that many variables. Subnational, geo database.

534
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:16,940
Then. Oh.

535
01:23:17,790 --> 01:23:24,300
Is this what he was doing? Yes. But then I also typed up like a error message.

536
01:23:24,900 --> 01:23:27,910
I had a bunch of numbers and nowhere near.

537
01:23:36,730 --> 01:23:42,890
Okay. There is some national.

538
01:23:47,870 --> 01:23:52,310
They did do this just yesterday and then it didn't work for me.

539
01:23:54,920 --> 01:24:03,420
It seemed like this whole. Try again.

540
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:08,360
Single country. Let's pick a different year.

541
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:48,220
2013. Yeah.

542
01:24:48,270 --> 01:24:51,320
Something is not working. Yeah, but you know what?

543
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:56,300
You business. I did get a download here shown folder.

544
01:24:59,770 --> 01:25:03,309
Oh. So it did work? I don't know.

545
01:25:03,310 --> 01:25:11,410
Like, still so it didn't work as a shapefile to try shapefile and not.

546
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:24,940
Yeah. So these are ship was not your database. The other one I think when I did it myself I used multiple many countries and they cleared all.

547
01:25:26,410 --> 01:25:32,040
I went to Zambia and Mozambique.

548
01:25:35,220 --> 01:25:41,460
Double check. Yeah. Didn't. And continue.

549
01:25:42,080 --> 01:25:45,890
Continue. You have to go back there because.

550
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:55,250
Yes. It didn't work for multiple countries. So in Finder.

551
01:25:57,770 --> 01:26:03,350
Fuller and. Yeah.

552
01:26:03,440 --> 01:26:11,630
If I go to screw you, you're running out of time.

553
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:22,990
It worked and I download it as a shapefile so maybe that your database is a problem on their website.

554
01:26:35,450 --> 01:26:39,380
All right. You know, I think we should take a break now because we're running out of time.

555
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:43,970
And I'm losing my brain. So let's take a five minute break.

556
01:26:43,970 --> 01:26:49,190
I'm sorry about that, because I'd like to give you guys time to work on your second project assignment.

557
01:26:49,610 --> 01:26:57,020
So five minute break and then we'll do the smaller discussions. Okay? So be back by 424.

558
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:32,400
I have one more question. So for assignment one under the first part, I think what he says is, look, we use this to help us answer that.

559
01:27:32,540 --> 01:27:37,730
This is part or no. That's a good way to think about what they're trying to do.

560
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,460
I just want to know if I could include that writing. Think you.

561
01:28:04,420 --> 01:28:10,510
And what makes this drive. So I guess if you combine those files, they just they look different inside of a folder.

562
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:20,920
I think it makes sense. So I can I can sit here sometimes.

563
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:35,020
The is that I'm trying to extract.

564
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:44,430
As I'm trying to describe, I'm trying to strike this stuff out into.

565
01:28:48,770 --> 01:28:56,720
Okay. So for the second assignment, are we being graded on how closely it looks like the map that's in the paper?

566
01:28:56,960 --> 01:29:02,090
No, I know you're graded on the quality of your own map.

567
01:29:02,270 --> 01:29:05,400
Right. Because you can't. Many people can make the exact.

568
01:29:05,420 --> 01:29:12,360
Yeah. So, you know, I think we talked about the different elements that are necessary.

569
01:29:12,950 --> 01:29:19,130
I don't know, you know, if it looks visually appealing, is it conveying information clearly?

570
01:29:19,850 --> 01:29:23,300
Do you have like the categories you might be using?

571
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:32,420
Do they make sense? Okay. Okay. So if there are like a few extra, like I have a few extra census tracts that I can't make you believe.

572
01:29:32,660 --> 01:29:37,440
It's not in the actual map. Okay. It's hard to get rid of those.

573
01:29:37,460 --> 01:29:40,820
Okay, that's fine. I mean, ideally, you remove them.

574
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:52,220
Yeah. So what you could do if you only want to spend time, depending on where the census tracks are, you can manually select stuff, right?

575
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:57,050
Oh, okay. It's showing up over areas where there's water.

576
01:29:57,260 --> 01:30:00,770
It's like as a as a census tract shape.

577
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:05,420
Oh, so you don't see this, like, gaps where water should be.

578
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:10,010
And maybe I could just look for a different census, like file that.

579
01:30:10,880 --> 01:30:17,810
Hmm. Let's see. Is it. Is it a set of people like this is.

580
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,950
So that's kind of the third person you select here.

581
01:30:22,970 --> 01:30:27,110
And you can draw a flow shift and you can draw that line or.

582
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:37,800
Oh, okay. You can select parts of the home that I think would be selected for there.

583
01:30:37,820 --> 01:30:46,040
You will push control down. Okay. You can be select and then you can create a new layer based on a selection.

584
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:49,820
Cool. Okay. I'll try that. Like cool things right now.

585
01:30:52,030 --> 01:31:04,390
So we feel like we're there and we need to make sure that they have the feeling on a grand scale.

586
01:31:04,750 --> 01:31:08,940
And when people are taking with you that you're showing the black.

587
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:24,480
Maybe the doctor's like, you should know all these reasons.

588
01:31:24,570 --> 01:31:29,460
I think you can benefit from the assignment.

589
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:41,500
If it's worth knowing, you can ask others. So I got a COVID testing raise money rotation, so they count on Article two surveillance dashboard.

590
01:31:41,940 --> 01:31:46,140
So it's accumulated to the way I thought they wanted to.

591
01:31:46,740 --> 01:31:51,340
But I think the census is great.

592
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:59,250
Only tell you I have to make fun of that.

593
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:12,030
I feel like I just use that. I think you can give the census for 2021 versus 2022, right?

594
01:32:12,180 --> 01:32:22,520
So yeah, they should be fine because the 2010 census, 20 census, I mean, they must have had census tracts if necessary.

595
01:32:23,160 --> 01:32:26,190
So, so there should be no change on census tract.

596
01:32:27,210 --> 01:32:33,080
And between those wonderful swing years that you're talking about and I think everything should come right.

597
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:41,219
Oh, like, oh, so we need to get enough like up to date or should use them for the period of time period.

598
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:47,530
The paper, you know, it's going to be too boring for me to do for the time period the paper.

599
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:58,380
Okay, because you can't get to the historically and go back and just do what you can get right and make sure your boundary,

600
01:32:58,720 --> 01:33:04,090
the timeline of any problems in one year is really is skills.

601
01:33:04,290 --> 01:33:10,020
These are folks who don't it because like this one's a lot easier.

602
01:33:10,110 --> 01:33:20,920
Yeah so. I mean, he just killed the only people you can put into threatening kill.

603
01:33:22,190 --> 01:33:30,210
You know, his primary goal is to.

604
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:40,490
Which the general. Depending on the.

605
01:33:47,190 --> 01:33:50,430
To do that. He was like one character.

606
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:56,230
Yeah. She was in a pretty good dress.

607
01:33:56,980 --> 01:34:03,100
I was looking for you know, I was looking for something from this school gives me.

608
01:34:06,300 --> 01:34:13,420
Oh. Okay. I got. Understand.

609
01:34:16,340 --> 01:34:21,560
I. Yeah. This is what's going on here.

610
01:34:22,050 --> 01:34:32,120
We should reduce the holdings. It's not really.

611
01:34:45,840 --> 01:34:51,590
Because, of course, he's going to be fun.

612
01:34:54,420 --> 01:35:12,590
Seriously, it's cold in here. You know, it's a good thing, you know, I'm in the same place I'm usually.

613
01:35:16,840 --> 01:35:23,440
All right. Let's get started with the student presentations. Let's see.

614
01:35:23,980 --> 01:35:27,030
I think first is the one an maybe.

615
01:35:27,490 --> 01:35:31,690
That's good. And we really double checked the list. No, Alexis is four.

616
01:35:31,690 --> 01:35:40,090
Sorry. So, Alexis, come when you are ready and get your slides.

617
01:35:50,090 --> 01:36:01,310
You. There you go.

618
01:36:07,550 --> 01:36:19,790
Okay. Hi, everyone. The article that we read for today is titled Food Systems Planning and Quantifying Access Using GIS to Plan for Food Retail.

619
01:36:20,630 --> 01:36:23,720
Obviously, this article came out a while ago,

620
01:36:23,720 --> 01:36:31,580
so I'd imagine there's been some developments in the past decade of how to more accurately measure some of the things that came up in this article.

621
01:36:35,150 --> 01:36:41,650
Yeah. And though it was published on Applied Geography, it is using an urban planning sort of framework throughout.

622
01:36:44,510 --> 01:36:52,220
So just to go over what I'll be discussing, obviously I'll be talking about the premise of the article, then the methods and data use,

623
01:36:52,640 --> 01:37:00,350
then the results of the article and the results of the study, and then ending on the strengths and limitations of the article.

624
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:07,310
But before we get started, a big concept that's talked about in the article is food deserts.

625
01:37:07,790 --> 01:37:10,930
How many folks have heard that call?

626
01:37:12,290 --> 01:37:16,970
And if so, what would you say is like a core characteristic of food deserts?

627
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:22,640
Based off your novel Like Black Ghost. That's a good thing.

628
01:37:22,900 --> 01:37:27,610
Yeah. Definitely. Lack of accessibility of a healthy and nutritious foods.

629
01:37:27,970 --> 01:37:31,840
Anything else you, I guess, like to expand on accessibility, thinking about, like,

630
01:37:32,560 --> 01:37:37,209
transportation to that and like I think it's within like a mile radius or something like that.

631
01:37:37,210 --> 01:37:41,350
But you could access the grocery store that had like a target. Right.

632
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:44,650
Yeah. Public transportation is definitely a big part of that.

633
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:53,080
Or just any vehicle access. Anything else that comes to mind, this may be connected,

634
01:37:53,080 --> 01:37:59,030
particularly where there would be like maybe grocery stores instead of, like fast food places or gas stations.

635
01:37:59,080 --> 01:38:00,549
Yeah. Yeah.

636
01:38:00,550 --> 01:38:11,110
I think a few years ago I came across the term food swamps by comparison to sort of talk about the hyper concentration of those types of places,

637
01:38:11,500 --> 01:38:14,500
typically in the same areas where you see food deserts.

638
01:38:15,520 --> 01:38:25,809
Okay, cool. So I mainly asked that because one of the first things that the article talks about is how food deserts get framed in some of the

639
01:38:25,810 --> 01:38:34,270
definitional limitations to that because of the fact that it's considered more of a broad concept than a specific measured parameter.

640
01:38:35,230 --> 01:38:41,320
So in this article, the author set out to quantify and map the accessibility of food systems in Toledo,

641
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:47,050
Ohio, and they do so by using GIS to measure the accessibility of each block group.

642
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:53,770
And they do that measure the accessibility of that to retailers selling a selection of fresh foods.

643
01:38:54,070 --> 01:39:02,440
And I'll break down sort of how they define that. But they do this to determine whether or not the spatial accessibility to food outlets

644
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:09,490
carries any issues in Toledo in terms of access to these nutritious and healthy choices.

645
01:39:10,420 --> 01:39:11,440
In like I mentioned,

646
01:39:11,440 --> 01:39:22,360
the questions and the analysis of the design is not only based off of this urban planning understanding of food deserts and food systems,

647
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:26,470
but also, like I said, some of the definitional limits of space.

648
01:39:30,140 --> 01:39:38,330
Okay. And so my first question for you all is what other challenges do you think can come up with using

649
01:39:38,330 --> 01:39:44,990
gas when you're trying to measure a concept that's different in its definitional parameters?

650
01:39:46,670 --> 01:39:55,250
Like a food desert. Or another example could be like how we look at the different definitions of urban versus rural allocations.

651
01:39:58,250 --> 01:40:01,280
Yeah. I think just understanding the boundaries and what's going to count.

652
01:40:02,010 --> 01:40:05,910
These videos and photos and you don't want to leave anything out. But also at the same time.

653
01:40:07,150 --> 01:40:10,690
If there's some different definitions. You know what I mean? Mm hmm.

654
01:40:11,310 --> 01:40:14,470
Yeah, I think that's important. I think.

655
01:40:14,620 --> 01:40:16,179
And it's not like some of those boundaries.

656
01:40:16,180 --> 01:40:22,390
Like, would you really do, like, focus groups to figure out what they are and reflect on what people are living in, how far they're traveling.

657
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:27,230
So you get like expensive. Mhm. Yeah. Any other thoughts?

658
01:40:27,300 --> 01:40:36,220
Yeah, I think also just like dreaming about what you can do about it once you figure out what the definitions are like,

659
01:40:36,230 --> 01:40:41,030
if there's a definition of like parameter that you're not going to actually be able to like,

660
01:40:41,150 --> 01:40:46,490
I just sort of like respond to then it could be because you feel like hard to believe

661
01:40:46,490 --> 01:40:53,750
that you're then trying to like make a change with your you're doing a great job.

662
01:40:54,170 --> 01:41:02,580
Yeah, these are all good points. I think definitely there comes a question of what your specific population is and

663
01:41:02,600 --> 01:41:07,040
what are the needs around that population in terms of what you're trying to study.

664
01:41:08,180 --> 01:41:13,850
But definitely, I think to your point about limitations around any boundaries that are created, definitely,

665
01:41:15,500 --> 01:41:24,710
I think the importance of naming those limitations is important so that folks can build off of those limitations in future research.

666
01:41:26,510 --> 01:41:34,590
But in terms of the methods and the data used, so they use argument 9.3 and they pull together.

667
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:42,170
They pull together a data from a few different sources, including the addresses of grocery stores and other food retailers.

668
01:41:42,860 --> 01:41:52,429
And they did this using a lot of different resources, which they later talked about in the study as sort of having a human error aspect to it,

669
01:41:52,430 --> 01:41:57,680
given the amount of just going through each, you know, phone book, Internet search, etc.

670
01:41:58,640 --> 01:42:05,690
And they also did a list of residential households obtained by the Lucas County Auditor Database.

671
01:42:05,960 --> 01:42:13,460
And then they also, like we've been doing, use census plot groups and they use the outlines and the demographic data for each group.

672
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:22,130
And they took that from the 2000 U.S. Census. And you'll see in red, these are the different aspects of those variables that were excluded.

673
01:42:22,790 --> 01:42:28,040
So they excluded convenience stores and membership stores like Costco, Sam's Club, BJ's,

674
01:42:29,090 --> 01:42:35,420
and they also excluded apartment complexes and how they measured out these different factors.

675
01:42:35,810 --> 01:42:44,840
And they also made the decision to exclude public transportation, which we can probably talk about in the limitations portion of the article.

676
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:48,409
But yeah, they did a lot of this.

677
01:42:48,410 --> 01:42:55,820
Like going back to your point about just some of the logistical decisions folks have to make when doing data and what's accessible.

678
01:42:56,450 --> 01:43:05,300
But the logic for excluding public transportation was the fact that they felt that from their mindset,

679
01:43:06,350 --> 01:43:11,600
residents in Toledo will be less likely to use public transportation for grocery hauls,

680
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:17,180
just given the inconvenience involved, like lugging a bunch of groceries to and from wherever you live.

681
01:43:19,570 --> 01:43:28,719
Yeah, we can talk about that and limitations, but. And so this is just the compilation in figures one and two.

682
01:43:28,720 --> 01:43:34,060
This is sort of how they pull together the data from the.

683
01:43:36,000 --> 01:43:41,550
First two of these different types of data collection and.

684
01:43:49,950 --> 01:43:57,510
Yes. And so in terms of the last point about the descriptive demographic data that they use from the census,

685
01:43:57,840 --> 01:44:01,150
they used the percentage of those who are nonwhite.

686
01:44:01,170 --> 01:44:04,200
They use the median household annual income.

687
01:44:04,530 --> 01:44:10,560
They use the percentage of residents in that specific block that are receiving any public assistance.

688
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:15,360
They also measured within each black folks who own a car or not.

689
01:44:16,200 --> 01:44:21,060
And they also measured folks who live below the poverty level within each block.

690
01:44:21,960 --> 01:44:26,880
This is also represented on figures three and four here.

691
01:44:32,030 --> 01:44:39,469
Yes. And so in terms of how they define the distance to a fresh food retailer,

692
01:44:39,470 --> 01:44:46,010
they really defined it as any sized grocer that's carrying predominantly fresh foods and staple items.

693
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:54,079
So not necessarily convenience stores or carry outs, but they also include it within that produce markets, meat markets,

694
01:44:54,080 --> 01:45:03,710
delis and small neighborhood markets versus the average distance to the nearest food chain retailer just included full service retail chains,

695
01:45:04,040 --> 01:45:09,830
which you'll see going back to this map.

696
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:18,150
The one here on the right is just showing the full service versus this is including full service and the smaller chains.

697
01:45:19,430 --> 01:45:25,850
But in terms of what they found in trying to do this analysis to map out accessibility to these systems,

698
01:45:26,210 --> 01:45:34,430
they found that while the average group product accessibility doesn't seem to vary significantly by these demographic characteristics,

699
01:45:34,430 --> 01:45:45,110
which they also talked about the heterogeneity of Toledo specifically, but though they didn't find any variation significantly by those factors,

700
01:45:45,260 --> 01:45:48,620
they did see that there are several neighborhoods that have this sort of

701
01:45:48,620 --> 01:45:54,110
convergence of both being a low income population and low accessibility rates.

702
01:45:54,950 --> 01:45:57,859
And so this demonstrates that for this study, at least,

703
01:45:57,860 --> 01:46:06,230
the socio socioeconomic factors alone did not predict well where food accessibility is hindered in Toledo.

704
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:10,310
And they talked about a bunch of different reasons why that was.

705
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:16,940
But I'm curious, I'm looking at these maps and thinking about the audience for an article like this,

706
01:46:16,940 --> 01:46:23,440
which I would imagine is other urban planners from a public health communications perspective.

707
01:46:23,450 --> 01:46:29,540
Which of these maps do you feel is more informational, accessible and useful for urban planners?

708
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:39,549
And if so, why? Yeah, I would say figure three you're the one that has the green lighted areas.

709
01:46:39,550 --> 01:46:44,050
I feel like I can look at it right away and tell what I'm looking at, first of all.

710
01:46:44,050 --> 01:46:53,530
And also like, where are the areas where there might need to be intervention or like more grocery stores opened up or just like places to get food?

711
01:46:55,730 --> 01:47:05,650
Okay. Any other thoughts? Yeah, definitely also figure three sort of figure or I think the,

712
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:10,860
the text that gives like the different like information about that area kind of like covers that map as well.

713
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:15,370
Yeah. Just something that's like cool that you can toggle right before like a picture of this.

714
01:47:15,390 --> 01:47:20,750
Not so much. Gotcha. Any other thoughts?

715
01:47:24,020 --> 01:47:30,620
I think. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, I was going to say I got off the phone that figure for you can't really tell what your views are like.

716
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:43,639
I was like, who doesn't think it's very like especially for the gray areas like help you like see like visually see that like where you have like a

717
01:47:43,640 --> 01:47:54,350
little big bird and then like I see like this one red that it's like this like for defense in the fight is kind of like taking over as well.

718
01:47:54,350 --> 01:48:00,320
So visually speaking, freedom three is more of like digestible.

719
01:48:04,930 --> 01:48:15,610
Any other thoughts about this question? So when I posed this question, I immediately had the same thoughts that most of you did.

720
01:48:15,620 --> 01:48:20,390
That figure three was more useful. I would imagine that.

721
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:27,909
They probably designed this map. I can't speak on it because we don't see it in the article.

722
01:48:27,910 --> 01:48:35,530
But I would imagine that this bigger format is meant to be interactive so that when you click on those counties, that data shows up.

723
01:48:35,950 --> 01:48:39,820
But it was really hard to tell whether or not that was the specific design of that.

724
01:48:42,070 --> 01:48:47,799
So I could see how kind of a trick question that like under certain perspective,

725
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:52,510
both of these are equally necessary in order to get that information that's useful for planners.

726
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:57,190
But I can see what you all mean about the information accessibility.

727
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:07,330
Okay. Um, so in terms of the strengths and limitations of the study, there were.

728
01:49:11,390 --> 01:49:18,410
Quite a few, I think. I enjoyed the article in terms of feeling like it gave a comprehensive and broad attempt

729
01:49:18,410 --> 01:49:24,020
to place local food systems and food security issues within an urban planning framework.

730
01:49:24,440 --> 01:49:32,960
I think in terms of what it means to brought in the stakeholders involved in this issue, that that's an important contribution that the article made.

731
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:38,960
And I think it's really cool that the research design could be replicated to another urban setting,

732
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:45,829
and it also offers a different disciplinary perspective on potential interventions using a more social

733
01:49:45,830 --> 01:49:51,740
determinants of health perspective than just looking at this individual decision about how people access food.

734
01:49:52,820 --> 01:49:56,540
But I felt like it was definitely a lot of limitations, obviously.

735
01:49:56,540 --> 01:50:03,350
And then doing a case study of Toledo, Ohio, there's a lack of generalizability from the specific context of Toledo.

736
01:50:03,380 --> 01:50:10,520
Like we mentioned, with the heterogeneity of this population and what that could mean for the influence

737
01:50:10,520 --> 01:50:13,940
that things like socioeconomic status would typically have in this realm.

738
01:50:14,930 --> 01:50:21,500
And like they mentioned, there was also human error involved in the manual address aggregation for the grocery stores.

739
01:50:22,790 --> 01:50:29,329
And it also didn't measure for personal preference, retail competition or realized access.

740
01:50:29,330 --> 01:50:31,790
So where people actually going?

741
01:50:32,870 --> 01:50:42,110
And lastly, it doesn't take into account comparisons of price or selection or more detailed accessibility barriers in the built environment.

742
01:50:42,410 --> 01:50:46,819
So like having across busy highways or walk across debilitated sidewalks,

743
01:50:46,820 --> 01:50:53,180
things that in people's lived experiences would definitely impact the kinds of decisions they made.

744
01:50:55,370 --> 01:51:05,060
So before I get to the question at the bottom, were there any other thoughts about strengths and weaknesses in the study that the folks came across?

745
01:51:07,060 --> 01:51:13,990
Either in its application methodologically or as a public health tool.

746
01:51:15,610 --> 01:51:18,970
To try to specifically understand food systems and access.

747
01:51:38,450 --> 01:51:47,430
Yeah. Yeah. I think like when she was earlier with, like, Quincy Jones and like where people live and like income, etc., etc.

748
01:51:48,210 --> 01:51:56,560
Like, when I think about public health, like Jennings, I think it kind of like there's a difference in like how things are to maybe, you know,

749
01:51:56,660 --> 01:52:04,640
contain things and then like you have to like if it's was quasi like was like looking for like digitized,

750
01:52:04,760 --> 01:52:08,600
you know, for such like, you know, viewership or visualization.

751
01:52:08,600 --> 01:52:20,470
And I think like overall always like things kind of get complex and, you know, and like, you know, distinct periods of things do kind of like missing.

752
01:52:20,730 --> 01:52:29,450
Yeah. Um, you know, and then like, I guess, like the question for future research is how can you, you know, how do you,

753
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:37,649
how do we compile that in order to, you know, show that through like different, like, you know, levels of data sharing.

754
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:43,800
And so overall, yeah, you try to you hit it on the head with that that's.

755
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:48,000
Okay. I think I saw it. Yeah, yeah.

756
01:52:48,050 --> 01:52:54,620
I just think the transportation thing and maybe they made an assumption because of things they know about Toledo, Ohio.

757
01:52:54,620 --> 01:53:00,349
And I don't know much about Ohio, but I think that would probably be a limitation for generalizability.

758
01:53:00,350 --> 01:53:05,679
Just because in a lot of cities. Folks do rely on public transit.

759
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:09,500
So. Not transfer to other places, I guess.

760
01:53:11,190 --> 01:53:15,720
Yeah. And speaking of that, I definitely was.

761
01:53:16,170 --> 01:53:18,569
I mean, granted, it's an urban planning framework,

762
01:53:18,570 --> 01:53:25,080
so I wasn't expecting much talk about rural food deserts and food systems, but I think that's definitely a limitation too,

763
01:53:25,080 --> 01:53:33,180
in terms of how applicable is this to rural contexts where there are very specific, unique considerations for how those food systems work?

764
01:53:34,020 --> 01:53:36,640
Yeah, I know you're going to talk about more that too,

765
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:45,120
but like I'm interested in the replicability in a city that has really great institution versus one that has really terrible public transportation.

766
01:53:45,120 --> 01:53:50,850
Like I work in Toledo and the busses there are the worst of the worst.

767
01:53:50,880 --> 01:53:56,220
So like, I don't blame anybody who doesn't want to smell like if it was in, you know,

768
01:53:56,280 --> 01:53:59,600
like New York where you couldn't get on the subway, I'd be there in 10 minutes, like.

769
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:04,230
Right. How would you change the study? Like, would you choose to include it?

770
01:54:04,230 --> 01:54:07,320
Does that hurt the results of that? In terms of comparison?

771
01:54:08,370 --> 01:54:12,109
I'd be interested in that. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point.

772
01:54:12,110 --> 01:54:19,850
That like even within that dichotomy of public transportation versus no public transportation, there is such a variation in quality.

773
01:54:20,540 --> 01:54:24,930
Yeah. I was hoping you were talking about the sidewalks.

774
01:54:25,290 --> 01:54:28,320
Yeah, I don't recall. Talk about that often.

775
01:54:28,560 --> 01:54:34,200
Like I always try to write for. Yeah.

776
01:54:34,860 --> 01:54:42,299
Yeah, there were definitely I had some broader questions about able to zoom within this and like even for

777
01:54:42,300 --> 01:54:47,850
folks who are able to use public transportation easily or walk through those areas easily than others,

778
01:54:47,850 --> 01:54:51,060
what does that mean about access to you? Yeah.

779
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:57,470
Um. Okay.

780
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:01,690
Also,

781
01:55:01,720 --> 01:55:13,330
another limitation that the article went into but put less emphasis on was that by focusing on these areas of high poverty rates within this map,

782
01:55:13,330 --> 01:55:17,409
that they created individuals living below the poverty level.

783
01:55:17,410 --> 01:55:24,460
In these black groups that have an overall higher median income level, they still may not get their needs addressed.

784
01:55:24,610 --> 01:55:32,860
In other words, individuals who can't afford to purchase food will not be able to do that no matter how accessible the food is to them.

785
01:55:34,930 --> 01:55:40,150
So, yeah, definitely leave some broader implications here.

786
01:55:41,410 --> 01:55:44,410
Um. I'm not sure how much time I have left.

787
01:55:44,410 --> 01:55:47,440
Should I start paying the rent?

788
01:55:47,710 --> 01:55:57,250
Yeah. Okay. My last question was just one of the suggestions the articles leave us with the article leaves us with is integrating more qualitative

789
01:55:57,250 --> 01:56:04,570
research into the data that gets collected to better understand motivations and people's actual behaviors in this context.

790
01:56:06,250 --> 01:56:13,270
And so I'm wondering in a qualitative context, what kind of questions would you ask in?

791
01:56:13,540 --> 01:56:17,740
How do you think that that would translate to how you measure it within GIS?

792
01:56:18,310 --> 01:56:22,600
Because I know we talk a lot about quantitative in this context.

793
01:56:23,200 --> 01:56:33,639
Yeah, I'm not I think it would be kind of like asking to actually use the bus right on different issues around like not assuming that folks

794
01:56:33,640 --> 01:56:40,030
who may have like disabilities and that kind of whatever like have someone to get confused for their research service and like,

795
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:42,810
you know, they can talk about as well, like what are your different areas?

796
01:56:43,810 --> 01:56:47,400
So kind of like breaking down assumptions and kind of being able to make realistic boundaries.

797
01:56:47,430 --> 01:56:53,970
Associates Yeah. Okay. You know what I actually do over there?

798
01:56:53,990 --> 01:57:00,480
Actually go grocery store. I think sometimes like we think, okay, well, this is like the closest one.

799
01:57:00,660 --> 01:57:07,889
So like in a food desert and the closest one like, that might not be in any like that grocery store,

800
01:57:07,890 --> 01:57:15,090
might not be any better for people or may not be more accessible, or like if they're working somewhere else anyways and they're like,

801
01:57:15,690 --> 01:57:18,240
there's no grocery store where I live, so I'm going to go, you know,

802
01:57:18,270 --> 01:57:24,750
this something that you figure out like I guess even more the breadth of the food desert and they're like,

803
01:57:24,800 --> 01:57:28,440
it is the one that's closest isn't serving people the best.

804
01:57:28,530 --> 01:57:31,960
And I would say that expands the boundary to a more. Right.

805
01:57:32,310 --> 01:57:35,640
Yeah. I think building off of what you just said,

806
01:57:35,790 --> 01:57:44,670
thinking about where people will want to go grocery shop in terms of like in Detroit they have a Whole Foods.

807
01:57:45,480 --> 01:57:49,830
But how I mean because it's a really expensive restaurant actually going there.

808
01:57:50,910 --> 01:57:53,399
So of course they have something in the area.

809
01:57:53,400 --> 01:57:58,980
But whether or not it's actually accessible to everybody else is something that needs to be addressed to.

810
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:08,110
Yeah. So it seems like maybe asking some questions about people's actual behaviors and maybe even asking them why.

811
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:16,090
Any last files. Cool.

812
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:26,240
Thank you. Right.

813
01:58:26,390 --> 01:58:29,660
Excellent work and great discussion, you guys.

814
01:58:30,050 --> 01:58:38,870
Let's just move on to the next one. I'm so sorry about the time we were in here.

815
01:58:38,910 --> 01:58:42,920
Yeah, I do. Also, I sent one version and I sent the updated one.

816
01:58:43,190 --> 01:58:46,759
I think this is the benefit of the help. Right.

817
01:58:46,760 --> 01:59:03,910
So if not, you have to. But hello, everybody.

818
01:59:04,030 --> 01:59:11,710
I did the article on Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, banning outdoor tobacco advertising near schools and playgrounds.

819
01:59:13,020 --> 01:59:17,230
So I want to just give you an overview of the presentations. They're going to go over the purpose of the paper.

820
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:23,590
I want to show you some ads. I go through the methods section, some of the results and the strengths and weaknesses of the paper.

821
01:59:25,600 --> 01:59:25,930
Okay.

822
01:59:26,290 --> 01:59:35,590
So essentially the purpose was to examine how the 29 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, FSP, TCA rules would affect tobacco retailers.

823
01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:37,420
This was the general purpose of the paper.

824
01:59:38,320 --> 01:59:44,320
So just some background information on the National Cancer Institute kind of concluded that there was a correlation

825
01:59:44,320 --> 01:59:52,360
between these tobacco advertisements and both the initiation of smoking and the levels of consumption.

826
01:59:53,890 --> 02:00:00,879
So along with that, this exposure to this ad is going to affect the attitudes, perceptions and desires of smokers.

827
02:00:00,880 --> 02:00:09,520
So your attitude about cigarets in general, maybe change you're going to see improved your perceptions on life, like if you need to smoke or whatever.

828
02:00:09,520 --> 02:00:10,599
I just think desires generally.

829
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:23,860
So if you, you know, trying to quit X, Y and Z area and then also just like the the law itself went into effect June 22nd, 29.

830
02:00:24,220 --> 02:00:29,590
So one of the rules that we're essentially focused on is the restriction of tobacco marketing and sales to youth.

831
02:00:29,590 --> 02:00:34,060
But these are other five rules that are detailed within this policy.

832
02:00:38,190 --> 02:00:41,960
Can you all see this just for Google.

833
02:00:43,590 --> 02:00:46,440
So going so why they actually to the study.

834
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:54,150
So even with the current regulations 85% of youth still reported that they were being exposed to these ads at these different locations.

835
02:00:54,780 --> 02:00:58,170
So they weren't kind of really effectively reducing their exposure at all.

836
02:00:59,160 --> 02:01:04,050
And then these point of sale locations are going to be because of grocery stores and gas stations like that.

837
02:01:04,060 --> 02:01:07,360
So essentially where these products will be sold, there's advertisements there.

838
02:01:07,950 --> 02:01:11,940
And these are used to kind of influence people to do like impulse buys and things like that.

839
02:01:12,330 --> 02:01:15,600
So I think the idea is like if it's inside and it's something that someone's gonna buy.

840
02:01:18,630 --> 02:01:27,520
So essentially laws proposed that's open for public comment in the tobacco industry gets personal like yo like we've collected this data

841
02:01:27,540 --> 02:01:35,970
we're doing this presentation 85 to 95% of the areas will just be like kind of off limit if we use these thousand foot like not borders.

842
02:01:36,330 --> 02:01:41,940
So I think they gave context around. There was a recent lawsuit that was like lost saying that this ban,

843
02:01:41,940 --> 02:01:45,090
it was unconstitutional, suppress their First Amendment right of freedom of speech.

844
02:01:48,360 --> 02:01:52,440
So one of the reasons why this paper another reason why this paper is done is directly in response to that,

845
02:01:52,620 --> 02:01:58,410
the only data that was available, that estimate this impact was being presented by the tobacco industry in a litigation case.

846
02:01:58,770 --> 02:02:02,490
So they decided to do a study. They did it with two states, New York and Missouri.

847
02:02:03,210 --> 02:02:09,900
Their central questions was, were how does this ban affect retailers in more densely populated areas compared to more rural ones?

848
02:02:11,160 --> 02:02:15,870
Are most of these ads banned due to, for example, real schools and playgrounds?

849
02:02:15,870 --> 02:02:19,620
So basically, like what to what degree are these being banned? Is that 85 to 95%?

850
02:02:20,520 --> 02:02:27,450
And how do the various regulation zones. So basically what all those buffer sizes so they add that maxes out that a thousand

851
02:02:27,450 --> 02:02:32,639
feet or are they lower to kind of see maybe what effects they may have for,

852
02:02:32,640 --> 02:02:39,630
you know, different policy implications to I think New York and Missouri were chosen because of the variety of rural,

853
02:02:40,440 --> 02:02:44,310
suburban and urban kind of locations where they thought they'd be a good fit to kind of test this out with.

854
02:02:45,150 --> 02:02:52,770
Oh, [INAUDIBLE]. So one of my questions is, if a lot of us are still taking the whole communications class, what were these ads going to look like?

855
02:02:53,010 --> 02:02:59,580
Do you have a picture of them? Think about their their point of sale by schools and playgrounds.

856
02:03:04,510 --> 02:03:10,549
Yes. I think in general, obviously, they're going to just I mean,

857
02:03:10,550 --> 02:03:17,030
ads are just going to be about like the fun of it or like the way that it looks or, you know, having a positive spin on.

858
02:03:17,070 --> 02:03:21,709
I'm not going to talk about like the health care parts of it just to get people to really just again,

859
02:03:21,710 --> 02:03:24,320
like you said, just impulse buy something like, oh, what's the harm?

860
02:03:24,320 --> 02:03:28,370
And if they're not really talking about the harms at all, you don't really think twice about it.

861
02:03:28,850 --> 02:03:38,030
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I think really, too, that I'd imagine there'd be some.

862
02:03:38,640 --> 02:03:44,160
Sort of. Cultural normalization with.

863
02:03:45,470 --> 02:03:49,810
This is just like a normal part of. That makes sense.

864
02:03:49,930 --> 02:03:54,820
Yeah. Yeah. Well, you both were right.

865
02:03:55,510 --> 02:03:58,790
So I just got a picture of some like some common, as you probably would see.

866
02:03:59,680 --> 02:04:02,800
And essentially, yes, they're accentuate like color.

867
02:04:03,520 --> 02:04:07,900
Pleasure is going across and it's nothing. No real information about the actual products themselves.

868
02:04:08,530 --> 02:04:13,719
I'm just trying to get you to buy them through this pleasure or you're having some sort of experience of some sort.

869
02:04:13,720 --> 02:04:19,420
And the prices, I don't really buy cigarets, but like I know they're generally expensive and say,

870
02:04:19,420 --> 02:04:26,799
oh, low price of this one's sub $10 versus 11 or 12 so big I advertisment it's like I said,

871
02:04:26,800 --> 02:04:31,840
they're kind of normalized at the point to where they're this giant and they're all kind of spread around the neighborhood.

872
02:04:31,840 --> 02:04:35,979
So yeah. So just to go to the metal.

873
02:04:35,980 --> 02:04:39,790
So how did they collect your data? What did they do? Let's see.

874
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:44,740
So they use GIS spatial analysis to do the study in the two different states.

875
02:04:45,430 --> 02:04:49,300
They also looked at two urban areas like within the states.

876
02:04:50,350 --> 02:04:55,900
So with their data collection, they got 2009 tobacco retail location data I think from the states.

877
02:04:56,230 --> 02:04:59,560
And then they used the Department of Education.

878
02:04:59,900 --> 02:05:06,850
I think also within those states to get the school locations, everything wasn't able to be like kind of found.

879
02:05:06,850 --> 02:05:09,820
So there was some data limitations which I didn't put in the weaknesses.

880
02:05:10,420 --> 02:05:17,620
So I guess we're talking about them now if they had to do some logical on their own. And essentially I think we've talked about that a little bit now.

881
02:05:17,920 --> 02:05:23,470
So you're be taking the addresses and just converting addresses into like longitude latitude to be a property on the map.

882
02:05:24,970 --> 02:05:27,280
They did a proximity and sensitivity analysis.

883
02:05:27,280 --> 02:05:32,709
So they have count and percentage of tobacco retailers that will fall within the buffers and they have it

884
02:05:32,710 --> 02:05:36,430
set up to where they have three different levels of buffers and if you don't like what they're looking at.

885
02:05:37,690 --> 02:05:43,450
So again, with the limitations, the scope parameters weren't like state wide.

886
02:05:43,780 --> 02:05:52,240
And they're also wearing, you say, files for playgrounds. So you had to expand it out a little bit and do parks, which we'll get into a little later.

887
02:05:54,340 --> 02:05:57,880
And essentially you say force will be used to like make those boundaries that they had to make them themselves.

888
02:05:57,970 --> 02:06:01,240
And this is just like the table. They have kind of a data all they did.

889
02:06:05,170 --> 02:06:12,219
So here the results for the 1000 foot boundaries and so we looked at when there was just

890
02:06:12,220 --> 02:06:18,730
schools considered 29% of those retailers actually fell within those buffers in Saint Louis.

891
02:06:19,600 --> 02:06:29,260
And then for New York City, 79% fell within that. Once you added the schools and parks, there was 43% for Saint Louis and 81% for New York.

892
02:06:30,190 --> 02:06:36,009
So just asking for reflections on those, those numbers are but they're also reflections on the maps themselves.

893
02:06:36,010 --> 02:06:39,640
They were readable. Do they get across the message? What do you feel?

894
02:06:45,800 --> 02:07:01,010
Yes. The first thing I can tell, I appreciate the location of the more populated areas that it affects.

895
02:07:01,580 --> 02:07:06,050
But overall, I think it I think it is the job done.

896
02:07:06,110 --> 02:07:10,250
Maybe I see the key, but the key has like notes what that means.

897
02:07:12,080 --> 02:07:21,410
Yeah, but it is, it does get a little bit when you look at the it may have is net which is also helpful to you know,

898
02:07:21,980 --> 02:07:25,240
signify that impact at the same time. Yeah. Yeah.

899
02:07:29,620 --> 02:07:34,060
What's going on? I just like looking at the size of each.

900
02:07:34,260 --> 02:07:37,489
Like Manhattan looks a lot smaller than, like, Saint Louis.

901
02:07:37,490 --> 02:07:41,380
So, like the impact of me, like those dots being layered on top of each other.

902
02:07:41,470 --> 02:07:46,870
It's harder than Saint Louis because I'm like, Oh, well, there's a lot of empty space that doesn't have those rezoning.

903
02:07:47,140 --> 02:07:52,480
And that could be intentional or it could be like kind of old me talking about how they chose to display the map to have a different impact.

904
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:59,260
Like leading me to be more biased, like, oh, Manhattan really has a problem with like having a lot of tobacco retailers in our schools.

905
02:08:00,010 --> 02:08:09,639
So yeah, we just like the way that the maps are, are displayed also can have like implications for, for like how people decide to like make decisions.

906
02:08:09,640 --> 02:08:14,530
I think like advises me to think like Manhattan really has a problem with, like, having to restrict tobacco retailers.

907
02:08:14,710 --> 02:08:20,670
Yeah. I think these maps are also really helpful because the more you look at it,

908
02:08:20,670 --> 02:08:24,040
the more information you're kind of getting from in terms of interpretation too,

909
02:08:24,060 --> 02:08:30,130
because especially the St Louis one, at first I was like, oh, so like there's definitely a concentrated area that comes up.

910
02:08:30,180 --> 02:08:35,890
But then also you see the pattern of like where certain clothes are and where the real retailers are going to be too.

911
02:08:35,910 --> 02:08:43,080
So yeah, yeah. It was like for me with like some of these lines like are these streets where there's just like every other,

912
02:08:43,080 --> 02:08:47,580
like, you know, so many feet or whatever, there's just like advertisements, like.

913
02:08:47,610 --> 02:08:53,340
Yeah, that's interesting. So you balance the thank you on the one to the next.

914
02:08:54,270 --> 02:08:58,020
So these are results for the 500 foot buffers.

915
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:05,790
So once again, if we're looking at New York City and Saint Louis City for Saint Louis,

916
02:09:05,790 --> 02:09:11,550
we have 11% of the retail is well within that those buffers and then for New York City you have 44%.

917
02:09:11,880 --> 02:09:17,040
But once you add in the schools and parks, you get 20% and then the 48%.

918
02:09:18,090 --> 02:09:23,010
And then this is going to be looking at the smaller buffer and it's gonna be 300 feet, 350 feet.

919
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:29,610
You have 7% of the retailers being black, falling into those buffers, 29%.

920
02:09:29,610 --> 02:09:40,170
And then you add the schools, it's 29 and 33%. And then so at the end they did a a hybrid.

921
02:09:40,350 --> 02:09:46,110
So they were saying, okay, how about we if we look at I believe, is this what that is?

922
02:09:49,470 --> 02:09:52,560
No. This is at the state level. I'm sorry.

923
02:09:52,800 --> 02:09:59,670
So at the state level, they looked at the fact that these thousand foot buffers would actually have out on a state level,

924
02:10:00,570 --> 02:10:03,630
just including schools for Missouri as a whole.

925
02:10:04,170 --> 02:10:11,490
21% of the retailers felt in those buffers looked at a state as a whole for New York, 51%.

926
02:10:12,150 --> 02:10:15,240
Then when you add the schools and parks, it's 29% and then 57%.

927
02:10:15,240 --> 02:10:19,470
So a large percentage of these retailers would be affected by this,

928
02:10:20,130 --> 02:10:26,210
but nowhere near the estimated 85 to 95%, which we could probably assume was going to be inflated.

929
02:10:26,560 --> 02:10:40,710
But then there was a kind of hybrid method where they looked at New York because it's more urban and Missouri having things more spread out,

930
02:10:41,190 --> 02:10:44,550
I guess more of a concentration of rural areas.

931
02:10:44,880 --> 02:10:53,310
So they set up a 500 foot buffers in New York and a thousand foot buffers in Missouri to see if that would happen sort of thing.

932
02:10:53,970 --> 02:10:58,320
So along with that, they found that for Missouri, 51% of the reserves will be affected.

933
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:06,660
And if in Newark, 21.8% when you add actual schools in in parks.

934
02:11:11,550 --> 02:11:22,380
Those numbers were. The second one is if you add the school at schools and parks.

935
02:11:27,160 --> 02:11:34,600
I think so, too, because I think there was a reduction.

936
02:11:35,500 --> 02:11:42,280
I'm going to say the numbers and then correct them here. So I got 24, 27.3% and 11.4% for New York.

937
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:51,670
So with the conclusion of an article, there was 2.5 to 3 times more reserves affected in the urban areas versus the war areas.

938
02:11:51,670 --> 02:11:56,799
And so I did the hybrid method and they were saying that this might avoid some of the constitutional issues,

939
02:11:56,800 --> 02:12:04,390
but like sacrificing effectiveness in the rural areas. So we are kind of increasing those buffer as we are seeing some sort of effect.

940
02:12:05,440 --> 02:12:07,450
But there is a lower effect in most areas.

941
02:12:09,110 --> 02:12:14,950
And I guess so for me, one of the questions was how might we still use that buffer method if it's avoidance,

942
02:12:14,950 --> 02:12:18,099
concession issues or just implement different interventions?

943
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:22,930
Like what would those interventions be? Would that work? Would that be feasible here?

944
02:12:30,900 --> 02:12:36,990
Can you repeat your question? So if we were like use a high rate method where we had small buffers for New

945
02:12:36,990 --> 02:12:41,910
York and larger buffers for Missouri to help avoid most constitutional issues.

946
02:12:41,910 --> 02:12:45,240
So basically, if we have 1000 foot buffers and both,

947
02:12:45,660 --> 02:12:51,630
it may overlap with too many other retailers and then they they would win the case and these but for someone to exist, it wouldn't exist.

948
02:12:52,410 --> 02:12:58,850
So this hybrid method is presented to kind of get around those constitutional issues and still kind of restrict their advertising around schools,

949
02:12:58,870 --> 02:13:13,040
parks. I am not sure, but I'm thinking that that makes more sense just to tailor it to like the city that you're going to apply it to.

950
02:13:13,040 --> 02:13:16,339
Because like New York, everyone is all on top of each other.

951
02:13:16,340 --> 02:13:24,290
So 500 feet in New York is a lot more space, at least in my opinion, than it is in the St Louis,

952
02:13:24,290 --> 02:13:29,059
which is like their population is going down and has been for a long time.

953
02:13:29,060 --> 02:13:35,440
So a thousand feet in St Louis could equate like 500 feet worth of, you know, marketing.

954
02:13:35,450 --> 02:13:38,960
So while I think that it should feel a thousand feet away,

955
02:13:40,040 --> 02:13:45,949
it seems like if you're going to be able to get and you should take the edge

956
02:13:45,950 --> 02:13:50,060
and keep moving from there and to the things that you're going to work in,

957
02:13:51,530 --> 02:13:54,590
because you know that at least at the end of the day, 500 feet is.

958
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:59,320
Yeah. No, it's very good.

959
02:13:59,350 --> 02:14:07,230
Thank you. So move on.

960
02:14:08,430 --> 02:14:17,610
So just give us the strengths and weaknesses. One of the weak points was I would prefer like more maps, so maybe maps at the different level.

961
02:14:17,610 --> 02:14:22,960
So was like I guess there was a state level map, but like they I don't know.

962
02:14:23,130 --> 02:14:30,480
Let's see where it's like this is the only map that was kind of presented and it wasn't kind of like broken down.

963
02:14:30,480 --> 02:14:38,160
So where you could see some of the levels. So there are some of the numbers in the buffers were shifted and so like that.

964
02:14:38,160 --> 02:14:41,910
So we only have the the thousand foot, not the 500 or 300.

965
02:14:41,910 --> 02:14:46,190
So just think different things like that to see how maybe the view of things changed.

966
02:14:46,210 --> 02:14:51,450
Maybe this is the most extreme use. That's the one they used. But I guess I would just would have wanted to see more maps.

967
02:14:52,600 --> 02:14:58,469
So the question that Matt just answered with just more tentative interventions to

968
02:14:58,470 --> 02:15:01,200
the hybrid methods that are saying that like there could be possible weaknesses,

969
02:15:01,200 --> 02:15:04,620
but they didn't give too many suggestions around like what could be done.

970
02:15:04,620 --> 02:15:09,089
So maybe there's more like targeted prevention or so might that that aren't related to the

971
02:15:09,090 --> 02:15:14,070
ads in those areas just to kind of get the law passed and then wrap around some other things,

972
02:15:14,790 --> 02:15:18,480
maybe it need to be more expensive or whatever, but it wasn't really included.

973
02:15:19,560 --> 02:15:25,290
So strong points for me was the fact that they connected this public health and policy together for each person.

974
02:15:25,290 --> 02:15:29,099
That's like interest of me and like why I want to learn this is to have that impact.

975
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:30,150
When you're talking about policy,

976
02:15:30,570 --> 02:15:37,889
just folks who either move pretty fast or aren't really data center people and being able to present these things have an impact.

977
02:15:37,890 --> 02:15:41,940
And then here's the other research pieces that well, I think it's really cool.

978
02:15:41,940 --> 02:15:47,250
Hopefully that is helping me because I before I thought the article was pretty straightforward and some of the maps,

979
02:15:48,990 --> 02:15:54,090
I thought that they were pretty smart for my understanding on how they overcame some of the data limitations.

980
02:15:54,090 --> 02:16:01,950
So being able to develop those boundaries and make sure they were like connecting to the actual effects of the policy.

981
02:16:01,950 --> 02:16:06,989
So saying that these retailers would also be limited if they fail,

982
02:16:06,990 --> 02:16:11,129
I guess like on the edge of those buffers as well because are still kind of like

983
02:16:11,130 --> 02:16:14,910
around the school versus like being towards the center or inside of the buffers.

984
02:16:14,910 --> 02:16:19,350
So you try to account for that by giving a little bit more wiggle room with the buffers they created

985
02:16:20,400 --> 02:16:23,490
and also not having the school because in the parks they're going to be testing for that as well.

986
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:31,320
And yeah, I think that having that hybrid method and going through that extra work to actually

987
02:16:31,320 --> 02:16:35,639
provide opportunities to better align the policy with the constitutional concerns.

988
02:16:35,640 --> 02:16:42,000
Just because I feel like for my reading they're more on the side of the public and public good and against the tobacco companies.

989
02:16:42,000 --> 02:16:51,120
So yeah, they also I didn't put this in here kind of suggested in the paper that the tobacco companies use this method versus the one

990
02:16:51,120 --> 02:16:57,360
they use which just looked at area coverage and did not include the schools and the parks and stuff like that or whatever.

991
02:16:58,680 --> 02:17:07,720
So yeah. So yes, that's my presentation. Right.

992
02:17:08,910 --> 02:17:16,470
And because you did a great job and we only have 7 minutes to work out your assignment.

993
02:17:17,400 --> 02:17:27,240
I'm so sorry for the time today. I can stay behind and help folks out if you need some support with the assignment too.

994
02:17:29,040 --> 02:17:33,030
But if you want to depart, you're welcome to go.

995
02:17:33,090 --> 02:17:37,650
We're going to have the class, basically, you know, the lecture and all that portion.

996
02:17:38,670 --> 02:17:41,700
So I just want to apologize for not giving guys enough time.

997
02:17:42,330 --> 02:17:46,290
I guess the the fire drill was not good for us today.

998
02:17:47,190 --> 02:17:53,040
Okay, well, well done. You guys you guys did awesome job and great, great conversation and discussion about the papers.

999
02:17:53,730 --> 02:17:58,410
Work on assignment is to, if you like, and I'll stick around for folks who want to stay and get some help.

1000
02:17:58,410 --> 02:18:02,250
Okay. If not, we'll see everybody in two weeks.

1001
02:18:03,450 --> 02:18:06,750
Take care and have a good rest of the week.

1002
02:18:12,180 --> 02:18:17,160
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1003
02:18:17,520 --> 02:18:24,780
So I've been living with data, as we discussed, and I said, well, I guess two progression, one I was going to do.

1004
02:18:25,800 --> 02:18:33,270
I was like, This is like figure one, but would you prefer that I pick one of these formats or should I repeat?

1005
02:18:33,870 --> 02:18:39,770
I think it's fine if you create just one, because a lot of people are just drinking one minute.

1006
02:18:39,910 --> 02:18:45,400
Okay. Yeah. Okay. If I get really into it, you can do that.

1007
02:18:46,200 --> 02:18:49,460
But I love it. Okay. Let's see. ACR.

1008
02:18:49,920 --> 02:18:53,219
And then I found this.

1009
02:18:53,220 --> 02:18:59,520
So I know we brought this in the meeting, and this is seeming like the best like county level thing.

1010
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:04,920
But I still want to keep looking a little bit more because I have. Oh yeah, I did find this.

1011
02:19:06,210 --> 02:19:09,240
Oh, that was like. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1012
02:19:09,240 --> 02:19:15,930
Actually, participation versus eligibility. But I'm not I'm having a hard time, like, getting the actual like they're,

1013
02:19:16,050 --> 02:19:21,030
they're not I whenever I get more information, it just takes me back to this page.

1014
02:19:21,570 --> 02:19:26,180
So everything. So where is this from? The census.

1015
02:19:26,190 --> 02:19:31,440
And they used the American result. So that's why I wanted to look more at the sentences,

1016
02:19:31,440 --> 02:19:38,850
because they're using them with a user base and they linked it with like if I'm guessing by finding the actual data.

1017
02:19:39,540 --> 02:19:44,880
But it worked for her. This was much more like what I wanted to get back to.

1018
02:19:45,130 --> 02:19:55,110
This was just like in the regions in my pay files and yeah, I did actually probably.

1019
02:19:55,530 --> 02:20:05,340
So, so what is this doing? Because it just so that you can like change which state is showing here and you can change what characteristic it's like.

1020
02:20:06,520 --> 02:20:11,220
Which Yeah. What the, what the denominator based on every word.

1021
02:20:12,380 --> 02:20:18,510
Yeah. And then you can rerun New Year's which you can download because as far as I can tell,

1022
02:20:18,510 --> 02:20:24,659
I'm going to keep looking because I found this earlier today and when I see like because it says like more information,

1023
02:20:24,660 --> 02:20:27,860
but then again that it just takes you the pages. Okay.

1024
02:20:27,870 --> 02:20:35,009
So I keep learning, but I guess if I don't, if I can't get this because I was really excited when I got this,

1025
02:20:35,010 --> 02:20:39,140
but if I can't get this, I do just fulfillment.

1026
02:20:39,150 --> 02:20:45,930
Ability, I think. Yeah, because it is going to be hard for you to compute this on your own because you need administrative information.

1027
02:20:45,930 --> 02:20:49,350
Right? Right. Right. Yeah. It's unfortunate.

1028
02:20:50,010 --> 02:20:59,800
I'm I'm going to I'm determined to keep going because I have started to find this and then I have too many tabs open, so I'm not sure what I mean.

1029
02:20:59,900 --> 02:21:04,380
Not open anymore. No, that's okay. No, I just meant like I found something.

1030
02:21:04,800 --> 02:21:07,960
Okay. Yeah, exactly. Okay.

1031
02:21:07,980 --> 02:21:15,120
Do something that's close. Okay. Right. Because it's about more about the process of making it.

1032
02:21:15,290 --> 02:21:18,640
Okay. Okay. I was just so excited when I found that it was like I did it.

1033
02:21:18,690 --> 02:21:22,230
It's got to be somewhere. It's somewhere. It's somewhere.

1034
02:21:22,350 --> 02:21:25,460
But I think since the census, maybe that'll be a year.

1035
02:21:25,800 --> 02:21:30,870
Okay. Okay, then I have a question for my paper.

1036
02:21:31,110 --> 02:21:35,730
I don't know if you remember from Friday, but it was talking more about census tracks rather than county level data.

1037
02:21:36,420 --> 02:21:44,400
So from the website that we looked at today, do you think I should download the census tract files instead of county?

1038
02:21:44,880 --> 02:21:48,960
Well, it depends on the the attribute data that you had.

1039
02:21:49,140 --> 02:21:54,090
I forgot what the topic was. Can you remind me? It was, uh, food deserts in Alabama.

1040
02:21:54,390 --> 02:22:00,090
Okay. And it was the Excel file that I found had census tract.

1041
02:22:00,360 --> 02:22:03,509
Okay. Okay. Then you should download census tracts.

1042
02:22:03,510 --> 02:22:07,110
Absolutely. Okay. So you would go down to here like census tract?

1043
02:22:07,110 --> 02:22:16,850
Yeah. And then you would select the state that would be in better shape.

1044
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:22,500
And it would be.

1045
02:22:23,570 --> 02:22:28,230
Yeah. Okay. Instead of county here. Okay.

1046
02:22:28,260 --> 02:22:32,640
It's the same procedure. Okay. Thank you. On what camp?
