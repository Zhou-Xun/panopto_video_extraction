1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:27,750
Oh. I was.

2
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:46,640
He could still be free after recording in progress.

3
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:25,170
Couple. Thanks to my next story, the U.S. Supreme.

4
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,720
So, Professor, she's coming. Yeah, but, you know, she.

5
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:46,410
She said she's going to. Look.

6
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:49,230
It's. Okay.

7
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:56,880
Good morning, everybody. Let's continue. Okay.

8
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,149
Let's continue our conversation about linear programing.

9
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:08,500
And if you remember last time we're solving a problem about piano keys,

10
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:15,690
how many the ideas of two types, one and two to a scale in order to maximize profits.

11
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:21,420
And we need some accounting or accounting here.

12
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:32,520
Do you doubt that? They kind of made it very easy for you, one $300 per patient, and they're going to waste $400 per patient.

13
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:42,600
And we have certain constraints. We cannot exceed the number of patients aged between 18 and 19 hospital procedures that we have.

14
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:50,220
There are one, 20 and actually 60. So we can play with these numbers in order to figure it out.

15
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:58,410
What if we include the best value we can obtain here without violating without

16
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:03,719
exceeding our resources and we keep track of the resources that we're using?

17
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:15,720
If I decide to have three value one and 25 the only dos, then I will be using 31 inpatient day, 780 nursing hours and 109 diagnostic procedures.

18
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:24,690
And those are the minutes, right? So right now I am using that feasible only feasible solution because all of

19
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:32,219
these numbers are lower than my and what I have available for each for each,

20
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,770
for each one of those resources. The problem is that we don't know if this is right.

21
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:44,130
Can we do that now? So all programs or linear programs can be.

22
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:52,560
So I'm going to give you an indication of how they are sold and then we're going to solve them using Excel.

23
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:04,810
So what we did is because we are having two variables and Libya program we to actually show videos,

24
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:09,750
we are using a graphing calculator so we can add two variables.

25
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,590
We can throw that in a piece of paper on a plane.

26
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:28,229
Right? And then I am using a graphing calculator on this most that you can use for free and to figure out what with the shape of these solutions,

27
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:37,380
this set of solutions that are feasible, what is how can we find all those solutions that are feasible?

28
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:45,400
What is the best one? And so we went to the decimals calculator to make.

29
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:55,860
To Google on canvas. And we have a link for you.

30
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,950
There's a calculator here. We're hoping that opening that is a new tab.

31
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:11,990
And I don't think I say this, but we can do that quite easy to see.

32
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:25,070
So we are going to graph all of these constrains and the first constraint being this two examples plus weighs less than one equal to 122.

33
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,750
Just do that quickly to a little.

34
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,340
Why is that important to people?

35
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:47,620
So that's number one. And then I think the second one is.

36
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:54,400
And explode setting why less than or equal to 900.

37
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:11,680
So we go back to this most. An X.

38
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:21,150
Large satellite. If you want to bring order.

39
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:32,210
And finally, finally, the last constraint is.

40
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,120
Three floors now why make for 2016?

41
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,290
So the member goes like this. This is one of those ones.

42
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:52,589
People respond to the information they use the it was and they make the procedures and that's one

43
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:59,909
that know that is going to be the diagnostic procedure three days because for way less than a week.

44
00:07:59,910 --> 00:08:15,180
One, two, three, six, 858, eight, four, three, one, two, three, six.

45
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:31,950
So let me zoom. Now that we have these three constraints and we also have the non negativity constraints and I

46
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:39,030
know putting bodies there that we cannot have solutions in the negative range of the variables.

47
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:54,210
So we just have to do so at least the positive rate and we're all in three areas there saying is looks like is here and there's only one.

48
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:06,149
So at any point inside that's feasible and you're not in the borders of this region or in that region is feasible.

49
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:11,940
Right. That means that if I get a point here, 2020, for example,

50
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:22,649
2020 will satisfy all the constraints of the new ones and 22 to 25 building strength and then say 4010,

51
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:28,710
for example, 40 the new ones and in the 18 to I old state.

52
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:34,220
So anything in that region will satisfy old industry.

53
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:40,110
So now I'm going to throw this out a little bit.

54
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,170
So, you know, you can see what the feasible region is.

55
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:57,200
Now, the characteristics of this region is that the is is appalling on night ice and two dimensional.

56
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:05,210
And so we can do that in a plane and we have infinite potential feasible solutions.

57
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,990
Right. So that means that a solution is feasible.

58
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:12,290
Solution is to use that a scale of the only one.

59
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:15,240
And you do that satisfy the concern that you can make.

60
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:23,900
So you can say, I decided not to continue any you want to in India you do sort of in view of zero and that's feasible, right?

61
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:27,410
You are not your own. You are not violating any of your constraint.

62
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,780
You are not using any of your resources. But you can zero right profit.

63
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:44,960
So what we need to do right now is somehow graphically figured out what would be if if I if I

64
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:54,860
can point a in the feasible renewables say these one 1015 in the new ones and 16 the 18 to.

65
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,490
I want to know how much profit I'm getting for the.

66
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:09,930
So any point I want to find out a or develop a graphical way to represent to think it to

67
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:16,100
find out what is the net profit of each one of those points and the feasible agreement.

68
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:20,840
Now let's go back to the problem.

69
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:32,240
And in the problem you see that the objective function is maximize Z 300 cents plus one 400 Y.

70
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,600
That's the objective function in some way in decision variables, the number one and number two.

71
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:52,920
But these, you know, these expression, which is what we want to we want to take that expression and make it look as like as possible without,

72
00:11:53,450 --> 00:12:08,620
you know, within the feasible region. So if you so suppose, for example, that we get something like 300 X a subset.

73
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:19,399
Suppose I want to fix the S, I want to fix the P profit.

74
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:29,050
2000. Right. Let's say let's say I want to find out all the points in the feasible region that give me an end to revenue of a thousand.

75
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:34,880
Like what would I do? I would put a thousand here writings that a Z of what, a thousand.

76
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:42,110
And then I say 308,300 X plus 400 Y.

77
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:48,980
Right? So let's figure out why this is house, how it looks.

78
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:57,990
So I'm going back to. My Lord.

79
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:09,460
And then I go 34x141819.

80
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,880
And I want to say equal to all of that.

81
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:28,310
And you see that you have this line here. So if you go from these point to these point, all of these points are feasible.

82
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:43,970
I then point in within that line, so and so we find out and is obvious is that when I log the objective function, what I get is a straight line.

83
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:48,530
Right. This is what it calls the the trace of the objective function.

84
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:56,580
So these are all the points in the visible region that are equal.

85
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:03,100
So if I implement the new one, then you're into with within that line they are going to be equal.

86
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:13,010
Give me a value. Now you know what happens if it instead of a value of 1000, you know, can I do better?

87
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,380
I go and try to get the value on 5000 is the right size.

88
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:31,490
See. Now, he moved a little bit to the right and all these points, all these points from here,

89
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:42,230
from the X axis to the Y axis for respond to in solutions that will give you exactly 5000 in revenue.

90
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:53,260
And so so you know, now that if we start moving that line to the right, my profit is going to increase.

91
00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:00,770
If I move that line through there to to the left, my profit is going to increase.

92
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:13,190
So what I want to do to do now is get that line moving parallel to itself, because that's, you know, that that's how it will be a slope.

93
00:15:13,190 --> 00:15:19,909
What that line is, is not depending on these number is depending on the 304 to 400.

94
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:33,710
Right. So the ratio of the two and if I if I change this number to 3000 now, the line will keep moving parallel to itself.

95
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:44,870
Right. And what I want to do is to make is to see how much I can push that line within the feasible region and that direction,

96
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:49,129
because I'm I'm going to keep making my profit line your line here, line here.

97
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,430
Like your line, your guide, your on deal. You know,

98
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:59,420
I touched the last point of the visa will read you so and then I can know you know if

99
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:05,239
I'm moving to the right then I'm not going to be able to satisfy all the constraints.

100
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:10,910
So, for example, if I instead of say 10,000, I would say 100,000.

101
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:20,960
And then my line. Mate.

102
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,460
I will be here. Right. So my life will be here.

103
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,950
This is a way honor actually here.

104
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,100
So way beyond the feasible.

105
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:36,710
So I cannot, you know, I cannot get a profit of a hundred thousand.

106
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,550
Definitely. And so what I want to do is see how much I can do.

107
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:51,650
How, how, how, how far I can drive my profit and stay within the feasible.

108
00:16:52,010 --> 00:17:06,620
So for God, what I am going to do is instead of 300 X plus 400 Y, I need to say 300 X plus 400 Y equal to Z.

109
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:13,670
And he's going to be a new variable. And then I'm going to add a slider for his for Z.

110
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:27,460
That means that I can change the value of Z by moving the slider and I'm going to get the minimum would be zero and the maximum.

111
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,900
And we know that we kind of got to be hundred thousand.

112
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:37,640
Let's try. Hey, $50,000 in tax rate is being zero.

113
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:45,440
And then in step one. So it can actually be when I want to be as precise as possible.

114
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:55,490
All right. So what happens here? So if I start right now, use right now.

115
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:59,000
These is the feasible reason. This is it is a real game.

116
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:06,440
And the values that that this is where the Z is equal to one right now.

117
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:10,459
So you see that is zero.

118
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,060
But these actually have a value of one Z.

119
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:21,050
So if you put 300 X plus 400 Y, these will be one.

120
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:32,280
So the only lines we can say that this will be rapid before you start moving me.

121
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:39,320
If I start moving that I increasing my profit and I steal.

122
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:51,770
For example, from this point to this point, there are all feasible points and my profit is going to be two is going to be equal to 14,500.

123
00:18:52,820 --> 00:19:02,780
So I keep moving, moving. And at this point, this line is feasible for this segment.

124
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:07,610
So my profits is going to be equal to 18,700.

125
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:16,490
Let's keep going only until I touch the last point of the feasible reducing.

126
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:29,929
So this is the last feasible point, but in the direction of maximization and that happens to be, you know, Z is equal 2140 1000.

127
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:34,100
So at 21,000 is the maximum I can get there.

128
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:39,050
But the question is, what is the one of the values?

129
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,850
What do you want to do with that point? Right.

130
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:50,810
So we kind of figured out that by placing the cursor and figuring out what are the coordinates of that point.

131
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:58,970
And here we have 54 and 12. So the U one is 54 and they are into 12.

132
00:19:59,510 --> 00:20:05,990
So those are the numbers that we need to scale in order to get the maximum profit of 21,000.

133
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:15,920
So even if you have more variables, then you will be drawing these in higher dimensions.

134
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:24,400
So we can imagine what would happen in three dimensions in June and in space in three dimensional space.

135
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:32,670
More than that, we can not have that graphical intuition, but is pretty much the same we are going to have.

136
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:40,700
We are going to form an and a figure of this type.

137
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:46,880
And so we call this column things either only in high dimensions.

138
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:57,170
And the the solutions of a linear program will always you see that you can we can have

139
00:20:57,170 --> 00:21:02,690
solutions some of these medium program inside the feasible medium because we can keep pushing,

140
00:21:02,690 --> 00:21:09,169
pushing, pushing in one direction until we touch the last point of the physical renewal.

141
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:17,410
So most of the time, you know, what we are going to find is that these solutions are in the corner point.

142
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,800
So the feasible right. Only in very,

143
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:30,200
very special cases when the grace of the objective function is parallel to one of

144
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:35,450
these constraints is that when we use to launch the last point of the feasible region,

145
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:42,469
you know, your life. So although that time you know you're going to be coaching one of these corner

146
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:51,500
points or these or do these or these because because your your objective function,

147
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:59,780
the duration of the active function is not likely to coincide with precisely with one of the constraints.

148
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:11,600
So you can when you push it into one direction, you are going to find and you reach a an optimal point at one single point,

149
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:18,040
which is a corner point of the feasible over because of that of the nature of these problems.

150
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:27,860
Right. So all these problems would generate the feasible region in two, three, four or five or whatever dimensions.

151
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:40,160
And it looks like this and they are like plains or high hyper plains intersecting and they are all interesting and and that they are,

152
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:46,760
they have vertex and very pieces that are just they wouldn't call the coordinate points of the feasible region.

153
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:51,530
And if you push a directional optimization, you're going to reach out.

154
00:22:51,980 --> 00:23:05,420
And so what is the insight that that we we have here is that they if we want to know what is the optimal point,

155
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:14,150
then we just need to check those corner points that are finite and figured out which one is the best.

156
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,610
Okay. There's an algorithm called the simplex algorithm that that's what we got.

157
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:29,089
So you you bring your and your problem and the simplex algorithm just figured out what the feasible reunion is.

158
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:35,320
And they go to one point improving from the point of view.

159
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:45,860
And he says, Yeah, we found a solution because corner points are finite, being is not going to be, you know, looking forever.

160
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,940
So he's going to he's going now find a solution.

161
00:23:50,450 --> 00:24:03,260
Sometimes very rare cases will say this is optimal and this is optimized for the case of the objective function is really part of this constraint.

162
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:11,180
And if you have two corner points that are optimal, anything in between will be optimal.

163
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,620
In this case, we we we said that we have multiple optimal solution.

164
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:21,950
So this is the insight I wanted to give you in the solutions of linear program.

165
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:34,520
But now how do we solve this? We are not going to be solving these solved in time, graphically, book, graphically, in solving a problem graph.

166
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:40,669
And so you will give your wish and what it is doing when you are dealing with higher or higher

167
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:52,310
order problem like this that we are going to do is we're going to use over and over this.

168
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:57,230
This is what we want to find out. We want to find out, you know,

169
00:24:57,290 --> 00:25:08,569
we want to maximize the total revenue so get by changing the you want on the you do so subject to certain constraints

170
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:16,250
and constraints on the fair amount of resources use must be less than or equal to the amount of resources available.

171
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:22,850
And we have the no negativity constraints that mean to the new one and you don't need it.

172
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:37,879
So let's, let's do that. If we go to data and then solver and then we go in to what we want.

173
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:48,500
We want to maximize what we use, that we want to maximize one to maximize total revenue, which is a 20 year by changing which.

174
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,580
So those are the decision variables, the things that you can control.

175
00:25:53,280 --> 00:26:00,110
And so this is your what you would need to meet and what are the constraints?

176
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:05,059
Well, I can there are three constraints right in the envelope negativity constraint.

177
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:10,730
But I can I can show them in a single swing, one independently.

178
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:17,630
The three sales independently must be live and we want to be three sales.

179
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:29,890
So a lot of people think that. So if if I if I change my schedule, the resources utilized are going to change.

180
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:38,490
But I want to make sure that they remain well-aware that the number of resources available

181
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,350
this is the number of resources that I'm using is I think is certainly an escape.

182
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:49,680
So I think I'll leave this in check.

183
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,750
This is a non negativity constraint.

184
00:26:51,750 --> 00:27:03,810
That means that the new ones and I'm not going to the negative side and and very important if you want this to be so efficiently,

185
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,470
we go into, you know,

186
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:13,320
choose the simplex linear programing unit and that's the that's the method that is that

187
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:22,799
recognizes when you have a linear program that is a convex polyhedron that's the physical region.

188
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:35,310
So that means it's like in your metric field here with corner points and all the linear sides and then is going to just pick the best,

189
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,530
the optimal corner point, right?

190
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:47,880
So otherwise it's going to be you're searching inside of all the reasons until we just get tired and say, here is the best I could do.

191
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:51,760
And so it's more of an approximation method.

192
00:27:51,980 --> 00:28:05,340
You know, we can do that for nonlinear Perl programs, but we we know that we can solve linear problems like these.

193
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,780
Exactly. Just figuring out what is the optimal solution.

194
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:21,660
So when we have that, you know, so and I have 54 and 1254 and 12 eight optimal number of new ones that we have,

195
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:32,340
which is actually telling me here that I am going to be making $21,000 by scaling these on YouTube.

196
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:40,920
And I'm using all the inpatient days, all the nursing hours about the diagnostic procedures, and I have no use in normal.

197
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,309
So if someone gave me more diagnostic procedures,

198
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:56,880
I would say now someone tells me I can make available to you more typos in procedure means it's not worth anything to me because I am already out.

199
00:28:57,210 --> 00:29:00,510
You know, I left off and I'm not using them.

200
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:04,140
So giving me more is not going to increase.

201
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:16,850
My might mean I won't be able to cure anything more because I'm using all the patient data and working hours that I have,

202
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,700
so I cannot make another way.

203
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,479
So I have an I have more than I need now is someone tells me, oh,

204
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:40,639
I can give you more nursing hours or I can be one for each day, more invasion days and let you do that.

205
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:49,060
You can use them. They may profit my you know, my my goal, but definitely not in prison.

206
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:50,990
All right.

207
00:29:51,980 --> 00:30:04,920
So from now on, just remember, you know how to use the graphing calculator, because my money asked you to solve a problem like that with a calculator.

208
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:16,610
Wish we should do it now. In practical terms, we are not going to use a graphing calculator because this is just a problem with two variables.

209
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:22,280
And we had a, you know, problems of any significance.

210
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,790
You usually have two variables.

211
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:34,790
So what I would like to do now is let me ask you first if you have any questions about.

212
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:55,030
Once. Think twice. Right. So I'm going to start solving your next home assignment, which is about linear programs.

213
00:30:55,910 --> 00:31:03,810
I'm going to save this. And.

214
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:29,730
The simple. Now that I can close the eyes and I don't need these desk anymore.

215
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:41,340
What I would like for you to download it to assignments and.

216
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,550
Homework number eight. So we have three problems that are due next week.

217
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:56,060
And I would like for us right now to solve problem three three.

218
00:31:56,910 --> 00:32:05,760
And I am going to download from the movie three and.

219
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:15,150
The. Opening and.

220
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:34,040
Leslie Mann is toward love these words but doomed to wait and cholesterol all she has decided she will certainly search carefully.

221
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,960
There are two possible disorders that she's considering, the snack bars and ice cream.

222
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,850
After reading the nutrition labels of the snack bar and ice cream packages,

223
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:51,380
she learned that each serving snack bar with 37 grams and contains 120 calories and five grams of fat.

224
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:58,520
Each serving of ice cream weighs 65 grams and contained 160 calories.

225
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:09,650
Ten grams of fat. Maggie will allow herself no more than 450 calories and 25 grams of fat in her daily dessert.

226
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:15,650
But because she loved this search so much, she requires at least 120 grams of these serve per day.

227
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:23,630
Also, she has signs and dates index to each of the needs shared, whereas zero is the lowest, any hundred is the highest.

228
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:28,190
She has signs and paste index of 95.3.

229
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:35,450
My 95 two is not pass because she prefers ice cream to this number and no sole use over to find

230
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:40,609
the daily dessert plan that stays within their constraints and maximizes the total thinks.

231
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:50,270
Index of only seven confirm graphically that this solution from part maximizes Maggie's total this evening and then finally

232
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:59,090
use it one way silver table to see how the optimal dessert plan varies with the calories per hour and ice cream vary.

233
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:08,359
Let the former vary from 80 to 200 increments of ten and let the latter vary for 100 to 300 in increments of ten.

234
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:26,570
So have things to do list this actually first going to this model the template and that I, I have for you what we are going to do is get,

235
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:36,980
you know, populate these template and we are going to start by revealing the data that we have.

236
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:41,540
So let me ask you these very quickly.

237
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,469
What is that we want to do in this problem?

238
00:34:45,470 --> 00:35:04,140
What is that we are what is our goal? We want to minimize, want or maximize, maximize the taste index based index obtained by changing one.

239
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,280
What can I change in this problem?

240
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:17,260
To change the taste in the number of snack bar and on screen the servings per day of the snack bars and ice cream.

241
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:21,840
Right. And so let's do that.

242
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:26,800
So we need to we have some server constraints that we need to figure out.

243
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:36,850
So what is the number of calories? Is that by 28, 21, 21, 23?

244
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:44,450
And the number of calories in the ice cream? One 6168.

245
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,670
So those are ingredients for serving of each dessert.

246
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:54,700
So any every serving of that bar, give me 120 calories.

247
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,490
And every serving as a cream of ice cream is 160.

248
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:06,110
How many? Five grams. Grams of fat per serving of snack bar.

249
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:14,900
Right. And ice cream and that.

250
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:26,629
And so is this is data. So I usually like to make this so blue or green.

251
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:38,640
So. So just to make sure I remember that this is this was information given to me.

252
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:43,050
All right. So the cell mate.

253
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:47,580
What about the grams per serving for this number?

254
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:52,560
37. 37 grams per serving.

255
00:36:53,100 --> 00:37:03,750
And ice cream. 65. And same thing right now.

256
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:10,530
The taste index of each dessert to 100 point scale per gram.

257
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:18,060
So there's not 195, 85 and ice cream.

258
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:23,730
85. 85 is. You see me?

259
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:29,070
No, no. The other way around is 85. He likes to.

260
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:41,349
You're drinking beer. Okay.

261
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:45,340
So this is you know, this is what we have.

262
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:51,630
And what we need to find out is the servings per day of is that our ice cream?

263
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,700
Right. So these are going to be my decision variables.

264
00:37:54,700 --> 00:38:02,349
So I need to decide on that. And I usually that's my preference, but it doesn't have to be.

265
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:10,840
You're putting you know, I highlight the decision is with the yellow with a yellow background.

266
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:16,839
Okay. So now we also have constraints, right?

267
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:29,800
So how many calories the as Maggie allows herself of is of dessert and how many grams of fat?

268
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:35,290
So I know that because she likes.

269
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:41,140
She likes this word a lot. She needs to.

270
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:47,270
She wants to consume more than more than how many calories.

271
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:55,390
At least. So let's say.

272
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:14,600
England traditionally ruled. Oh.

273
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:23,990
Okay. So no, Maggie will allow herself no more than 450 calories and 25 grams of fat in their daily dessert.

274
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:29,900
But she required at least 120 grams of use there.

275
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:39,380
So it has to be less than 450 calories and less than 25 grams of fat for less than 450.

276
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:44,900
So this is less than 4015.

277
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,840
And this is less than how many grams of fat.

278
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:57,400
Maximum 25. Belly fat.

279
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:05,810
And those are of course, those are also.

280
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:17,180
Ebert Right. So so I get into what else constrains on the total grams of these per day.

281
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:29,910
I know that she requires more than. In 2018 when more than 120 grams of these are made.

282
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:50,590
And they. They think this is the year.

283
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:57,160
So what, what what we want to do now, we're going to do two things.

284
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:05,860
The first thing we're going to do is let's say that I'm going to make a number of servings per day.

285
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:14,979
Right. So let's say that, Maggie, get three servings of snack bar and two servings of ice cream.

286
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:22,030
And fractional servings is is is that is there modeling?

287
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:30,200
Right. So you can say can have a half of a serving little snack bar, one quarter of a servings of ice cream.

288
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:34,630
You just chop it up. Just infinitely, infinitely divided.

289
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,610
So the snack bar and you can leave chocolate and give it to your friend beverage.

290
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:49,460
I think you. When people see one bleep.

291
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:58,680
Oh, so what what I'm going to do is based on the the information that I have here,

292
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:13,680
if I if I have if I called 93 is nine times and the three servings of the snack bar, two servings of ice cream, how many calories?

293
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:18,840
How many five grams and how many grams of oz?

294
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,310
How many how many grams of fat and how many grams of research is consumed?

295
00:42:24,330 --> 00:42:34,920
Let's get that. How many calories? Well, 40 calories is going to be we have calories per serving.

296
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,400
Right. And we have this servings per day.

297
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:48,390
So if I eat some rather big calories per serving for this not far and the ice cream is servings per day of this bar and ice cream,

298
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:55,320
then I get the total number of calories. Right. So this is going to be some problem.

299
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,470
Before I do that for me, make sure that.

300
00:43:18,910 --> 00:43:25,840
I can't I don't want to wrap the text, though, so we can show the Formula One line.

301
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:32,200
Okay. So this is going to be as if we're saying equal to this sum problem.

302
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,660
I need to do these things to prove that.

303
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:54,060
I need to get that right now.

304
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:59,500
Let's get back to some problem.

305
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:15,680
Open parentheses, and then I'm going to have the snack bars and I'm going to get it nonpartisan in this case, and I'm going to lock this.

306
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:22,800
And I made my decision to make the servings per day.

307
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:25,769
I'm going to look that way. This is invading the set.

308
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:38,940
And when a multiply that times the calories versus not by adding calories or so now if I consume three, if my consumed three snack bars,

309
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:49,169
three servings of the snack bars and two servings of ice cream cheese, ingesting 640 is either an 80 calories, which is more than what you showed.

310
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:53,520
So that is not feasible. What about the grams of fat?

311
00:44:54,030 --> 00:45:02,840
Well, this is going to be the same thing and going to multiply the grams of fat versus is that bar in ice cream servings time,

312
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:11,580
the number of servings per day. So it's going to be they want some of these two versions of these.

313
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:24,719
These are all in the pros. You simply want to copy that formula because I love the total number of servings per day.

314
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,350
And if I drank, the formula down is going to take the fat intake.

315
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:38,189
If the information and it's reading right. That this is a variable.

316
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:43,200
So you have ingredients consumed 35 grams of fat.

317
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,780
It is more than we can do.

318
00:45:46,440 --> 00:46:01,679
If you think about the the total constraint on the total grams of these serve per day, well then see in total grams of these layers are per day.

319
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:11,249
So the servings per day is three and two and then the grams per serving are 37 and 65.

320
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:28,860
Right, 37 and 65. So if I multiply these times the grams per serving, then as you will say so again the formula because this is,

321
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,500
you know, it doesn't follow the same pattern, right? It's skipping one.

322
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:47,060
So I'm going to turn this into some problem. And now I don't have to lock anything.

323
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:54,390
He was able to bring the populace from the Times to France.

324
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:09,390
Certain. So now the Grahams consumed would be 241, which is more than 120 would what she wanted.

325
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:15,000
Let me get a convention.

326
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:18,150
Whatever you want. But we need to get these.

327
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:33,480
Some of them call for calculations. You can use any of that information right now.

328
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,280
The last thing they need to do is get their total base in.

329
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:54,630
Right. So if my guy has three and some three servings of snack bars and two servings of ice cream, what is going to be that?

330
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:12,110
They see this out of the way. How do we do that? So I should multiply that times one the taste index.

331
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:20,690
Remember that, you know, these are servings per day and the taste index is per round.

332
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:32,210
Right. So what we need to do first is you're right, we need to take the servings per day and take that into their diet into grams.

333
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:38,090
Right. And then after that, then we multiply that times the basically.

334
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:41,930
So. So he's going to be kind of a double some brother.

335
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:56,990
So what I would like to do is multiply these three times two grams per servings times a day, the days in this index per gram.

336
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:02,510
I'm the same and same here. The number of servings per day.

337
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:13,580
Times. Four servings times. Then they taste index of ice cream for the program.

338
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:20,310
So we can do that. Nine. Using is some problem.

339
00:49:23,850 --> 00:49:38,790
And, you know, when I started it down sometimes and I mean these B and C then lengthens the phase, it makes the surface pretty.

340
00:49:41,450 --> 00:49:43,250
So we send double some blood.

341
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:55,160
So it's going to be the first, you know, each one of those, a corresponding entry in the programs are going to be multiplied.

342
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:05,240
The first one in very strange times, the first one in the second reading time difference in the first one is in the third range.

343
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:11,670
And then we're going to be the same thing with the second landing at all those problems.

344
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:20,600
So and then we have the taste index in this case is going to be 21,725.

345
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:35,700
So things are going to put the cells and coma and have a special column to get the information.

346
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,440
Maybe green and maybe.

347
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:47,950
Bond and they will because those are important components to on.

348
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:53,170
And now we're ready to solve. Right. So what we need to do,

349
00:50:53,200 --> 00:51:02,790
we want to maximize the total banks in this by changing the is not the number of snack bar servings per day and ice cream servings per day,

350
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:08,740
subject to the constraints that the ingredients consume calories.

351
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:19,500
And the number of calories and fat consumed has to be more than what is allowed, and the grams of the certain consumed has to be at least one point.

352
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:24,370
Okay, so that's my money. Those are my constraints.

353
00:51:24,930 --> 00:51:28,960
And so going back and going to data,

354
00:51:31,230 --> 00:51:46,480
so we're going to want to summarize and maximize what this means in total pay in next hour by changing which

355
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:53,710
variables that I'm going to change the servings per day of snack bars and the service birthday ice cream,

356
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:04,030
some due to the constraints that the ingredients consume as we refer to the ingredients around.

357
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:07,059
And then I'm going to add one more constraint.

358
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:22,630
This thing grams of these serve consume has to be it has to be at least the supply and say it's okay we're fun thing.

359
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:31,650
Two things we need to do make sure that we have the non negativity constraints because we don't have negative values of is that bars and.

360
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:44,360
There is that bias over polar ice cream and change these tools in your program.

361
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:53,600
That's important because you realize it's going to try to solve it with an approximate method that is going to be inside the feasible region.

362
00:52:54,410 --> 00:52:57,490
And he's going to find a solution because this is an easy problem.

363
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:02,090
But in general, you may not. So let's solve.

364
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:10,430
In the end, what we have is the total things that the maximum is going to be 15,509.

365
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:24,679
That's not that this the best possible taste the community that will produce more satisfaction in terms of the pace for her given the constraints.

366
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:40,219
Right. So she is consuming 450 calories will be grams of fat that he's allowed to and she's consuming more than one.

367
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:43,870
20 grams will be served from 68 and ten.

368
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:53,299
And the solution is one and a quarter servings of this nut bars.

369
00:53:53,300 --> 00:54:02,560
And you only do 1.9 servings of ice cream, basically five.

370
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:07,970
Just make sure. His son.

371
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:18,920
So actually CC is if you take C 1.8754, multiply times a little grams, right?

372
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:25,040
So you know what? How many grams of ice cream you are going to need later?

373
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:33,440
All right. So okay, so we you know, we solve that Maggie's problem.

374
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:41,210
Now, what we need to do, and I would like you to do that weekly is so that graphically.

375
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:59,290
So we've got two dance moves and, you know, see if you can get this eight, 15 or nine, 15, five or nine and 125 on 1.8, seven five.

376
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:09,640
So this is your second old firm graphically that this allusion from before from part A maximizes my total space in and.

377
00:55:13,050 --> 00:55:19,230
The very time that they present to police or go to the traffic meter because want.

378
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:43,800
By the way, this is a very kind of.

379
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:56,640
It's it's not a trivial example. You know is looks like fun to those that were on ice cream.

380
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:00,960
But you know this is the root of this problem,

381
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:10,020
you know has to do with one of the first application of linear program is is finding the optimal

382
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:26,340
diet for the it was that there had been several attempts to use the daily prices of some food items

383
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:42,060
and have and that requirements of proteins and carbs so maximal they're meaning an irony and I

384
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:48,870
mean they said that about eating each one of the ingredients and putting together an optimal diet.

385
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:59,909
So minimize the cost of a diet. And as have these five they they do have constraints that is actually something that

386
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:10,920
is done with canned food because they tend to look like they want your own taste.

387
00:57:10,990 --> 00:57:15,890
They want something based on and that is good.

388
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:20,490
But what happens in humans is when they develop,

389
00:57:20,890 --> 00:57:28,920
they have to put a lot of constraints or account to account for based on variety because sometimes they got some,

390
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:37,820
you know, some solutions like flour to be paid or something.

391
00:57:37,830 --> 00:57:44,700
They have all these ingredients in the nutritional foods.

392
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:53,070
Three other being, you know, mean they look at it unconstrained but it was not edible.

393
00:57:54,270 --> 00:58:07,170
But you know in in in hospitals and health systems became more sophisticated and groaning under, you know,

394
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:18,930
these kinds of problems and trying to get an optimal diet in sort of in case in case it's not,

395
00:58:19,290 --> 00:58:25,380
you know, it actually works better when we're talking about in large, large number of people.

396
00:58:25,470 --> 00:58:29,270
You save a lot of money doing that with.

397
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,500
This is a small number.

398
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:49,230
I would, if you can save you, thousands may not be important, but we're talking about creating a diet for an Indian population.

399
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:56,980
And so that takes you makes an impact.

400
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:06,580
No, that's crazy. Yes.

401
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:15,360
Right. So. She got this.

402
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:27,020
So. Let's go to Des Moines.

403
00:59:42,220 --> 01:00:12,340
Okay, look. Okay.

404
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:17,550
So let's let's see what we have in.

405
01:00:24,510 --> 01:00:29,580
Bruce is a strain is one.

406
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:46,820
When the x plus one sees the Y which is less than or equal to 4120 464 5140.

407
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:53,630
Is when we need X.

408
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:05,740
What used to be one of these?

409
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:12,580
It was 1 to 1.

410
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:16,590
One to me.

411
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:23,040
My first one. The second one mentioned the.

412
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:38,160
Five and. 25 side explosion ny less than an equal to 25 in the.

413
01:01:40,010 --> 01:01:49,940
€5 in one i 10 to 25.

414
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:55,920
We didn't see.

415
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:06,640
We have these. These are a region right now that see that everyone.

416
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:24,410
The third one will be many grams per serving and servings per day 37 and 37.

417
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:31,760
65. 137, 65, 20.

418
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:51,090
37/8. To those who I work with under the quota model and what we do that we.

419
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:58,440
Hey, you know what?

420
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:06,300
Interesting cause is greater than the last one.

421
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:12,470
Less than two. So the official origin is going to be ring.

422
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:29,660
Now let's take a look and see whether we know what if this this is this is not the objective function to do function.

423
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:43,390
It is said you need to multiply now 37 and 83.

424
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:52,140
So that's going to be the coefficient of x and that is 74 degrees.

425
01:03:55,970 --> 01:04:01,140
That's the inscription. Thanks.

426
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:20,280
And movie. He should apply to be 65 times 35, 65, 85, 61, 75.

427
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:39,320
3140 560 issue.

428
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:47,310
So. This is going to be.

429
01:04:48,010 --> 01:04:51,660
Let's get another win. One.

430
01:04:52,990 --> 01:05:10,150
45 x 6175 Y is equal to z and then less and is neither too.

431
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:18,570
I think you've a typo on your red line. It's supposed to be 65 instead of 2506.

432
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:22,930
If I had this one, the red one or this one.

433
01:05:23,230 --> 01:05:26,510
65. Yeah. Sorry. Thank you.

434
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:32,500
You. Yeah.

435
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:37,450
And then how did you get to the 31, 45 and 61?

436
01:05:39,130 --> 01:05:42,670
Yes. So in order to.

437
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:56,570
Seems like so. So remember that we are multiplying.

438
01:05:57,350 --> 01:06:01,970
This is X, right? And this is. I'm sorry. This is X and this is why.

439
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:13,520
Right. In order to get the objective function, we multiply the grounds four servings times the whose name is not by our index.

440
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:18,110
Right. And then times the number of the number.

441
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:23,840
Right. So, therefore, efficient of these eggs is 37 times 85.

442
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:29,480
Yes. And the position of the Y is 65 times 95.

443
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:45,320
And this what I have here, 57 times 37 times 35 is 31, 45 and 65 times 35 is 61/7.

444
01:06:51,310 --> 01:07:01,640
Sitting. All right.

445
01:07:01,910 --> 01:07:11,270
And now we have this line here that that give me the trace of an empty function.

446
01:07:11,270 --> 01:07:14,990
That is zero. Right. So let's go from.

447
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:24,410
When it was there, the taste index that we got for her, the maximum.

448
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:29,740
13,000 something. 15,000.

449
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:36,370
Let's go from 0 to 20000. 0 to 20000.

450
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:51,510
Is that one? Then we're going to start moving news stories of the country.

451
01:07:52,500 --> 01:08:03,310
We now are in this region where we seem to be at odds here.

452
01:08:05,980 --> 01:08:09,950
And. So that point is.

453
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:16,130
One 2581 1.251.875.

454
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:25,090
So this is what we wanted to see.

455
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:37,750
And then 11.25, 1.875 and 15,426.

456
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:47,320
The. 15,500 money close to where they need to move the.

457
01:08:51,510 --> 01:08:58,800
Usually what you do with graphical analysis is go to the point that you know, is going to be and then calculate.

458
01:09:01,160 --> 01:09:05,830
Things. That's.

459
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:25,710
And then you go. That's perfect.

460
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:29,190
And then on that line, on that on that point.

461
01:09:29,460 --> 01:09:39,420
Right. So we push we push the trace of the negative function until the last point of the visible region.

462
01:09:40,530 --> 01:09:45,059
If you see that it's almost parallel to this constraint,

463
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:55,560
but not quite you see that the new line is a little bit above the the the side of the feasible region.

464
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:00,750
Right. Well, that's the last point that is feasible.

465
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:13,689
So we corroborated that what we got analytically and then we graphically corroborated that when we got analytically.

466
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:32,260
So the best solution is going to be 1.5 snack bars, 1.75 ice cream, servings of ice cream for a total taste index of 15,000 children.

467
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:46,630
Now, a. Another interesting question that we're going to keep exploring next Thursday,

468
01:10:46,640 --> 01:10:52,690
we're going to start today is what happens is some of these parameters change.

469
01:10:53,140 --> 01:11:04,180
So what happens is the transfer fad of ice creams, they change a little bit over the the pace in the changes.

470
01:11:04,180 --> 01:11:13,900
And so we're not sure about that. So in essence, if we are not sure of the parameters, that parameters are allowed to change a little bit,

471
01:11:14,650 --> 01:11:20,170
how it is going to affect our solution, how is that going to affect our decision?

472
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:33,610
So usually what you do in these days with computer computations on Cube is that you use to change the numbers.

473
01:11:33,610 --> 01:11:40,930
And so if you get it right, but if the problem is that you if you have to try a lot of parameters,

474
01:11:41,890 --> 01:11:49,170
then it can be cumbersome just to change your number and and running and changing over and grinding in is.

475
01:11:49,450 --> 01:11:53,169
So we use some programs that would do that for me.

476
01:11:53,170 --> 01:12:04,420
So I would go and kind of plot what would be the sensitivity of certain parameters to what the

477
01:12:04,420 --> 01:12:09,900
sensitivity of this solution that we have to certainty and the variability of around three.

478
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:19,600
So we are. We are going to.

479
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:42,070
So we need to see we're going to use a two way silver table to see how the optimal dessert plan varies with the calorie perspective.

480
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:53,740
And it's been very late day for me vary very 80 to 200 in increments of and a little later varied from 120 to 300 in increments of ten.

481
01:12:54,100 --> 01:13:06,070
So we are going to when I use a program, a macro solver table, do not confuse solver table with solver.

482
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:14,830
Solver is the election routine that comes with the Excel Solver table is an app

483
01:13:14,830 --> 01:13:23,970
in a macro that we can use to perform sensitivity analysis for linear programing

484
01:13:23,980 --> 01:13:36,070
solution that we obtain from sober and so solver table is a program that is more

485
01:13:36,310 --> 01:13:42,190
directly to the class that we are doing is developed for sensitivity analysis,

486
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:47,709
linear program and what it does is takes that solver.

487
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:55,570
And so a lot of linear programing with the parameters that we say that we know how to run solver take.

488
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:02,920
So let's go to the.

489
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:14,280
Homework number eight and I have here silver table for windows and silver table for Max.

490
01:14:15,000 --> 01:14:25,430
And so because right now everybody has silver and everybody has either people with Max have silver, people with silver.

491
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:36,450
You can run with all these linear programing models without having to go through the roasting people that if you were to be roasted for a lamp,

492
01:14:36,450 --> 01:14:39,840
that's perfectly fine. So the table is already installed there.

493
01:14:40,710 --> 01:14:53,350
If you are running that on your max in your laptop or your windows machine, then you need to download either a silver table for windows,

494
01:14:53,350 --> 01:15:01,830
but the silver table for Max and those are and in, for example, do the silver and table for a window.

495
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:19,379
So when to download is in and right now is in the showing folder is is on the download so you can leave it there and then downloads.

496
01:15:19,380 --> 01:15:32,160
I'm going to put it then cut these and move it to it can be 6054 silver that I have this done of these

497
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:41,250
computer games so that's silver and they do not double click on that because it's not going to do anything.

498
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:50,430
So what you need to do now is in Excel for Excel.

499
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,300
Then you see there's no silver in table here. Right?

500
01:15:54,660 --> 01:15:58,920
So we are going to we need to loading into Excel.

501
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:05,650
So I'm going to go to file. Then mob shoes.

502
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:20,350
An ad is. Then go on to their silver table.

503
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:27,650
So what you should do is you.

504
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:31,690
Now, I know. That's all right. So what you should do.

505
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,360
You don't have any silver table. Right.

506
01:16:34,610 --> 01:16:46,270
So you've got to browse and then go to the place where you downloaded or or or place or in this case, the desktop.

507
01:16:46,990 --> 01:16:52,210
It can be 62, 54. Now you can open silver, silver.

508
01:16:53,320 --> 01:17:00,550
And then when you do that, then it's going to be installed in your bar as part of your API in Excel.

509
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:12,730
Okay. And then I also, if I have precision certain I don't want to be able to pay Microsoft this time interest based.

510
01:17:13,180 --> 01:17:18,580
And now you have silver table and in silver table.

511
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:28,210
Then we are going to create a two way table that is going to change certain around interest rate.

512
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:39,730
So you already have the normal you can click on the silver table.

513
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:50,050
Who knows? They probably need to do to be more more forceful and say, run this man.

514
01:17:51,200 --> 01:18:06,400
So. You argue that next time, but for you that you also weren't able to run.

515
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:12,820
So I need to I need to do that for these computers or allow that.

516
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:20,470
So being able to run this, Michael, then is going to present the menu where we can change some parameter.

517
01:18:20,650 --> 01:18:25,370
That's how we were going to start. There's a lot.

518
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:35,610
So you get through this. Like so.

519
01:18:37,780 --> 01:18:43,270
When we were building, when we actually did anything besides this building.

520
01:18:43,930 --> 01:18:47,170
One of the these really in particular,

521
01:18:47,470 --> 01:19:00,790
one of the early signs was to put two screens here and then one here moved here and the projector, which is still the same.

522
01:19:01,210 --> 01:19:07,230
But, you know, it was they were trying to cut costs and then they really didn't want.

523
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:16,030
So every year, I, you know, I try to convince new billboards to protest.

524
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:25,960
And even I've been trying for years to get the dean's office to put another screen there.

525
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:32,200
And, you know, if you can think that, that would be great.

526
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:39,730
But if I would do, I'll do my my shirt at we have three screens.

527
01:19:39,760 --> 01:19:52,230
I know, I know. This is so great and feel so kind of left over.

528
01:19:55,070 --> 01:20:02,360
And so this they said, you know how that sort of thing runs at this place.

529
01:20:04,610 --> 01:20:12,390
I feel very well by searching out your.

530
01:20:14,270 --> 01:20:20,100
No, no, no, no.

531
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:31,690
Thank you for your time.

532
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:49,720
Yes. People like you and all of you will give your heart, whether it's through the credit.

533
01:20:49,870 --> 01:20:55,240
I think, again, we're going to. Yeah, we're going to take that.

534
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:58,980
Okay. Okay. What is it, Jamie?

535
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:11,460
Let me do it right now. It was beautiful because there's a meditation that's 500 watt information.

536
01:21:11,470 --> 01:21:18,970
And if you want to see the movements.

537
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:40,250
The. So I'm you at least that these you don't know who it is really me.

538
01:21:40,650 --> 01:21:48,540
And I will do that with a whole other group.

539
01:21:48,650 --> 01:21:54,540
Or because you do have to show that.

540
01:21:55,590 --> 01:21:58,670
Yeah. You have to create something out.

541
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:04,530
Do it just so you can.

542
01:22:04,540 --> 01:22:08,510
You can say just cause they have to go to trial.

543
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:22,130
I need to come up with something. This I tried to say, Oh, come on, let me tell you how sorry I am, which is,

544
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:30,629
you know, or you seem to think that they can only be we of be in this green.

545
01:22:30,630 --> 01:22:39,570
I just want you to look at this piece of art.

546
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:48,280
And I was like, Oh.
