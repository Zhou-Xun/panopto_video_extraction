1
00:00:00,265 --> 00:00:06,795
So in this segment, we're going to talk about using our five senses mindfully.

2
00:00:06,795 --> 00:00:16,405
And we're going to talk about how you can use it, kind of in a meditation or mindfulness practice that can be coming and grounding.

3
00:00:16,405 --> 00:00:24,795
We're also going to talk a little bit about how you can use it as a tool kit going forward for self-care and coping.

4
00:00:24,795 --> 00:00:32,275
If you're having a moment where, let's say you've been preparing for a speech for a long time or just kind of stressed,

5
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:39,645
it can be a good time to just kind of get back in the moment to be, like I kind of said, restarting your computer just kind of shaking things off,

6
00:00:39,645 --> 00:00:45,265
getting loose, and starting again. So this can be a good way to do that.

7
00:00:45,265 --> 00:00:49,205
And just like a breath is a good way to get in the moment,

8
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:53,885
checking in with our 5 senses is a really good way to get in the moment. So

9
00:00:53,885 --> 00:01:00,075
a way that you can do this is, to just pick one of your senses to start with.

10
00:01:00,075 --> 00:01:07,675
So touch, so right now where I'm at, I can feel the carpet under my feet.

11
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:16,075
I can feel the chair, which is kind of soft and cushy when I touch it with my hands, it's got a little bit of texture to

12
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:22,325
the fabric that's on the chair. And I can feel the chair behind me,

13
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:26,315
I can kind of push up against it and feel what that feels like.

14
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:35,125
I can also feel my clothes and they're pretty comfy, so I can move a little bit and just notice what my body feels like in the moment.

15
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:39,805
So you can start with this, and kind of just pick maybe five things that you notice.

16
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:47,735
And sometimes the more specific that you are, it's going to bring your mind away from all the busyness that it's doing and really bring it into the moment.

17
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:56,605
So, for example, next, I'll use sight. In the room that I'm in, the walls are kind of beige,

18
00:01:56,605 --> 00:02:00,655
and I can notice a couple of places where I put and nail in the wall

19
00:02:00,655 --> 00:02:06,895
and took it out. The ceiling is white and lighter.

20
00:02:06,895 --> 00:02:12,345
And while the walls look smooth, they have just a little bit of texture to them.

21
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:17,395
Behind me, I can see the white planters.

22
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:25,155
with, that are kind of geometric with the gold trim, and the succulents in them.

23
00:02:25,155 --> 00:02:31,375
And I also have blue curtains, and outside there's a green tree.

24
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:38,325
It's kind of a cloudy day. All of those things brought me into my visual sense,

25
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,135
and where right here around me.

26
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:50,155
But getting specific kind of helps when I switch the channel of our brain and bring it into the present moment, the more specific you are usually helps.

27
00:02:50,155 --> 00:02:58,755
Sounds. There's not a lot of sound in here, I have a fan on.

28
00:02:58,755 --> 00:03:07,495
Sometimes with this one, we have to pause and be quiet for a moment, because you start to hear things that you didn't hear before.

29
00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:12,535
I think for right now in my room, it's mostly the fan. But I'm just bringing curiosity to the moment.

30
00:03:12,535 --> 00:03:16,525
So even if there's nothing that we pick up on, that's information, too.

31
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:27,845
Sometimes quiet can be a very lonely sound. Smell.

32
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:33,275
I'm not particularly noticing anything there. You might in your house if something's cooking.

33
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:38,465
Or if there's like, if you have essential oils or some kind of fragrance in the room.

34
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:43,955
Well, I did actually notice is that my mind actually went back to feel.

35
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:56,225
And I noticed the temperature in the room, it's a little bit warm. And then lastly, we're going to check in with taste. Now,

36
00:03:56,225 --> 00:04:01,245
if you don't have anything actually to eat or that you've eaten recently,

37
00:04:01,245 --> 00:04:08,705
hopefully you're not picking up on, like, old onions and garlic or anything like that. Sometimes we just notice what our mouth feels like.

38
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:16,585
Do you need water? Or you can often be a nice thing to just take a sip of water,

39
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:22,105
notice the temperature of it and what it feels like going down our throat. Tea.

40
00:04:22,105 --> 00:04:28,135
Something like that. The other thing, and we'll kind of get more into this when we talk about our tool kit is that sometimes you can

41
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:35,785
introduce something like a mint, or a caramel, or dark chocolate, or like a spoonful of sorbet,

42
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:44,975
and really just slow down and savor it and notice all of the different flavors. That can be a really fun way to destress.

43
00:04:44,975 --> 00:04:52,865
So if you were trying to fall asleep and we're having a difficult time doing that, just keep kind of going back through the senses.

44
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:57,715
Don't worry about, some people go by each sense and they come up with three things.

45
00:04:57,715 --> 00:05:05,645
You can kind of just kind of randomly go through them, if you forget one, no big deal. As soon as you don't notice much more, you can shift to a different one.

46
00:05:05,645 --> 00:05:14,345
And again, it just brings our mind into the moment, often helps weed out some of that stuff floating around that's stressing us out and relaxes us.

47
00:05:14,345 --> 00:05:22,805
Now, the way that I want you to think about this as a tool kit, think about with each of your senses,

48
00:05:22,805 --> 00:05:30,965
what are some of your favorite things that kind of can help to calm you, comfort you, energize you?

49
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:38,095
So for a taste for me, that might be coffee, dark chocolate. Those are some of my favorites.

50
00:05:38,095 --> 00:05:41,595
Water can be really good, and kind of refreshing and soothing.

51
00:05:41,595 --> 00:05:49,915
Those are some of my go-tos. So if you write this down somewhere, I would encourage you to, just maybe in your journal.

52
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:58,495
Those might be some things. Gum, like Andy's mints, or Altoids.

53
00:05:58,495 --> 00:06:05,865
Altoids can be like, sometimes we're having anxiety, they can kind of waken the system and shift it out of thinking about whatever the thing is.

54
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:17,695
So sometimes things that have like sour, or really cooling, mentholy, can be nice when we need a little bit of a distraction or a shift.

55
00:06:17,695 --> 00:06:24,235
Smell. Some people really like essential oils, you might find lavender to be comforting.

56
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:28,465
They might find peppermint really calming.

57
00:06:28,465 --> 00:06:39,335
And this may seem strange, but you can literally just keep tea bags or I mean, if you don't have, like, essential oil, a peppermint tea bag in your backpack,

58
00:06:39,335 --> 00:06:43,295
in your desk drawer, just like take a pause. Breathe

59
00:06:43,295 --> 00:06:47,195
in, breathe out, and let that calm. So think about what are some of your favorite

60
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:53,025
smells to kind of calm you down or even energize, so you might add that in to kind of body wash,

61
00:06:53,025 --> 00:06:58,495
and stuff to up self care there. Visual, so sight.

62
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:04,695
What in your room, when you look at it, makes you just feel good?

63
00:07:04,695 --> 00:07:10,025
And that can be a place to kind of just look and breathe in stressful moments.

64
00:07:10,025 --> 00:07:14,615
Also, you may have books, I know I've mentioned Morgan Harper Nichols,

65
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:18,155
she has beautiful artwork that goes with her a lot of her affirmation and poems.

66
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:22,695
I can just flip through there and feel better. Now the window might be that thing,

67
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:30,335
you might want to bring a plant, or poster, or put some affirmations up on the wall that looking at them

68
00:07:30,335 --> 00:07:35,995
makes you feel better. What do you like to hear?

69
00:07:35,995 --> 00:07:39,475
What do you want on your playlist? Some people like white noise, like my fan,

70
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:49,965
that actually helps some people calm down. So you want to think about what are the sounds that calm you down or energize you or cheer you up.

71
00:07:49,965 --> 00:07:56,505
And then what feels good to the touch? So think about this in terms of your blankets,

72
00:07:56,505 --> 00:08:01,435
think about this even in terms of your chair. I have a pillow behind me, because it helps.

73
00:08:01,435 --> 00:08:10,415
But when you are anxious, when you're down, what things feel good?

74
00:08:10,415 --> 00:08:16,015
So kind of come up with what ways moving your body feel good?

75
00:08:16,015 --> 00:08:23,775
Shower, baths, getting your feet in grass, for some people getting their hands into some dirt or something like that,

76
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:28,515
plato, or think it's called thinking putty.

77
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:37,135
People often can like that, because the texture, something that they kind of work their hands on, along with some of the different fidget gadgets, spinners,

78
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:45,495
things like that. So think about this and have around you some of the things

79
00:08:45,495 --> 00:08:50,015
that can help

80
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:57,125
calm you through your senses. The last thing I'll say about this is YouTube is great for

81
00:08:57,125 --> 00:09:03,795
like, if you if you want to Google calm beach front and have it on for three hours.

82
00:09:03,795 --> 00:09:14,055
Fireplace, outdoor camping, river stream. You can put that on in the background as a visual and a sound that is helpful.

83
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:22,055
Also, it can be helpful to think to our own experiences and memories that calm us down or cheer us up.

84
00:09:22,055 --> 00:09:29,495
And if we close our eyes and visualize them and bring in all of the sounds, the smells,

85
00:09:29,495 --> 00:09:36,315
and just for two minutes, go to a calming memory. Or sometimes it can be an imaginary safe space.

86
00:09:36,315 --> 00:09:44,445
But the important thing is that you bring in all of the senses, you bring all of your attention there, you let yourself just be there and breathe.

87
00:09:44,445 --> 00:09:48,445
So think about that. Where would be a place that would be comforting to visualize, that maybe

88
00:09:48,445 --> 00:10:00,135
you've never even been before. Where would be some memories and experiences that would be nice to go back and revisit with all of your five senses?

89
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:03,825
And sometimes what might be nice to just put up on the computer and have in the

90
00:10:03,825 --> 00:10:09,615
background to kind of change what you have in front of you and your senses.

91
00:10:09,615 --> 00:10:14,145
So play with the five senses and start to learn what helps you calm down?

92
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:22,235
What helps you cheer up? What helps you through the moment that you're in?
