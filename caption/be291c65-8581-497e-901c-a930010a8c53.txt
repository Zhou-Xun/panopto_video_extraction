1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:10,262
So, let's talk now about how to think
about communication channel selection for

2
00:00:10,262 --> 00:00:12,650
an example campaign.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,860
And for the purposes of this class,
I'm gonna focus on raising awareness

4
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:21,760
of the health insurance marketplaces
that are now available online.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,520
Now, before we go any further,

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:28,700
let's review the four fundamental
concepts about communications design.

7
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,080
Who's our audience, what's our goals,
what's the core central message,

8
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,860
and what's the narrative, or

9
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,150
the overall structure of what
we're trying to say here.

10
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,450
Now, audience.

11
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:44,680
If we're talking about the health
insurance marketplaces,

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,140
we want to reach a broad range of
the population in the United States.

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,770
In particular, we want to reach those
who don't have good current insurance.

14
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,650
So either they don't have
any insurance at all, or

15
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,100
the insurance they have is less
than ideal for their needs.

16
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,100
But this is gonna cut
across ethnic groups,

17
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,400
geographic regions, gender, all these
other demographic characteristics.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,810
We want to cast this net broadly and
reach as many of these people as we can.

19
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:15,800
Second, what's our goal?

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:24,650
Well, I'm framing this right now as about
increasing awareness of the marketplace.

21
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:29,520
This communication is not about
picking which insurance plan is best.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,750
It's not about any of the issues
about how much it might cost.

23
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,700
It's just an awareness campaign, to
potentially motivate people to go look and

24
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:45,070
potentially take advantage of any options
that are there to get insurance or

25
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,470
better insurance or cheaper insurance.

26
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,560
Now, we may boil those two pieces down.

27
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,030
We might think about our central message
as being something like, you might be able

28
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,560
to get insurance, or better insurance,
if you look at the marketplaces.

29
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,850
And that's the one big takeaway message
that we wanna get across in this campaign.

30
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,890
And if we wanna think about structuring
that in a narrative form, and

31
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:13,430
I'll use the ABT, and
but therefore form here,

32
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:18,650
health insurance is often difficult to
get outside of employer offered policies,

33
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,820
and the options that are available
to people are often quite expensive.

34
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,760
But the health insurance market place
has a variety of affordable options, so

35
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,390
therefore, it might make sense for
people to take a moment and

36
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,740
see if the marketplace
could meet their needs.

37
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:40,230
So, having gone through those four pieces,
now the question becomes,

38
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:43,830
what channels are gonna be appropriate for
this kind of message?

39
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,330
Well, there's a variety
of possible answers, but

40
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:48,550
let me go through a few
of the better ones.

41
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,980
So first, mass media, right?

42
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,450
If we're gonna reach a broad population,
TV spots,

43
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:59,770
radio, web advertising,
things like that are key.

44
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:02,050
And our goal is exposure, right?

45
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,740
Getting as many people as possible
to know about the marketplaces and

46
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:11,200
know that they exist and why they exist.

47
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,990
So a mass media campaign, if the resources
were available, might make a lot of sense.

48
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,750
We also might wanna think about
journalists or news organizations,

49
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,880
especially at particular points in time,
like the time when people have to

50
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:30,820
make new selections of health
insurance plans as newsworthy, right?

51
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,090
This is gonna be something that
a news organization might want to run

52
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:34,750
stories about.

53
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:38,790
And so, reaching out to journalists might
be a very effective way of getting that

54
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:39,630
message out there.

55
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:45,910
I also wanna talk about posters or
billboards or handouts.

56
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,070
It's a very different kind of channel.

57
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,730
It might be appropriate in certain
situations to consider these,

58
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,280
and here's why.

59
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,900
If you think about it,
who are we trying to reach?

60
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,210
We're trying to reach particular types
of people who may not have insurance or

61
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:01,090
are gonna be underinsured.

62
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,490
There are particular locations where
those people are more likely to be.

63
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:07,980
They might be at health clinics or
hospitals,

64
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,860
that predominantly serve uninsured or
underinsured populations.

65
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:17,620
We also might particularly be interested
in employment locations that don't offer

66
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:22,700
insurance, and so as a service to
their employees, they might be

67
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:27,480
interested in making information available
about the health insurance marketplaces.

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:31,790
And in those locations,
putting up a poster or billboard,

69
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,800
etc., might be a particularly effective
way of reaching that population.

70
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,930
But you have to be specific about it,
right?

71
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,860
Because if we pick the wrong locations,
we're just wasting time and money.

72
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:48,327
Specifically, we're failing
that presentation or

73
00:04:48,327 --> 00:04:52,310
attention step from the reception
yielding model, right?

74
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,210
If I never see the billboard or
I'm not gonna pay attention to it

75
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:00,700
at this moment in time,
it was a waste of time and money.

76
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,780
So, while some types of posters or
billboards or

77
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:08,530
handouts might be appropriate
in targeted situations,

78
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:12,230
not all situations would
be appropriate for that.

79
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,000
Now, a critical point here.

80
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,610
This is a push message.

81
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:19,410
We are pushing our information out
to the audience, and they may or

82
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:23,200
may not realize that this
is of interest to them.

83
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,300
We want to raise awareness of the health
insurance marketplace and its options.

84
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:33,280
So our evaluation goal is part knowledge,
we want

85
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,910
them to know that it exists, but more than
anything else, it's probably motivation.

86
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:42,250
Are they motivated to
go to the marketplace,

87
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:48,470
to explore the options that are available
to them about health insurance options?

88
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:54,520
So, I've highlighted some channels that
are probably potentially a good option.

89
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,718
Let's also talk a little bit about some
channels that are probably inappropriate.

90
00:05:57,718 --> 00:06:00,225
One, websites.

91
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:02,290
Wait, what do you mean?

92
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:04,940
The marketplace itself is a website.

93
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,650
Yes, that's true.

94
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,480
But the marketplace itself is
about communicating content,

95
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,800
about helping people choose which plan
might be most appropriate for them.

96
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,210
That's not our communication
goal right now.

97
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,720
Our goal is about that initial
exposure and motivation problem.

98
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,420
And how will people know
to go to the marketplace if

99
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,080
they haven't heard that it's important?

100
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,430
So, I'm not gonna use a website because

101
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:37,210
people won't go to the website unless they
already know that they need to go there.

102
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:43,450
We need to use other kinds of channels
to give people that initial exposure.

103
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:48,050
And then, and only then, might they
go to the marketplace websites and

104
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,390
learn more about what's there.

105
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,200
Furthermore, I think it's important
to note that social media

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,690
usefulness here is gonna
be somewhat limited.

107
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,470
Unless we have people
within the social networks,

108
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:07,809
where there's a substantial number of
people who need to access the health

109
00:07:07,809 --> 00:07:12,690
insurance marketplaces, the hit rate
is gonna be relatively poor, right?

110
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,390
If I'm sharing this in
my social network and

111
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,688
most of the people that I know
already have health insurance,

112
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:25,070
that's not gonna be very effective at
reaching the people we're trying to reach.

113
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:30,920
So again, being aware of our audience,
our goal, and our message,

114
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:35,522
helps us to select the communication
channels that are most likely to succeed.
