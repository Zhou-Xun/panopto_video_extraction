1
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:12,733
In this video, we will shift our focus
from consumers to firms examining

2
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:14,261
the supply side of the market.

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,436
This video contributes to meeting our
learning objectives of describing the key

4
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,927
economic actors and health and

5
00:00:20,927 --> 00:00:23,848
health care,
including their objectives and incentives,

6
00:00:23,848 --> 00:00:28,040
in predicting how economic actors
are likely to respond to incentives.

7
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,813
This will allow us to analyze how
they interact in the pursuit of their

8
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:35,783
objectives and determine how those
interactions influence the cost and

9
00:00:35,783 --> 00:00:38,863
effectiveness of the health care system.

10
00:00:38,863 --> 00:00:43,104
As organizations who purchase a higher
inputs to create a final product for

11
00:00:43,104 --> 00:00:47,440
sale in the market, firms are the key
actors on the supply side.

12
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,656
Like economists assume consumers,
primary objective is to maximize utility,

13
00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:55,261
we assume the firm's primary
objective is to maximize its profits.

14
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:00,855
The firm has a production function which
describes how it's available technology

15
00:01:00,855 --> 00:01:03,761
allows it to transform raw
inputs into a final product.

16
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:08,651
The firm's costs depend on
this production technology,

17
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:13,239
the prices of inputs, like labor,
machinery and raw materials, and

18
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,504
how much output the firm
decides to produce.

19
00:01:16,504 --> 00:01:21,605
Like consumers, optimizing firms
will make decisions at the margin,

20
00:01:21,605 --> 00:01:26,622
firms will seek to expand production
if the last unit is profitable and

21
00:01:26,622 --> 00:01:31,340
shrink production if the last
unit is unprofitable.

22
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:34,940
In this way, firms will respond
to changes in their incentives.

23
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,698
If demand for a product grows,

24
00:01:36,698 --> 00:01:41,028
existing firms get a signal to increase
production and new firms get a signal

25
00:01:41,028 --> 00:01:44,561
to enter the industry due to
expanded profit opportunities.

26
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,573
If input prices or
production technology change,

27
00:01:48,573 --> 00:01:53,344
firms will change the quantity produced in
the mix of inputs hired to reflect the new

28
00:01:53,344 --> 00:01:56,638
levels of productivity and
costs of the various inputs.

29
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:03,211
The supply curve is our primary analytic
tool for the producer side of the market,

30
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:08,139
just like the demand curve reflects
consumers utility maximizing decisions.

31
00:02:08,139 --> 00:02:12,153
The supply curve reflects how the firm's
profit maximizing choices change as

32
00:02:12,153 --> 00:02:13,261
incentives change.

33
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,481
Like the market demand curves can
be constructed by adding individual

34
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:19,988
demand curves together,

35
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:25,011
individual firms supply curves can be
summed into a market supply curve.

36
00:02:25,011 --> 00:02:28,808
To maximize profits,
a firm will want to supply all units for

37
00:02:28,808 --> 00:02:32,840
which the price exceeds
the marginal cost of production.

38
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:36,936
That is the added input costs, it must
be incurred to produce one more unit,

39
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:40,940
producing and
selling these units will raise profits.

40
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,255
Applying this logic, the firm's profit
maximizing supply directly reflects its

41
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:46,929
marginal costs of production.

42
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,640
So how are prices determined
in a competitive market?

43
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,841
The price P star is the unique price
at which the quantity supplied by firms

44
00:02:56,841 --> 00:03:00,840
exactly balances the quantity
demanded by consumers.

45
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,140
That's why economists call
it the equilibrium price.

46
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,137
If prices were any higher than P star,
firms would think it's profitable to

47
00:03:08,137 --> 00:03:11,840
produce more than consumers
would be willing to buy.

48
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,441
That unsold product would create downward
pressure on price, encouraging firms to

49
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:20,861
produce less and consumers to buy more
until the equilibrium price was reached.

50
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,201
If prices were below P star, the opposite
dynamic would occur with a shortfall in

51
00:03:26,201 --> 00:03:29,772
production relative to demand,
creating an upward pressure on price.

52
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,200
Note that the market equilibrium net
social benefits, defined as the difference

53
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,699
between the value to consumers and
the cost of producers is maximized.

54
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:46,223
At any other quantity that shaded area
would be smaller, at quantities below

55
00:03:46,223 --> 00:03:50,203
Q star, we'd effectively be chopping
the point off the triangle.

56
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:53,821
And quantities above Q star,
we'd be adding another triangle,

57
00:03:53,821 --> 00:03:57,243
over that triangle would actually
represent a net social loss

58
00:03:57,243 --> 00:04:01,914
because all those units above Q star would
have marginal cost of production in excess

59
00:04:01,914 --> 00:04:04,244
of their marginal benefit to consumers.

60
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:11,899
Therefore, equilibrium prices reflect
both the value to consumers and

61
00:04:11,899 --> 00:04:15,340
the input costs to the firm's
of the marginal unit.

62
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,809
Prices create incentives, they play
two crucial roles in the economy,

63
00:04:19,809 --> 00:04:25,012
signaling and rationing, a higher price
signals profit opportunities to firms and

64
00:04:25,012 --> 00:04:27,151
encourages them to produce more.

65
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,944
Higher price simultaneously signals
consumers that they should cut back and

66
00:04:32,944 --> 00:04:36,040
substitute towards other goods.

67
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:40,974
Prices also ration available supply
to those willing and able to pay.

68
00:04:40,974 --> 00:04:45,076
At the equilibrium price, the limited
existing quantity is allocated to all

69
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:47,664
those willing to pay
the going market price, and

70
00:04:47,664 --> 00:04:49,761
none of them will go home empty handed.

71
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,140
If we don't like that the market price
allocates goods according to willingness

72
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,338
and ability to pay, we need to devise
an alternative rationing mechanism such as

73
00:04:59,338 --> 00:05:02,340
waiting in line or limiting purchases.

74
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,139
Such a system could create incentives to
set up a black market where those with

75
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,961
access to the good resell it
to those most willing to pay.

76
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,299
As we saw in the market equilibrium graph,

77
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:17,651
the net social benefits of the product
our greatest at the equilibrium quantity.

78
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,490
Competitive markets result
in three desirable outcomes.

79
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,331
First, they produce the right stuff,
that is,

80
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:29,630
only goods consumers value more than
the cost of production will generate

81
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:34,240
the profit opportunities needed
to entice firms to produce.

82
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,240
Second, they produce the right amount.

83
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,864
All units generating more
value to consumers and

84
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:43,140
their cost of production are made and
no more.

85
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,440
Third, they use the right inputs.

86
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,164
Profit maximizing firms must use
the efficient input mix or face a cost

87
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:53,029
disadvantage relative to competitors
who do employ the efficient mix.

88
00:05:55,140 --> 00:06:00,392
So, in the immortal words of Gordon Gekko
from the movie Wall Street, Greed is good.

89
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:04,196
Markets made up of selfish
utility maximizing consumers and

90
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:08,300
profit maximizing firms generate
outcomes that are difficult,

91
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:13,461
if not impossible to approve upon in a way
that makes society as a whole better off.

92
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,640
So what role does that leave for
government as a regulator of the economy?

93
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,640
Not much because of the limited scope for
intervention to improve outcomes.

94
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,201
Government makes and enforces
the rules for the economy to function,

95
00:06:28,201 --> 00:06:33,340
most importantly, establishing property
rights and policing fraudulent claims.

96
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,035
Government may also seek to redistribute
income and promote fairness, if

97
00:06:38,035 --> 00:06:43,337
a governing consensus can be reached about
what that means and how to redistribute.

98
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:46,662
Beyond that, the implication
of this model of a competitive

99
00:06:46,662 --> 00:06:49,803
economy is the government
should just get out of the way.

100
00:06:49,803 --> 00:06:55,738
Interventions such as taxes, subsidies, or
direct regulation of what, how much and

101
00:06:55,738 --> 00:07:00,961
how to produce would only serve to
worsen the already ideal market outcome.

102
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,411
The simple model of an economy made up
of competitive markets provides us with

103
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:10,984
a benchmark against which we can compare
real economies made up of real markets,

104
00:07:10,984 --> 00:07:12,751
such as those for health care.

105
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,125
As we'll see in further videos,
markets are only guaranteed to

106
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:22,761
produce the ideal outcomes with a number
of important assumptions hold true.

107
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,412
We will see that while these assumptions
are violated many real markets,

108
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:29,961
they are particularly
problematic in health care.

109
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:35,048
To summarize, firms are assumed
to pursue their self interest,

110
00:07:35,048 --> 00:07:37,340
defined as maximizing profits.

111
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,390
This process involves balancing
the revenues and costs from producing and

112
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:46,490
selling another unit, and these choices
can be summarized in the supply curve.

113
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:51,460
Prices are determined by the interaction
of firms and consumers through supply and

114
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,668
demand in markets.

115
00:07:52,668 --> 00:07:58,040
We concluded that an ideal competitive
market yields several desirable outcomes.

116
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:01,253
Therefore, government
interference with the competitive

117
00:08:01,253 --> 00:08:03,716
market will generally
yield worse outcomes.

118
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:08,177
In future videos, we will examine a
variety of situations in which unregulated

119
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:10,251
markets fall short of these ideals.
