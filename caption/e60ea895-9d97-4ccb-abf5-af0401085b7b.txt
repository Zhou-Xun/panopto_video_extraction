1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,629
All right. So thank you for coming. I really greatly appreciate it.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,530
And you all are making a great choice. I hope that you continue to come.

3
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:19,200
We are starting this professional development series that will be every Friday from 12 to 1.

4
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:29,070
Perhaps in the future we will try to entice everyone with some treats and this will continue this semester and then next semester as well.

5
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,370
So today the goal is to introduce everyone involved in this course who you can see over here.

6
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,420
Everybody, minutes talk. We're going to outline the course and its goals.

7
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:50,250
We'll describe some of the many feelings that you may have right now acclimating to school, to maybe a new country, maybe a new just state, city town.

8
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,980
And then we'll provide some tips for succeeding as a grad student and take quick stock of where we are and reflect on some goals over the next year.

9
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:05,260
So the instructors for this course are myself, Cui and Sebastian.

10
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,639
So I'm telling you all, I'm Associate Professor of Biostatistics.

11
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,270
I've been here for ten years. I'm the Associate Chair for academic affairs.

12
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:21,219
I'm also the admissions chair and I'm really excited about this class as students have been asking for something like this in our program.

13
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:27,730
And while we have pieces of professional development throughout many courses,

14
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:33,490
there's not one area where you can find these skills, and a lot of skills are missed in the classroom.

15
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,879
So we're going to have a lot of really great content. Please.

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:44,680
Do you want to introduce yourself? Yeah, sure. I mean, you probably already know because I teach 600th this year by regions such in the department,

17
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,130
so I will mostly be leading sections in the winter semester of this course.

18
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:55,120
Glad to see you out here today. And Sebastian, I am Sebastian Zellner.

19
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:03,430
I'm a professor in the department. I've been here for 18 years, something like that long time.

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:14,350
So to give you, I'm also going to teach I'm going to teach a little bit more in the fall because I'm not going to be all that much in the winter.

21
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:22,000
To give you a little bit of my background so that you can see where my opinion and advice come from.

22
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:29,560
I've been doing all my graduate work in Germany, so I have not personally gone through the experience that a lot of you are going to go through here.

23
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:35,050
On the other hand, I have been advising well over 20 graduate students here in the department.

24
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,330
So I've seen a lot of what they have done, what worked well for them, what did not work well for them.

25
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,090
So that will be my perspective as I'm teaching this course. Not so much from personal experience, but much more from.

26
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,090
I've seen many, many people succeed, some not succeed in this program and what worked for them and what it.

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,570
And we also have several of the weeks are going to be taught by a guest guest lecturer.

28
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:06,459
So if you all haven't met Chilima a commoner yet, she is our new wellness and inclusion advocate,

29
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,830
and she's going to show up at least twice this semester to talk about a lot of different things.

30
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:22,630
But mental health, acclimation, sort of thinking about yourself as a whole, whole self and moving along.

31
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:31,810
We also have Dave Bossie, who's our chief administrator of the department, and he's going to come in and talk about conflict management.

32
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,840
We have a speech, career services who are going to have a few sessions at the end of the semester

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,740
that are really focused on internship preparedness and career readiness.

34
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:49,209
So thinking about your resume, your social your social, I guess,

35
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:55,120
profiles that you could have out there of how you search for internships, etc., and how you think about careers.

36
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,390
We'll have alumni panel, so and we'll also have current students talking about how they got internships and what they did.

37
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,600
We also have Wolverine Wellness coming in.

38
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:11,050
So you're going to see a lot of different groups that we've handpicked to have some really great programing for you.

39
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,020
So you all should have gotten a invitation to our canvas page.

40
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:22,870
And on that canvas page you can get a live link to the syllabus, which is on Google Docs.

41
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:28,300
This is a noncredit class and no one's here because it doesn't have to be right.

42
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:35,200
But you all made a really great decision. We're hoping that next year this will be a one credit course that hopefully all of our

43
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:40,750
master's students will take and will complement their classroom knowledge and coursework.

44
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:45,130
Like I said, it's fall and winter. It's one hour every Friday.

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,299
The goal is that we have maybe, max, 30 minutes of lecturing and a lot of time for exercises,

46
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,910
activities and engagement so that this will be not just something that you fall asleep to,

47
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:04,780
but really something that you're learning from and participating with. There's no grades or homework because there's no credits attached here.

48
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:10,689
So we know we can't make you do that. And while attendance is not required, it is really highly suggested.

49
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,499
And while you can go through and pick and choose which weeks you'd like to come to,

50
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,640
I highly suggest that you attend to all of them because you never know.

51
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:26,319
You think you know something, but you don't know what you don't know. And so you might get a piece of of helpful information.

52
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:37,030
And each week, even when you thought you knew that, that information. So our goals are to learn skills, to survive and thrive as a bio start student,

53
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,190
whether that's an MRI student or a Ph.D. student, we're really focused on first year master's students,

54
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:49,090
and a lot of the fall material is going to be really thinking about how you can thrive as a student in our program here,

55
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:56,700
and then as we go further into the fall and beyond. We're going to discuss a variety of career opportunities for Biostatistician,

56
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:03,219
prepare for internships and job opportunities, and learn skills to be successful professionally.

57
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:09,820
And so that will be much of the winter semester is really focusing on those professional skills for the workplace.

58
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,030
I took this quote that actually is actually Emma's signature and I really like it.

59
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:23,230
My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor and some style.

60
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:33,450
So some of the fall topics, if you've looked at the syllabus, next week's the best time to talk about advisor advisory roles.

61
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,390
So as you've all come into the department and have an advisor view,

62
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:45,000
we are going to give some tips about how to facilitate that relationship and or find other mentors.

63
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,450
There's mental health, wellbeing, emotional and cultural competency, and Chilima is going to speak on those topics.

64
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:56,460
Then there's also we're going to talk about academic misconduct and research ethics,

65
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:03,300
things that are very important and often just sort of assumed that, you know, but you may not.

66
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:08,660
We'll touch on collaboration, communication skills, time management initiatives.

67
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,990
And then really go into the internship preparedness, the search, the profile, your resumÃ©, future planning.

68
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:19,110
What is it that you think you want to do? And then what can you do?

69
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,710
What are these other options in an outside internship? But your next step here.

70
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,120
So like I said, you should have gotten an option to join the campus page if you did not.

71
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,660
Please let me know if I can add anyone. The syllabus and our class size are there.

72
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,519
All lectures will be recorded and posted in case anyone wants to reference them later.

73
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:47,010
Or others who don't get to come want to see them. There are lots of other resources and they will continue to build on the campus as well.

74
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:55,110
So there is things like computing resources or, you know, resources around campus that you might be wanting to use.

75
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:59,219
And so we'll make sure that these are all one area there.

76
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,160
There's resources about how to contact career services and what to look for there, and that will continue to be updated.

77
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:11,040
We've opened Piazza on a campus page, which is a discussion tool.

78
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,710
Quite honestly, I've never used it before, but we has.

79
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:20,309
And we're hoping that if there are questions or discussion that you'd like to have anyone would like to have,

80
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:24,730
whether they're here in the class or not, that you post on Piazza instead of, you know,

81
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,560
necessarily emailing one of us or all of us every week,

82
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,200
Piazza is going to be sort of the the common room where we can address questions and your your student,

83
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,250
your fellow students can see the answers to questions as well.

84
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,580
So expectations, in terms of what we expect from you, we hope that you show up.

85
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,900
We hope that you engage in both the lecture and the activities or exercises.

86
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,030
We hope they are open to new ideas and hearing things that maybe you thought you knew,

87
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:57,570
but getting a different perspective or just hearing it again can always be useful.

88
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,759
Obviously, we hope that there is a level of respectfulness to everyone in here,

89
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:08,970
not just to the instructors, but to each other so that you're listening and respecting other's opinions.

90
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:13,019
Please speak up. Raise your hands. Post on Piazza.

91
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:18,659
We want engagement here and we also want honest and constructive feedback.

92
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:24,750
So this is a pilot. We are hoping to have this a real course next year for the incoming master's students.

93
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,600
So while you are somewhat of guinea pigs,

94
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,209
we want to make sure that what you're getting is good and then you can help us refine it for the next set of students.

95
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,760
So please, at any point we'll have some points in which we stop and do some formal feedback.

96
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:45,530
But if you have feedback as we go, please let us know. All right.

97
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,490
So, yes, I just wanted to emphasize one thing that Kelly said.

98
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:55,600
The course is designed around the idea that you're in the classroom.

99
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:03,520
A lot of the activities I'm planning and I'm sure what Kelly's planning will not come across if you just watch the course on campus.

100
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:10,060
So it's going to be a very different experience, whether you come or whether you just try to watch it on campus.

101
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:20,050
So we strongly encourage you to actually come. So for all those watching on campus after today, take notes, we want you in class.

102
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:30,530
Also, please stop me at any point. Ask questions, speak up if I'm going too quickly or if I just have any question, just please speak up.

103
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:38,260
So welcome. You've had your first full week check, done great work.

104
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:43,090
You've heard welcome from many, many people. But welcome again to biostatistics.

105
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:48,580
I know many of you from different countries, different states, different different settings.

106
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,149
Some of you were students previously, but not grad students.

107
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:58,150
Some of you were grad students. Some of you are working some of your college students or coming from lots of different backgrounds.

108
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:04,680
And we're really grateful that you're here and you've chosen Michigan, Ohio State to choose to spend the next, I don't know,

109
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:10,719
two to however many years that you're maybe avoiding the real world or you're

110
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,470
really just trying to get the skills to go more skills to go into the real world.

111
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,060
We're hoping to give those to you.

112
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:23,740
I don't know how many of you are familiar with culture shock, but for those of you who are new to the country especially,

113
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,180
but even those who are just new to grad school might go through some of this.

114
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,110
There are these five stages of culture shock.

115
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:36,730
Most likely if you just got here recently, like you moved here a week or two ago,

116
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:40,750
you're probably still in the honeymoon phase where everything is really exciting.

117
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:46,780
School started, you're meeting new people. You know, the food is interesting, right?

118
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,170
There's new things to do. The weather's super nice.

119
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,130
So it's still very much a honeymoon phase. That's exciting.

120
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:01,630
You'll find that eventually, maybe in the next month or so, you might start to feel some homesickness,

121
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,610
maybe a little irritated that people aren't necessarily understanding you.

122
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:16,030
This is a cultural crisis where you're kind of going down from the honeymoon phase and then most likely around midterm time,

123
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,010
you're going to start to possibly feel the low point.

124
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:27,400
So it's not just because of midterms, it's also maybe going to get cloudy and a little colder outside.

125
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:37,210
You've been away from home much longer, so now you might start feeling more homesick, a little bit lonely, possibly perhaps annoyed.

126
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:40,810
And this is all totally, completely normal.

127
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:48,490
Students go through this every year, regardless of whether you're coming from a new country or just starting in a new place is a new role.

128
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:56,410
And so just to make you aware that it's okay, right, that you go through these stages, it is going to happen most likely.

129
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,450
But what we're hoping is that eventually you're going to make your way back up this curve.

130
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,460
You'll have this final learning curve of acceptance, adjustment and integration.

131
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,360
And we're going to help hopefully will help you get there.

132
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:16,900
And if you need help at any point, there are lots of resources and what you can use to try to get you back up from that low point.

133
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,790
Besides homesickness, which is an obvious symptom of culture shock,

134
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:30,200
there are many others which can really be detrimental to your success as a student.

135
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:38,220
And so just figuring out that if you're feeling any of these things at any time in the next few months, it might be because of this culture shock.

136
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,460
Again, culture being a new country, but it might just be a new role as a grad student.

137
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:48,510
So you might start to feel some anxiety or perhaps your sleep is affected.

138
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:56,600
You might start feeling sort of that you're a lonely or in isolation.

139
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:03,500
You could have decreased productivity, poor time management, which are obviously going to affect the way in which you're working as a student.

140
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:10,420
And so, again, these are all normal. And so if you start feeling these things, then thinking about, you know,

141
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:19,250
where am I on this and how can I get back up and how can I help maybe seek some help from others to start coming up from that culture shock?

142
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,050
So there are lots of ways to overcome this culture shock.

143
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,709
One is to keep familiar things around you.

144
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:34,940
So if you're missing people from home to have photos around you, obviously carrying your phone, I'm sure you have them in there.

145
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:43,280
But to look at them. Right. And to maybe make you feel a little bit better about where you are and that they're still there and you can talk to them.

146
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:51,530
Another thing is just for when you're meeting new people, try to assume the best about those around you.

147
00:14:51,770 --> 00:14:59,599
Try to forget about stereotypes and prejudices so that it's easy to come in and to feel uneasy and to think,

148
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,280
Oh, they don't think I'm smart, or, Oh, that person is not smart, or like, Oh, they're this way.

149
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,600
And so they don't know what they're doing,

150
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:14,690
trying to forget those things and be really open and interested in meeting others and thinking that, you know, they're not judging you.

151
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,220
Maybe they are, but thinking that they're not right and going on and trying to think the best of others

152
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,170
so that you can go into those relationships a little bit more open and inviting,

153
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:32,060
trying to make friends. So what happens a lot is that individuals who come from a similar culture end up making friends with each other.

154
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:41,390
And we get some pockets of different types of students and some dichotomies of of the student groups that occur.

155
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,329
And so that's totally fine and natural and normal,

156
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:50,180
but also to try to explore those who come from different cultures and to really learn from each other.

157
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,889
So maybe it's easier if you're all speaking the same language to continue to hang out together,

158
00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:00,130
but also think about who else you can meet and talk with. And that might open your eyes.

159
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,710
Open your eyes to new experiences and and information.

160
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:08,479
And then you're here to learn. Right. We want you to do well in your classes.

161
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,820
We want you to learn vital statistics for obviously,

162
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:16,370
your or your course instructors are going to assign homework and tests and you're going to be doing a lot of studying.

163
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,460
But please don't forget about yourself. Write your first person.

164
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:28,340
You need to take care of your whole self, your health, which includes both your physical, mental, emotional, spiritual self.

165
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,639
Those are all very, very important and those are all thriving.

166
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:35,990
Right. You can do much better as a student, so make sure that you are exercising.

167
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,590
If that's what you like to do, you're eating well, you're getting enough sleep.

168
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,650
Please prioritize those things that keep you healthy.

169
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:49,660
Also, if you are from somewhere internationally, please take advantage of the International Center.

170
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,870
There are really great resources on this site.

171
00:16:51,890 --> 00:17:00,379
They have really interesting events and just have done a really excellent job because we know that we have lots of people who

172
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:07,070
are international coming to Michigan and so it can bring people together and it can help you in learning and this new place.

173
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,040
All right. So quick tips to thrive as a grad student. And maybe some of these are obvious, but just a good reminder.

174
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:20,829
So, first and foremost, please ask questions. Ask questions to your professors.

175
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:25,330
Ask questions to your eyes, to your fellow classmates, to your advisor.

176
00:17:25,570 --> 00:17:36,370
Don't feel like you can't speak up. I feel like there's cultural differences and there's also like hidden curriculum and unwritten rules.

177
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:43,360
Some people think that, oh, you know, I have to be deferential to the instructor or I don't want them to think that I'm stupid,

178
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:47,410
so I don't want to ask them something. But that's not true. There's never a dumb question.

179
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:50,910
We are here to help you. The GSEs are here to help you.

180
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:56,319
Everyone wants to do well. We want to support you and want you to do do.

181
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,710
We want you to thrive? So please seek help when you need it.

182
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,310
Seek it early instead of waiting until it's too late.

183
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,420
Right. We want to help prevent it as opposed to fixing it and putting a Band-Aid on it.

184
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:11,200
Make sure that you're also taking initiative.

185
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:19,750
So this is something that really sets some students apart from others, is that those just sort of gliding through and getting by.

186
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,520
You know, that's one way to do it.

187
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:28,780
But the other way is to really, you know, be speaking up, take that initiative, go to the events, ask the questions, send the emails.

188
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,770
You know, maybe the advisor didn't send an email to you to set up a meeting.

189
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:37,330
They that doesn't mean that they don't want to meet with you. It just means that they were overwhelmed, too.

190
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,840
Right. So use an email to the advisor and ask for a meeting.

191
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:47,680
So just take that initiative either with teachers or with your fellow classmates.

192
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:53,649
Right. I'm sure that there are lots of classmates who are worried and scared and don't know who to connect with.

193
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:58,030
And they would very much welcome an email from someone asking if they want to get together.

194
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,770
We have so many events, especially this first month.

195
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,300
It can seem a little overwhelming, but I do suggest that you take advantage of them as much as possible.

196
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:14,830
So we had the whole orientation. We have a picnic coming up next.

197
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:21,100
Not this weekend, but the following weekend. Then we have a new student retreat the weekend after that.

198
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:28,510
There are lots of things going on, but they're all meant to help bring you together and feel like you have a supportive cohort.

199
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:35,380
So please try to take advantage of these events as much as possible. We always try to have great food and fun games at the.

200
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,750
None of these events coming up are academic in any way. They're all just for fun.

201
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,980
So try new things and then again, take care of your whole self.

202
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,330
So more tips to succeed are to leverage your peers.

203
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:56,610
So you all had an opportunity to sign up for peer mentors. Hopefully you took advantage of that and have a peer mentor.

204
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:01,920
But you also, if you didn't, that's okay. You also just have all of your other classmates.

205
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:08,190
So there are almost 90 and between 80 and 90 of you first year students.

206
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:14,820
And then there's a little over 90 of the second year master's students and many,

207
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:20,250
many PhD students that have been here that have gone through this program are they're going through it together.

208
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,090
So please turn to your classmates. Ask them, how do you manage time?

209
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:28,800
How did you get through this course? You know, what did you do to study for this thing?

210
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:35,250
How did you get that internship? And and how are you just getting through the week, right.

211
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,090
Turn to your classmates because they're going through the same thing. They're really great.

212
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:48,149
So to talk to you and to get some information from seek out your faculty mentors so you're all signed an advisor if you didn't meet with them,

213
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,040
which there should have been an opportunity during orientation week, if you weren't able to meet with them,

214
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,999
please send them an email and and see if you can connect with them.

215
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:05,220
Even if you know you've got your schedule figured out, just go and say, Hi, I'm so-and-so from wherever and this is my goal.

216
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,659
Just wanted to say hi to you. You know, it could be a five minute meeting.

217
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,840
It doesn't have to be long, but it's a great way to connect with someone.

218
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:21,360
Faculty in the department. And maybe during that meeting you're like, I don't really jive with this advisor that was assigned to me.

219
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,610
I'm not sure that this is going to be someone that I want to seek out and seek out somebody else.

220
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,670
Okay, so you can have that official assigned advisor, but you can have informal mentors as well.

221
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
And I think Sebastian is going to talk much more about this next week.

222
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:46,319
But if, you know, you should have some contact with some faculty members, whether it's in the classroom, also not someone in the classroom.

223
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,850
And you can choose who you want to look up to or if you want to talk to you about where you're going.

224
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,409
And another one is to map out your goals early.

225
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:00,899
So it might seem overwhelming because you just entered this program and you might have no idea where you want to go.

226
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,500
And that's totally fine. But to think about, you know, just start thinking about it.

227
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,180
What is it that I want to do next? And it can change many, many times before you graduate.

228
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:13,980
Right? But do I want to get a job or do I want to get a job in this area or this area?

229
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:18,840
Do I think I want to go to a Ph.D. in bio stat or in some other discipline?

230
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:24,180
Right. Thinking about where you want to go is really going to help you in terms of your electives choices,

231
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,240
in terms of if you want to get an internship or not,

232
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:33,840
in terms of how much you're engaging with the faculty, etc., what events and seminars you're going to go to.

233
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,670
So just start to think about what those goals are and what you want to get out of the program.

234
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,300
I think this is my last slide of tips to succeed.

235
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,290
And this is really important and something that I didn't talk about during orientation.

236
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:55,060
And so I really hope that you all are focusing on learning and not just the grades.

237
00:22:55,390 --> 00:23:04,210
So when you go through schooling, through college, you know, a lot of times, especially when, you know, you want to go to grad school,

238
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,870
you're thinking about, I need to get in there, need to get no, I mean, those straight A's, you know, in order to look good for the next school.

239
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,270
So right now you're in graduate school, you made it right.

240
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:22,330
All those grades were really important. You got here. But now it's really about getting this knowledge to move on to your career.

241
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:26,350
And so at this point, the most important part is that knowledge,

242
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:33,640
that learning the process of of curiosity, of understanding, of deep thinking, critical thinking.

243
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:40,479
So try to focus on that learning process and gaining new experiences and networking with your college,

244
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,260
with your classmates, because they're going to be your colleagues as opposed to necessarily only focusing on the grade.

245
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:53,610
Start practicing time management. If you didn't have to do this in college, you certainly will.

246
00:23:53,610 --> 00:24:00,629
Now, as an undergrad, if you didn't have issues with time management and graduate school, right,

247
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:07,230
things are much more flexible on your schedule and there is a lot that is going to be do.

248
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,280
So it's important to start mapping out your assignment deadlines and commitments,

249
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:16,860
using calendars to do lists, prioritizing them on how you need to get them done.

250
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:23,310
We're going to have a leader lecture dedicated to time management to help with that if you don't already have those skills.

251
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:30,870
And then as every other slide has made it clear that you're also still a person, right?

252
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:36,390
And you need to consider your sleep, your health striker, work life or school life balance.

253
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:43,170
Find some fun. So for some people that may be doing more problem sets or getting together, right?

254
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:50,580
But for a lot of people, it's not it's having some support that you want to go play or go watch or,

255
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:55,920
you know, doing some musical activity or whatever it is.

256
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,790
Right. Have some aspects of your life that you feel like is balancing all that work and that you

257
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:06,540
can do with others potentially to to help feel a bit more balanced throughout this program.

258
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:17,890
I also mentioned this at the orientation that goes along with not necessarily only caring about those A's,

259
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:25,270
but learning is also that you're going to have lots of group projects, you're still going to have lots of individual things as well.

260
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:29,680
And you want to think about your time here as a collaboration.

261
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:39,370
Much of what we do as biostatistician is a collaborative process, and we're working with others throughout many, many projects.

262
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:47,860
And so you want to think start practicing that now with your classmates so that if you want to be incrementally better, you can be competitive.

263
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:51,170
But if you want to be exponentially better, be cooperative.

264
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,620
Right. Working with others is going to be helpful.

265
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:59,979
Not necessarily saying no to being in that group, study group, because you think you can get farther by yourself.

266
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:05,139
But saying yes and then helping them and then they might in turn help you understand something better too,

267
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,410
or help you with more of an applied aspect to it.

268
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:12,430
And so please work together.

269
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:18,849
Don't try to put someone down to get yourself ahead. It's really going to help everyone.

270
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:25,780
If you can think about this as a as a start of working at teams, which you will do throughout your career.

271
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,810
We've seen in the past that because we have these relatively large cohorts,

272
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:38,320
that there is this competition that builds because many students want to get into our Ph.D. program.

273
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:46,950
What I can tell you is that while not everyone can get into our Ph.D. program, if you do well,

274
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:53,180
right, you can get into a Ph.D. program, which is just probably just as great.

275
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:53,500
Right?

276
00:26:53,520 --> 00:27:01,530
You can go to some other place that you can get a Ph.D. so we're not stifling your future in any way just because you don't go to Michigan's program.

277
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:06,990
And so it's not going to be helpful to come here and to just try to be at the

278
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,400
top of your class and to put others down so that you can get into our program.

279
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,979
Right. What's going to be helpful is they are all working together.

280
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:18,540
You're all doing as well as you can and you're all going to have successful futures, whether it's here or not.

281
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,240
So, again, just focusing on the collaborative teamwork as opposed to competition.

282
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:30,520
All right. So, beginning of our engagement, have you guys used poll everywhere before?

283
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:37,650
Yes. Have you? So poll everywhere you can either use on your computer or on your phone and their questions.

284
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:44,290
So if you want to use your phone, you text up to 37607.

285
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:53,870
This Kelly can well with one L to 50. And if you want to use your computer or your tablet or iPad or whatever you can go to pull ABC.com slash.

286
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:59,620
Oh, sorry. It's not Kelly and it was just Kelly Cable 215 with the one L and then this.

287
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,379
These questions should pop up.

288
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:13,270
So if you text Kelly okay, well, 252, three, seven, six or seven, then you can choose A, B or C text texted again and I can see how many respond.

289
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,880
Let's try to get. He responds this.

290
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,760
So we will 6040 so far.

291
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:59,720
So I guess when I do that, I can't see how many people responded. You guys go to work?

292
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:20,980
If you wanted it. I was going to say, I think most of you are first year masters to see if it's the first heavy use out of it.

293
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:25,360
Do we have time? Oh, I don't think so.

294
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,170
I think you should be able just to text. Is it asking you to create an account?

295
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,480
Yeah, it's. It asked me to type in my username.

296
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:40,240
Really? Yeah. You can just put it in like a name or like I put in, like a letter.

297
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,960
It doesn't matter. Says Presents presenter, not phone. Did you spell it right?

298
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:48,160
Probably. Yeah. Might be a typo then. Okay.

299
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:52,030
Okay. Yeah. Let's try it again.

300
00:29:52,180 --> 00:30:02,020
Is there. Since you are not with your body.

301
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,940
I know that's a good question for me.

302
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:13,630
I feel like I should be. But then you have to come up to the screen and try to.

303
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,640
But yeah, that's great advice.

304
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,439
I think we could you could I can give you what you have from the site.

305
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,160
Right. So that's a good point. Okay. I'll do that for the next time over.

306
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:36,490
All right. How about this? Since most of you are all of your masters students, I think after you complete the masters and this could change.

307
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:42,730
So I'm not locking you in anything. Right. Also, I'm not collecting this data in any way in terms of using it for anything.

308
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:50,310
But what do you think you want to do? Take.

309
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,160
Come on. We got here.

310
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,370
Working industry. Pharma or tech? Get a Ph.D.

311
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,860
Who knows? That's great. These are all great options.

312
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,030
You'll find that. You'll figure it out eventually. Maybe you'll figure it out once you get the job offer.

313
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:29,110
Right. You might not know until you actually start looking for jobs.

314
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,120
Hopefully we'll help you figure that out along the way. All right.

315
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:37,630
Let's try an excellent. Okay.

316
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:44,320
So for this one, you're going to submit a word so you can text or put in a word.

317
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,280
What's one thing that you really want to learn regarding professional development?

318
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,070
What are you hoping to get out of this course, which hopefully you continue coming to?

319
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:09,500
New development options. Confidence calling it.

320
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:21,080
Experience. Internship information.

321
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,770
Career choice. That's great.

322
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:37,180
So hopefully you will get all of those. We're hoping to touch on all of those things for sure.

323
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:44,470
Okay. So that's the that's the end of poll everywhere. Good job using if that was your first time.

324
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,910
Some of your classes may or may not use it. I use it in my class. I teach biostatistics.

325
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:52,989
19 So in your second year master, I use poll everywhere in that.

326
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:56,050
So if you don't see it again until you take my class, then I'll sit there.

327
00:32:56,530 --> 00:33:00,250
Okay. So you should have gone. You should have picked up one of these. Does anybody need one?

328
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:10,930
Yeah. Okay, you got one things. Okay, so this is just a fun, nonacademic activity, right?

329
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:20,319
Where we can think of we're all unique individuals that are via our own balance right across these four aspects of our life.

330
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,770
So work you can think of as any school or like family obligations or work, right?

331
00:33:26,770 --> 00:33:32,100
If you're a geoscientist or a play is anything that is fun for you, right?

332
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:38,350
Love It might be another person, it might be animals, it might be it just any object of affection.

333
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:46,090
And then, of course, your health is both physical, mental, spiritual, emotional in any way.

334
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:53,140
And so take a minute to fill this in like color it is where are you are now on all four of these aspects.

335
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:58,360
Where would you place yourself today? This first week class is over, right?

336
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:10,209
Where are you feeling like you are on this? And as you do that, I also think about what would be your optimal coloring on the dashboard, right?

337
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:14,500
Like where are you today and how would you where do you want to be on this?

338
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,720
Yeah. Is this in terms of like how much time you put into each of these are like what is the measurement?

339
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:26,349
Yeah, like your measurement is how much you feel like maybe how much time or how much you feel like

340
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:35,350
you dedicated to these different things or you feel like they're a part of your past week.

341
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,950
Right? That's how you're filling it in is where you are this week.

342
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:46,720
And then you might think about your optimal being as like how much you actually want these things to be a part of your life or the time spent on it.

343
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:53,170
So let's give you a few minutes. Kelly Yeah. I don't have a pet.

344
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,340
Oh, you don't have a pencil. You can use the expo marker.

345
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:08,170
Oh. Or Xerox. I have a lot. So I'm not collecting this.

346
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:12,230
This is just for you, right? Nobody's going to see it. Not going to ask you to share it.

347
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:22,990
Right. There's no right answer. And what maybe is optimal for you right now might not be optimal for you in a year,

348
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:31,240
but it's just kind of helpful to take a momentary pause in reflection on where you are and where you might need to focus going forward.

349
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,740
So a lot of time we're too busy just moving forward, thinking about the next task,

350
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:35,380
the next assignment, the next thing we have to do, and we kind of forget to take stock of ourselves.

351
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,770
So I just invite you to think about this dashboard as you go throughout this especially first semester.

352
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,550
And to think back, you know, where where am I? Is for good.

353
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:48,850
Right. Is being full good or is full too much?

354
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:52,360
Where do I need to focus on either lessening or increasing?

355
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,500
And again, that balance is going to be super person specific.

356
00:36:55,510 --> 00:37:00,520
What I would want on a dashboard is likely very different from what you would want or need.

357
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:10,900
So just, you know, thinking about this dashboard, you can go back to the slide and use it or color it in on your iPad and take stock of where you are.

358
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:18,890
Okay. Then we're going to do this, this activity, which is going to be small groups and the whole clump together.

359
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,060
So I so take three index cards, but you could just use one.

360
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,310
I have more if you want them.

361
00:37:25,850 --> 00:37:35,660
But what I want you to do on each of your index cards is for each individual person is going to write down three specific goals for this next year.

362
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,990
So think about your next year in our program.

363
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:43,100
But it doesn't just have to be academic goals. It can be like personal goals as well.

364
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,950
And I want you to write down three goals. There's we want to use this smart goals.

365
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:54,220
So they should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time bound.

366
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:58,610
So in this year, what are some goals that are specific that you could achieve?

367
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:05,210
Okay, so take a few minutes to do that. Then we're going to get in small groups and talk about our goals.

368
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:13,370
So be prepared to talk about them. If you're really embarrassed about a goal either, maybe don't write that one down or open up and talk about it.

369
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,570
And then we're going to try to make a new list of things that you actually had in common.

370
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:22,070
So take a few minutes to write down your own goals. Yeah.

371
00:38:22,700 --> 00:40:26,229
Do you need one? All right as you're finishing rating your goals will get in groups of three to compare them.

372
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:37,480
So maybe like you three and you three right here and then you three and then if you can go with Yeah, you two and then you three back there.

373
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:44,620
So discuss your goals and if one of you can be like the group recorder and turn your,

374
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,440
your index card over and write the common goals that the three of you have.

375
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:56,919
And if you don't have common goals, maybe after hearing some of those other goals, you want to you would want to add those to your list.

376
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:01,570
So write down what what could have been common goals. So I'll give you a couple of minutes to do that.

377
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:14,230
I want to make sure I can stay healthy.

378
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:27,820
So why don't you want to go first? It's not for some kind of job.

379
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:43,570
I don't think we know what to do in terms of nonacademic events, regular exercise in the U.S.

380
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,260
I don't like this.

381
00:41:47,610 --> 00:42:06,129
Like something that everybody was nervous about.

382
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:14,770
Like, you know, that's just not right.

383
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:29,440
I thought that this way. Maybe we should wait until I think I should stronger.

384
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:57,120
So I think this week I think that what happens on the surface, which is sort of like the introduction of the record,

385
00:42:57,250 --> 00:43:28,150
is to make sure that every aspect of their exercise, which I wrote down, I think it was an important part of your class for your class.

386
00:43:28,810 --> 00:43:37,270
I really want to ask you about what's going on there.

387
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:48,140
And I would just like vocational skills. I would have realized that, you know, to get directly to strong interacting with the organization.

388
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,650
So that's like something that just like you feel.

389
00:43:52,690 --> 00:43:59,570
I was kind of surprised.

390
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:19,470
Yes, I know. I didn't mean that. But more than that, it seems like we had like some that were common that students are probably like 2012.

391
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:40,270
Right. All right. Well, yeah, I think that see, that was one of the first things I want to do right now.

392
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:48,520
We need to have like a common experience, which is like end of the year,

393
00:44:48,550 --> 00:45:00,080
like some kind of career like physically is typically what's going on be actually like that.

394
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:08,590
All right.

395
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:14,260
I need to have some training or whatever.

396
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,100
So you just.

397
00:45:20,950 --> 00:45:25,890
Yes, that's far. All right.

398
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:31,570
So we don't have to maybe come up to the board. We can just sort of ask the groups in the interest of time.

399
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:36,190
So if we go maybe group by group.

400
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:41,530
So we'll start with you guys. Did you have any common goals? Common goal to stay healthy.

401
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:45,820
To stay healthy, including physical and mental health, physical and mental.

402
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:49,000
That's a great goal. That's the excellent goal during that.

403
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:52,780
So that was your one common goal I had among three of you? Yeah.

404
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,850
Some of them call you.

405
00:45:56,850 --> 00:45:59,850
Call me sorry. Or if I internship.

406
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:04,060
Okay. Okay. So we call it jazz or find an internship. All right, great.

407
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:09,100
How did you all have any common goals? Yeah, we have two pretty similar goals there.

408
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:21,009
So stay healthy and sort of by the end of the year, either drunk, get a job or do.

409
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:25,060
Yeah. Yeah. I thought the case. The advisor was an idea.

410
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:29,110
Okay, great. Great. All right. How about this group back here?

411
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,580
Not. Not Sarah. This one. Pretty much the same.

412
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:40,450
Pretty much the same, though. Staying healthy and getting a job or internship?

413
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:46,720
Yeah, funding our internship.

414
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:53,380
That's great. Okay, so your group, we have three in common, but one was an internship.

415
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,230
The other one was meeting with friends. Okay, let's go out.

416
00:46:57,250 --> 00:47:00,850
Friends that are not here at Michigan.

417
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,080
Okay. And then we had exercising 2 to 3 times a week.

418
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:08,350
Oh, okay. Very specific health goal. I like it.

419
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:12,280
Very. That's measurable, right? You can you can actually do that.

420
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,390
Whereas, you know, staying healthy is a little bit ambiguous.

421
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:24,460
Right. But I hope that you do stay healthy. But that's so how do you keep yourself accountable on that goal?

422
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:32,350
Right. You might want to dove down and get more. And maybe you just said it very generally because it's easier to say that.

423
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:36,010
But thinking about how specifically you could do that. All right. The last group, how about your common goals?

424
00:47:36,850 --> 00:47:47,750
The first one is have better academic performance and the second one is work out more often, which is similar to keep you healthy.

425
00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:51,670
And the third one is meeting new people.

426
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:55,240
Meeting with new people. That's great. Yeah, making friends.

427
00:47:55,240 --> 00:48:00,730
So, yeah, there is the friends that came up several times.

428
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:05,680
So there's just like a kind of fun activity.

429
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,050
One, you got to meet some new people. Hopefully you introduce yourselves. Right.

430
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:14,649
The second being that we were all coming from very, probably very different backgrounds or some from very different backgrounds,

431
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:22,299
but yet we all have very similar you might have some similar goals that we really want to keep throughout the year.

432
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,990
So try to if you didn't make those goals specific for yourself,

433
00:48:26,290 --> 00:48:30,909
try to drill down and make those more specific so you can be held accountable over the next year and you

434
00:48:30,910 --> 00:48:35,530
can kind of keep that index card with you and look back at it throughout the year and see how you've done.

435
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:44,110
So just in summary today, thank you so much for coming. Please tell your friends that this is a useful course and that they should come in next week.

436
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:47,680
We'll have lunch for them and for you.

437
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,540
Next we will do lunch. Okay.

438
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:59,680
And it really is better in person because we're going to keep doing these exercises where you can meet others and practice your your skills.

439
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,879
So this whole course is to complement the bio start curriculum in the classroom,

440
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:08,230
learning that you're doing so that it will help you succeed as a student and also as a professional.

441
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,120
We're going to really focus on being a student and preparing for an internship in the fall.

442
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:17,420
While you might still be adjusting, lean into the opportunities that we have here.

443
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:24,220
Meet new people and learn from each other. Remember that this should be a collaborative experience, not about competition.

444
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,690
Take stock often where you are and adapt what you need more.

445
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:34,659
So thinking about that dashboard and then as we just saw that we might be from many different backgrounds,

446
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:39,490
but we all that we have similar goals and so we can help support each other with those goals

447
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:44,290
and keep each other accountable or having fun with each other as we try to reach those.

448
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,400
So thanks for coming. We hope to see you next week.

449
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:52,900
Check out the canvas. Use Piazza. We'll check it out too if there are questions on there.

450
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,240
And have a great weekend.
