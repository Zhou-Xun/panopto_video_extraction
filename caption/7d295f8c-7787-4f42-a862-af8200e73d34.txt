1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,080
Welcome, everybody. I'm excited to see all of you and get to know each other a little bit.

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,910
My hope for this horse is that it's more than meets your needs.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,620
My goal is that when you leave this course this spring,

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:23,850
you are set up for success and will be wildly more successful than all of your peers from other places.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:30,120
So my name is Christine said, I'll introduce myself a little bit more,

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:35,930
but I just want to go through our agenda today so you know how today will work and also help orient you to the campus site here,

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,920
because I know sometimes it can be confusing,

8
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:46,920
but we want to go through a nice welcome, including really understanding what you want out of this program and why you're here at Michigan right now,

9
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,170
because I can talk about the content you need to learn here a little differently depending on why you're here.

10
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,729
So if you want to hear a little more about the policy side of things, if you want to do consulting,

11
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:09,930
if you want to be a venture capital or entrepreneur for your side or policy side for your management, which is kind of our career here.

12
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,340
But tell me and we can make sure we bring in some of that.

13
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:19,070
What that means in that lens of things to the work that you're assigned.

14
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:23,760
You really need to understand healthcare systems, how they're organized,

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:29,250
what kind of tools you have to play with as you embark on your professional life in health care.

16
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:37,860
Big place. Lots of things to play with your $4.3 trillion industry so far so you can do anything.

17
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:45,150
All right. I also want to introduce Abby Phillips. She'll be our graduate student instructor this semester.

18
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,670
Yeah, my name's Evie. I'm a second year MHC student.

19
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:59,260
I was in your shoes just one short year ago, and, yeah, I.

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:06,150
I got my undergrad at Indiana University who was in health care management and policy,

21
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:12,420
and then I went on and worked in software tech, health care tech for three and a half years.

22
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:21,450
And now I am here and I interned at Michigan Medicine and the Department of Neurology this past summer.

23
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:27,660
And then when I graduate, I have an offer for consulting.

24
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:31,380
So in strategy and performance. So looking forward to that.

25
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,910
I need to be working with you all and giving you all feedback and learning from each other.

26
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,380
So yeah, I'm an open book and looking forward to the semester.

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:53,550
You guys talk a little bit about this course and what you got out of it or, you know, maybe help guide how you'll help the students this semester.

28
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,330
Yeah, definitely.

29
00:02:54,330 --> 00:03:02,880
I think that when I think back on this course, there are really there are really three things that I like to highlight of the course.

30
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,810
One is the rapid response memos, which obviously we'll talk about more.

31
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:13,200
That's when we major part of your assignments and how you'll be graded and kind of the skills that you will improve upon this semester.

32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,110
It's really similar to a lot of the work that I did when I was in when I was working full time.

33
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,990
And it's also something that I was able to dive in deeper and really hone in my communication skills,

34
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,400
being really precise and succinct about the ideas that I was trying to communicate.

35
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:36,360
And then the second thing is working on the cases, I was able to talk about the cases that we worked on in this class,

36
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:42,330
both in my interviews for internships and consulting firms this past semester.

37
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,520
So I think that they're really relevant.

38
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:52,410
And if you put in your all, you'll really be able to take the things that you've learned and apply them to the future.

39
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,840
And then finally, just group work and learning from my peers in the course.

40
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,209
The cases are all group projects,

41
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:12,030
and so you learn how to kind of navigate being friends with your coworkers or colleagues or fellow students while also trying to manage their quirks.

42
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:21,059
And I think that that's a really, really important skill to be able to be kind and friendly while also getting constructive feedback.

43
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,460
So yeah, that's kind of what I think about these great things.

44
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:34,049
All right. So all right. We'll go through attendance here in a minute and I'll go first.

45
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,790
I want to explain why attendance a little bit before I do that.

46
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:43,050
So maybe I'll just give you a little more thorough introduction to me.

47
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,820
I, too, was in your shoes, but just a couple of years ago.

48
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,940
I graduated from this program within just a couple of years ago.

49
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,080
Now I, I have two roles here.

50
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,370
One is I'm an adjunct faculty. Which means I do other stuff sometimes when I'm not here.

51
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:13,480
My other stuff is I run the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization, so I am the CEO of this place.

52
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:23,590
This is a global nonprofit. We are the medical society, if you will, for excellence and extracorporeal life support,

53
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:27,400
which does the work of your heart and lungs outside of your body.

54
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:36,220
It's really for the world's sickest patients. We have 800 US centers that are also members around the world.

55
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:46,690
Everywhere around the world. Including three in Russia. Still so far, I need to figure out what to do with this war going on.

56
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:51,040
But I also have people in Iran. So we've been dealing with this for some time.

57
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:57,459
My job is to execute the mission and I report to a board of nine people so

58
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:01,690
that you will we'll talk about that and leadership and how to do these things,

59
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:07,390
because I have to do that every day. The founder of Elso is also the inventor of Echo.

60
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,200
He is an emeritus board member, also, Dr. Bob Bartlett.

61
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:18,390
He's got still allowed that he runs at the young age of 83 here at Michigan.

62
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,810
He's been funded consecutively by MH for 55 years, which I think nobody else has can say that.

63
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:32,830
So he's just in July, one another $5 million grant to keep advancing life support.

64
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:37,540
So I can tell you what's happening in the world, in health care,

65
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:43,750
around resources and access and how we think about who gets access to life support or not.

66
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,900
But these things I'll bring to you in my lens,

67
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:54,010
and I think that's part of the advantage of having act on faculty at your disposal when way when you're dealing with a course like this.

68
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:03,009
So prior to the role of CEO here at so I was I did consulting for 20 years.

69
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:08,920
I started at Deloitte when Deloitte was just Deloitte and then it became Deloitte period.

70
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:16,600
And after Enron and that blew up all the consultancies, Arthur Andersen disappeared.

71
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:25,419
Accenture emerged because of conflicts, as probably some of you know, Sarbanes-Oxley law was developed then.

72
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:34,399
And that has rules for us in health care today around the anti kickbacks and making sure there's separation in terms of separation.

73
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,479
And so you don't have these built in conflicts of interest that are very interesting and had with Enron,

74
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,650
which destroyed that company and a lot of people's livelihoods.

75
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,850
So that's a little bit of my background when I was here.

76
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,040
Media consultant wasn't allowed on campus here,

77
00:07:53,080 --> 00:08:00,490
so I snuck over to the MBA program and took a couple of courses over there and interviewed and Deloitte that way.

78
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:06,430
We've changed since then, and so now you really do have the world as your oyster.

79
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:17,420
I think consulting administrative fellowships is next steps health care payers, that environment, health policy and think tanks and things like that.

80
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,120
The fee side of things, I.T., it's a broad network.

81
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,959
And so I would love in a minute I want to hear more about you and and really what you're interested in hearing about here.

82
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:36,610
But first, let's go back to the course and have a website. So just for a minute today, you're going to see my view of this.

83
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,930
So you can see all the pages that will come up.

84
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:50,500
I need to publish yet, but when I say had few pages, there's a little button here at the top and you'll see every course, every lecture, have a page.

85
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:55,630
So the one that's published right now is week one January six.

86
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:02,950
So it has some reading assignments in in here. These aren't assigned ad hoc.

87
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:06,970
I don't not care that you read them. I do care.

88
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:13,150
They'll be talked about in class. You'll do better if you read them and are familiar with the content.

89
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,520
When we meet for today, we'll go through these just because a couple of them are videos,

90
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:23,470
which I think also bring us up to speed on what's happening right now in health care.

91
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:32,710
So my my other hope is that all the things that we flipped on its head and learned during the pandemic, you need to know about those things,

92
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:40,030
because when you walk into health care, everyone that's in management roles and leadership roles right now has gone on that learning curve.

93
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,890
My goal is to help you catch up on that learning curve so you're not walking in there

94
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:51,400
like a 1990 style mode of thinking about building all the efficiency out of healthcare.

95
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:59,730
Right. And if people have heard of green belts and Six Sigma black belts and everyone you want to.

96
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,990
Do that kind of work? Yes. Okay.

97
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:12,110
So we did that for 50, 60 years in health care, which made sure we had this much capacity to address a pandemic.

98
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:19,540
We have zero capacity. Our good management of our is good management of ICU is good.

99
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,189
Management of inpatient beds is what? What do you want?

100
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,660
To run your hospital? Too many.

101
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:33,940
Full capacity. Full capacity. 90%. Run your hours.

102
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:41,720
90%. 85%. Maybe. If you've got a big trauma center and you need to deal with a bunch of people that come in in the middle of the night, 90%.

103
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,500
And then what happens when there's a pandemic good 90% on a good day.

104
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:57,760
You have no capacity. So one of the things I wanted to go into that is what have we learned?

105
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:04,450
What are we doing now that we've had to go on this journey to flip what we learned on its head change and get into

106
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:10,720
search management and all the operations that we now think about in health care to make sure you can search up,

107
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,739
search down, how to what are your triggers? How do you staff up for that?

108
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:22,990
How do you minimize your staff for that? You all will be working in that environment if you're on the health care delivery side of things.

109
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:28,720
So, okay, so you now know where to find the readings and all of that.

110
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,919
Let me go through.

111
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,090
I'd love for you to. Do you have them pulling in? Yes, I do.

112
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,270
So I think you'll just need to ask, are you locked down?

113
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,060
I'm like, do you want to try to up and get back?

114
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:58,780
And I want to just pull you all to see why a little bit more data about why you're here and see from the hook.

115
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:08,740
And we'll talk about that and we'll take attendance so it.

116
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:23,740
We can pause sharing and you can take any questions while I set this up.

117
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:27,350
Yes, of course.

118
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:36,480
For can. So one thing that I hope you all feel when you leave here or even when you're here, realize the commitment to this program.

119
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:46,400
I love Michigan and I love the time I had here and the professors I had here, the professor that taught this course when I was here is Professor John.

120
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,830
And so he met with me like five or six times to make sure I didn't screw it up.

121
00:12:53,010 --> 00:13:03,000
And I was taking over the years he was known for like throwing stuff at you in class and swearing often just to make sure you're paying attention.

122
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:13,710
But he also, like, was challenging for me to think about health care and what's the right answer and how do you deal with some difficult things.

123
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,960
And the people that I got to know, including my cohorts.

124
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:29,190
It is really. So I hope you all feel this way too, when you leave this commitment to help others that are students know five years,

125
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:35,430
know ten years from now, but also bringing back the field and what's happening to people.

126
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:42,389
I do a couple other things, too. Community wise, I'm the chair of the Huron Waterloo Pathways Initiative,

127
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:49,740
which is like we're trying to build trails all around this county to make it easy for people to have a healthy,

128
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,020
safe way to exercise, but also maybe commute that reduces carbon footprint, that kind of thing.

129
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,040
Prior to that,

130
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:04,110
I served on the school board for the Ann Arbor Public Schools for ten years because education is one of those few things that is an equalizer.

131
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:11,220
But I think these are things, too, that hopefully when you think about your career and what you want to do with your life,

132
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:19,950
you piece together this mix of your professional life, your home and family and friends, but also the community you live in.

133
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:25,140
So Michigan's part of my community. I live a couple miles from here, so it's easy for me to get to, but.

134
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,020
All right. So can you. Oh, yes, I think so for me.

135
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:53,360
And it's like. Yes. Try one more time.

136
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:04,310
If this fails, we just talk about it out loud so I can try something else pretty quick.

137
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:39,050
Yes. I have to get back to the streets before I leave my house.

138
00:15:43,220 --> 00:16:08,330
It was just one of I wake up to realize that I basically because they're worried about 20 minutes.

139
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:16,140
So I had of a little friends.

140
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:42,190
So, you know, I did that on the second night and I had never seen anything like that.

141
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:54,830
So I really feel like in here I just think I'll try to press and speak.

142
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:03,560
And that is the reason why I suggest to you all is just if you benefit from the work of other people,

143
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:10,790
one of the things you need to do when you're leading stuff is learn fast how to stop fast, right?

144
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,880
And so as you go through your careers,

145
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:22,370
it helps you to read books about the life work of other people because you're learning fast everything they learned in a week.

146
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,180
This one is one about leadership in health care.

147
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:33,470
And this is a story really about Robert Grossman, who is the dean and CEO of New York University Langone Medical Center.

148
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,250
When he became CEO, he was a radiologist there before.

149
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,090
You know what he did the first day? He. Any idea?

150
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:49,860
Let me first paint the picture of what NYU is like. So when I walked into the lobby, I worked with him when he first became CEO there as a consultant.

151
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:57,150
Elevators that the main elevators don't work. The floor getting in there is kind of messy.

152
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,349
There's a radio station ish thing off to the right, but it's kind of dark glass.

153
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:09,670
You're not sure what that what's going on over there. And so on Grossman's first day, what do you think he did as CEO?

154
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:14,820
So kind of a mess, right? Not ranked medical school. New York City.

155
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:22,470
Opportunity to do a great job taking care of sick people, but not ranked medical system either.

156
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:28,060
What do you think? What would you do the first day of the year of cleanup?

157
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:32,520
Okay. Clean it. That's good. Yes. Something tangible that people can see.

158
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:38,880
Anything else? First day, everyone.

159
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:43,410
What's do like one on ones and meet everybody who beat everyone is.

160
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:49,020
I mean it's probably not possible a but I think you can get the key people in a day.

161
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:57,690
But that's not what he did. Any other guests look at the issues and list them like know exactly what's going to happen next, how to fix them?

162
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,190
Yeah, it's a good idea. All good ideas. Not what he did.

163
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,830
Do we have the budget to fix it? That's always the question.

164
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:23,300
Okay, I'll tell you the answer. He fired everybody. Your executive team, he fired you on the fly, and then we shall see.

165
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:32,690
So part of what he thought was wrong and part of the conditions on which he accepted the job of CEO is to fix the culture there, to fix things.

166
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,130
And he was a radiologist there, so he had been working there a little while.

167
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:40,030
He knew how the leadership was received. I knew how things were going.

168
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:45,610
And he said to the board, If you ask me up, I can turn this place around.

169
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:52,470
Which means every person he just fired, you know, is going to the board to say, this guy's a lunatic.

170
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,150
Can't you let him go? Come on. You know. Like, what are we doing here?

171
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:01,860
And they stood by him so that he could fire everybody and change it.

172
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:07,310
How is New York University Langone Medical Center doing today?

173
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:10,710
Because nobody can get it right. So crank up three.

174
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:19,720
Top three. Yep. Anything else? What did they do that's unique in the world?

175
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,430
They offered free medical school. Yes, they did. And what does that do?

176
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:32,860
Um, increases, I guess. One of the bottlenecks that exists keeping doctors out in the field say more.

177
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:41,379
So medical schools, stupid, expensive, and a lot of underrepresentation in the field of medicine exists because of that.

178
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:48,160
And that free medical school is basically focused on fixing a lot of that and representation is getting at something important here.

179
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:56,390
So the other thing that's wrong with how much medical schools cost is it's really difficult unless you're wealthy, to be a primary care physician.

180
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:04,960
When you graduate medical school and undergrad after eight years of school, you have somewhere between 300 and $600,000 of debt.

181
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:14,080
Which how do you sign up for a half a million dollar a year orthopedic surgery job or the $100,000 a year primary care doc job?

182
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,590
What exactly specialties you pick.

183
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:24,120
You have to pick something that pays you back more because your debt is this high.

184
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:31,319
And by the way, all of your peers have a full time job, have a home, maybe have kids, and have a decent income.

185
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:39,730
And you don't. You don't get to be a residents and you're going to make $40,000 a year to work at the top 80,

186
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:48,760
80 hours a week because there's a law now that restricts you, which is a 40 hour per week less workload than you used to have with Matt Lauer.

187
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,120
So he started fixing things there in a way that you can now see results.

188
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:03,380
This book is about that story. So if you want to learn a little bit, not that you're always going to always what's recommended,

189
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:07,370
but if you want to learn a little bit about leadership in health care and how

190
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,790
you deal with difficult situations and how you build rapport with your board,

191
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:18,690
this is a good story about that that you all ought to know. For those of you that want to do consulting.

192
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:27,850
Marvin Bower was the CPA managing director of McKinsey in 1950s to 75.

193
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,270
That's firm was started in 1923 or something like that.

194
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:37,430
They were an accounting and engineering firm. Started out. The title of this book is called The Will to Lead.

195
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,750
And it gets at what we expect of our leaders in anything.

196
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:48,870
So Mackenzie is fairly well known for being the top consultancy when it comes to strategy in any field.

197
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,860
Right. Good reputation ish. Bad reputation.

198
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:59,460
Lately, they're in the news a lot for being corrupt, for working with governments, for undermining some things.

199
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:05,250
Pharmaceuticals. They advised the opioid, like, how can we get more into people's homes?

200
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:12,480
So they've had some issues like way back. Marvin Bower back in the fifties and seventies was a really good integrity kind of person.

201
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:16,350
And he also talked about how important it was to be involved in your community.

202
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:24,120
So if you want to learn about someone that shaped McKenzie and turned it from a little engineering firm into what McKenzie now is today,

203
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:31,700
that's this guy. And this book might help you learn about that faster than you will going through courses and things like that.

204
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:41,340
So just just another example. This one came out last month and this book is called The Song of the Cell.

205
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:50,310
One thing you might want to need to know if you're in health care is stuff about health and science because you live in that space.

206
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,360
So I struggle with his name.

207
00:23:54,360 --> 00:24:07,200
So it hurt them a lot that they see that President Clinton thinks that it's great that this book was called Cancer the Emperor of All Maladies.

208
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:11,700
And it was incredibly well written about what we've done in health care for cancer.

209
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,400
It's kind of like an adventure story, and it's one of my favorite books.

210
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:24,479
I have not read this one yet, but he's an exceptional author and does a great job talking about detailed level cancer risk genes with his next book.

211
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:33,510
And now this one's about the self. But if you all are serious about being in health care, you ought to know a lot about how your body works.

212
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:38,580
And health and science don't have to be. And you can't be in management everything.

213
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:43,530
You can't be an air doc and a pathologist and a nurse and housekeeping.

214
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:50,790
You have to rely on your teams to manage and make the system work, but you help yourself.

215
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:53,460
The more you know about how things really work.

216
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:58,770
So these are three books I wanted to bring with you, to you today, just to give you a little sense of the kinds of things.

217
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:06,120
I'll keep doing this about this semester, and I'll leave you with a reading list so that when you do have time to pick away at some things over time.

218
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,830
Okay, let's do that. It. We're ready. Yeah. All right, let's take one.

219
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:22,430
So you you go to this website. What? You've taken each MP 603 or you can text this number and then select your response A, B or C.

220
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:27,570
So we're just trying to get an idea of who we're working with here.

221
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,169
And yeah, and there are five questions.

222
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:40,080
So some of the questions in the future are just one word responses, but you can respond as many times you want and we'll go over well,

223
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:46,230
we'll get started with this one, so we'll start shifting over to the responses.

224
00:25:50,280 --> 00:26:07,969
Real time data. Yep. Nice. Number of responses.

225
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:17,080
We are about 42 responses that were having trouble getting to the mine is asking me to come.

226
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,790
No, I think you can ask. Yes, do it. Of course you.

227
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:52,880
And the reason that this is looking so good, because almost half of you have had a full time job in health care.

228
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:57,890
And yeah, most of you have had some experience and a few of you haven't.

229
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:04,580
But that's helpful for me to know, just in terms of how we're talking about health care and the familiarity level that you all need.

230
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:09,500
So I'll try to be cognizant of that throughout the semester.

231
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:17,089
And next question. One word.

232
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:21,020
What do you use to describe yourself? Every man is tough.

233
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,040
Just pick one. Good.

234
00:27:25,760 --> 00:28:02,499
And. Kids with an interest in like Jackie Chan, Donnie Yen, who's the jackhammer here?

235
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,810
That's what I listen to. The song is based on the number of his words.

236
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:19,920
That's going to have to go for each.

237
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:30,130
Got it, she said. Yeah, I mean, why don't you graduate if you want to?

238
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:42,040
We need more time. Are we good? Okay, that's good.

239
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,250
Yes. I use one one word responses.

240
00:28:48,250 --> 00:29:05,930
We can respond three times. What skills or knowledge you want to hear because you're a Girlboss or you want to learn how to be a Girlboss guy.

241
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:10,260
Okay. I mean.

242
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:30,400
One more. So we're going to get more in the piece and we'll.

243
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:56,980
Because also going into graduation. So the parents of whoever put nepotism on there and very proud of.

244
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:07,680
You know, I think that if got to continue.

245
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:17,550
Yes. Thank you. So this one's an interesting one.

246
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:20,360
What are the biggest challenges facing the industry today?

247
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:27,290
And you can add your own word and you can also upvote or downvote other people's words that they've added.

248
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:34,340
You really think accessibility or competition are important ones about those or some of them?

249
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:22,150
Oh, yes. It's a great list. It's just a lot of accessibility.

250
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:46,469
It's nice. All right.

251
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:54,550
So last question here. What can we do about those challenges?

252
00:31:54,560 --> 00:32:01,230
We're. And this one you can answer in a sentence or a couple of words.

253
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:17,050
Okay. He.

254
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:30,390
There's a word for this radically change health care systems and not patching.

255
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:31,500
It's called kludge.

256
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:40,240
Ocracy is to kind of make incremental tiny changes and you end up with this ugly patchwork quilt that's not doesn't really in a corporation anything.

257
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Yeah yeah. Kludge ocracy comes together in something new today.

258
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:51,390
I love that. I learned that from one of my peers here for Accounting Genius.

259
00:32:51,510 --> 00:33:06,470
It's like, Hey Al, you closed it because so many things go on and.

260
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,330
That's right. I mean, it just sounds ugly.

261
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:32,900
It's like I said, an interview. It's like she said, of course.

262
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:42,890
Yes, that's fine. That's everything.

263
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:52,670
Thank you, guys. I wanted to get a show of hands to you about what you're thinking you want to do with your career.

264
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:11,270
How many of you want to go into health care management? Just kind of show us that consulting and tell your side of the policy.

265
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,730
Venture capital. That's it.

266
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:29,860
All right. That's a good distribution, I think, too. So that's that's fantastic.

267
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:37,809
I think that'll really help me also make sure we have a very diverse set of have to talk about what's going on in health care and hospital systems.

268
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:45,420
And we're providing a lot of filters for you to think about how we describe how I want to be

269
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:52,720
attending business and I want to do that now is some of the things we'll do in this course.

270
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:58,870
You will have lots of opportunity to work in teams, but I also want to help you to become better,

271
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:04,750
more articulate about how you communicate and and also present here.

272
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:08,890
So this will become a safe space for you to practice that.

273
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:14,950
We'll go through the course overview in a minute. But in-person time here is important.

274
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:22,060
Obviously, if we get another variant of COVID or something else and we need to adjust, we know how to do that.

275
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:27,100
That's the good news these days. But while we're able to be here safely among each other,

276
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:32,020
I would love it if we can work as teams and give you all that opportunity to really

277
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:39,570
practice being here and being articulate about what you need to communicate to whomever.

278
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:49,510
A team that you're working with, a board member at your institution, your boss's boss's boss is angry or upset, family or patient.

279
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,490
Just being able to handle the different ways that you have to communicate.

280
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,510
Each of you will have to do that in your work, and that will be one of the skills,

281
00:35:58,510 --> 00:36:03,540
tactical skills we'll be working on here, which is difficult to do at home.

282
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:08,470
And so we missed some of that opportunity remote. I wasn't able to mimic that very well,

283
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:17,440
but I will just call your name and probably just your first name because I will communicate with your

284
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,769
last names so you can see kind of the order you're in and just love to see show hand where you are.

285
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:30,879
So my apologies. Is this Louie or is that correct?

286
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:54,100
That's cool. What do you like that? They want to take a away when you say, okay, oh, hey, that's a mirror.

287
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:59,260
I think you may have to help me a couple of times, so.

288
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,570
Andrew. Great. Joshua. Great.

289
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:09,350
Great. Elizabeth Simmons.

290
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,250
But they are not great.

291
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:21,460
I'm sure you do. Too. Wacky indeed is what you get free.

292
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:25,990
Right, Cameron?

293
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:31,930
If you need to miss class. Some of you Friday mornings are a good interview time, as it turns out.

294
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,680
Just let me know that you're not going to make it for some reason.

295
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:41,880
These are recorded. You can watch them, but you will miss some of that in-person exchange.

296
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:49,270
So just so you know. But that would be excused if you're not feeling well or you're worried about having something or you have an interview.

297
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:52,780
Those are things in the hands of others. Fabian.

298
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:58,080
Evan Saban. Natasha.

299
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,570
Lauren. Alexandra. And you like it?

300
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:10,950
Yeah. Sarah. And Nora.

301
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:16,010
Nora. Isaiah. Mariam.

302
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:22,100
Mohammed. Three. Nadia.

303
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:30,350
Yasmeen. Sara. Gina.

304
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,720
Jenna. Thank you. Jenna. Abigail.

305
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:41,590
Dani. That's right. Okay.

306
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:46,660
Not just kind of correct, but Shivangi.

307
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,060
Right. Sam. Sam?

308
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,839
Yeah. Okay. So when I.

309
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,260
When you can call me Sylvia. Zoe. Sylvia.

310
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:03,180
Sylvia. Sylvia. Okay. So can you capture that for.

311
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:12,560
So, yes, I think you just need to I want to be respectful of how you like to do your thing here.

312
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:18,530
And correct me, please, Joseph Locascio.

313
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:27,490
She goes by. Mekeisha. Mekeisha. Thank you, Mekeisha.

314
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,580
Claire. Hi, Claire. Justin.

315
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,120
Yeah. Okay. Stephanie. Great.

316
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:41,360
Hi, Stephanie. Krista. Great. Alex.

317
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,380
Alex. Alexa. Here. Okay. Alexa.

318
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:48,160
Yeah. Okay. Great. Eliza. Eliza.

319
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,610
Eliza. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, sure.

320
00:39:51,920 --> 00:40:01,920
So, Matt. Okay. Alexis popularity is very above that of Sydney.

321
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:13,360
And if I said that. Madeline, Natalie, Jamal, Jarren Duran.

322
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:17,730
Do you think you're going to call me Jason? You have a positive proposal.

323
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:21,350
Okay. Say again, Jason. Jason? Yeah.

324
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:24,570
Okay. All right. Run, John.

325
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:28,269
Yeah. I go by running. Content running.

326
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:35,440
Run. Okay. You, Zachary, bring in your first name.

327
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:39,430
Terrible. Zachary. He goes by Zach.

328
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,000
Zach. Okay. Now I can get Mike.

329
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:52,330
Mikey, this Mike. Mike. Thank you. My first name may be Ukrainian.

330
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:57,190
Diana. Hi, Diana. Ruthie. Trudy.

331
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,990
Great. I should especially. Thank you. Connor Great.

332
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:07,600
Alexander Yes. Alex Okay. Not Alexander.

333
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:15,430
Carlos. Unless you're in trouble. Okay. Sofia has Sofia.

334
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,380
Helen, take Helen and bingo.

335
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:26,460
I think you can call me Fara. I wouldn't want one more time.

336
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,979
Tara Farnborough. Yes. Call me.

337
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,410
Phone. It's open. Okay. All right. Thank you.

338
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:38,710
So I won't have these all by next week, so bear with me a little bit, but thank you for going through that with me.

339
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:45,850
Okay. Course overview. Starting next week, we have our first rapid response menu.

340
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:57,150
So next Thursday morning at 9 a.m., I will give you something that's happening now and that is because it will be happening now.

341
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,940
And sometimes I won't even know what the answer is. I'll give you an example.

342
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:08,160
Last year I gave the course the memo of what one of my senders was struggling with.

343
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:16,300
I was sitting at the University of Iowa Medical Center struggling with whether whether to shut down food services or not.

344
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:20,050
We were in a big wave of the pandemic. They were full.

345
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:23,960
They did not have more ethanol coming in, nor did they have more staff.

346
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:29,320
They're also a trauma one center and the only place in the region for a few hundred miles that I was at.

347
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:33,730
So that's the memo. Oh, great.

348
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:41,140
Okay. That's the kind of thing that you may get as a memo and what you need to do.

349
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:47,980
You get instructions about it. You need a one page memo, one page.

350
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,290
And it needs to be formatted like a memo.

351
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:58,389
Which means if I'm walking by you and we were going to have a meeting an hour before this so that I can go meet with the press about whatever

352
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:05,469
the thing is you I need to speak about that got canceled because a meeting came up and that got canceled because something else happened.

353
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,830
And then one of my board members stopped by to all the time you and I had.

354
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:13,269
We don't have. Instead, I'm walking through like, do you have a drone?

355
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:20,499
And you hand it to me. And then as I'm walking, I can read through what's on the memo and do a good job with whatever I need to

356
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,970
say or do or communicate to the party that I'm supposed to communicate with.

357
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:31,480
You will find yourself in this situation often starting this summer in your internships.

358
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:37,630
Maybe not quite at that level where it's a press release kind of thing, but probably to your superior,

359
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:46,990
your person that you're working with at anything, consultancy, health, hospital, whatever, you get good at that here it will be structured.

360
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:51,250
The first thing is those backgrounds. That's one paragraph.

361
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:55,930
What's the context for that? The memo says it's a memo.

362
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,850
It says the date of the memo. It says who it's from. And it says what the topic is.

363
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:04,090
That's how all of them will start. And you'll get good answers.

364
00:44:04,540 --> 00:44:12,970
And if you can't follow directions on that, you should question yourself about why you here hear the.

365
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:18,160
Communication is key to success, especially when things get messy.

366
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:26,530
And so clarity is important. Things need to be titled appropriately well-organized, succinct and impactful.

367
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:31,240
So those will be the memos. Context is first.

368
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:41,360
What you should do about it is next. Write a little bit more detail or analysis, but not a lot because it's one page.

369
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:50,740
And then finally, any end in remarks which could be reiterating some of the what's our plan or something else.

370
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:58,030
So, for example, the memo that people put together for University of Iowa to know the University of Iowa.

371
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:04,180
But I did said what you should do. Do we close that move for COVID patients or not?

372
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:10,630
And why? And that's it. So you'll get something.

373
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:17,530
I don't know what it is yet, but it will be happening now and you'll have 24 hours to turn it in.

374
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,040
Is will be individually assigned. There were two points.

375
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:26,710
It's not major, but I'm looking for over this course, you get really good at that.

376
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:35,110
So being succinct is hard. You can write ten pages better faster than you can write one.

377
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,429
Do you agree? Have you ever had that like, oh, I got, I've got this assignment do and it's I've got to turn it.

378
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:46,010
But if someone asks you to do one page. It's harder, right?

379
00:45:47,390 --> 00:45:53,960
You have to be succinct. It has to be impactful. And it takes more thought about how to write what's there.

380
00:45:54,200 --> 00:46:01,330
I do this every Saturday morning. I write an update to my board and what's going on at that week.

381
00:46:02,150 --> 00:46:09,050
And I find as I'm reading this, these guys are ladies and gentlemen, they're all over the world.

382
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:14,120
When my new president is in Singapore, they're all physicians except two lawyers.

383
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:17,950
And they're busy. Right. So who the heck wants to read?

384
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:24,290
I think that. My God, I can't believe I wrote that down. If this has happened, you know, this is what's coming up.

385
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:28,130
I think till then, I there's no time for that.

386
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:34,129
The words matter. And so I find myself going back before I hit send and deleting sentences,

387
00:46:34,130 --> 00:46:39,110
deleting paragraphs, reorganizing things as I'm going through top of mind what's happening?

388
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:45,530
That doesn't matter when I reread it sometimes. And so I too struggle with the one page memo.

389
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:53,150
So you're always going to be getting better at that, but you'll get good at it here so that by when you start your internship this summer,

390
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:57,450
you'll be able to communicate effectively with whomever you're working with.

391
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,530
Faces. Oh, yeah, go ahead. Should we be citing research articles in these models or.

392
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:09,320
No, you can, but that you have to be careful about how much space that takes up.

393
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:14,900
It's good to have a credible source for what you're recommending.

394
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:20,210
What you don't want is a long end of that one page.

395
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:24,490
That's all references. Right. So they have it on the page.

396
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:30,260
They have to fit on one page. You can't do two pages. There's no because of the scenario I was just describing.

397
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:33,830
You and I were supposed to talk. I'm going in to meet with the press.

398
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,570
Here's my memo about what I'm supposed to say. And all that time we had I don't have time for two pages.

399
00:47:38,870 --> 00:47:44,349
I can look at the words I'm walking over like. Yes, no, I agree with this.

400
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,660
No, I don't agree with that. Okay. But I'm okay. I'm ready. That's it.

401
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:54,040
There's no time for two pages. So one page with your references.

402
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,520
Be careful. Cases.

403
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,930
We try to also make us real things that matter.

404
00:48:02,110 --> 00:48:06,520
So we have two cases that are Harvard Business publications.

405
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:14,230
One is about pandemic related stuff. It's the Department of Public Health in San Francisco, which, if you recall,

406
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:19,540
was one of the early places that started thinking about setting up tents in the city.

407
00:48:19,870 --> 00:48:23,400
And people thought they were crazy. They're crazy.

408
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:33,500
That's crazy. So that's one of the cases so that you can learn what happened there and you

409
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,600
can get good at putting together a deliverable which has an executive summary.

410
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:46,490
It has your analysis in the background. First, your analysis about the approach you recommend, your approach that you recommend.

411
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:51,140
What's wrong with your approach? How are we going to do it? So implementation plan.

412
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:55,430
How fast? Easy is this to do? What do you think? What are the steps? You have to think about that.

413
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:01,410
And then you have to write something about risk mitigation. What if it doesn't go the way you think?

414
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:06,040
How are you going to know early and change the path that you're on? That's your cases.

415
00:49:06,070 --> 00:49:11,770
All of them will be the same way. And then our last thing we'll do together is a strategic plan.

416
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:20,290
That's basically your final. You'll be randomly assigned in groups, a entity to work with.

417
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:32,770
So developing their strategic plan. I'll be thinking about the centers or health systems or other things that we might want to do.

418
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:38,440
And I'll give you an example of one that kind of no longer exists that we did, which is haven.

419
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,270
Anybody know what that is or was? Say it again. Haven. Haven.

420
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:54,810
So couple organizations who are largely seen as maybe know what they're doing.

421
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:06,090
JPMorgan Chase, it wasn't an organization that can fix health care.

422
00:50:06,510 --> 00:50:11,340
These guys can't. Let's fix it. And who did they hire to be their CEO?

423
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:19,590
Until one day, one of the assignments you'll have is a reading assignment is the thing that put a tool on the map,

424
00:50:20,010 --> 00:50:23,340
which is a article about cost in McAllen, Texas.

425
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:30,719
And that was like a what in the world is going on here kind of article where the costs per person in McAllen,

426
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:35,010
Texas, which I was at just this past summer, helping set up an excellent program there.

427
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:40,530
It's twice the cost per person of anywhere else in this country.

428
00:50:41,370 --> 00:50:45,780
This is a border town in Texas, very close to Mexico.

429
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,079
How and why? Why? And so a tool went and explored that.

430
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:55,979
And because of a tool, things changed there five years later.

431
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:00,690
It was embarrassing, humiliating, actually published this in The New Yorker, of all things.

432
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:04,540
Not an academic journal, but it changed the trajectory of that town.

433
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:11,700
So they hired him to be the CEO. And you could argue and we thought I didn't know at the time, maybe they.

434
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,910
Well, how hard can health care be to fix, right?

435
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:20,610
Throw the best people that we can think of at it, private side fix it.

436
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:26,960
And they they didn't. But that was one of the strategic plan assignments.

437
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:28,310
Just to give you a flavor.

438
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:33,500
And some of them are classic ones, like the one near and dear to our hearts right here down the street from Michigan Medicine.

439
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:42,170
You may or may not get that one Cleveland Clinic mail. Those are often seen as leading health institutions from a brand or reputation perspective.

440
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:49,460
So think about what they should do next. Anyway, you'll get that as you're basically your final exam.

441
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:53,600
And the way your final exam will work is those are due in mid-April.

442
00:51:54,290 --> 00:52:01,099
Your teens will present and this is kind of your last opportunity to get good at every one of you having a role,

443
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:04,370
to say something, to talk about your strategic plan.

444
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:11,550
Okay. Questions about that. Well, we'll help you.

445
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:12,360
It'll be okay.

446
00:52:13,410 --> 00:52:23,430
But I think it'll also be a good way to reinforce the learnings about health care systems and operations and what we do here required material.

447
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:31,950
I'll try to provide as much as I can. I do recommend you get Griffith's book on the well-managed health care organization.

448
00:52:32,580 --> 00:52:37,710
You'll be surprised how often it's nice to have something that is an actual reference book.

449
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,370
It's not your most engaging reading.

450
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:47,400
It's not nice, but what it does have is a good list of the basics.

451
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:52,590
And for that, for this class and where you are in your careers, it's a good reference material.

452
00:52:52,860 --> 00:53:00,570
I think I have five of these additions from when I was here as a student in your shoes to this latest version here.

453
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:10,470
And there's some other readings. Again, I'll put a quick recommendation list together for you so you can have that.

454
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:18,090
But I'll bring up why some of these as we go through it and where we have we're touching on a topic that a book touches on,

455
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,900
offering those up that suggested reading, but not the whole book.

456
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:26,190
Those are good books, but they're kind of outdated because they changed a lot of that.

457
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:28,770
It sure did. Yeah. Yeah.

458
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:36,780
And so this is kind of this odd juxtaposition where in which we'll go through a little bit and lecture today about how much health care costs.

459
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,230
It still costs a lot. The pandemic didn't change any of that.

460
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:47,819
And so you all as you're entering health care a year from now, not this summer,

461
00:53:47,820 --> 00:53:52,860
but next summer, you all are released into the world of health care to go fix it.

462
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:57,809
You still have some of the foundational issues we had before the pandemic.

463
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:02,490
Only now they got just a little bit worse. A little bit worse.

464
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:11,110
So maybe that's a good Segway. We went through this already.

465
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:20,050
It's a good Segway to get into the content of the lecture. And one of the things I wanted to bring to everything that we do here.

466
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:26,770
If you aren't thinking about the patients that we serve in health care and the communities we serve in health care,

467
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,730
there, again, probably should not be here.

468
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:35,660
That's the anchor. Why don't we do stuff?

469
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:42,500
You are in health care leadership. You don't touch one life at a time.

470
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:53,810
It's worse than that. And it's better than that because if you're managing stuff, if you're managing a health system, what are you responsible for?

471
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:02,180
Let's say you're the CEO, machinist or David Miller, Marshall Rank.

472
00:55:02,850 --> 00:55:05,950
What's. You're responsible for it.

473
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:11,170
Yeah. Uh, the patients, providers, the community, everything, basically.

474
00:55:11,260 --> 00:55:20,980
Yeah, kind of. You touch in the cemetery? Yes. The patients, every patient by block, every patient that makes his or her way to your campus,

475
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:26,020
you have to treat by federal law a federal law called Metulla.

476
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,110
You can't turn them away because they can't pay.

477
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:36,040
You can't say, gosh, I really don't think you need the E.R. and just down the sidewalk a little further.

478
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:41,260
That'd be great. You're responsible for every person that makes it to your campus.

479
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,490
That includes staff. Thousands of staff.

480
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:51,670
That's physicians. It's nurses. It's housekeepers. It's valet service.

481
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:55,780
It's the engineers that work on repairing the buildings.

482
00:55:56,050 --> 00:56:01,690
It's the I.T. staff that run your H.R. and all of the systems that can be breached.

483
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:08,890
It's when you get hurt. Your legal team and your I.T. team and all the people that come to protect the patient data that just got stolen.

484
00:56:09,610 --> 00:56:13,930
You get at all. Get it off.

485
00:56:15,550 --> 00:56:23,950
That's what this program is about, is understanding that and also understanding on the policy side, you're not just responsible for one system.

486
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:28,450
So if you're Marshall Grundy, you just have Michigan medicine to worry about.

487
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:37,929
You don't have the U.S. health system to worry about. But if you're in policy and you helped write Obamacare legislation or you help

488
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:43,030
write the next piece of legislation that every health system then has to be.

489
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:48,080
Comply with you affect all the lives then.

490
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:53,100
So your responsibility, one could argue, is even greater.

491
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:58,860
And that's how we need to think about our work here. It's all the people.

492
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:05,470
This is a good picture and a good moment, but a patient that's dying.

493
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:15,960
If you can look at that picture. You can see I borrowed the two things from this, this woman who did a sexual job as a physician during the pandemic.

494
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:19,990
She put a tweet out. This is her tweet.

495
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:34,310
We see that. You see?

496
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:45,290
But also on the job description.

497
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:58,280
And I think that's a lot of what is required for a lot of health care providers are doing what we're trying to do right now.

498
00:57:58,730 --> 00:58:12,650
How do you feel when you look at this? You know, just empathy and compassion and how can you make it full screen so we can actually.

499
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:22,040
Let me just open that up a little bit.

500
00:58:22,610 --> 00:58:31,310
Yes. Do we have access to the slide deck?

501
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:36,920
Yeah, I'll post it after class. I just didn't want you all to cheat about the things that I was going to ask you about today.

502
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:41,470
So I will post it after so you don't get this.

503
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:50,960
So if you can't read, this is sort of a dark room and darkens this, patients dying and the patients dying alone.

504
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:54,830
So the days during the pandemic, nobody can. Nobody's in there.

505
00:58:55,580 --> 00:59:01,970
And the nursing staff has cut out hearts and put a little light string of light

506
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:08,480
above this patient so that the patients can die with a little bit more comfort,

507
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,400
maybe a little more dignity than the rest.

508
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:23,730
It's somewhat similar. I saw a photo a long time ago about a children's hospital where they had the window cleaners dress up as like super athletes.

509
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:29,160
That's really cool. So I thought that was and I said that was a great. I loved that.

510
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:33,660
These are your opportunities. So to to create the kind of culture where these things are.

511
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:41,309
Okay. Did a little hearts violate your materials policy about what should be there?

512
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:45,890
Maybe just have to get the lights from doing they sterilize before they would do.

513
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:55,170
But if you create the kind of culture where people can think about a patient and a patient that's dying and has to die by themselves,

514
00:59:55,170 --> 00:59:59,970
which happened a lot during the pandemic, it's worth doing.

515
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:09,630
In her paper that I had, and I hope you take some time to read it.

516
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,400
Her paper is called Brave Enough.

517
01:00:16,810 --> 01:00:27,850
And this same woman describes treating a patient, a COVID patients whose son, a man with a grown son who just doesn't think she needs to do that,

518
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:33,340
doesn't think he has COVID, doesn't think he needs to be vented, doesn't think she knows what she's doing,

519
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,450
challenges everything she says, and she gets pretty frustrated.

520
01:00:40,190 --> 01:00:47,049
That's not an uncommon thing that happens. We went from health care heroes and she is seeing a lot of that stuff early in the pandemic.

521
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:54,670
And we were clapping and celebrating our health care workforce early in the pandemic.

522
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:58,300
And fast forward to a year later and they're enemy number one.

523
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:11,110
Enemy number one, right? She describes her work trying to treat a patient whose family is resisting the recommendations.

524
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:16,160
And she is able to get this person the care he needs.

525
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:23,810
She's able to put him on a bench. She's able to get some things done, but an enormous personal cost to herself.

526
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,029
And so she goes home to one day where the son is yelling at her and challenging

527
01:01:29,030 --> 01:01:34,970
her and telling her she doesn't need to put his dad on events and the savvy.

528
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:46,239
It's hard to be challenged like that. It's hard to be told.

529
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:50,110
You don't know what you're doing. It's hard to be told.

530
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:54,070
No, I don't have coverage. That's not a thing that's made up.

531
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:05,120
So this is a little bit of what you're walking into now and what you're also walking into which we heard at the DLC symposium this fall.

532
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:13,160
How's that going for health care workers right now? How's that going, gentlemen?

533
01:02:13,380 --> 01:02:17,670
So you and I actually. They've left. They've left.

534
01:02:18,810 --> 01:02:21,180
If you get frustrated enough, you're not there anymore.

535
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:29,920
And if you're left and you're a staff, you're doing more work to take care of the same patient work because you're done.

536
01:02:30,970 --> 01:02:34,290
Right. So that's how it's going.

537
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:38,670
I'll give you one of the things I wanted to share today.

538
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,559
I thought this is brilliantly done, but it gets into them. Health care general.

539
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:49,380
And what what goes on here? How's that going? So let's take a listen to this one together for 8 minutes.

540
01:02:49,830 --> 01:03:01,840
If you guys don't mind. Coming up, this helicopter has a seven month old baby who's fighting for his life.

541
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:14,140
That's him, Theo Mazur. He has a respiratory virus and is being transferred into this pediatric ICU from another hospital.

542
01:03:14,470 --> 01:03:20,290
Tonight, he's comfortable just thinking with the team rushes to get Theo on oxygen.

543
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:33,100
Then Theodore emphasizes the importance of Michael's increased walking, breathing, shortness of breath,

544
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:47,680
congestion on the line as demands and know what is being left unsaid by the doctors still not out of the woods.

545
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:58,959
An unprecedented surge in a respiratory illness among children.

546
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,300
A rising number of cases of the flu, RSV and COVID 19 is a common virus.

547
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:09,379
But due to the isolation of the pandemic, kids have now gotten exposed and not of opportunity.

548
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:16,690
In Michigan, six year old is no die from, as Dallas County has reported, its first flu, Dallas death of a child here in Southern California.

549
01:04:17,320 --> 01:04:21,100
For nearly three years I've been reporting from the pandemic's front line.

550
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:26,110
Now America is facing yet another surge, but this crisis is different.

551
01:04:26,410 --> 01:04:30,130
It's attacking children. This is our pediatric pandemic.

552
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:33,729
The floodgates have opened. They're coming. They're coming in droves.

553
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:36,880
Our hospital is being overrun and we need help.

554
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:41,950
I want to find out why hospitals are overwhelmed by such common viruses.

555
01:04:42,610 --> 01:04:48,130
Is it just because of an unprecedented number of sick kids or is something else at play?

556
01:04:50,500 --> 01:04:53,620
Your parents weren't allowed on the evacuation helicopter.

557
01:04:54,340 --> 01:04:59,350
I i they arrived nearly 2 hours later.

558
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:05,920
Nervous wrecks. So I think this is the peak of his numbness right now and is making it really hard for him to breathe.

559
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:10,040
But we're here and he's being watched. Yet you're worried about him.

560
01:05:10,130 --> 01:05:17,050
He's going in the wrong direction. We'll tell you later that night.

561
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:25,570
The doctor delivers bad news. Theo is indeed heading in the wrong direction and will need to take additional measures to try to save his life.

562
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:36,000
This is Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital. It has one of the only pediatric ICU in Connecticut.

563
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:40,530
So they made a commitment to not turn away any child in their state.

564
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:46,450
But it's been challenging to uphold along with our strength.

565
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:49,470
And that's our national coming out.

566
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:56,250
We have calls from Massachusetts, from Rhode Island, from Maine, from New York,

567
01:05:56,520 --> 01:06:02,600
saying even a child who needs an ICU and we send them to Connecticut and we said, you can't we don't have this.

568
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:06,490
They don't have enough nurses and they don't have enough beds.

569
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:09,720
So they even converted their playroom into an ICU.

570
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:20,010
Most other hospitals don't have the equipment or expertise to care for children as sick as the pediatric patients are, not just small adults.

571
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:25,440
And we use 40 times that pretty, but it's been there all 40 times.

572
01:06:25,620 --> 01:06:34,680
That is not known how they really feel like child even if they take care of adults.

573
01:06:35,490 --> 01:06:44,010
The difference in the life and death. Critically ill children are four times as likely to die at hospitals without pediatric expertise.

574
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:53,330
So people hospitals care for so emergencies. Medicare was one of the most well-resourced states in the country.

575
01:06:54,080 --> 01:07:03,950
To understand, we need to go way back before the pandemic and pediatric unit shut down study hospital in Boston down since 2008,

576
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:09,590
20% of different departments in hospitals across America have closed theatrically.

577
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,860
It's engineered less complex care than adults, and that means they make less money for hospitals.

578
01:07:16,310 --> 01:07:18,110
So additional beds for it's a joke.

579
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:26,720
Minimal decades of profit driven decision making and gutting theatrical closures would be life threatening because we are losing such a vital service.

580
01:07:27,170 --> 01:07:29,150
But there's another reason kids aren't lucrative.

581
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:37,430
The government pays for the majority of children's health care in the US, mostly through Medicaid, and they are woefully underpaid in America.

582
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:43,580
Saving kids is just bad business. That's created health care deserts for critically ill patients.

583
01:07:43,970 --> 01:07:51,160
Children just sitting and languishing in emergency departments, not getting the correct treat, especially in rural areas.

584
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:57,800
Have to go out of state to why you are seeing it and levies hospitals like this one should shoulder the burden.

585
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:06,360
During my three days inside this ICU, I routinely see parents crying.

586
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:20,540
The experience following this, normally a feisty little kid. Michael and Jonathan have a foster child with RSV and hoping to adopt him.

587
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:30,860
Four year old Talia has been in the pediatric ICU for more than 100 days with the rare disease that may have been triggered by COVID.

588
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:42,410
You know, our life very, very much revolves around our children.

589
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:50,600
I need my daughter to come home to me, thinking that's inside my mind that there is something that's not really.

590
01:08:50,610 --> 01:08:58,900
Because in order to uphold the commitment the hospital made to the state, the nurses are stretched thin.

591
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:09,660
It's overwhelming. I think everyone is a little burnt out under saving it.

592
01:09:10,110 --> 01:09:15,660
Our goal is to always try to make it so that families don't feel the weight of maybe what we're feeling.

593
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:24,180
I feel like I'm a mom of 100 people and when I get home, I'm not such a good mom.

594
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:28,710
But as nurses, that's what we do, right? We care for everyone else but ourselves.

595
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:35,610
As the transfer calls command, the team has to ask themselves, Can they take this patient on?

596
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:39,840
Do they have enough nurses, enough space? Will the other patients suffer?

597
01:09:40,350 --> 01:09:43,410
There have been times when we have pushed those plans.

598
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:46,650
There are times when it doesn't feel safe.

599
01:09:46,830 --> 01:09:54,560
I see this question all the time as it is not providing the tens of thousands of.

600
01:09:57,330 --> 01:10:03,780
That's a balance fishermen have to strike. This search has exposed a failure of our health care system.

601
01:10:04,350 --> 01:10:07,800
The U.S. is ill equipped to care for children in emergencies.

602
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:15,870
Less than three viruses don't just occur in your pediatric ICU, nor do more common accidents like car crashes.

603
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:20,250
Children deserve access to care in their own communities.

604
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:26,370
The government can fix this by incentivizing hospitals to invest in pediatrics.

605
01:10:27,450 --> 01:10:36,030
Congress has considered recent bills such as one that would increase Medicaid payments and another that would invest in pediatric critical care.

606
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:40,950
But none have been signed into law. That's unacceptable.

607
01:10:47,050 --> 01:10:56,440
The next morning, [INAUDIBLE] turn the corner. So he made it home for Christmas.

608
01:10:58,530 --> 01:11:01,740
It's time for America to start taking care of its children.

609
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:16,210
Saving SIDS doesn't have to be bad business. Yes.

610
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:21,730
Thanks for listening to that one. But I need to.

611
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:29,819
I think that's kind of a standard thing. I mean, hospitals are pushing away from inpatient.

612
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:33,750
They're pushing away from primary care because they're just not profitable.

613
01:11:33,810 --> 01:11:37,440
It's a trend that's been going on for some time, I think for a lot of reasons.

614
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:42,110
You know, some things become sad.

615
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:46,590
There's not as much preventative care in primary care and pediatric care.

616
01:11:47,570 --> 01:12:05,190
But if you think about it that way, everyone that's a CEO of a children's hospital right now is.

617
01:12:06,540 --> 01:12:15,910
Sensible for this situation. Everyone that's a legislator in you see is also something like this.

618
01:12:18,430 --> 01:12:24,940
If you go into a children's hospital in the next couple of years and start working there, you too are part of the problem.

619
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:34,510
So you lead this program with ideas and passion about how to solve these things.

620
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:45,820
And what I would have you think about when we think about looking at something like this is how difficult it is to actually solve the problem,

621
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:53,230
because it takes multiple takes. It takes the policy side, which I'm saying high here because it affects so many lives if you change the policy.

622
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:56,560
It takes leadership at your health system.

623
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:05,050
It takes thinking outside the box about partnering with your local community, partnering so that communities health might improve.

624
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:12,700
So there's things you can do in within the system and without outside of the system to try to advance things.

625
01:13:13,120 --> 01:13:24,070
And yet you will inherit this situation. And the situation is pediatrics doesn't make money or does women's health care make money?

626
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:29,860
And so when you at the CEO level or upper leadership level have to think about

627
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:35,440
balancing your budget and making sure you're profitable so you can continue to survive.

628
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:41,380
You've all heard the phrase no margin, no mission. How many people have heard that phrase before?

629
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:45,460
Right. It's a [INAUDIBLE] phrase. Right.

630
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:50,230
It's kind of something that you want to say. And yet it's true.

631
01:13:51,550 --> 01:13:59,590
And yet it's true. You have to be able to survive as a health system to continue to stay in existence so you can continue to employ people,

632
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:04,570
so you can continue to take care. And yet you too, will have to balance your budget.

633
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:10,940
You, too, will have to think about the service lines that make money so you can subsidize things like pediatrics.

634
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:14,710
That doesn't. And that's kind of what we've been doing.

635
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,430
So you'll still have that to work with.

636
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:28,720
But let's let's go on a little break and just think about that as you walk into now, we'll orient you to the bigger kind of systems system you.

637
01:14:29,110 --> 01:14:32,290
Okay, let's take a ten minute break to that sort of thing.

638
01:14:32,410 --> 01:14:35,790
So intensity will come back. Okay.

639
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:46,703
So it's like three parts, you know, came from I got myself from here, I and I was like, oh, I don't know.
