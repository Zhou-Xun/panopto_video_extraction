1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:03,810
This video is about calculating costs.

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,978
When we think about costs there are several ways we can categorize the costs.

3
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:12,086
And we wanna think about all these categories of costs and direct costs,

4
00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:16,463
indirect costs, things like someone's time and not the short term costs but

5
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:18,640
also long term costs.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,300
When we wanna estimate costs and high level overview is four basic steps here.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,703
First, we wanna identify the type of resource affected by the intervention.

8
00:00:27,703 --> 00:00:31,378
Might be doctor's visits, hospitalizations, vaccines given out.

9
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:34,621
Two is identified the amount of each type of resources used.

10
00:00:34,621 --> 00:00:40,140
So, one dose of vaccine or three doses of vaccine, seven hours of nurse time.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,470
Then we monetize the per unit cost of each type of resource.

12
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,840
So maybe $50 an hour for our nurses time.

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,232
And then we calculate the total,

14
00:00:49,232 --> 00:00:54,630
we multiply those quantities per unit costs and sum those all up together.

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:01:00,240
So quantities times price and then we sum those all those items up.

16
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,848
When we think about costing, we can think about it from two different perspectives

17
00:01:03,848 --> 00:01:05,980
also we can think about macro and micro costing.

18
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:09,501
What I just described to you is kind of micro costing.

19
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:12,040
So you break out all the elements and add them up.

20
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,901
But you can also do macro costing.

21
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:18,390
So for example the cost of a heart attack, you might be able to just find the cost of

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,693
a heart attack from some sort of administrative database or

23
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:23,940
maybe Medicare reimbursement.

24
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,511
Or you could micro cost it.

25
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:31,110
So you could figure out all the different components and sum those up.

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,601
And depending on what the focus of your intervention is, you may want to just grab

27
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:42,446
macro costs or you might actually wanna go through the exercise of the micro costing.

28
00:01:42,446 --> 00:01:46,390
To get that cost data there are several places databases providers,

29
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,607
there are many other studies in the literature which can give you cost data

30
00:01:50,607 --> 00:01:53,240
and then finally expert opinions.

31
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,076
Some useful databases for collecting costs would be the Health Care, Cost and

32
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,040
Utilization Project or hcupnet.ahrq.

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,065
That has a lot of good information on inpatient hospitalization and

34
00:02:04,065 --> 00:02:06,040
emergency department costs.

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,278
Then there are outpatient visits,

36
00:02:08,278 --> 00:02:12,761
which can be costed from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, MEPS.

37
00:02:12,761 --> 00:02:14,585
That is a lot of good data there.

38
00:02:14,585 --> 00:02:18,446
One note that those data are not disease specific, so they might be for

39
00:02:18,446 --> 00:02:22,040
different types of visits but not for specific diseases.

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,625
Then there's Health Care Blue Book which is a nice kind of

41
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:30,350
new interesting source which tries to figure out what things should cost.

42
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:33,550
And also Medicare, we can use Medicare pricing.

43
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:39,050
Medicare pricing is very useful but it can be kind of complicated as well.

44
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:44,601
Medicare has several different parts, we can think of several here Part A B and D.

45
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:46,430
Are usually useful for costing.

46
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,966
Part A, is for inpatient and outpatient hospital services,

47
00:02:49,966 --> 00:02:53,232
skilled nursing facility services in home health care.

48
00:02:53,232 --> 00:02:56,719
Part B, is physician services, tests, outpatient procedures and

49
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:59,340
therapies and durable medical equipment.

50
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,464
And then part D is the new outpatient drugs.

51
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:10,331
To get that Medicare data often times you wanna look at Medicare reimbursement.

52
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:16,072
Here there's impatient which is gonna be grouped by diagnosis related group or

53
00:03:16,072 --> 00:03:20,884
DRG payments to the facilities for specific hospital diagnosis.

54
00:03:20,884 --> 00:03:25,034
For physician procedures, that will be organized by CPT or

55
00:03:25,034 --> 00:03:27,950
common procedural terminology coding.

56
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:33,139
Outpatient Medicare data will be generally organized by out

57
00:03:33,139 --> 00:03:38,645
patient perspective payment service PPS also by the CPT codes.

58
00:03:38,645 --> 00:03:41,631
Drugs, you can look at Medicare reimbursement for drugs.

59
00:03:41,631 --> 00:03:45,491
You can also look up Medicare, sorry, drug information in the tool called

60
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,640
the Red Book, which is available at the university.

61
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,834
And lab fees,the centers for Medicare and

62
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:56,290
Medicaid Services has a clinical lab fee schedule as well.

63
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,380
If you want some more details on this, I have some documentation on how you can try

64
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,140
to figure out the costing from all these different sources.

65
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,561
So that is the Medicare costing.

66
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:09,281
But sometimes we might have some costs that we need to adjust.

67
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:14,168
And what we wanna do here is figure out what is the current value of

68
00:04:14,168 --> 00:04:16,940
using societal resources.

69
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,930
And there's several different ways we wanna adjust the cost data.

70
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,371
There is the cost to charge ratio.

71
00:04:23,371 --> 00:04:24,929
So if you have some charge data,

72
00:04:24,929 --> 00:04:28,820
you could use the cost-to-charge ratio to figure out what the actual cost is.

73
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,570
You can also adjust cost data with inflation adjusting.

74
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:36,430
And finally we can do some discounting of cost data.

75
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,061
So first of all the cost-to-charge ratio,

76
00:04:39,061 --> 00:04:43,782
providers typically have charges that are much higher than their actual costs.

77
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:45,186
And why is this?

78
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:49,800
Well, partially needs to make up for uncompensated care.

79
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,233
They need some profit margins in there and

80
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:56,691
oftentimes the payer's insurance companies for example have discounts.

81
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:59,214
So they start off with their really high charges and

82
00:04:59,214 --> 00:05:03,270
the actual payers pay something much less than that.

83
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,808
So if you see something that refers to charges then you wanna

84
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:08,840
adjust this by a cost-to-charge ratio.

85
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:15,640
So simply put this the cost would be the charges times this cost-to-charge ratio.

86
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,700
Where do you get these costs in charge ratios?

87
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:22,790
Medicare's medical provider analysis and review Medpar data.

88
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,330
There's some data in appendix D of the Muennig book.

89
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:30,810
Also the health care costs and utilization project HCUP.

90
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,840
That data also has costs and charges.

91
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:37,635
So you could look at similar procedures and get a cost-to-charge ratio

92
00:05:37,635 --> 00:05:41,820
from that and or sorry, similar visits for hospitalization.

93
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:46,360
And if you're doing some sort of primary data collection from the hospital for

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:50,279
example, the provider might be able to provide you with some sort of

95
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,224
cost-to-charge ratio there.

96
00:05:52,224 --> 00:05:57,440
Another thing we might wanna do to adjust data is inflation and discounting.

97
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,213
These are, sorry, two different things actually they're not the same thing and

98
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:03,248
it's something important to keep in mind.

99
00:06:03,248 --> 00:06:05,240
When you're adjusting for

100
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:11,060
inflation you're converting dollars in a particular year into real dollars.

101
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:16,778
So, into real really today's dollars and the inflation adjusting accounts for

102
00:06:16,778 --> 00:06:21,590
the fact that the value of the dollar general diminishes over time.

103
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,174
So if your parents and

104
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:28,454
grandparents will tell you about how they used to buy a gallon of milk for

105
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:33,470
a quarter or something like that and that's because a quarter was or

106
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:38,500
nickel or whatever was worth a lot more 50 years ago or something.

107
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,231
So what we wanna do is adjust for that.

108
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:46,600
So, even it's been something not so long ago in the past you might

109
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:50,670
have some data on what an MRI costs from five or ten years ago.

110
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,730
We need to adjust that to today's dollar values.

111
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:58,491
So the inflation is only gonna apply to cost.

112
00:06:58,491 --> 00:07:02,509
So it's usually if you have some cost data from five or ten years ago,

113
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:06,350
you will want to use inflation to adjust that to today's values.

114
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:12,540
Discounting is separate and that accounts for an additional consideration.

115
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,548
A dollar in the future is something we have to wait for and so dollars that

116
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:22,651
we receive or have to pay in the future are worth less than dollars today.

117
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:27,433
So discounting is is not about changing stuff in the past to the president's

118
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:30,946
about time preference in our preference to have money or

119
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:34,040
spend money either today or in the future.

120
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:38,369
A key way to think about this is inflation is gonna be used to bring costs from

121
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:39,970
the past up to the present.

122
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:46,940
And discounting is gonna be used to turn future costs into present values.

123
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,369
So how do we do this well for inflation to get the cost today

124
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:56,310
we take the cost in that past year, let's say a year 2000.

125
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,535
And then we multiply it by a price index for

126
00:07:58,535 --> 00:08:04,340
today over the price index of that past year, like the year 2000.

127
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,138
So we just simply multiplied by that price index and there's several price industries

128
00:08:08,138 --> 00:08:12,140
you can use a common one is the consumer price index, for example.

129
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,018
So you can use the consumer price index,

130
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:16,901
there's the medical component of the consumer price index.

131
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:19,910
Other people like things like the GDP Deflator.

132
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:26,440
And if you have questions about which one is best, I'm happy to answer those.

133
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,981
But so that's inflation adjusting.

134
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:33,692
The next thing is discounting and what we're doing with cost effectiveness

135
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:37,909
analysis is trying to make prescriptions about what we ought to do.

136
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,729
And so if we think about how we ought to make trade offs between dollars today and

137
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:47,332
dollars, maybe five, ten years in the future, this discount rate should

138
00:08:47,332 --> 00:08:52,740
represent some sort of societal rate of time preference for consumption.

139
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,991
And so the key here is probably that you wanna use 3 percent to use for

140
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:59,580
your discounting.

141
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,269
How do you do that?

142
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:07,602
If you take into your finance classes, there's a present value formula.

143
00:09:07,602 --> 00:09:11,381
And basically every year in the future X2, X3 and so forth.

144
00:09:11,381 --> 00:09:15,414
In the future we need to discount that by some sort of interest rate.

145
00:09:15,414 --> 00:09:19,040
So here would be 1+ r, in this case are would be 3%.

146
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,688
So we take those for one year in the future, we discount by 1.03,

147
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:28,440
2 years in the future, we discount by 1.03 squared and so forth.

148
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:35,740
We sum up all those payments in the future to get a present value.

149
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,249
So the US preventative services test course or

150
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:45,107
public health service panel recommendation is to

151
00:09:45,107 --> 00:09:49,861
use some sort of social rate of time preference.

152
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:53,705
And the recommendation is typically to use 3 percent to discount.

153
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:58,644
And they also recommend sensitivity analysis should consider ranges

154
00:09:58,644 --> 00:10:01,747
from 0 percent discounting to 7 percent.

155
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:05,224
And that takes into account the fact that if we're gonna have some sort of

156
00:10:05,224 --> 00:10:07,561
benefits in the future we might discount those.

157
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:10,921
And so that's what's going on here with the discounting.

158
00:10:10,921 --> 00:10:14,350
So, other issues to think about when working with costs.

159
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:18,733
You might wanna quantify time costs, so that I would recommend using things like

160
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:21,323
wage data like the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

161
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:25,420
How do we deal with costs from morbidity and mortality?

162
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:30,021
Generally morbidity and mortality should be captured in the health effects,

163
00:10:30,021 --> 00:10:32,060
the quality adjusted life years.

164
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,904
But if you do an analysis based on life years, not quality adjusted life years,

165
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:41,388
then it might be appropriate to add productivity, lost productivity and

166
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:46,140
from the morbidity to the cost, like days off of work and so forth.

167
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,475
And that's it for the high level review of costing.
