1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:28,160
We can. Okay.

2
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,600
Maybe we can get started. You.

3
00:00:35,310 --> 00:02:00,270
Give me 1/2. All right.

4
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,919
So thanks, everyone, for coming. So this is going to be our first recitation session.

5
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,340
So before the session, just want to make a quick announcement.

6
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,230
So, you know, we have two sessions, two parallel sessions for this, uh, six sexual one.

7
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,200
Um, currently there are still finals space in the second session.

8
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:25,020
So if you want to try different sessions, feel free to do so.

9
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:29,760
So both sessions will be identical and we're going to share all the office hours,

10
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,239
exams, homework questions, office hours, etc., including this recitation session.

11
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,430
So feel free to join any session.

12
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:50,760
And just so you know, so now, okay, so today we're going to review some of the materials, especially in the first couple of lectures on accounting.

13
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:59,459
And we're going to look at this particular problem that is involves a lot of accounting and probability calculation.

14
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,290
So we're going to work on this problem together,

15
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:10,650
hopefully will help you review some of the concepts as well as enhancing some techniques that you are learning in class.

16
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,630
Okay. Uh. Okay.

17
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,010
All right, so let's get started. This is the problem set up.

18
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:23,360
So assume this is a very interesting problem. So let me introduce it.

19
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,630
Assume there are 100 prisoners or are labeled 1 to 100.

20
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,100
Okay, we have a blank board.

21
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,540
That's good. So the warden decided to play a game with the prisoner.

22
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,700
So here's how the game is set up. There's a room with 100 boxes.

23
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:49,700
The boxes are also numbered from 1 to 100. And inside the box.

24
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:54,710
Inside each box, there is a slip with the prisoner's number on it.

25
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:06,200
Which is also 1 to 100. So the warden asks the prisoners to go to the room one at a time and to chat 50 boxes.

26
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,740
Okay. So each prisoner, a prisoner will go to the room and randomly open 50 boxes.

27
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:22,320
If they find their own number in the box in one of those 50 boxes, then that's good.

28
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:33,570
Otherwise, it's bad luck. So when they leave the room, they have to replace the boxes exactly the way that they found it in the first place.

29
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,220
And they cannot communicate it with the other prisoners that go into the room after them.

30
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:47,970
All right. So then the deal is if all 100 prisoners final number during their term, then they will all be freed.

31
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:58,070
But even if one of them fails to find their number when they open 50 boxes, then all prisoners will be executed.

32
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:06,800
All right. So that's the setup. So let me know why you are reading this.

33
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:12,440
Let me just draw a little. Uh, in a situation on the board.

34
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,570
I haven't used charts in years, so these are 100 boxes in the room.

35
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:54,880
Okay, so each one of them has a slit in it. So with the it's number 1 to 100, but they are randomly placed in these boxes.

36
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,040
For example, it's not for one.

37
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:05,710
They have a sleeve that has number five and this, but on the film they have a sleep number like nine and so on, so forth.

38
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:09,520
Each count as a number, as a unique number and one.

39
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,840
So the prisoners will go into the room. Why the time?

40
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:18,860
Open 50 boxes and then try to find their own number.

41
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:24,650
If they find that a number. They are good. If they don't, then all will be executed.

42
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,460
Is the question clear? Any question about this set up.

43
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,210
So we're all clear. Good. All right. So question number one.

44
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,500
What is the probability of success? In other words, what's the probability of all these prisoners will be freed?

45
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:58,560
If they just play this game randomly. This should be an easy question.

46
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:07,959
So first thing you need to think about is are these independent processes are different.

47
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,970
Prisoners go through this process, have equal probability of finding their number.

48
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:21,240
Is Prisoner one. Associated with prison are two or they are totally independent.

49
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Their chance of finding their number could be totally independent.

50
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:34,450
Is it independent or not? Any.

51
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,150
That's. Yes.

52
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,950
And speak louder. Yes.

53
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:55,620
We have to leave the room exactly the way they planned it. So they open 50 boxes.

54
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,720
When they are down, they closed all the boxes exactly in the same way I leave the room.

55
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:11,330
It's independent. All right. Very easy question, because prisoner number two doesn't know anything about what prisoner number one find.

56
00:08:11,330 --> 00:08:18,590
So it's totally independent process. So then the next question is, what is the probability of prisoner?

57
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,670
Prisoner number one find is a number. When he opened 50 boxes.

58
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,290
Any guesses or any thoughts? Yes, sure.

59
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:51,940
So again, the set up is pretty much just. Each box has a number in it.

60
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:55,150
1 to 101 in two boxes.

61
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:02,770
Each prisoner what each prisoner has to do is just open 50 boxes randomly and try to find their own number.

62
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:09,160
So what is the probability of each prisoner? Find their number in their turn.

63
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:16,870
50%, not hard, right? 50% because it's a random process.

64
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:21,530
So there are. Assume the prisoner.

65
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:25,070
Number one, open the first 50 boxes.

66
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:35,700
Essentially the chance of finding. In order to calculate the probability of finding the number one in this first 50 boxes is just Connie.

67
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:43,890
How many how many cases are there? A number is placed in one of these, of course, 56 divided by the total number of no placement.

68
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,470
Right. So it's a half and half open 50 boxes.

69
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,470
Then there's one half of a probability of finding his own number.

70
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,910
All right. And we also know that it's a random it's an independent process.

71
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:17,550
So the probability. Of all prisoners being freed can be calculated using this compound probability.

72
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:28,420
Equation. Right. So it's going to be one over two to the power of 100 as we're going to multiply this one half 100 times.

73
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:34,330
One for each prisoner. So this is a chance that all prisoners find their number.

74
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,000
Within their term. Okay.

75
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,730
As. The first question. Pretty.

76
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:48,500
Pretty straightforward. Right. Any question with this number how we got this number?

77
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,320
So it's again that the key is that it's an independent process.

78
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,190
So we can directly multiply the chance for each presenter to find his no number for all prisoners.

79
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:09,750
In total, we have 100 prisoners, so we multiply this one half 100 times.

80
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,770
Now give us the probability of of success.

81
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,540
In other words, all prisoners find their own number. Okay.

82
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:26,460
And this apparently is going to be an extremely small number, which means there are very slight chance that they will be all be freed.

83
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:30,420
Most likely they will all be executed if they just do it.

84
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:45,520
Right. So. But. Consider this if the warden allowed them to strategize before they actually go into the room.

85
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,910
All right. Before they go to the room. Before they see anything.

86
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:55,970
Before anyone see anything. How do they increase their chance of success?

87
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:06,090
Now. Things got started. Got interesting. They are given a chance to discuss before anyone go to the wrong.

88
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,680
Once they start to go into the room, we cannot talk to the to the guys after them.

89
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:17,560
The only the only chance they have is they can discuss before they actually enter the room.

90
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:30,780
Then what's the best strategy? In fact, if they come up with the right strategy, they can actually raise their chance almost one third.

91
00:12:31,470 --> 00:12:38,160
That's crazy, right? From one over two to the power of 100 to almost one third.

92
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,030
So I'll give you a couple of minutes so you can discuss among ourselves and see if you can come up with a strategy that actually help them bump,

93
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:56,850
bump up their chance of survival. Okay. So just use your imagination and think about ways that we can.

94
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,510
Strategize their moves so that they can. Increase their chance of success.

95
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:09,840
Feel free to discuss some ourselves. So I say if you can come up with something, that's great.

96
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:18,540
Okay. And don't feel bad if you don't. Since this is a super hard question, I don't I don't know the answer in the first place.

97
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:26,510
So maybe I'll take a, you know, 5 minutes discussion.

98
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,340
So feel free to ask any question if you have for clarification.

99
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,350
So has anyone of you have seen this problem before?

100
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:22,490
No. That's good. So let's discuss and say how to strategize so we can all survive.

101
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,230
So the tricky part here is they can only discuss it before they go to the room.

102
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:48,500
So that's the tricky part. Okay.

103
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:02,350
Question. Try this.

104
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:07,060
I don't know how this works on the track.

105
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:14,230
Okay. So it's just a question that.

106
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,390
So everything else stays the same after they go, like, look at the cars.

107
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,470
They must leave all them, like, in the same order. So.

108
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:31,479
So they are allowed to discuss, like, just at the very beginning, even before the first prison.

109
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:37,209
There is no way to stop overcrowding. And that's and that's the only one.

110
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:42,790
Charleston. So for of once the first prison, there starts no other prisoners.

111
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:48,600
Okay. The wrong is that take away their body after they got out of.

112
00:15:49,400 --> 00:16:14,959
Okay. The careers of. Thank you. All right.

113
00:16:14,960 --> 00:17:20,270
Two more rallies. All right.

114
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,250
Time is up. Any thoughts? Gaz's ideas.

115
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:33,969
From any group? Yes. So this is supposed to be rolling.

116
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,660
So try to. Hello.

117
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:49,340
I think you can just. For example, you are a prisoner number two, and you enter a room and you just open the box number two,

118
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:54,290
and you follow the number to inside box number two and open the next box.

119
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:03,409
For example, just throw in box number two and you go to open the box number 30 and so on.

120
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,170
So first. And for example, in box 50, there's number two and you're free.

121
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:17,600
Very good. So have you seen this problem? Yes, very good.

122
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:22,309
And that's actually the strategy. Now, there are bump up.

123
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:28,850
There are chance of survival. So let's look have this strategy together as exactly as what is a set.

124
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:39,800
The best strategy so far is that each prisoner actually they can go to the room open first, open the box with their number on it.

125
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,110
If you are prison number one, go to the room, open box number one, whatever.

126
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:49,580
Whatever number in that box. That's the box that is going to open next.

127
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:56,120
Okay. And then you just keep doing it until you open our 50 boxes or the file number.

128
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:06,220
Okay. And that's the strategy. But then the question is, why does that give us a chance of a success of almost one third?

129
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,140
Now, that's what are we going to work on today? Okay. So is everyone.

130
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,220
Okay with the strategy clear with a strategy? Yes.

131
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:20,750
Question. There is no black box.

132
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:28,700
Every box has a number in it. So there's 100 boxes for 100 prisoners are not going to go out of the box?

133
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,160
No. Each box has one slip, and all the slip are unique.

134
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:37,800
And that's. Yes. So they always stay there.

135
00:19:38,910 --> 00:19:42,540
So they have to leave the boxes exactly out the way that they find it.

136
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,810
So that's the strategy. So each prisoner opened the box with their number on it.

137
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,250
Find the slip, open that box, and until they finish their terror.

138
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,900
Okay, so now let's look at why that actually helped them.

139
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,950
So a few facts before we actually calculated the probability.

140
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:12,440
That is, first, all the boxes in this strategy now becomes part of a closed loop.

141
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,400
That's actually a very important finding. Right.

142
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:23,180
Let's say if you start from box number one, whatever number in it, it tells you where you should go next.

143
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:28,610
And then you find the next box, find the number in it, and that tells you the next one.

144
00:20:29,330 --> 00:20:33,590
At some point, you will circle back to the original box, number one.

145
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:38,130
Right. And that complete a closed loop.

146
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:43,440
It can be a large loop. It can be a small the smallest loop would be just a self loop.

147
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:47,670
In other words. Box number one. Just have number one in it.

148
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:53,370
So just finish environment. It can be a it can be a super long loop.

149
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:57,690
For example, box number one have number two, unit. Box number two.

150
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:02,580
Number three. Unit and so on, so forth. Box number 100 has number one.

151
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:07,410
So that's a super long loop of 100. Right.

152
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:12,030
But whatever the group sizes are boxes.

153
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,480
Once they are randomized, they become part of a closed loop.

154
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:26,750
So that's one observation. And another observation is that any random arrangement of these boxes would form a mixture of loads.

155
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:32,710
There won't be any open lines. Everything will be a closed loop.

156
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:38,480
No matter how you arrange these boxes, the slates, they are always going to be closed loops.

157
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:47,620
It's just going to be a different mixture of loops. And as I said, the loop side is going to range from the smallest loop, which is self loop.

158
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:55,510
The box has the same number on it and in that, so it's a south loop or it's going to be a super long loop.

159
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:06,950
All right. So the size ranged from 1 to 100 and the LA and then each prisoner was he or she'd go to this room.

160
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:14,630
Actually, she will. He will definitely follow a loop until the prisoner find his own number.

161
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:23,210
And in fact, this prisoner was always start from the furthest point in this loop until he found his number.

162
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:34,620
If his prisoner of war one. Whatever. Look, this number one has it always start from the boxes that is farther away from his own number,

163
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:40,650
because the last part in this loop going to be going to be going to have the number

164
00:22:41,130 --> 00:22:46,530
number one in at that point in back to the the box that this prisoner first opened.

165
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:52,490
So each prisoner will always start, will always follow a loop,

166
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,400
and he will always start from the first point on the loop until they find its own number.

167
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,790
So these are just the direct observations from this strategy.

168
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:14,790
So then we can reinterpret the events of all prisoners, find their numbers with them.

169
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,930
50 stubs to be something that's calculable.

170
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:24,909
Okay. So with these facts, how do we reinterpret this?

171
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:32,430
Our prisoners find their numbers within 50 snaps. Now in terms of the loops.

172
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:46,800
This is equivalent to what? Think about the size.

173
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:58,170
Right. So all 50 prisoners, all 100 prisoners found their numbers within 50 states.

174
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:12,600
What is that equivalent to? Let's say if you have a with some arrangement, you have a loop that has size 80, for example.

175
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:17,420
Well, all prisoners find their number within 50 stops.

176
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:27,930
If you have a loop of size 80. Anyone on that loop will be doomed, right?

177
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:32,900
Because it will take them 80 stops to find their own number.

178
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:42,830
Every one of them on the island. As I said, everyone's going to follow the loop and they always start from the furthest point.

179
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:47,360
So if you have a loop of us of the size 80.

180
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,960
We can never find their number within 50 states. Right.

181
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:58,040
So where does all prisoners find their number with them? 50 steps equivalent to.

182
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:09,220
Yes. Very good.

183
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:18,400
So that is this event is equal to the event of the largest.

184
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:25,680
Love sighs. Is last or equal to.

185
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:34,140
50. So as they know, the largest loop size to be out of our lives are equal to 50.

186
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:43,690
Okay. And the reason is, just as I just said, if you have a loop that has size 51,

187
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:52,060
everyone on that loop will never find their slide, never find their number within 50 snaps.

188
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,260
They will always find their number in 51 starts.

189
00:25:58,030 --> 00:26:03,700
So this event, the original event of all prisoners, found their number within 50 steps.

190
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:12,970
Now becomes this much simplified expression that is the largest group size is large, like with a 50.

191
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:19,670
Is everyone go with that. Any questions so far?

192
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:24,960
Okay. Now let's calculate what is the probability of that. Okay.

193
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:31,440
So before we calculate the probability, that's for us to think about the question of arranging this boxes.

194
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:39,660
So the warden has the chance to randomly arrange these boxes and the number of the slips with numbers in it.

195
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,290
So first question is what is the total number of arrangements?

196
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:57,130
Now. The warning coming. Again, think about this arrangements where you have 50, you have 100 boxes and you have 100 numbers.

197
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,390
So what are different ways to transmit numbers on boxes?

198
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,720
How many different ones? Very good.

199
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:09,130
I want to know if that's how you right. Because it's exactly a permutation problem.

200
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,620
You fix the boxes only to compute in the numbers or the slips.

201
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:23,480
So that's 100 factorial. That's the total number of arrangements that you can possibly have.

202
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:26,840
Right, this one. Or if I tell our different arrangements.

203
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:36,320
Any luck? Ever assume the water around the slopes randomly that each arrangement has equal probability?

204
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,590
Okay. Each arrangement has equal probability.

205
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:47,830
Now, calculating the probability of a certain arrangement just becomes counting.

206
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:54,430
How many arrangements satisfy that condition? And we can divide by this number and we out the probability.

207
00:27:55,610 --> 00:27:58,870
Okay. So that's question number two. Very good.

208
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:05,290
And question number three, what is the number of arrangements with a group size equal to 100?

209
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:19,820
This l equal to 100. How many different ways can we arrange these boxes so that we have a loop of a size 100?

210
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:31,040
Again. Think about how these are arranged, right?

211
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:41,460
Is it us or something with replacement or software without refreshment or something with or without replacement?

212
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:46,380
Think about the way we've been learning. Plus. Is it order Mark O'Mara.

213
00:28:55,780 --> 00:29:02,060
Well has to be harder. There is a natural order. And as a result.

214
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:10,190
Without a cleansing, because once you use a slip, it's making stuff, so you have to use the remaining.

215
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:17,180
Then how do we calculate the number of arrangements with the little size 100?

216
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,950
Any idea? Yes, I.

217
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:33,660
Very good 99 factorial. How do you calculate that? Why not in my factory.

218
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,800
Yes. But why? So what's the rationale behind this?

219
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:50,250
How did you come up with this number? Okay.

220
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:54,530
That's fair. It's a correct answer. You guys, any thoughts?

221
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,640
This is a quick answer. Why? 99 factorial. Yes.

222
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:16,790
That's that's a good idea. So we can fix one of the boxes, you know, and then premiere the remaining.

223
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:21,440
Right. That's one way to think about it. Or you can think about this as a sequential procedure.

224
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:26,360
Right. All I need to do is to put the slides in this one in the boxes.

225
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:36,500
That's why we need to do it right. We are just not sure how many different ways, how we put this within so that it forms a loop of what, a size 100.

226
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,490
So let's start from the first step. How many different ways can players like in Box one?

227
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:51,160
How many different ways? Not an was right because you can now put number one it.

228
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:55,060
All we can do is put number two or two, number 100.

229
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:02,560
So that's 99 different places, 90 out here. And the ones you are down with this one now move to the second.

230
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:10,180
How many houses do? Not a right and not you the first one.

231
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,870
You can also not use number two. Right.

232
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,130
And so on and so forth until the last one. So that gave you 99 factorial.

233
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:33,870
All right, then. The probability of having a loop of size 100 are going to be not in nine factorial divided by 100 factorial, which is one over 100.

234
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:38,670
Okay. So that's question number three. Any fashion so far?

235
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,340
Okay. All right.

236
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:54,370
So question number four. What about the romance with love size equal to 999?

237
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:01,540
Slightly trickier than the previous question. It's still manageable.

238
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:10,690
Hopefully. How many different ways can you form a loop with size 99?

239
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:22,280
So first of all, we need to think about what does a loop size nine and nine means.

240
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,670
If you have a loop of size 99, what about the remaining one?

241
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:29,990
Has to be a self loop, right? There is no other choice.

242
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,370
You have to have a south loop and another big loop of size 99.

243
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:44,970
So what is the number? How do we calculate this?

244
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:54,840
Yes. Look, over time. 100 times factorial, 98 factorial and why?

245
00:32:55,170 --> 00:33:00,840
Let's first talk about why 100? Where does that number comes down on?

246
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:07,380
You just need to order. Very good.

247
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:17,360
Does everyone get it? So the first one or two, you need to pick one or you need to pick a nine and nine boxes out of this 100 boxes.

248
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:26,950
And you can pick one to form a self loop or pick a nine and on to form a a big loop of size 99.

249
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:36,670
In a way, it's equivalent. Okay. So let's say you first take one box to form a self loop that gave you 100 different choices.

250
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,600
Okay. You can take box number one. Box number two, all the way to box number 100.

251
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:49,580
That's your very first step. So that give you 100 different options once you are down with that.

252
00:33:50,950 --> 00:34:03,610
Now you do. Step two. The other words, focus on the remaining 99 box boxes and the remaining 99 slides and form a loop of size 99.

253
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:12,890
Not exactly becomes the previous problem. Right. Instead of working with 100 numbers, you are working with 99 members.

254
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:26,060
So the rationale stayed the same. You can use the same logic to get these 98 factorial, which is a permutation of the 98 different options.

255
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,760
To form a loop of size 99. Okay.

256
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:38,410
Again, you start from the first box, you have eight, nine, eight different options.

257
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:46,360
Whatever option that you choose, you go to that box. You have now you have 90, 97 options.

258
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,440
And then you go on until you have until you reach the end.

259
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,690
Okay. So now I gave you this number.

260
00:34:54,350 --> 00:35:03,300
So again, now you can calculate the probability of forming a loop of size equal to 99, and that's going to be this number.

261
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:10,130
So the probability is going to be 100 times 98 factorial divided by 100 factorial.

262
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:20,650
Right. Which is one over 99. So that's the probability of having an arrangement with loop size equal to not enough.

263
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,530
Okay. Any questions? Over. All right.

264
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:39,460
So next. What about nine a? How many different arrangements can you have to have a life size equal to not a.

265
00:35:46,390 --> 00:36:00,040
And how do we calculate that? Any idea how?

266
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,850
100 shows to. Times.

267
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:11,830
What? 97 factorial.

268
00:36:11,950 --> 00:36:17,270
Anything else? Or is that the final answer?

269
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:25,000
I've heard someone say at times to. Times two factorial.

270
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,920
And why is that? Why do we need to time to factory.

271
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:37,510
So the first to let me explain this why not just do it again?

272
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:45,500
Same logic. Once you have a loop of size 98, you need to first choose the remaining two boxes that is not in this world.

273
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:51,680
Okay, so that's why did you choose two and the 97 factorial is how many ways that you can

274
00:36:52,760 --> 00:37:00,260
rearrange this 98 boxes to form a loop of size 98 exactly as we discussed before.

275
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,270
But what about this two factorial? Where does that come from?

276
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,510
Very good. The way to order the first two boxes that I chose that are not in the loop.

277
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:23,090
All right. We don't really care whether it forms a loop to South Loops or just one loop of size two.

278
00:37:23,990 --> 00:37:28,190
All we care about is all the permutations that we can have for those two boxes.

279
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:38,870
And I gave you exactly two factorial. Similarly, if you want to calculate a loaf size of 97, the sky exactly the same thing.

280
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:43,790
100 to 3 times, 96 factorial, times three factorial.

281
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:48,709
Okay, so if we calculate this, this is going to be 100 factorial,

282
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:55,280
divided by two factorial, nine factorial times nine, seven factorial, times two factorial.

283
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,900
And if you do the calculation that gave you 90.

284
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:11,720
90. What, 90? And the right.

285
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:19,640
Got it right? Yeah. Yes.

286
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:24,580
Seven factorial times 19, nine times 100.

287
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:35,680
Okay. So this is a number. And again, if you want to calculate the probabilities, it's divided by 100 factorial which are going to end up with 90.

288
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:45,130
In fact, you can perform you can calculate it in exactly the same way, all the way down to a loop of size 50.

289
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:50,810
Or a loop of size 50. What? Okay.

290
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:57,400
Once you go beyond 50, then things start to get more complicated.

291
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:06,010
But luckily we don't have to worry about that in this case, since we only care about the size greater or equal to or greater than 50.

292
00:39:06,850 --> 00:39:15,650
That's the case if we need to worry about. So imagine if you have a loop size, the maximum loop size, less than 50.

293
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:23,270
Now you have to think about different scenarios. Sometimes you may have a multiple small, small loop, sometimes you may have even larger groups.

294
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:27,470
So you need to rule out duplicate duplicate scenarios.

295
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:36,560
So we won't go into that. So now let's put everything together and say, you want to we can tackle this this problem.

296
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,750
The probability of all prisoners finding their number within 50 steps.

297
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,110
Okay. Recall that we had.

298
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:59,690
All prisoners finding that our number within 50 staff is essentially equivalent to say this largest loaf size is last or equal to 50.

299
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:06,960
Okay. So the probability of that is the probability of the size last are equal to 50.

300
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:16,910
And based on our calculation before. What is that?

301
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:22,470
I'll give you maybe 2 minutes to work out the. To work out this number.

302
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:48,580
You don't need to calculate the final number. Just give me the formula.

303
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,780
Any solution. Per. Hi there.

304
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:35,540
How to get this number? So to calculate this, we need to now think about the sample space and start right.

305
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:42,350
So if we want to calculate the probability of this maximum size, last I quote a 50.

306
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:49,660
It's a harder problem, as I argued before, because calculating the maximum size is less than 50.

307
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:57,040
You have to consider scenarios where you have either multiple small loops or one small loop and one large group.

308
00:42:57,370 --> 00:43:00,760
So it's more complicated than considering the alternative.

309
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:07,570
The complement of this of this sun, which is the probability of our greater than 50.

310
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:16,420
Because for each life size greater than 50, you know, you don't have to care about the other smaller group.

311
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,309
So and we can plug in what we have calculated now is going to be one minus the

312
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:33,060
probability of al equal to 51 plus l for the 52 all the way to our equal to 100.

313
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:39,460
Okay. And based on our previous calculation, that is.

314
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,450
Our equal to 100. That's one over 100.

315
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:54,420
Right. And one hour equal to nine and nine. That's one over 99 all the way to one over 51.

316
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:06,060
So these are going to be the final answer, one minus the summation of this one or 51, plus all the way to one one over 100.

317
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,780
And if you calculate it, it's roughly equal to.

318
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:20,190
Point three. And that's why using this strategy.

319
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:32,740
You actually increase the likelihood of survival for these prisoners from a teeny tiny number to this point three, which is pretty magnificent.

320
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:39,290
Okay. Question so far.

321
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:46,260
Okay. So another question. What are the probability of each prisoner finding their number within 50?

322
00:44:51,990 --> 00:45:14,570
How do we calculate that? So since these prisoners.

323
00:45:15,590 --> 00:45:19,610
Again, we're going to go through exactly the same process. Right.

324
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:23,300
Every one of them will go to the room, finding the room exactly the same.

325
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:33,080
So from a probability, probability perspective, they should have equal probability of finding their number within 50 steps.

326
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:40,750
Can we agree on that? Each one of them, they don't one person prisoner doesn't have an advantage over the other one.

327
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:46,750
No one knows what's in the room. So everyone should have equal probability.

328
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:52,240
Okay. And then we can just focus on the first presenter.

329
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:58,940
What is the probability? The first prisoner find their number within 50 stops.

330
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:15,330
How do we calculate this? Any idea, you know, how to work out the actual number, but any idea?

331
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:17,680
How should we calculate this?

332
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:43,240
In order to calculate this probability, the probability of this event, the first prisoner finding their number within 50 stops.

333
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:49,660
We need to again translate this into something that's calculable in terms of this loop.

334
00:46:50,850 --> 00:46:54,840
What does that imply? What is the problem? What is that event?

335
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:07,800
That president, number one, actually fine his number. What about the loop known content, number one in it.

336
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,720
Can it be a loop of size? 70.

337
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:31,170
No. Right. It has to be a loop of size plus or equal to 50 that contains number one.

338
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:38,129
So all we care about is this sleep number one or both?

339
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,250
Number one. It's the same thing.

340
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:47,470
So the box number one, it has, let's say number three and eight.

341
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:58,390
Number nine in it. Number five in a number 2018 and 20 has number one nine forms a loop.

342
00:47:58,630 --> 00:48:08,140
As we said, the prisoner, number one, always go to the first box, which is the furthest away from its own number, which is contained in this.

343
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:18,859
Box number 20. Okay. So the probability of this prisoner finding his number within 50 steps in this room that contained

344
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:28,100
box number one has to have a loop size last or equal to 50 is not just an arbitrary loop.

345
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:34,220
It's these particular loop that contain vast number one has a size last time equal to 50.

346
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:39,880
Okay. So this event is equal to the event of Luke.

347
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:47,950
Containing. Box one has size.

348
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:54,350
Last quarter 50. Okay.

349
00:48:55,100 --> 00:49:02,240
And then you can think about whether this has a larger probability or smaller probability than the one that we calculated before.

350
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,690
The probability of loop size less than or equal to 50.

351
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:16,740
So I'll leave that to you and. A couple of extensions now they can go from here.

352
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,140
To make it even more sophisticated. For example, you can consider the cases where.

353
00:49:24,590 --> 00:49:30,940
Assume the guard or the warden actually over overhear what their strategy is.

354
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:38,980
So he just sneaks in the room and make the move to be of size 100 to make sure that everyone fills.

355
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,170
Okay. Is there a strategy that the prisoners can still win?

356
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:52,660
There's actually the answer is actually yes.

357
00:49:54,130 --> 00:49:57,660
Right. No matter what the warning does, they can still win.

358
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:08,680
But they have to change their strategy a little bit. For example, what they can do is they can reassign their own numbers to counter that act.

359
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,810
If they randomly assign their own number, then they are back to the origin.

360
00:50:13,090 --> 00:50:16,630
Back to the origin. Right. They're still playing a fair game.

361
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:27,160
Or in fact, we can just add a certain number to their own number so that stay of this all this argument still holds.

362
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,020
They still have about a third of a chance to win the game.

363
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:43,480
So that's one very interesting extension. Another extension is that assume, given the number of prisoners and the number of boxes going to infinity.

364
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:50,520
Instead of having 100% or 100 boxes, what about having a thousand present or a thousand boxes?

365
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:57,170
What would the chance of success be? What about if you have 10,000 greater prisoners?

366
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:05,120
In fact, you can calculate that probability using a let me a theory and that is going to be.

367
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:14,680
One minus plot to. The natural law to which is approximately.

368
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,910
.31 something. Okay.

369
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,840
And you can think about how to get that number. Even then, the same logic.

370
00:51:27,530 --> 00:51:31,980
And you can find more information through this YouTube video.

371
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,750
I actually got. Gather ideas from this YouTube video.

372
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:42,560
She is pretty much all in there in this YouTube video, and it's a very good summary of this problem.

373
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:49,580
So after afterwards, if you are interested, you can take a look and they have some additional variants of this problem.

374
00:51:49,850 --> 00:51:56,480
But I'm trying to say is that actually you can see in this problem, all we need is a counting process.

375
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:02,900
Right. As long as we know how to properly calculate the probabilities, we can actually solve this problem.

376
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,640
At first glance, it may seem complicated, but if you break it down fact,

377
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:11,570
it's something that we can we can already do using what are we learning in class?

378
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,850
Okay. Any question before we end today?

379
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:24,160
All right. So thank you, everyone, for coming. So hopefully you enjoyed this little problem.

380
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:35,200
Very interesting problem. So check out I'll post the the recordings and the slides on our campus so you can check it out if you want.

381
00:52:36,530 --> 00:53:00,490
All right. Thank you. Are not sure because we just talk about the probability of majority merger,

382
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:12,240
saying that if we're concerned and if they're producing is also, you know, that's not the case.

383
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:16,770
So that's exactly why we we cannot do it.

384
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:23,340
So think about it. If your largest group size is 49, 90, you do not calculate the probabilities in the same way.

385
00:53:23,790 --> 00:53:34,110
If you have a no size, larger size of 49, then you have to consider the remaining 51 profit they can not form on the right.

386
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:48,910
Otherwise they will be a violation of the assumption, which is not exactly to say nothing at all to 100 to 151.

387
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:53,040
So true. Then we have many more.

388
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:57,720
Yes, but but the problem is if it's a split.

389
00:53:57,780 --> 00:54:05,160
Split from the middle, right. If you consider the larger half, of course, if the largest size, if only for a larger size,

390
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,470
you can never have a loop that is greater look size than the one that I consider.

391
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:15,810
Right. But it's not the same as if you consider the maximum wolf size allotment.

392
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:24,700
So let's say you are not you would not discuss how is the largest would be something it's not the any difference.

393
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:33,630
Yeah. So in the extreme case, for example, if your largest loop size has is equal to one.

394
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:46,440
How many cases you have of. Well, since you know if you are largest will decide how many different.

395
00:54:50,250 --> 00:54:54,660
I mean, if every. Every box is a thousand. Yeah, that's only one.

396
00:54:55,110 --> 00:55:00,810
All right. So the probability of that is not a one over one if the one over 100 apart.

397
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:05,970
So we cannot apply this formula down to the second half.

398
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:11,640
Right. Okay. So that's exactly the reason for its shrinkage, right?

399
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:15,420
Yeah. Think about it's an interesting problem.
