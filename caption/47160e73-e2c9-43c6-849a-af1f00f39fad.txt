1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:17,710
Imagine we had a study where marijuana use in midlife was associated with dementia among women, but not among men.

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,270
In other words, we find that there's a modification of the relationship between marijuana use and dementia by gender.

3
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:33,250
Are we done? Well, just like with main effects, we have to consider whether or not there's other explanations for these findings.

4
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:43,709
In this particular video, I'm going to walk you through how we examine alternate explanations for effect modification could be due to chance,

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:50,070
confounding different prevalence of confounders within the strata and different biases for the strata.

6
00:00:51,860 --> 00:01:01,370
So in the literature, I find it surprisingly common for investigators to report no overall associations between their exposures and their outcome.

7
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:05,150
But then they go ahead and look for associations and subgroups.

8
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:12,560
These analysis have often not been planned, and there's something that's been done just sort of in a data mining way.

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,820
They then report associations when something is observed, but not necessarily all of the associations looked at.

10
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:30,380
While these findings can be quite intriguing, the analysis are a bit risky because we run into the risk that chance is coming into play.

11
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:38,900
Often these analysis do not have a strong the scientific motivation behind them and they can be influenced by chance.

12
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:45,590
In addition, if you ever see an association in subgroups when there is none overall,

13
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:51,830
what that means is that the association must go in opposite directions in the different groups.

14
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:57,140
In other words, exposure hurts some people, but helps others.

15
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:02,450
Well, this may indeed be possible in some very unique situations.

16
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,650
It's pretty hard to imagine how this happens commonly.

17
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:15,320
The only way in which I can think about it is where one group tends to oppress the other, such as what you might see in a situation like slavery.

18
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:23,430
Therefore, what I recommend is to avoid all of these post-hoc types of analysis,

19
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:33,270
meaning the ones that you look at without the original plan and focus on those analysis that you had initially set out to accomplish.

20
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:42,120
If you do report additional findings, be wary that they might be due to chance alone and therefore interpret them with caution.

21
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,250
Another issue that can sometimes arise with effect modification is confounding.

22
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:55,490
Just like with main effects. I have to worry about confounding on the effect modification scale.

23
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:04,610
So what do I mean by that? Well, what I'm referring to is some alternate explanation for the cause of effect modification.

24
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:12,860
So what if, for example, the reason that women have a stronger relationship between marijuana use and dementia is really the results of

25
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:20,270
differential educational attainment between older men and women and actually has no other reason related to gender.

26
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:28,580
What this means is that if I went about making advertising campaigns intended to prevent dementia in future generations,

27
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:34,850
what I want to do is not necessarily pitch those advertising campaigns to women in college environments,

28
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,660
but rather to all individuals who are still in high school.

29
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:46,040
Now to account for the possibility that confounding can occur on the effect modification scale.

30
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:56,690
We just use adjustment as we did with our main effects now because we're really getting into this issue of strata stratified by other strata,

31
00:03:57,050 --> 00:04:03,350
we evaluate confounding on the effect modification scale really by use of statistical models.

32
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:11,149
We do this by including interaction terms, not only for the effect modification of our exposure by Z,

33
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:19,850
which is our primary modifier of interest, but also we include effect modification of the exposure by confounders of Z.

34
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:28,500
In other words, we want to make sure that we're not having confusion of our Effect Modification Association

35
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:34,260
and saying it's due to one factor when in reality it's actually due to another.

36
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:42,450
Now, if we find evidence of effect modification, it might also be that bias is at play.

37
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,690
One possibility is that there's different confounders between the two strata.

38
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,700
So, for example,

39
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:59,820
let's say that women who are health conscious and eat well are also less likely to smoke marijuana and they get dementia less frequently.

40
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:07,800
In contrast, let's just imagine that there's no association among men between eating healthy and marijuana use.

41
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:17,460
In this situation, if we adjust for eating habits in a pooled model, we may not adequately capture the confounding by eating.

42
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:23,400
So what could happen is that we observe stronger associations between marijuana use and

43
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:29,580
dementia among women due to residual positive confounding in this group by healthy eating.

44
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:40,770
Now, it might also be that there's different quality of information or different selection going on among women because, for example,

45
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:49,020
maybe women who use marijuana earlier in life are more likely to see physicians and therefore be diagnosed with dementia.

46
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:56,370
If men's decisions to seek medical care in later life have absolutely nothing to do with their past lifestyle choices.

47
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:05,010
You might imagine that this scenario would exaggerate the association between marijuana use and dementia, but only among women.

48
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:13,610
So the key takeaways from this particular video are that we want to use the same type of considerations in

49
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:20,330
evaluating effect modification as we do for our main associations of interest between an exposure and an outcome.

50
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:27,500
In order to prevent agents from influencing our findings, we want to stick with a priori hypotheses.

51
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:36,110
Beware of confounding on the effect modification scale and consider sources of bias that might explain different associations within strata.
