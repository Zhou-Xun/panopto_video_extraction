1
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:18,309
whose name is long enough so that I never remember if I'm going to be able to get all of it out in proper sequence.

2
00:00:18,489 --> 00:00:27,099
So I'll put the name that I came up with the I know we were trying to be inclusive.

3
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:35,139
That decision is always is it going to be inclusive or produce an interesting abbreviation.

4
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:39,009
And we decided for being honest and inclusive.

5
00:00:39,099 --> 00:00:50,199
So we have a lot of tweets, but saying that I would like to welcome Ben Cowling to the School of Public Health.

6
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:53,049
This is the second time you've been here,

7
00:00:53,229 --> 00:01:04,419
because first time was about eight and ten years ago when we were a little bit a little bit different in terms of the amount of activity.

8
00:01:05,109 --> 00:01:06,819
We didn't have a center at that point.

9
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:19,178
We still we're working on transmission and prevention of respiratory infections, and that's what I've been doing for the years.

10
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:22,709
He has been at Hong Kong. What came first.

11
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:33,299
An analysis of existing data and then moving to modeling continues to do both of those things.

12
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:40,739
And we have worked together. Both in terms of our group here at Michigan and personally.

13
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:51,959
And I remember spending a couple of days in the Midlands of England working with Jonathan Van-Tam,

14
00:01:52,409 --> 00:02:02,039
who was going to be here next week on a study to try to separate out airborne and large droplet transmission.

15
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:07,169
So I won't go into details about the success or failure of the study.

16
00:02:07,589 --> 00:02:12,029
If it had been a success, I think you would have heard about it by now.

17
00:02:12,509 --> 00:02:18,269
But I'm going to stop and let Jonathan let Ben take over.

18
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:20,608
And he is talking, as you can see,

19
00:02:20,609 --> 00:02:29,699
about the epidemiology and control of COVID and Hong Kong and the approach it approaches that are far different from what we used here.

20
00:02:30,779 --> 00:02:35,759
Ben, thanks very much. And it's my pleasure to be back. I'm just passing through Ann Arbor.

21
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,869
I have been in Hong Kong since 2004, so almost 20 years working on a lot of different things.

22
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:49,799
And I've I've done a lot of things to look at COVID in the last two and a half years, from the early days.

23
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,999
I can't share everything. I just pick some some things that I think you might be interested in.

24
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:59,009
Hong Kong is a city on the far south coast of China.

25
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:02,309
It's a special administrative region. We have 7.3 million people.

26
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:07,329
We used to have more, but some have left. So it's actually I think it might be 7.2 now.

27
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:14,578
It keeps going down. We have a subtropical climate and we have a very dense population in Hong Kong.

28
00:03:14,579 --> 00:03:24,019
So. When I estimated the reproductive numbers for COVID 19 in the early days, we came out with an estimate, but we had a 2.2, which we published.

29
00:03:24,259 --> 00:03:27,439
At that time we saw in Hong Kong is going to be higher because we have such a dense

30
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,359
population and that means it's very difficult to stop infectious diseases from spreading.

31
00:03:32,689 --> 00:03:33,979
But we do our best.

32
00:03:35,269 --> 00:03:43,849
I'm going to talk for, I guess, 40 minutes or so, and I'll try and cover a bit of all of these, how we succeeded in the early days.

33
00:03:44,089 --> 00:03:47,329
We rolled out vaccinations and we had a problem with vaccine hesitancy.

34
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:50,869
We had a large Army combat two wave earlier this year.

35
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,849
And I've got some data to share with you on vaccine immunogenicity and effectiveness.

36
00:03:56,149 --> 00:03:59,689
And at the end of those time, I'll talk about the current situation.

37
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:08,689
In the early days of the COVID pandemic, Hong Kong had had cases from from travelers from mainland China.

38
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:17,358
And we very quickly latched on to an approach to stop transmission in the community with targeted case finding,

39
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:22,639
contact tracing and so on, and also border measures, border controls.

40
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:30,649
So in Hong Kong, initially the government was very reluctant to close our northern boundary with with the mainland.

41
00:04:31,009 --> 00:04:38,599
About 300,000 people cross every day for work and for study as many children in across the border who come to school every day in Hong Kong.

42
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:44,479
So there was a lot of reluctance from the government to close the border. The nurses in Hong Kong went on strike,

43
00:04:45,109 --> 00:04:50,929
insisting that the border be closed and so reluctantly in early February the government closed the border and

44
00:04:50,929 --> 00:05:00,979
has been closed ever since and the international border was closed soon after requiring quarantine on arrival.

45
00:05:01,309 --> 00:05:04,969
So Hong Kong been been closed for two and a half years.

46
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:14,329
The approach used in Hong Kong and also in Singapore, Australia and New Zealand has is now sometimes called the dynamic.

47
00:05:14,329 --> 00:05:20,839
Zero-Covid strategy is a local elimination strategy, previously called zero COVID,

48
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:30,799
rebranded as Dynamic Zero-Covid in China because of the recognition that zero is unattainable but a low level of cases is attainable.

49
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:38,119
And so there's two aspects to zero-covid. Firstly, if you have an outbreak like at the moment, there is in Shenzhen,

50
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:45,829
like in some other cities in China, rapidly stop the outbreak to get local cases back down to zero.

51
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:52,339
And then you can you can breathe you can you can have a break from the domestic control measures.

52
00:05:52,939 --> 00:06:00,139
And the second part of the strategy is to just stay at zero as much as possible for coping, ideally, most of the time as a zero.

53
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:04,269
And from time to time, you know, there's going to be an outbreak, but you have to be ready to stop.

54
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:08,989
And so the quarantines and the travel restrictions are absolutely essential.

55
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:15,139
You can't have zero-covid without strict travel measures, including antiviral quarantines.

56
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:20,439
And the rationale for doing this in China, in Hong Kong and Singapore, Australia,

57
00:06:20,449 --> 00:06:27,528
New Zealand was the idea that the Zero-Covid strategy is a more efficient way to protect public health in the early

58
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:35,209
days of the pandemic than allowing COVID numbers to go up and then almost panicking when they get to a high level.

59
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:38,239
Locking down the community for a period of time, the numbers come down.

60
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:43,719
Eventually, the numbers are low enough that you can relax and then they go off again and it's up and down, up and down, up and down.

61
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:50,898
And it's very disruptive to everybody. If Zero-Covid works well, most of the time you don't need domestic control measures.

62
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:54,198
You only need to travel measures in practice.

63
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,629
That's not that's not necessarily the case. Australia spent a lot of time in lockdown, but that's the concept.

64
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:07,089
And so in Hong Kong, the first two years of the pandemic, the successes of this graph, we had very few cases.

65
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:13,389
The confirmed cases were less than two per thousand. My colleagues and I have been doing several logical studies.

66
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:19,329
Less than 1% of people were infected in that period. So very, very few infections.

67
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:27,339
A number of community outbreaks, the peaks on the left that the first one is actually called our second wave for some silly reason.

68
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:31,809
Second wave, third wave, fourth wave. And then on the right was our big fifth wave.

69
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,939
I'll talk about later with data and the way we were able to stop community epidemics.

70
00:07:37,389 --> 00:07:41,649
Firstly, travel measures to minimize introductions. Universal masking.

71
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:44,799
Outdoors and indoors. Testing like crazy.

72
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:48,399
Isolating every case outside the home.

73
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,269
So we have isolation camps for people in Hong Kong.

74
00:07:52,569 --> 00:07:58,059
And if you test positive in these two years, you will be taken to an isolation camp.

75
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:01,869
It's like a one star hotel.

76
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:08,589
This place is just like a one star hotel and normally five no food deliveries.

77
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:13,449
You're stuck in a room for two weeks and it's very harsh, very stringent.

78
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:19,929
But it only affects a small number of people who are confirmed cases because infections of a relatively low level.

79
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,709
But we recognized the isolation of cases wasn't enough to stop transmission.

80
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,449
We have to quarantine that to trace the contacts and quarantine them to get ahead of the virus.

81
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:38,249
And so the quarantine was also done outside the home. Also in one star hotels, special or constructed facilities for that purpose.

82
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:41,799
Also very harsh, very stringent.

83
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:49,149
And then in the periods when there was a lot of community transmission, there were more strict social distancing measures.

84
00:08:49,149 --> 00:08:53,359
So school switched to online school work at home policy.

85
00:08:53,889 --> 00:08:57,429
Restaurants moving to takeaway. Things like that.

86
00:08:57,429 --> 00:09:00,969
Closure of leisure facilities, gyms and cinemas and so on.

87
00:09:01,389 --> 00:09:03,459
So it was there was never a total lockdown,

88
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:09,639
but there was enough done in combination with the targeted measures, plus the general community wide measures.

89
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:13,869
That was enough to stop transmission and bring numbers back down to zero.

90
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:17,789
And for the second half of 2021, we had no local cases,

91
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:24,639
pretty much just a handful of of cases around and very, very small outbreaks that were immediately stopped.

92
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:29,109
Singapore. Not exactly the same, but roughly similar.

93
00:09:29,589 --> 00:09:35,799
And they had a concrete plan in Singapore that they would buy time for vaccines to roll out.

94
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:40,629
And their plan was by late 2021 with a high vaccine coverage that we open to the world.

95
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:46,539
Hong Kong did not have that plan. Hong Kong the plan still is to try and stay at zero.

96
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:55,569
And so it's a different a different rationale for the Zero-Covid approach, similar to the first part, but but different now.

97
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,899
I want to share some data on Superspreading because it's something that particularly interests me.

98
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:07,929
We published a paper in Nature Medicine early in the pandemic about clustering of cases in Hong Kong.

99
00:10:07,929 --> 00:10:10,949
Because we have a lot of contact tracing, a lot of case finding.

100
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,199
We don't trace every transmission chain, but we trace a lot.

101
00:10:14,709 --> 00:10:21,549
And so this figure on the left shows the clusters and also some some smaller groups of cases.

102
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:27,128
And we use that data after we infected the missing links because we knew that there were definitely

103
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:31,899
missing links in the picture to say on the right hand side that the offspring distribution,

104
00:10:32,289 --> 00:10:37,299
70% of cases didn't transmit infection to anyone else and a small fraction on the right hand tail.

105
00:10:38,199 --> 00:10:41,799
90% of cases responsible for 80% of transmission events.

106
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:48,669
So that's superspreading. And in fact, my post-doc and I wrote an article in The New York Times saying, If you can stop Superspreading,

107
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:54,729
you should be able to stop the epidemic because it's superspreading that drives transmission in the community.

108
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:58,509
So stop the large clusters. Think about reducing large gatherings.

109
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:07,839
We can find ways to try to stop the opportunities for Superspreading to occur and you can have a big effect on transmission.

110
00:11:08,829 --> 00:11:13,118
We've been looking at it again recently because we have data not only from the system,

111
00:11:13,119 --> 00:11:16,749
from the second wave, but from the third and fourth and even the fifth wave in Hong Kong.

112
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:23,859
And this is data from the second, third and fourth wave. When we look over time at the Superspreading phenomenon, the lower panel,

113
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:30,129
the orange shows the proportion of cases that are responsible for 80% of transmission.

114
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:39,279
Horizontal line is 20 for reference. So 20% of cases causing 80% of transmission is what we found in our previous paper for 19.

115
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:46,249
And we were thinking that Superspreading will. There'll be less superspreading as we control the epidemic.

116
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:52,999
And if there's less superspreading, that would probably mean that more cases are responsible for 80% of transmission.

117
00:11:53,179 --> 00:12:00,409
Where we find the opposite, we found actually there was more superspreading as the epidemic progressed and became controlled.

118
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:07,039
So let me say that again. We were expecting as an epidemic control, there's less superspreading we stopped superspreading.

119
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:12,349
But what actually happened? There was more superspreading. We when we thought about it for ages.

120
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,679
We checked everything two times, three times, four times.

121
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:25,279
And then I think we came up with an explanation. And if I go back to the distribution all the way, the offices of distribution has a right hand tale.

122
00:12:25,729 --> 00:12:28,368
But, you know, distribution is how two times there's a left hand as well.

123
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:32,059
It's not really a tire is it's a spike, but it's a left side on the right side.

124
00:12:32,329 --> 00:12:39,979
And what we think has happened is as the epidemics control with targeted measures of case finding, contact tracing, we get more and more zeros.

125
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:47,629
And so the left hand side of the distribution, the Ziegler fraction, the inflation of zeros, goes up and up and up.

126
00:12:48,049 --> 00:12:52,649
And that's also over dispersion. The zero inflation, Russell, is an over this distribution.

127
00:12:53,149 --> 00:13:02,179
So we think what's happened is not that there were more superspreading events, there was actually less large clusters, but there was even more zeros.

128
00:13:02,509 --> 00:13:09,049
And so the superspreading effectively increased, although the epidemic was brought under control.

129
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:17,269
And so now we're thinking maybe this K and other the proportion responsible for 80 is not the right way to think about things.

130
00:13:17,869 --> 00:13:21,528
Maybe we need another metric because we want to say the epidemic is being controlled.

131
00:13:21,529 --> 00:13:30,039
We want to say there's less large clusters. The zero is this like it is another metric of of how well we're getting on.

132
00:13:31,669 --> 00:13:39,299
So we have two vaccines. We have two vaccines available in Hong Kong, the Pfizer vaccine and the inactivated vaccine produced by Sinovac.

133
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:44,539
The vaccine is called Coronavac. And Coronavac is, I think, the most used COVID vaccine in the world.

134
00:13:45,379 --> 00:13:47,059
It's up there with Pfizer anyway,

135
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:56,089
because it was distributed not only in China but also in other countries in Asia and in South America and Eastern Europe.

136
00:13:56,389 --> 00:14:06,019
Lots and lots of places bought Corona back for their populations and used it because it was available in large quantities early in in 2021.

137
00:14:07,099 --> 00:14:13,849
So in Hong Kong we have both and we were wondering what the uptake was going to be like through 2020 with with our community surveys

138
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:21,409
that we've been doing since the beginning of the intention to receive vaccination before the start of the vaccine program was Moderna,

139
00:14:21,419 --> 00:14:24,829
about 60% saying they of people saying they intend to receive it.

140
00:14:25,219 --> 00:14:30,169
Unfortunately, at the very beginning of our vaccine program, there were thrombotic events.

141
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:36,709
A soon after people receive corona that the vaccine program started with the oldest in Hong Kong, as it does elsewhere.

142
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:43,819
And unfortunately, there were some thrombotic events. And when the government came to explain what they think had happened,

143
00:14:44,569 --> 00:14:53,539
the explanation was something like there was an older person in the eighties or even nineties with underlying heart disease,

144
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:57,739
high blood pressure, diabetes, other conditions as well.

145
00:14:58,099 --> 00:15:00,349
They got vaccinated with Corona back a week later.

146
00:15:00,349 --> 00:15:07,279
They were dead from a heart attack, but they were a ticking time bomb because of their underlying medical conditions.

147
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,609
And so the vaccine shouldn't be blamed for that. And it wasn't a very convincing story for older people in Hong Kong,

148
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:19,009
many of whom also have underlying heart disease and other things and maybe don't

149
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:23,089
think of themselves as ticking time bombs and they're not ticking time bombs.

150
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:29,388
And so we understand that vaccination can cause, in some rare cases, thrombotic events.

151
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:35,749
It's very unusual. It can happen. And of course, I like the assessment I don't think should be done on an individual basis.

152
00:15:35,749 --> 00:15:43,849
It should be done on an aggregate to say, you know, what are the rates of these events in people who are vaccinated or comparable people who are not?

153
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:49,669
And if we did that, we find that it was almost the same because there's a very low risk of that kind of thing happening.

154
00:15:50,539 --> 00:15:56,959
But anyway, it was a big problem for us in Hong Kong. So we had a lot of people in Hong Kong who were hesitant about getting vaccinated.

155
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:01,189
Orange is people who are not going to get vaccinated in March 2020.

156
00:16:01,699 --> 00:16:07,249
Green is people who we're going to wait and see. Blue is people who are happy to go fast, happy to go to the front of the queue.

157
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:11,149
This is all ages and you can see a lot of hesitancy.

158
00:16:11,629 --> 00:16:19,399
But when we look by age, the younger adults at the top and the older adults at the bottom, the hesitancy is relatively higher in the younger people.

159
00:16:19,879 --> 00:16:26,689
In the older age groups, there's not many against the idea of getting vaccinated and there's plenty of people ready, ready to go fast.

160
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:30,739
So the hesitancy was probably in younger people to start with.

161
00:16:33,329 --> 00:16:37,139
By September. So this is now six months into our vaccine program.

162
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,639
We were at almost 60% coverage.

163
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:44,969
So the people who got one dose typically went on to get a second dose.

164
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:50,609
We were looking good to even reach 70% by later in 2021.

165
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:58,029
So that was okay because the original target for the vaccine program was 70% uptake and we were on the way there.

166
00:16:58,649 --> 00:17:01,618
There was a quite a lot done to stimulate and to encourage uptake.

167
00:17:01,619 --> 00:17:10,499
You can see that they in in April, May didn't look so good, but a lot of effort was made to persuade people to get vaccinated.

168
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:15,329
And it worked. But we had a problem in our older adults. So the picture's changed.

169
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:23,069
Now, this is a slightly different color scheme. Green is people who got vaccinated at least one, and almost everybody went on to get two doses.

170
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:29,309
And then the other colors are like whether they still intend to get vaccinated with regard to being against vaccination.

171
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:36,299
And in the old age of 65 plus, you can see only 30% that received one vaccine dose by September 2021.

172
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:42,569
So that's very low compared to the other age groups and a real problem.

173
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:50,139
And so my colleagues and I repeatedly advised the government that this was the biggest danger to Hong Kong.

174
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:53,878
Remember, between June and December 2021,

175
00:17:53,879 --> 00:18:00,269
we didn't have cases in the community and the government was very focused on maintaining zero cases in the community.

176
00:18:00,569 --> 00:18:04,889
We had 21 days on a wave of quarantine. I did that myself in a hotel room for 21 days.

177
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,789
We had a lot of testing, a lot of stringent measures ready to be implemented in the event of an outbreak.

178
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:18,749
And our feeling was the government was focusing mostly on zero COVID surveillance

179
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:23,128
and control and not so concerned about vaccine uptake because in a way,

180
00:18:23,129 --> 00:18:27,659
if you don't have cases in the community, it doesn't matter whether you have vaccine coverage or not.

181
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:32,759
And if your plan is to continue to have no cases in the community for the at least

182
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:37,168
for the short term future low vaccine uptake in the elderly is not a priority,

183
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:43,379
I suppose. I don't know. It was never completely clear to us, but it was not a problem that was solved.

184
00:18:44,069 --> 00:18:47,009
We did a qualitative study to try and work out what the reasons were,

185
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:53,488
and there were a lot of reasons why a lot of people said they didn't want to get vaccinated so that the first one,

186
00:18:53,489 --> 00:19:02,459
the decision from doctors because of adverse events occurring in older people with underlying medical conditions like heart disease,

187
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:03,929
diabetes, whatever.

188
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:10,889
Instead of giving you a blanket recommendation, the government said if you're concerned about the risks that vaccine poses to your health,

189
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:15,809
go and see your family doctor and seek reassurance.

190
00:19:16,269 --> 00:19:21,629
And so it sounds like a good idea, but actually what happened is those doctors were not really family doctors.

191
00:19:21,839 --> 00:19:26,729
They're like, you go to see them. If you're sick, you don't go see them. If you're not sick, you don't have a relationship with them.

192
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:35,039
And those doctors were unwilling to give blanket reassurance to ticking time bombs, which is the impression that they may have had.

193
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:40,679
But if you see someone who's got all of these medical conditions and they say, am I going to be okay if I get vaccinated,

194
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:49,199
you may be on the hook for some kind of liability if they have a heart attack or stroke in the following weeks, even if it was a total coincidence.

195
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:53,249
So the doctors didn't give any reassurance to people to get vaccinated.

196
00:19:54,429 --> 00:20:00,399
There was a lot of negative news. And then on the right hand side, I also want to talk about downplaying pandemic risk.

197
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:08,679
This is the issue that the government in Hong Kong was very focused on maintaining the zero cases in the community.

198
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,639
And if you're a person who's weighing up the benefits and the risks of vaccination,

199
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:15,909
you know that maybe a risk of getting vaccinated, it could be a low risk.

200
00:20:16,629 --> 00:20:20,739
On one hand of the general advice is the benefits far outweigh the risk,

201
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,229
but the benefits you get from vaccination only accrue if there's COVID in the community.

202
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:31,129
If there's a zero COVID success, then that actually does this.

203
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:33,759
There's limited benefit to getting vaccinated.

204
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:41,139
So that was a lot of issues, and I don't think any single strategy would have overcome all of these different, different issues.

205
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:42,909
But it was a major problem.

206
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:53,469
My colleagues and I are trying as hard as we could to to explain we've got to have a timeline to move away from zero-covid like Singapore did.

207
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:58,779
And the Singapore communication was very, very clear in the second half of 2021.

208
00:20:59,049 --> 00:21:04,419
The communication message was everyone's going to get COVID at some point in the next year

209
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:08,619
or two and you'll be much better off if you get vaccinated before you get out of it.

210
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:12,159
You know, we're not going to protect you anymore after September.

211
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:16,359
We're not going to have travel measures. We're not going to have a lot of social distancing.

212
00:21:16,629 --> 00:21:19,809
So please get vaccinated. And they did mandate it as well.

213
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,869
Eventually in Hong Kong, we didn't have any such message.

214
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:28,989
Any time the government asked about the possibility of relaxing policies and allowing COVID to spread and living with COVID.

215
00:21:29,319 --> 00:21:34,809
The government is very negative even today. The government is very negative about the idea of living with COVID.

216
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:38,019
So it's a it's an issue.

217
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:46,539
We're caught in a dilemma at that time because where we have a government that's very keen on zero COVID, but also a low vaccine uptake in elderly.

218
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:52,959
So in early 2022, we had four concurrent outbreaks beginning in our community,

219
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:58,689
two in Omicron Bay, one that came in through four light crews who had a short quarantine.

220
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:03,579
And then for some some some way the virus got out into the community via one twice.

221
00:22:04,179 --> 00:22:08,589
We had Delta. I'll come to you in a minute. And we had only conveyed to.

222
00:22:09,859 --> 00:22:16,679
Go to another Colombia. One were all controlled by the by the stringent public health measures used in January 2022 by two was

223
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:23,399
was not slipped through it slipped through the net and it wasn't stopped early and so took off that

224
00:22:23,489 --> 00:22:31,279
the only can be a two came into a quarantine hotel and my colleague again did another my postdoc and I

225
00:22:31,669 --> 00:22:36,739
looked back at quarantine hotel records because it's something that we're particularly interested in.

226
00:22:37,219 --> 00:22:42,499
So there's a scenario in a quarantine hotel where when I go, I think I'm going to have to do quarantine.

227
00:22:42,859 --> 00:22:49,819
If I arrive and I'm incubating infection, I'm going to become contagious while I'm staying in the quarantine hotel.

228
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:55,579
If there's someone on the opposite side of the corridor in the next room who's just about to leave that quarantine,

229
00:22:55,819 --> 00:22:58,999
whether it's a three day or a seven day of a 14 day or 21 day,

230
00:22:59,209 --> 00:23:05,509
if they're coming to the last couple of days of their quarantine, I can transmit to them and they're going to take infection out of the community.

231
00:23:06,139 --> 00:23:10,999
However, a whole new set of quarantine, that's always going to be a possibility. And that happened a number of times.

232
00:23:11,449 --> 00:23:13,879
It was known in 2021 that it was occurring.

233
00:23:14,509 --> 00:23:20,538
But my colleague and I look back at what about cases where there was a transmission event in the quarantine hotel,

234
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:24,679
but because the infected person was still detectable, their equality,

235
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:31,579
it was it was classified as an imported infection, as an incubating infection on arrival.

236
00:23:31,969 --> 00:23:38,868
But actually it was a transmission event in the hotel. We estimated that every 100 infected alive was transmitted once.

237
00:23:38,869 --> 00:23:46,639
So one one transmission for every 100 infected arrivals, which is actually when there's a lot of people arriving from month to month.

238
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:50,179
That's a massive risk. Obviously, if you have a longer quarantine,

239
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:56,629
risk is mitigated because there's more chance that the transmission occurs with someone who's still going to be staying in quarantine for longer.

240
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,049
And that was the reason given for 21 days at one point.

241
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:05,089
But I don't think it's justified to think about longer and longer quarantines to mitigate this risk.

242
00:24:05,449 --> 00:24:07,909
What you really need is a purpose built facility.

243
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:14,629
The government also tried cohorting people arriving on the same day, on the same corridor, but practically speaking, it doesn't really work.

244
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:21,809
Delta came in with hamsters and that's just a hamster destroying. It's really sad, actually.

245
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,589
So we had a Delta case picked up in a pet shop owner in Hong Kong,

246
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:29,709
and I think the initial reaction from the government was it was a bit of a surprise that this was the petrol pump,

247
00:24:29,849 --> 00:24:34,259
but you know, it could have come from anywhere. So they were doing the tracing to see is this pet shop owner.

248
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:41,789
Like, who did they have lunch with? Have they met any other people that recently arrived in Hong Kong and there was no known source for this delta.

249
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:48,419
And then they started testing the pets in the pet shop because she was a pet shop owner and they found Delta in the hamsters.

250
00:24:48,689 --> 00:24:50,879
And they tried. But hamsters are coming from the Netherlands.

251
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:57,869
They went to the warehouse where the hamsters first arrived before going to the pet shop and the other hamsters in the warehouse were also positive.

252
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:05,519
And so there's a Lancet paper describing this whole situation where it was a reverse zoonosis human to hamster in the Netherlands.

253
00:25:05,819 --> 00:25:11,339
The hamsters came to Hong Kong. They were not quarantined because animals went thought to be a risk.

254
00:25:11,729 --> 00:25:17,249
They were distributed. They were sold as pets in December 2021 for Christmas presents for small children.

255
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:26,819
And in January 2022, the government insisted that all recently purchased hamsters be returned to the government to participate in the hamster cull.

256
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:32,759
And so it's very sad actually. There was a lot of kids who were very upset about this hamster.

257
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:44,369
Their new best friend has been um has been sent back to but any anyway the delta outbreak wasn't driven by hamsters.

258
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:47,549
There was an outbreak in the community during my presidency and it was stopped.

259
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:54,839
So we did really well in Hong Kong. We stopped by day one. We stopped out. We couldn't stop to like this is in February.

260
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:56,728
This is a month into the beta outbreak.

261
00:25:56,729 --> 00:26:03,299
The government saying that they still feel like zero-covid is the right strategy in influenza pandemic planning.

262
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:07,168
Often countries will think they might try containment at the beginning.

263
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:11,969
They might try to stop transmission completely at the beginning. And then there's a switch at some point to mitigation.

264
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:16,379
And there's a lot of discussion in influenza policy about how do you make that switch.

265
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:24,509
You got to not leave it too late to switch from from containment to mitigation in Hong Kong, we didn't switch basically until very the very peak.

266
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:29,519
We did a switch nearly early enough to mitigation that caused a lot of trouble.

267
00:26:29,999 --> 00:26:36,449
So we had a big wave that in terms of the confirmed cases, there was a million in our seven plus million population.

268
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:41,159
In terms of infections, we think it was about half the population got infected within about a month.

269
00:26:41,549 --> 00:26:46,079
That's a lot of cases at peak, unfortunately, a lot of deaths.

270
00:26:46,379 --> 00:26:51,449
The doubling time of 3.1 days is a bit slower than BHO doubled elsewhere as we slowed it down.

271
00:26:51,719 --> 00:26:55,529
It could have been two days or one and a half days. We slowed it down, but we didn't stop it.

272
00:26:55,979 --> 00:27:02,039
And one of the problems we had in Hong Kong in 2022 is the problem that other parts of are probably Michigan had

273
00:27:02,169 --> 00:27:09,989
in early 2028 or 2020 of elderly homes struggling to deal with COVID outbreaks and the practice in Hong Kong.

274
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:14,129
If there's a person with COVID, they should be isolated outside the window,

275
00:27:14,129 --> 00:27:19,829
outside elderly and elderly homes, particularly in Hong Kong, did not want to deal with cases in their home,

276
00:27:20,099 --> 00:27:27,448
so they simply sent them to hospital in ambulances and they ended up outside the hospital in the lower right, and there were too many of them.

277
00:27:27,449 --> 00:27:33,358
This is very frail, elderly, potentially with mild coma, not necessarily with severe COVID,

278
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:41,999
not needing any kind of medical attention, but, you know, frail and left outside the hospital for for prolonged periods of time.

279
00:27:42,569 --> 00:27:47,939
We suspect that some of the COVID deaths were deaths in frail,

280
00:27:47,939 --> 00:27:56,909
older people with mild COVID who might have been okay if they'd been looked after in another way or maybe if they'd been looked after.

281
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:03,779
And so it's a really a sad situation. We have so many deaths, 9000 deaths in the space of a month.

282
00:28:04,109 --> 00:28:10,799
And if you scale it up to the US 50 times, the population nine times 50 is one of 50,000 deaths in the space of a month.

283
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:16,439
It's an enormous number of deaths in 2022. And you look at that, the curves.

284
00:28:16,709 --> 00:28:22,829
Hong Kong went from best at the bottom here in January 2020 up to, you know, really not that good.

285
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:28,408
And if you if I narrow the scale to just 20, 22, I think we were pretty much the worst.

286
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:31,829
So it's really quite, quite an embarrassing situation.

287
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:38,639
So I want to talk now about how well the vaccines work, because there were obviously questions about whether the vaccines were working,

288
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:43,079
particularly the Coronavac inactivated vaccine produced in mainland China.

289
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:49,259
When we look at antibody titers, this is with our live virus neutralization assay,

290
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:54,119
the Pfizer vaccine in blue, the inactivated Coronavac vaccine in red.

291
00:28:54,659 --> 00:29:01,619
The antibody titers against the ancestral virus higher is better and the Pfizer vaccine is much better.

292
00:29:01,979 --> 00:29:08,159
It's a much stronger antibody response. The inactivated vaccine has a very weak response.

293
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:15,229
And then when we look at the waning after the second dose, the waning is very prominent as well for the United.

294
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:22,108
Very good vaccine. So we expected from this the protection conferred by CORONAVAC is a lower level

295
00:29:22,109 --> 00:29:27,029
of protection which is not lasting for as long as is the Pfizer vaccine.

296
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,639
We expect is is not necessarily providing that much protection.

297
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:41,489
We then have just recently finished a booster trial of third doses where we have all the possible combinations for

298
00:29:41,489 --> 00:29:47,549
people who got two doses of inactivated vaccine on the left or two doses of inactivated vaccine on the right.

299
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:53,129
So C is coronavac. B is biontech. That's Pfizer. So sexy means Corona back all the way.

300
00:29:53,879 --> 00:29:56,039
B-Bbee means means Pfizer goes away.

301
00:29:56,489 --> 00:30:06,239
And so we go on the on the the the top is that the ancestral virus antibody levels by life, hospitalization and by surrogate neutralization.

302
00:30:06,329 --> 00:30:09,659
On the bottom is only Colombia two, which is the virus that actually circulated.

303
00:30:09,989 --> 00:30:16,499
And you can see the key antibodies. And the BBC is really low against Batu particularly.

304
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:23,789
So from the antibodies, it would seem to us that there would not be much protection provided by Coronavac,

305
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:26,879
at least against infection, against severe disease.

306
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:33,509
We need other markers. So we have T cell responses of C for the top CDA on the bottom.

307
00:30:34,619 --> 00:30:43,189
And it's interesting that the Pfizer vaccine did not stimulate, you know, AC did not stimulate t cell responses, but those are primed with coronavac.

308
00:30:43,889 --> 00:30:48,689
So there was a time with with Pfizer, it didn't have T-cells, those primed with Coronavac on the left.

309
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:58,619
And CP did have very nice T cell responses on day seven, whether they got a booster with Coronavac or with the Biontech-Pfizer vaccine.

310
00:30:59,339 --> 00:31:07,589
So that was kind of interesting. So that the Coronavac timing does seem to to to allow t cell responses with a third dose.

311
00:31:08,999 --> 00:31:12,329
Pfizer vaccine, the aim of any vaccine data in our assay.

312
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:17,369
So on the right hand side there, we had this big epidemic during our study.

313
00:31:17,489 --> 00:31:19,439
So we could look at the incidence of infections.

314
00:31:19,439 --> 00:31:25,079
We ask the participants to do rapid tests every week and to tell us if they had any indication of infection.

315
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:29,519
So we picked up a lot of infections. Between 50 and 20% of the participants were infected.

316
00:31:29,849 --> 00:31:33,359
And the rates of infection are very similar among all four groups.

317
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:38,579
On the right hand side, you can say there there's a bit of a difference, but actually the numbers are not that large.

318
00:31:39,749 --> 00:31:43,049
So it actually perplexes us a bit.

319
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:51,959
If I go back, the antibody levels are so low for the corona booster antibodies against P2 particularly,

320
00:31:52,199 --> 00:31:57,579
but yet they seem to be protected against mild infection picked up by rapid test done at home.

321
00:31:57,579 --> 00:32:05,579
This is not severe disease. This is mild infection. And so what we're wondering and we have some preliminary data from internal genes,

322
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:12,569
NUCLEOPROTEIN antibody, non neutralizing antibody corona vaccine stimulate stock substantially.

323
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:16,169
Biontech doesn't is a spike vaccine.

324
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:26,369
Maybe there's something to that. But the conclusion so far to the tentative conclusion is that while neutralizing antibody

325
00:32:26,789 --> 00:32:31,649
could be a good color of protection for the Pfizer vaccine or for many vaccines,

326
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,339
the neutralizing antibody titer may not be the right code of protection for inactivated vaccines.

327
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:45,299
And that would be something quite new, because when we hear about the discussion of COVID as a protection so far,

328
00:32:45,569 --> 00:32:51,149
it's always about how neutralizing antibody is an established code of protection for COVID vaccines.

329
00:32:51,449 --> 00:32:56,849
And there's a bunch of papers looking at that and using that to try and project B.

330
00:32:56,849 --> 00:33:03,359
It doesn't seem like it's is quite right for inactivated vaccine, but we will continue to work on that.

331
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:12,739
When we look at vaccine effectiveness in the community. So this is another study we've done with thousands of individuals doing rapid tests every week

332
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:20,299
since the peak of the Bay two wave with all different types of vaccine choices up and whatever.

333
00:33:20,299 --> 00:33:25,999
On the right hand side is the V. If they got a second dose within three months or they got a third dose,

334
00:33:26,329 --> 00:33:32,089
they do seem to have some degree of protection against small infection picked up with a rapid test,

335
00:33:32,479 --> 00:33:35,479
not a high level, but a bit of a low to moderate level.

336
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:41,429
If this was flu, we'd say it was a bad year, but we still call it moderately.

337
00:33:41,809 --> 00:33:43,878
Oh, but it is not too bad.

338
00:33:43,879 --> 00:33:51,709
30 or 40% V against infection, but it doesn't seem to last for the second dose and we suspect it will not last for the three dose group.

339
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:56,808
These were recent third doses. When we look at severe disease, though, this is a study we published in The Lancet.

340
00:33:56,809 --> 00:34:02,119
It's using the screening method against severe disease and COVID mortality.

341
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:06,859
Both vaccines work pretty well, particularly after three doses.

342
00:34:07,099 --> 00:34:11,779
So, yes, a lot of numbers on the slide. On the right hand side, all the numbers are in the high nineties.

343
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:20,599
So whether it's Coronavac or the Pfizer vaccine Bnt162b2, whichever vaccine, three doses work very well against severe disease.

344
00:34:21,259 --> 00:34:27,049
For Coronavac, two doses in older people is not that good.

345
00:34:27,949 --> 00:34:33,409
That's these numbers in the forties down down here in the in the lower middle of the table.

346
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:41,569
But the World Health Organization said a year ago that for older adults who get coronavac, they should get three doses, not two.

347
00:34:41,869 --> 00:34:47,359
And they should even think that the primary series for coronavac for older people is three doses, not two doses.

348
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:50,839
Don't say someone's fully vaccinated after two, it should be three.

349
00:34:51,439 --> 00:34:57,379
We discussed this in Hong Kong, but in Hong Kong there's a lot of sensitivity about the different vaccines.

350
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:02,209
And so there was an unwillingness to say that you needed three doses of one but two of the other.

351
00:35:02,389 --> 00:35:09,769
And every time we've had recommendations for additional doses, like for Coronavac, for older adults, a third dose is needed sooner.

352
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:19,309
It's always added on as one of the Pfizer vaccines added on as well. So it becomes you need three doses of either just to satisfy whatever criteria,

353
00:35:19,969 --> 00:35:23,749
whereas we think that is particularly an important issue for CORONAVAC.

354
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:28,519
Now, whether the right hand side wanes more quickly for Coronavac, we don't know this.

355
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:36,259
This was in the peak of our fourth wave at a point when our third doses were relatively recent.

356
00:35:37,729 --> 00:35:45,499
I still got a little bit of time to talk about the COVID situation. So we were having now what the government still calls the fifth wave.

357
00:35:45,499 --> 00:35:51,229
But what is actually a sixth wave is a resurgence of infections after public health measures were relaxed in April and May.

358
00:35:51,919 --> 00:35:54,919
We now have 10,000 cases today.

359
00:35:55,489 --> 00:36:04,009
Scale it up to the US 10,000 times 50 is 500,000 would be a lot of cases would be a five.

360
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:10,759
So I could be a two there. But actually EPA five is just taken over yesterday as the predominant strain.

361
00:36:10,759 --> 00:36:16,129
It's now half of the cases. And if you see the blue is bay to the green is bay five.

362
00:36:16,759 --> 00:36:21,739
Most likely the blue is going to come down and the greens going to predominate and keep going for a while longer.

363
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:25,578
But it's difficult to predict exactly how much longer it'll be.

364
00:36:25,579 --> 00:36:30,679
A five epidemic is going to go on fall because there should be cross-protection between being two and five.

365
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:37,969
So I'm uncertain what's going to happen next, but the government is very concerned and so we have a lot of measures in Hong Kong.

366
00:36:38,269 --> 00:36:43,519
The travel based measures, when I go back to Hong Kong are in, I think in six weeks time I've been putting it off.

367
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:46,549
When I go back my need to a pre-departure test, it's going to be negative.

368
00:36:46,729 --> 00:36:50,539
If it's positive, I'm not allowed back. I need at least two vaccine doses.

369
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,579
In order to be allowed back. I need a three day hotel booking. There's not many bookings available.

370
00:36:55,789 --> 00:37:00,169
It's not easy to arrange and I need to a lot of testing after I get back.

371
00:37:00,439 --> 00:37:05,629
If I test positive within the first few days, I could be staying at a five star hotel for my quarantine.

372
00:37:05,929 --> 00:37:11,529
They allow that now, but if I test positive, I'm going to one of those containers for a week.

373
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:17,419
I don't come home if I test positive after Labor. So the Government is trying to encourage business travelers to come.

374
00:37:17,749 --> 00:37:20,989
But if business travelers, you know, check what's the procedures,

375
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:28,549
it's one thing to say you can come in and stay for three nights in the room at the Hilton Hotel, you know, the five star hotel or whatever.

376
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:35,389
But if you also find out if you're positive in that period, you're going to a container is not so attractive.

377
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:40,819
And then in the community, we have a lot of policies, unfortunately.

378
00:37:41,029 --> 00:37:48,319
So we have a mask mandate indoors and outdoors. It's the only exception is if you're in the country park, really in the countryside,

379
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:51,499
and also if you're doing vigorous exercise, which is a very definition.

380
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:53,719
And yesterday I got from Twitter,

381
00:37:53,989 --> 00:38:03,499
these six older gentleman were in the park together and they don't find each 600 USD each person for breaching the outdoor.

382
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:10,239
A band of four. More than four people reached the Cobra Band wearing masks.

383
00:38:10,629 --> 00:38:13,689
Still not acceptable. We have a mobile phone out there.

384
00:38:13,689 --> 00:38:19,358
We need to scan everywhere we go, which tracks all movements and in theory is allowing contact tracing.

385
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,659
But actually there's not that much contact tracing being done at the moment.

386
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:30,879
And that also allows the government to enforce the vaccine pass, which is a form of vaccine mandate, a three dose mandate in Hong Kong.

387
00:38:31,209 --> 00:38:39,969
I've got it as 18 plus, but I just read in the news it's going to go down to age 11 for for children to want to go to lots of places,

388
00:38:39,969 --> 00:38:46,119
restaurants, shopping malls, hospitals, businesses and university campuses.

389
00:38:46,329 --> 00:38:51,909
And it will be schools as well. So a three dose mandate, that's an exception if you got infected.

390
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:59,769
A six month window when you don't need to get the vaccine because it's a natural boost, but it's ultimately a three dose mandate.

391
00:39:00,729 --> 00:39:06,579
And I got myself in a little bit of trouble with the government by arguing against a mandate for younger people.

392
00:39:06,939 --> 00:39:12,398
I said, you can you know, you can argue the pros and cons for older people, but for younger people,

393
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:18,819
I argued that I thought there were more arguments against the mandate than there were for a mandate in younger people.

394
00:39:18,819 --> 00:39:22,089
But the government was was not at all happy about that.

395
00:39:23,139 --> 00:39:26,889
Well, we have a lot of other things you can read all the different things schools,

396
00:39:26,889 --> 00:39:33,639
children and me as a as a university staff and other businesses require daily rapid tests with a photo

397
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:39,519
uploaded against a like a newspaper or something that shows the date to prove that it is done today.

398
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,229
So a negative rapid test.

399
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:51,159
And the government has said that they will only allow schools to go back full day if vaccine coverage in the school exceeds 90% with three doses.

400
00:39:51,729 --> 00:39:59,469
And so we're a long way from that. So children are going to school in the mornings, going out for lunch with their classmates or going home for lunch,

401
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:03,519
and then staying at home in the afternoon to do online lessons.

402
00:40:03,999 --> 00:40:07,899
And this is three years into the pandemic where there's been a lot of disruption to schooling.

403
00:40:09,159 --> 00:40:13,839
So it's is harsh. I'll tell you one final thing, which which I find bizarre.

404
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:19,409
There's a system for reporting rapid test results to the government if you're positive

405
00:40:19,409 --> 00:40:23,249
and the government encourages you to do that when you report a rapid test positive.

406
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:28,079
It's on the right hand side here. The government then may ask you to go into a PCR test.

407
00:40:28,739 --> 00:40:32,729
You'd like to double check it. And so you go to the Cova clinic, you do the slope.

408
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:36,118
PCR is done. There's a $10,000 Hong Kong dollar.

409
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,939
That's a 1500 U.S. dollars fine if you don't do the PCR.

410
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:45,569
But there's also been a number of cases where people have gone.

411
00:40:45,659 --> 00:40:47,039
They've reported rapid test positive.

412
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:53,699
They've gone to do the PCR, the PCR comes back negative and the governments fine them for lying about the rapid test result.

413
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:04,649
So the allegation has been that the person falsely reported a positive rapid test result because that PCR two days later came back negative.

414
00:41:05,069 --> 00:41:09,959
And I thought that was a bizarre way to try and encourage people to report the results.

415
00:41:11,149 --> 00:41:14,639
Now we recognize the possibility of a false positive results,

416
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:21,238
but I think the government was imagining people gaming the system because obviously if you if you have a rapid test positive,

417
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:27,149
you get an isolation order. Seven days, potentially sick leave may be paid in some companies.

418
00:41:27,539 --> 00:41:36,899
So that in general, in terms of co-promotion Hong Kong, there's been a lot of sticks, not many carrots, which is a little bit frustrating.

419
00:41:39,149 --> 00:41:41,949
In terms of the vaccine uptake, now we're doing much better.

420
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:48,779
The fifth wave really boosted vaccine uptake, as you can imagine that particularly when there were thousands of people dying.

421
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:57,599
So now we're in a relatively better position. About 70% of people having had three doses, both doses not so much uptake so far.

422
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:02,999
Looking by age, I haven't got 202 twos in that, which has just started with without much enthusiasm.

423
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,049
But most age groups that the two dose coverage is pretty good.

424
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:13,139
Older adults, it's picked up substantially and the three dose coverage is getting up as well.

425
00:42:13,499 --> 00:42:19,849
But the gap between two and three is mainly people who were infected and haven't had to get their third dose yet.

426
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:23,919
But we'll have to get it to satisfy the vaccine mandate at some point,

427
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:28,209
I think within the next three months, depending on the timing of the infections.

428
00:42:29,399 --> 00:42:34,889
We haven't had any flu. We've got we've we've we've eliminated flu because of all of the stringent measures.

429
00:42:35,129 --> 00:42:40,709
There were some FluMist detections, which are the blows of the bubbles at the bottom, but really not not much.

430
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:47,969
Not much expectation of flu coming back soon, because we still have a lot of measures in Hong Kong to stop COVID.

431
00:42:50,169 --> 00:42:58,749
We have to recognize the risks of dynamic. COVID public health is more than COVID in China, particularly in cities in China.

432
00:42:59,019 --> 00:43:08,139
They're spending enormous amounts of money on zero-covid, on locking down cities and repeatedly testing people every two or three days by PCR.

433
00:43:08,379 --> 00:43:15,219
So entire cities tested by PCR repeatedly that the city offers the Hong Kong Macao.

434
00:43:15,399 --> 00:43:22,959
Another special amenities region did 14 rounds of universal testing last month, 14 rounds of PCR for every single resident.

435
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:24,819
And that's extremely expensive.

436
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:34,599
So some cities in China have spent more than half of their health care budget for any health care, cancer, heart disease, whatever, surgeries.

437
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:38,019
Half of that health care budget is already going on PCR testing for COVID.

438
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:45,699
And so it is costing an enormous amount. And it's also very disruptive not only in China, but the supply chain disruption as well.

439
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:52,329
So it's seems like there should be a transition plan away from zero COVID.

440
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:57,009
But in mainland China, there's no announcement about a transition, a transition plan.

441
00:43:57,789 --> 00:44:03,039
The expectation is that Zero-Covid will continue. And in Hong Kong, we're part of China.

442
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:12,279
And so despite not being anywhere near zero, the government is still very keen on the idea of continuing with a dynamic zero economy strategy.

443
00:44:12,549 --> 00:44:17,049
And just at the moment, we are dealing with an outbreak which will, you know,

444
00:44:17,409 --> 00:44:21,819
in the government's mind will stop eventually and maybe it will have a chance to be a zero for a while.

445
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:34,119
So that's where we are at the moment. And my final comments, we're still dealing with the Zero-Covid strategy in the middle, the middle point.

446
00:44:34,869 --> 00:44:39,339
I wonder whether some parts of the world are going to revisit the idea of short term

447
00:44:39,339 --> 00:44:42,519
containment of the next respiratory virus pandemic like the next flu pandemic.

448
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:50,829
In pandemic plans, containment is typically just the first paragraph of the pandemic plan explaining that you might try it,

449
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:56,499
but it's it's not going to be sustainable. And you better to switch to mitigation soon and to save more lives.

450
00:44:56,859 --> 00:45:02,139
Actually, some places Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore, maybe some others as well,

451
00:45:02,379 --> 00:45:09,699
may consider short term containment of the next pandemic as an alternative to immediate mitigation.

452
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:15,698
And then the last point I said already that that I think the danger posed by low vaccine

453
00:45:15,699 --> 00:45:20,739
uptake should have been addressed and the focus was on zero-covid and on containment.

454
00:45:20,739 --> 00:45:28,539
But I think we needed to prepare for the scenario where COVID spread uncontrollably, which which is what actually happened.

455
00:45:29,559 --> 00:45:33,099
So I'll finish that. I have still got some time for full Q&A.

456
00:45:45,169 --> 00:45:48,799
Yes. It's very interesting.

457
00:45:49,219 --> 00:45:55,329
I was wondering if you can say anything on how the government got you in trouble and if.

458
00:45:55,549 --> 00:45:59,149
Oh, yes, I will take a look to the future.

459
00:45:59,269 --> 00:46:07,398
The point I tried to make almost every time, a few times, the flash point is that a mandate,

460
00:46:07,399 --> 00:46:12,439
in my opinion, should or should be justified in a situation where it's the last resort.

461
00:46:12,709 --> 00:46:20,448
So you have the idea, you know, if we don't mandate it, there's going to be a lot of people dying, maybe not the people vaccinated.

462
00:46:20,449 --> 00:46:24,409
It could be older people. But there's going to be a big issue if we don't do it. And we tried everything.

463
00:46:24,589 --> 00:46:29,529
And it's the last resort. And I think for 18 year olds, it's not a situation of last resort.

464
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:33,319
Actually, the two dose uptake is very good. The three are sometimes moderate.

465
00:46:33,829 --> 00:46:40,779
So the argument must be that, you know, unless we can get the three dose uptake to 90 something percent, we're going to have a disaster on our hands.

466
00:46:40,789 --> 00:46:41,779
I don't think that's the case.

467
00:46:42,109 --> 00:46:47,869
And the problem with a mandate is that it puts people off vaccination as well and the government doesn't accept the argument.

468
00:46:47,869 --> 00:46:53,778
So I said having a mandate will increase hesitancy and the government response was to me saying

469
00:46:53,779 --> 00:46:57,739
that there shouldn't be a mandate with increased vaccine hesitancy by putting people off,

470
00:46:57,739 --> 00:47:03,169
you know, by not toeing the line. And that one specific thing that upset me.

471
00:47:03,859 --> 00:47:10,609
The vaccine mandate is required to go to restaurants and cinemas and workplaces and schools and so on, the government said.

472
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:15,559
There's some people in Hong Kong who only got vaccinated in order to comply with the mandate.

473
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:22,519
And if we were to relax it now, which is my argument, I wasn't asking them to apologize to the past just to say, stop it now, don't have any more.

474
00:47:22,729 --> 00:47:31,819
They said, if we stop it now, all the people that got vaccinated only to comply with the mandate will feel cheated because they don't benefit.

475
00:47:31,939 --> 00:47:37,729
They don't have an advantage over other people that refused because everyone could go to restaurants so everyone could go to work or school.

476
00:47:38,119 --> 00:47:42,139
And I thought that was a strange argument because that vaccination should be of some benefit.

477
00:47:42,349 --> 00:47:47,388
You don't need to say that effectively. You're going to punish the people who choose not to get vaccinated.

478
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:51,709
I thought that was harsh. Yeah.

479
00:47:52,009 --> 00:47:58,189
I can tell you the other one. I put a slide at the end. Please don't take photos of this one because I can from it again.

480
00:47:58,729 --> 00:48:07,249
So in Hong Kong, this is in October 2021, we had a policy in Hong Kong that every COVID case was isolated for a minimum of ten days.

481
00:48:07,249 --> 00:48:15,729
If you get me to Hong Kong as a traveler, you test positive. You go into a container terminal camp for ten days minimum until you test negative.

482
00:48:15,819 --> 00:48:19,519
PCR average was actually 14 days. So that's one thing already.

483
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:20,568
And some people came in,

484
00:48:20,569 --> 00:48:26,959
they'd already recovered from COVID and they were in the end of their infection and they test positive another 14 days isolation.

485
00:48:27,289 --> 00:48:36,289
The government had this brainwave in October 2021. They said, okay, after the isolation, minimum ten days, let's do another 14 days just to be sure.

486
00:48:36,649 --> 00:48:41,519
So as a post isolation quarantine, I said, that's ridiculous.

487
00:48:41,809 --> 00:48:47,899
On Twitter and the newspapers picked it up. They said, you know, Hong Kong University expert says new policy is ridiculous.

488
00:48:49,369 --> 00:48:54,479
The health minister like upbraided me. It said some way, you know, criticizing.

489
00:48:54,479 --> 00:48:59,569
I said if it you know any measure to reduce risk is, you know,

490
00:48:59,899 --> 00:49:06,529
we were going to take every possible measure to reduce risk zero COVID is a strategy and we've got to do everything we can.

491
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:10,549
And I said at some point that it seemed like it might be unethical.

492
00:49:10,699 --> 00:49:19,639
And in the bottom right here, measures taken by the government in the community's interest must not be caught unethical, like a slap on the wrist.

493
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:24,169
I mean, I couldn't believe it. And people did it.

494
00:49:24,499 --> 00:49:29,118
They did 14 days isolation and then another 14 days post isolation.

495
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:36,109
Isolation with with absolutely no rationale just because the government thought it would be a good idea.

496
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:44,299
So I don't know. Anyway, so I advocate the go ahead.

497
00:49:44,779 --> 00:49:52,909
So the I mean, I think this balance between containment and mitigation and the timing and when and in what populations is like,

498
00:49:53,269 --> 00:49:57,979
it's still the really kind of tension point sometimes of what we learn from the pandemic.

499
00:49:58,369 --> 00:50:09,289
And but because places like Hong Kong did that with so much testing and surveillance on top of it, it seems like when thinking about future pandemics,

500
00:50:09,649 --> 00:50:19,009
you can kind of use what's happened in Hong Kong to define the parameters where containment works versus you can very easily quantified.

501
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:22,789
Here's the threshold where, yes, maybe this is unrecoverable.

502
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:26,329
All right. And one thing I did, I mention a tool in Hong Kong.

503
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:31,429
We had SA in 2003, 1700 cases, 300 deaths,

504
00:50:31,759 --> 00:50:40,519
a lot of deaths in health care workers and a lot of panic in the community about corona virus epidemics and the potential for coronavirus pandemics.

505
00:50:40,519 --> 00:50:46,519
That's why I moved to Hong Kong in 2004, was to prepare for the next source, which they thought could be imminent.

506
00:50:46,789 --> 00:50:51,349
And it took 20 years, but it came SARS-CoV-2, right.

507
00:50:51,739 --> 00:50:59,119
So because of source, there was an enormous investment in Hong Kong's infrastructure for testing and they use it seasonally for flu and other things.

508
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:02,929
They test a lot of people and they're ready with the public health measures.

509
00:51:02,929 --> 00:51:09,918
They got the legal framework. So enough isolation and quarantine. And I think other countries are going to look at that now and Singapore and see like

510
00:51:09,919 --> 00:51:14,449
what needs to be modified in the coming years to be better prepared for the next one.

511
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:20,149
And learning from Hong Kong's preparations in the laboratory and the hospitals infection control.

512
00:51:20,179 --> 00:51:22,939
We had a load of negative pressure rooms and hospital staff.

513
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:29,569
I have one study in hospital talk where there were minimal infections in dirty wards and that's very different in most parts of the world.

514
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:33,048
And I think that the training and the equipment which we had in Hong Kong and

515
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:36,499
maybe other places don't have don't even have masks for healthcare workers.

516
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:39,879
We had it. And then where are the inflection points when that.

517
00:51:39,889 --> 00:51:45,019
Yeah, yes, that's it. And I think what one of the other things to put into that is also the uncertainties,

518
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,389
because in the early days of a pandemic, you don't know what's going to happen.

519
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:52,099
And if you pull the trigger on containment and it turns out to be more like 2009, you look stupid,

520
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:57,829
but if you don't and it's severe, then, you know, you potentially have a lot of a lot of mortality.

521
00:51:57,829 --> 00:52:01,309
So it's the uncertainty is also really a key point.

522
00:52:01,579 --> 00:52:09,169
Yeah, assessing severity is a real problem and we've never really come up with a good way to do this.

523
00:52:09,499 --> 00:52:17,679
But I was complexed in terms of your results with the Pfizer vaccine versus.

524
00:52:17,869 --> 00:52:29,929
Yeah. And how much of that was because it was two doses with the overcrowded way when two doses, even with the Pfizer vaccine, didn't work very well.

525
00:52:29,929 --> 00:52:33,499
But we found that two doses was not too bad against severe disease.

526
00:52:33,529 --> 00:52:39,769
If it was a reason, if it was a reasonable second dose that was evident recent, recent, but later is not.

527
00:52:40,219 --> 00:52:46,639
And one of my question is how waning in protection relates to waning in antibodies, which is not not that slow.

528
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:50,839
You look at the antibody waning for Pfizer, it's not that fast waning, but the protection.

529
00:52:51,509 --> 00:53:01,639
That's the other thing that you realize is a very the little bit of data I've seen with non non uh.

530
00:53:03,039 --> 00:53:12,609
RNA vaccines, messenger RNA vaccines is that they weigh in less quickly than the RNA vaccines.

531
00:53:14,479 --> 00:53:17,949
And well, this is this is so fast.

532
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:22,789
And the idea would be that something like in the U.S., the novavax.

533
00:53:22,939 --> 00:53:26,939
Yes. It's going to last longer. Yes. Yeah.

534
00:53:26,939 --> 00:53:35,069
To me, that's a big question. And then what's the optimal vaccine schedule going to become annual or twice annual or what?

535
00:53:35,669 --> 00:53:42,419
I mean, you know, what I mean is are you going to have see is ever going to have seasonality?

536
00:53:42,449 --> 00:53:46,019
You're right. With diabetes, are we measuring waning of the right thing?

537
00:53:46,789 --> 00:53:53,849
Yes, we're comparing apples and oranges between the novavax waiting and waiting on this so that our assays mean apples and oranges,

538
00:53:53,849 --> 00:53:57,689
neutralizing antibody and anti spike. And that's not the full story.

539
00:53:57,689 --> 00:54:05,488
I think that's what we're finding. But unfortunately, what's in the literature the most, particularly because it's all Pfizer other places as well.

540
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:09,148
There's a lot of data on Pfizer, not so much data on the other. That's the problem.

541
00:54:09,149 --> 00:54:13,289
We really have very little data on the AstraZeneca vaccine.

542
00:54:13,409 --> 00:54:17,729
Yeah, which is yet again, it has been used extensively in the world.

543
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:23,639
Yeah. So there was a presentation to see a meeting from from two W.H.O., sage members,

544
00:54:24,509 --> 00:54:29,309
60 slides on vaccines and vaccine strains, selection and policy and all of that.

545
00:54:29,669 --> 00:54:36,439
Not a single slide on, quote, someone else, right? It was all Pfizer, some AstraZeneca, no inactivated vaccines.

546
00:54:36,809 --> 00:54:41,969
US Yeah. I mean it's a it's an issue because I think we're missing the full picture.

547
00:54:42,659 --> 00:54:47,219
Last time I said that last question, I was just going to ask if that's the.

548
00:54:48,759 --> 00:54:54,458
But what would be the reason that I'm not arguing like against U.S. centricity or whatever,

549
00:54:54,459 --> 00:55:00,459
but what is the reason that data that probably do exist on Coronavac and AstraZeneca are just not?

550
00:55:01,209 --> 00:55:09,449
Are they ignored here or in the American context or other Western countries where they're accused of being used in the wrong places to study?

551
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:16,358
But I think the question is, does the data exist? In some cases, the data does not exist in the same way.

552
00:55:16,359 --> 00:55:20,649
In some cases, that's being ignored. I mean, I would say it's a bit of an event, but I mean,

553
00:55:20,649 --> 00:55:26,169
there's some good studies from South America in South America where all of these vaccines have.

554
00:55:26,439 --> 00:55:29,499
I feel like sometimes that data's downplayed because of the origin.

555
00:55:29,889 --> 00:55:35,799
Because, you know, those people are. Right. Well, because it's a vaccine that's not on the U.S. market.

556
00:55:36,329 --> 00:55:42,129
I know. I think part of it is the policy of Germans right now.

557
00:55:43,149 --> 00:55:50,049
Everything is relevant to the local market and also rapid review.

558
00:55:50,299 --> 00:55:54,789
Yes. And I just reviewed a paper from Sweden.

559
00:55:55,179 --> 00:56:05,818
It was. And this this use the whole population as a cohort and it was not well done and it gets rejected.

560
00:56:05,819 --> 00:56:09,028
And therefore you're not going to hear the results.

561
00:56:09,029 --> 00:56:13,019
Right. Because because of the pressure to get things out.

562
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:19,439
Right. Thank you very much, everybody, for coming in second time.

563
00:56:24,869 --> 00:56:30,179
State your visit. And then for those that don't know, next week,

564
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:31,790
we've got in conjunction with the Francis Lectureship that's happening on Thursday evening, that's going to be lectures all day.
