1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:07,550
I feel like having St Ives in here to participate substantially means doing what?

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,960
I can't choose to do it.

3
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,590
We are. It's just that, like, I have not had time to sit down.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:23,670
I'm like, maybe financially, but it's very. Yes, we are going to do Saturday though, because Friday is the poster session.

5
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,470
So I think Saturday is better than people voted. I'm just going to make the executive decision.

6
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:38,490
Sorry. Yeah. I realize what's going on with Saturday.

7
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:47,650
You're technically free. I know you are. You don't have any place to run to over the weekend just yet.

8
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,430
We are still doing it. I just I'm going to go ahead and make a change.

9
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:59,130
They keep on forgetting because I'm he's going to stay at home that time, but I might drive it.

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:11,370
Yeah. I mean, if they be a switch to the same thing is the idea of fighting those crazy you might as well.

11
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:22,580
I think that's one of the great relief working day, is that not.

12
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:32,880
Yes, you have to do it but don't do like an insane turkey like the other one.

13
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:42,030
I'm going to be for PI. I'm also going to pay my taxes and I used to make a pumpkin.

14
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,870
I may have gotten lost, so I gonna get paid.

15
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,020
So let's get started. One announcement about homework.

16
00:01:52,020 --> 00:02:02,730
Three We did didn't originally upload the data set for question three and that's now uploaded to set.

17
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:09,450
And also the due date is at 22nd and we changed that on campus right now.

18
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:18,300
So it's all consistent. So like the interviews as well as who's going to be our guest lecture today,

19
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:29,610
he is a professor in the School of Sustainability, an expert in conservation, biology and also on disease ecology.

20
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,209
Just finished wrote a book published recently on the intersection between disease,

21
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:40,740
conservation, biology and disease ecology, which I will talk a little bit more about.

22
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:51,780
Yeah. And he's going to be connecting to these ecology is mostly dealing with diseases of non-human animals but

23
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,750
today he's going to be connecting that why disease ecology is important to us in the context of human health.

24
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:03,210
Okay. All right. Thanks, Joe. Thanks for coming here.

25
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,310
I assume you're all grad students. Okay.

26
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:14,930
So I'll assume that we have a I project, let's say.

27
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,719
I mean, if if you guys can't hear me, let me know. And I can.

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,440
We can I can make up. Okay. Yeah, let's try this and see how it goes.

29
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,730
So let me see. So my background, I'm an ecologist.

30
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:46,469
I'm very much interested in infectious organisms and the role they play in in the workings of natural ecosystems and the field of disease ecology.

31
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,080
Who studies this is it's a pretty new one.

32
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:59,129
It basically emerged in the last 20 years, and it's probably arguably one of the triumphs of environmental science, of ecological science.

33
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:07,860
We really had tremendous advances in understanding how infectious diseases affect most natural ecosystems,

34
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,180
but by extension, by understanding how these organisms live.

35
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,050
This has had definitely important implications for human health, for public health.

36
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:19,520
Okay.

37
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:31,140
So what I'll be talking a lot about is looking at the issues that you guys are interested in, which is presumably human health, public well-being.

38
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:42,510
But from the perspective of of an ecologist and I will be talking to some extent about the effects

39
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:50,489
of epidemics are actually epizootics in wildlife populations because these things are related.

40
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:59,760
So this is a theme I'll be coming back again and again about how, yes, you can look at it through the narrow human health perspective, but.

41
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,660
Probably a scientist that actually, even as a public health practitioner,

42
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:11,580
you're going to be more successful if you step back and look at these organisms and how

43
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,379
they fit in the natural environment because they're really just parts of a bigger system.

44
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,950
There's a reason why these organisms are the way they are and why they do the things that do to their hosts.

45
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,450
So this is some of the things I want to discuss in this in this today.

46
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:34,920
So what I would like to do is, is this a laser pointer?

47
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:47,910
Laser pointer works. Okay. So so what I would like to do today is sort of like talk about infectious agents in a broader scope and then talk about

48
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:55,170
the relationship between biodiversity and infectious disease and why these things are related and why this matters.

49
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:06,389
I want to briefly review the whole idea of what microbiology macro parasites know to talk about ideas, emerging infectious diseases,

50
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:18,030
which I'm sure you've heard ad nauseum in your classes and then essentially talk to the main emphasis of this class is going to be

51
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:27,180
to discuss the role of the environment for human disease and kind of like how anthropogenic effects on the natural environment.

52
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:34,050
What we do to the natural world affects the public health conditions and affects human health.

53
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,379
And I'll try to use some case studies, and there are a lot of examples of these,

54
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:50,130
but I think there is merit in trying to give it a little bit more detail about some of these pathogens and the way,

55
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,490
you know, we there's definitely biases in the way we view the social environment.

56
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,990
You know, when you look at race relationships in the United States and all the biases,

57
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:06,330
their biases in public health and which infectious agents we study,

58
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:17,190
and there's a whole group of infectious agents that, you know, neglected tropical diseases basically that get short shrift.

59
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:24,540
So I decided to kind of like focus a lot on some of these pathogens that you maybe not hear too much in other classes.

60
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:35,219
All right. So I'll try to give you some examples both about how infectious organisms affect public health in other countries predominantly,

61
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:42,720
but also how maybe a couple of examples of noninfectious agents that affect human health.

62
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,410
And then finally, if we have time and talk about dilution effects and what these are,

63
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,340
out of curiosity, how many of you have heard about dilution effects and.

64
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,910
Epidemiology. Okay. Okay. So that's in your topic.

65
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,270
So we'll talk about that because it's important, I think. Okay.

66
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:08,770
So let's start with something really familiar, right? So you guys all have know about this disease threat and triangle, right?

67
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,220
How you really need to have the interaction of.

68
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:20,000
Host parasite and the environment in order to have really an epidemic take off.

69
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:30,440
So when we're looking at infectious organisms and let's call them parasitic, these are essentially parasitic organisms.

70
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:39,110
Okay? So these are organisms, whether they're micro macro parasites that take resources away from their host in order to make their living.

71
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:47,420
And these organisms are really quite a surprisingly large fraction of organisms in life,

72
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:52,310
depending on how you define that, because we use this definition really broadly.

73
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:58,060
A cow is a parasite, right? Because it steals resources away from from the grass.

74
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:09,170
Right. But if you even if you use a reasonable definition, up to 40 or 50% of all organisms out in nature are parasitic one way or the other.

75
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,280
Okay, this is half of the organisms out in nature do this thing.

76
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:24,470
So it's a pretty common lifestyle, I would say. So these parasites broadly read a really important part of biodiversity.

77
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:35,910
So when you're looking at the relationship between biodiversity and and human health, there's clearly a relationship.

78
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:41,150
And this is actually something that I hope I'll be able to emphasize and drive home.

79
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:46,310
But our well-being depends on the well-being of nature.

80
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,370
So biodiversity, native species, communities provide services to humans.

81
00:09:54,810 --> 00:10:00,629
And a lot of this is just broadly about things like food or oxygen or whatever.

82
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:07,050
You know, this is ecosystem services, as we call it, in ecology, but a lot of it is health related.

83
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:21,810
And then humans come in and this is where humans come in with our activities and we mess up natural ecosystems.

84
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:30,150
Right? And in the process, we actually affect these ecosystem services that species communities provide to humans.

85
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:36,050
So how do we do that? Okay. How do humans affect natural ecosystems?

86
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:40,340
Ideas here. What are the processes that matter?

87
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:47,150
Yeah. I'm thinking if the main one could be like sewage. Like sewage treatment and things like that.

88
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:51,770
Okay, so you can do it.

89
00:10:52,640 --> 00:11:00,550
Is it like something to think about? Right. All right.

90
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:09,520
Okay. So we have we have basically sewage.

91
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:18,060
I'm going to I'm going to call this eutrophication. Okay.

92
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:25,130
What else? Yeah. Groundwater sources when we build roads and cover areas.

93
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:29,420
So can you speak of replenishment of groundwater? Okay.

94
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,889
So we're messing up the hydrological system, right.

95
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:50,060
And the disruption in risk.

96
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,610
This can really have a variety take a variety of forms.

97
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,800
So, for example, it can result in flooding or it can result in drought.

98
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,280
And each of these can actually have public health implications. Right.

99
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,510
Okay. More ideas. How do we affect natural ecosystems?

100
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,170
Yeah. Go ahead. Deforestation.

101
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:21,129
Deforestation? Absolutely. Okay.

102
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:28,950
Very good. What else? Come on, you're informed citizens, you know?

103
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:35,990
Yeah, technically, but drugs, if you look at our bodies as an ecosystem for parasites.

104
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:40,300
Yes. Involvement of those parasites, so on. So.

105
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:45,490
So it's pollution of the environment, both in the broad sense.

106
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:53,379
You know, for example, we can have antibiotic dissemination into waterways or that our bodies are

107
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,190
loaded with all kinds of chemicals that affect this host parasite interaction.

108
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:00,790
Okay. So I'm going to call this broad lead pollution. Okay.

109
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,960
All right. What's going on in Sharm el Sheikh right now in Egypt?

110
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,670
COP26, climate change or.

111
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:26,740
Yeah, I just wanted to add more generally, especially with biodiversity, any time we develop an area we like set limits for species to be able to.

112
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,190
Engage with each other. Like when one of the examples was like the border in Mexico.

113
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,450
Like splitting species from being able to interact with each other and their communities populations.

114
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:46,010
Yeah. So. So that's a that's a good one. That's a disruption of, let's say, migratory pathways.

115
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:53,370
Okay. I'm going to call the disruption of natural networks.

116
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:03,450
Okay. That's a good one. And global climate change.

117
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:07,020
Right. You guys are all familiar with that. Okay.

118
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:12,810
So. So we mess with the natural environment in many different ways and.

119
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:26,920
We have changes in the immuno competence of those as a result. We have passed pathogens spill over, over kill wildlife stress, ecosystems stress.

120
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:35,530
There really are a variety of ways in which humans affect the natural environment and all of this affects ultimately the ecosystem services,

121
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,850
especially the ones that are entrusted to you guys, which is public health.

122
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:50,430
Now. The other point I wanted to make is that when you look at the ways in which humans end up causing extinction,

123
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:55,120
species extinction, make make no mistake about that.

124
00:14:55,140 --> 00:15:03,750
You know, when you look at the two big dangers that humanity faces, that our survival as a species is going to depend on.

125
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,190
It's not going to be public. It's not going to be infectious organisms that are bad.

126
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:14,610
But the things are really going to get worse in the long term as global climate change and and species loss,

127
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,020
because we depend on natural ecosystems for for surviving.

128
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:23,460
And once we lose biodiversity, we can't survive.

129
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,020
So this is a really serious problem in the long term.

130
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,150
In any case, we are causing species extinction.

131
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:37,829
We are actually affecting the loss of parasites and pathogens.

132
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:42,690
And those in turn affect ecosystem function and health.

133
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:54,510
So what I'm trying to say is if we look at the effects of this environmental disruption on human health,

134
00:15:54,510 --> 00:16:00,780
but actually there's also disruption that happens on natural ecosystems because of parasite and pathogen extinction,

135
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:10,770
because these organisms that are part of the natural systems and when they're taking out of this complex machinery, the whole ecosystem doesn't work.

136
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,070
Okay. So this is a pretty important point I'm making here.

137
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:22,860
As public health practitioners, you think about pathogens and parasites as being these problematic agents that we need to control.

138
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:34,140
But you also need to be aware that natural ecosystems, these species, play an important role, and if they disappear, the ecosystem falls apart.

139
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:46,110
So there's actually right now a pretty significant of voices in the ecologist community who call for the protection of pathogens and parasites.

140
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,830
Okay. And this sounds like probably weird to you,

141
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:58,770
but it's it's something that comes out of the recognition of the importance of these organisms for the function of natural ecosystems.

142
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,080
So I want to put that out there for you to remember, and we can discuss it if we have time at the end.

143
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:09,420
Okay. But don't always assume that pathogens and parasites are bad agents.

144
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:18,360
Okay. All right. So before we start this, just a quick note.

145
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:23,430
Are you guys familiar with that distinction between micro versus macro parasites?

146
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,620
So I'm so. Okay. So let's review that briefly.

147
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:36,870
So one of the recognitions that organismal biologists, ecologists,

148
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:45,750
whatever you want to call these type of biologists have come over the years is that parasites really differ in their lifestyles.

149
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:51,090
They're really trim in nature. There's like tremendous variation in parasitic organisms.

150
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:55,840
But you can broadly categorize them in two broad categories.

151
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,719
Okay. So the one is micro versus macro parasites.

152
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,660
And one way of thinking about them is the one group tends to be unicellular.

153
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:09,500
The other group tends to be macro visible to the naked eye.

154
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,610
You don't need a microscope and there are micro parasites.

155
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:20,400
So there are differences in size. There are differences in generation time.

156
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:26,370
Okay. So micro parasitic organisms tend to replicate very quickly.

157
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:35,100
They have very quick doubling times versus macro parasites tend to have generation time,

158
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:44,010
so are in the order of days and weeks or even months as opposed to 2 hours and days at most,

159
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:54,930
the life cycle in micro parasites tends to be direct, which means you have a single host one stage and it's just it's pretty simple.

160
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,129
Macro parasites like think something like tapeworms, for example.

161
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,590
You have different stages living in different hosts,

162
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:11,160
potentially doing really different things in these organisms and each species of host different type of reproduction.

163
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,730
Micro parasites tends to be a sexual and macro parasite.

164
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:23,730
You often have sexes that may that are required to form, to have gametes, have fertilization and production of of zygote.

165
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:27,230
The parasite load is very different.

166
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:36,270
You know, when we're talking about viruses and bacteria, we're talking about billions or trillions and tapeworms, which are extreme macro parasites.

167
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,760
You can be infected with one or two individuals, right? You can use the royal we.

168
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:49,130
When you refer to yourself and your tapeworm. Right. And you are going to live with that tapeworm for many years.

169
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,530
It's your friend, it's your body, it's his leg.

170
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:58,290
And in any case, they're very different.

171
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:05,370
Right. And micro parasites tend to eventually evoke pretty strong immunity in the host.

172
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,759
That's why infections tend to be transient versus macro.

173
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:18,150
Parasites have evolved strategies to fly under the radar, not really escape the wrath of the immune system, and persist for long periods of time.

174
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,410
Okay, so these are two very broad strategies that you should be familiar with because they're pretty fundamental to the parasite work.

175
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:34,530
Okay. I'm mentioning this because it kind of like sets the stage for what I'll be talking a little bit later on.

176
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,850
So I want to talk next about emerging infectious diseases.

177
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,350
And I'll just assume you guys are all familiar with this. Yeah.

178
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:50,460
Okay, good. So, um, so, first of all, how we define IDs.

179
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,600
You find these things? What's an emerging infectious disease? When is it emerging?

180
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:10,690
What do you guys think? Having Thanksgiving dinner with your aunt who really doesn't know too much.

181
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:17,070
Guy is scientific, scientifically disinclined, and she's asking what I mean.

182
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:21,690
And you have to explain to her what an emerging infectious disease is.

183
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:22,620
How would you do that?

184
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:40,680
A novel pathogen or a pathogen that would spread to a new geographic area or like at a different incidence in an area it's already in.

185
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:48,959
Okay. Okay. So, first of all, a novel pathogen. Write something that is new, whether it's newly evolved or.

186
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,140
Yeah. Okay. So that's that's one really good point. Okay.

187
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:03,520
Okay. What else? A pathogen which evolves to infect a host that it has not infected before.

188
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,110
Yeah. Okay. So you have a switch of hosts.

189
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,000
Maybe now this pathogen is infecting a new species of our stride host's job.

190
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,660
All right, so. Absolutely. Okay. What else could it be?

191
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:24,580
Yeah. Maybe, like, not only a pathogen and a host, but also noticing how it affects a specific population.

192
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:32,770
Mm hmm. Mm hmm. So maybe it has evolved new kind of virulence characteristics, and it's now much more impactful on the host.

193
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,340
Okay, so any other thoughts?

194
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:43,110
These are all really good ideas. Maybe spread into a new region.

195
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:51,179
Okay. So it's a pretty malleable term. And, you know, to some extent, there is a little bit discretion about where you use it,

196
00:22:51,180 --> 00:23:00,400
but it's typically used to describe all these new diseases that are befalling actually not just humans, but also wildlife species.

197
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:04,950
So remember, I come to this from the perspective of a wildlife biologist,

198
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:10,710
but you will see that these problems are actually quite closely related to each other.

199
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:19,950
Okay. So the examples here, out of curiosity, how many of you have heard of Keter deal?

200
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:23,240
Mycosis. Okay. Okay. Some of you. Okay. That's good.

201
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:26,290
That's great. So continue on my coat. So, do you want to say what?

202
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:32,400
What you know about it? Yes. I worked very heavily with Kid for quite a few years, actually.

203
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:41,010
I worked with a bunch of herpetologists. But Chytrid is a fungus, invasive fungus that is killing a nurtured species worldwide.

204
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:49,649
Yeah. So Chytrid is this weird, obscure, obscure group of funguses that emerge and smell killing literally,

205
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,570
like it's responsible for the extinction of hundreds of frog species worldwide.

206
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,870
Like hundreds of species are going extinct, as we're speaking,

207
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,740
because of this emerging pathogen that ultimately it's human agency that spread it across the globe.

208
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,090
So it's a big deal.

209
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:18,780
So in any case, we have a variety of make your list of some of the emerging pathogens that we've been dealing with in the last 20 years or so.

210
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:25,320
And what I want to point I want to make is that these IEDs are actually increasing in incidence.

211
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,170
So here's some data from paper that's over ten years ago.

212
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,020
Okay. Just shows it basically at a lower than number.

213
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:39,840
It's a survey of the number of these new outbreaks and the emergence of new pathogens in different decades.

214
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:46,080
So on the x axis, you have the different decades. And what you're seeing is the point is this is increasing trend.

215
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:49,469
Okay. So we're seeing more and more and more of these pathogens.

216
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:55,800
And some of it has to do with better recognition and better monitoring system that identifies these things as the pop up.

217
00:24:56,130 --> 00:25:01,170
But part of it is a genuine rise that reflects altered environmental conditions.

218
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:07,890
One of the classic figures we show is this one here.

219
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:14,460
And basically what you're seeing here is guys who remember Venn diagrams from math, right?

220
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,510
So what we're using here is the circles to describe a group of hosts.

221
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:25,330
So one of these is pathogens that infect wildlife species.

222
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:31,560
They're the greenish yellow cycle are the ones that infect domesticated animals.

223
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,000
And then the blue cycle is those pathogens that infect humans.

224
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:45,150
And these three circles overlap. And the reason is because some of these pathogens, some of these infect multiple groups of hosts.

225
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,760
So can you think of a pathogen, for example, that infects multiple species of hosts?

226
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:56,590
Be. Sorry.

227
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,249
Influenza. Influenza. Right. I mean, it's it's originally a bird disease, right?

228
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,500
And now it's spilling over into into mammals.

229
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:12,560
Absolutely. Can you think one that infects that's all three categories.

230
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:16,290
Although I would say influenza is up there. It's pretty close to the center.

231
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,840
Any other ones you can think of? Yeah.

232
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:27,750
That African trypanosoma. Yeah. So. So I'm gonna like.

233
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:32,040
Let me think about this. Yes, absolutely. That's a good example.

234
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,230
Yeah, because it infects livestock. Right. Infects humans and infects wildlife as well.

235
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:41,309
Absolutely. Okay. So African trypanosomiasis, another one, right?

236
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:46,080
Sleeping sickness, as it's colloquially known. Right. Rabies, for example, is another one.

237
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:53,400
Right. That's really that's a bad one. And I don't want to get rabies so, you know, smack in the center.

238
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:58,829
So the reason why I'm putting this graph here and I think this is I love this graph because it's so, so,

239
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:05,970
so seminal, so important is because what what the authors have done here is they have this this arrows,

240
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:17,610
this arrows that basically show how the contained factors that amplify transmission within this, either within a group of hosts.

241
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:29,730
So it intensify the trend. So that transmission, let's say within human population, so within wildlife populations or between two groups of hosts.

242
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:33,390
So for example, in habitat encroachment,

243
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:42,210
introduction of exotic species and essentially spillover and spill back facilitates the spread of pathogens between wildlife and domesticated animals.

244
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:51,780
All right. Alternatively, you can have global travel, urbanization, environmental manipulation, that enhanced transmission within human populations.

245
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:55,590
All right. So it just summarizes a lot of information here.

246
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,280
So so just to make sure that I'm not the one who does all the speaking, let's do a little exercise.

247
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:07,550
Okay. So let's look at this graph here. Same graph.

248
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:10,920
Okay. And I've put here some of these emerging pathogens.

249
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:15,410
And what I'd like you to do is split. How many do we have here?

250
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:19,630
We have about 40 people. So we already have seven groups already.

251
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:27,930
Okay. All right. So. Okay.

252
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:36,300
So let's have each group of the seven groups take two pathogens.

253
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:40,530
Okay, so group one, there's these two HIV Ebola.

254
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:45,840
Group two does Marburg and Mertz. Group three, the SARS and Avian Flu.

255
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:50,850
Group four does Nipah and Hendra. Group five COVID and Zika.

256
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:58,740
Group six West Nile and Sin Nombre. Group seven Lassa and H1N1 Flu.

257
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:08,910
Okay, so got it. So each group I want you to your freedom get on the internet.

258
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:18,450
You guys are all hooked up and see which of these factors here promote the emergence and the spread of your two pathogens.

259
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:23,430
Okay. Does this make sense when you take 5 minutes to do that?

260
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:36,160
Any questions or you think you just had to Google three statements?

261
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:43,150
Yeah, that's what I just said.

262
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:52,860
So your passenger. Yes. So you're 762,005.

263
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:02,350
I mean, it's not like you could actually go. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

264
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:31,020
I. I thought it was. I think I can see him happy to hear that his eyes just look like anything else.

265
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:40,550
It looks like what? Thinks it's an endurance lab because it's so nice.

266
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:47,130
If you get so excited.

267
00:30:47,550 --> 00:31:02,090
Oh, wow. I because, like, it's a continuum where it gets to the point that they're coming in 2 hours or so and wearing a headdress.

268
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:09,380
Hers is different now. Not at all. No, I don't know what's going on.

269
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:21,420
Obviously, the phone calls that you should be telling me, by way, if you look at that.

270
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:28,110
How much did you say?

271
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:37,080
It seems like it's getting worse than we already saw it.

272
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:48,870
I mean, it's always less scary because this is Mexico during what you talk about, everything in the streets.

273
00:31:51,780 --> 00:32:00,540
So sorry. I mean, some of the details are so important.

274
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:13,100
You have to find something and you look at that and say there are ways that you live with your mouth that look like,

275
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:21,780
you know, people actually do crazy things like that.

276
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:35,500
I was traveling around the city totally a week ago, probably through the Internet.

277
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:41,459
What is it? It's really okay.

278
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:50,180
I get my location and everyone's best travel so much that I don't like that that's.

279
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,590
That was carried out.

280
00:32:56,370 --> 00:33:00,120
It's just like everything that has happened.

281
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,600
I mean, a lot of the bad can affect on the world.

282
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:18,950
But think what I really love. Actually, I think that's what I'm looking at.

283
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:26,400
Something I have loads of dance shoes, blankets.

284
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:37,550
So I was like, Oh, okay.

285
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,960
But also I have a lot of people.

286
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:49,330
So I just think I feel like I'm always on ice.

287
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:56,450
And I was like, you know, there's not a of heavy weight.

288
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:04,350
Me So, you know, it's just like MSL looks like a city mouse.

289
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:41,240
I heard it was you just don't even like, I guess, you know, know I was like, no, no.

290
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,470
Don't you like it?

291
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:52,950
Yeah, I just I was surprised how like I subway's.

292
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:57,450
I think I'll take the subway.

293
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,160
The old York City subway.

294
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:14,870
I didn't realize it. And so it was a really nice balance. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

295
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:31,530
You know, it's not yeah, it's crazy. But some of those passengers have they all and I was just trying to figure it out, like, you know what I mean?

296
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:36,000
Yeah. Right. That's the thing.

297
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:42,030
Yeah. So they have to while I'm just trying to be honest with you,

298
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:54,839
I think when I don't think I integrate, I don't really know what it's like to be affected by it.

299
00:35:54,840 --> 00:36:01,980
All this kind of spills over into Should I be doing so?

300
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:09,059
And so the way he's scared of things now,

301
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:21,780
I guess now I guess that they're pretty purposefully established that it was first person to actually start doing the things.

302
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:36,620
And I was like, Oh, I don't know if you'll excuse me, Mr. Brooks, what do you think is like it's.

303
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:43,550
I thought this was my two year old,

304
00:36:44,140 --> 00:37:03,790
which is why I was told that in just three years of my life and I called my son up right in the morning, is transmitted to the domestic.

305
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:23,940
Right. Okay. So it was like I was, you know, I guess we were excited about that, you know, because starting right, it changes everything.

306
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:31,450
And I think that I think some people are thinking.

307
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:46,910
So that's why I was trying to make an impression, like something that used to be like.

308
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:52,350
That's like something. Okay.

309
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:58,920
But it's like. But the real question is, how do you help them seem to have.

310
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:12,100
All right. So I'd like to share those conversations because that's what I've been saying all over school fashion, I think.

311
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:17,140
All right, you guys need more time. How are you doing?

312
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,960
A few more minutes. Okay, let's take a few more minutes before we go.

313
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:32,410
Yeah. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. But you know what?

314
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:40,389
I just want to see the exit of means outside the natural environment.

315
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:43,660
It's Latin means outside the site. Okay.

316
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:48,900
And it means the natural environment. So typically in some sort of, like, artificial setting, like a market.

317
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,310
Yeah, that's acceptable. So that's what we thought. Okay, good.

318
00:38:53,560 --> 00:39:00,580
Any more questions? Okay, let's take three more minutes and then we'll get together.

319
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:08,260
So this is okay.

320
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:13,540
Okay. I'm sorry.

321
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:27,000
We're going home to your home or any other kind of the same place.

322
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:40,740
I do feel like I don't think I'm young, so I can't imagine what I think.

323
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:48,839
I feel like, you know, it's like, what would you want it to be?

324
00:39:48,840 --> 00:40:02,150
Something that would be that kind of freedom, which will be great.

325
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,700
But there's also it's like, you know,

326
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:19,150
you're not just messing with a horse that you're traveling somewhere else of that to travel outside your natural environmental side, too.

327
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:38,430
And then you're just kind of thinking like, I know for me, I know what that be something I a really I don't know about everything and it seems like,

328
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:47,940
you know, okay, so, so we get together and see what different groups found once you start.

329
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:56,760
One, maybe. I have no clue what group one is.

330
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:03,780
So which are your pathogens? We had HIV and Ebola.

331
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:12,330
Okay. So did you fight for HIV? We said the hosts were humans and like maybe primates a long time ago.

332
00:41:12,330 --> 00:41:21,569
And that's kind of unclear. And we said that the drivers were predominantly like today or predominantly global travel organization.

333
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:25,410
And then we included also like social factors, like sexual practices.

334
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:29,510
The handling of blood products, which we thought would maybe fall into.

335
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,730
Biomedical manipulation. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah.

336
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,150
I mean, these these mechanisms here are not exhaustive.

337
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:46,180
It's not just these. There are other ones as well. So maybe you'll find that there's another mechanism that was responsible for the amplification.

338
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:54,590
Right? So, yeah. So. Okay. So global travel, sexual practices were really important for the spread of HIV.

339
00:41:54,770 --> 00:42:02,020
What is the thing? This is really important that facilitated the spread of HIV from primates where it normally circulates.

340
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:11,510
That's where the normal hosts are into humans. Probably human encroachment and ecological manipulation.

341
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:19,040
And we didn't we didn't talk about that because we weren't sure if we kind of focused on like HIV in more recent, like.

342
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:27,110
But yeah, so I mean, you can try to control the factors that limit the spread of HIV in human populations.

343
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:36,200
But to some extent, the genie is at that point out of the bottle. What you want is to prevent the spillover event from primates into humans.

344
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:40,220
So how did HIV get from chimps into humans?

345
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:47,690
Which markets like the market? Like markets where they're selling needs like primate needs.

346
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:54,980
Yeah. So basically it's poaching. It's I call it HIV, the revenge of the vanquished.

347
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,370
So chimps, it's normally a chimp disease.

348
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,270
Our closest relatives. And right now, they're going extinct.

349
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:07,250
There are only a few thousand chimps left because they're being eaten to death.

350
00:43:08,270 --> 00:43:14,719
They're being hunted, killed, butchered and eaten. Okay, so this says a lot about us as a species,

351
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:20,000
the fact that we are killing and eating our closest relatives to the point where we're pushing them to extinction.

352
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:27,530
Okay. This is what's happening right now. And in the process of eating them to death, we picked up the pathogens.

353
00:43:27,770 --> 00:43:38,629
Okay. That's what HIV is. Right. So bushmeat is a huge driver of emerging pathogens, not just in Africa, but also in Southeast Asia.

354
00:43:38,630 --> 00:43:42,590
So I'll talk more about this later on. Okay. Let's let's take some.

355
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:49,610
I don't want to be exhaustive about this. Let's kind of like just see some examples from other groups and see where what you found.

356
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:55,640
So which group wants to go? Yeah, one of ours was Cyrus.

357
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,399
Cyrus? Yes. What's their spread through?

358
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,840
Like, respiratory droplets.

359
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:11,800
So we said that global travel can cause spread and that urbanization would increase population density, and that also can cause spread among stars.

360
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:18,350
And then as for where it came from, they're thinking it came from like an animal market, like a wild animal market.

361
00:44:18,350 --> 00:44:23,990
So that would be accident contact where they were poached and held outside of their natural environment.

362
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:28,860
Absolutely. Okay. So Cyrus is another coronavirus.

363
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:35,400
Okay. And. It's kind of it was the the arc the archetypical.

364
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:42,240
The first major coronavirus to emerge and it's kind of fascinating to which extent.

365
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:49,319
Following corona viruses like nurse Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome and COVID,

366
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,920
which is another Corona virus, followed the same playbook of emergence.

367
00:44:53,220 --> 00:45:01,080
We see again and again the same pattern. In any case, wet markets, wildlife trafficking,

368
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:08,190
butchering have been really and wildlife farming have been really important components of the emergence of of coronaviruses.

369
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:13,320
And I'll talk more about this. Let's take one more pathogen which group wants to talk about their pathogen.

370
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:19,700
Yeah. So we had Hendra, which many of us were unfamiliar with.

371
00:45:19,700 --> 00:45:24,680
So it was basically transmission from bats to other animals and eventually gets back to us.

372
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:31,099
So we were saying that these really for both of them, they have very similar ways of transmission.

373
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:39,950
But we said translocation was a big one because bats can travel just a really huge radius and infect the domestic animals.

374
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:44,660
Like, for example, there is a pig population like a pig farm. So they were like infecting the pigs.

375
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:51,080
You know, we eat the pigs, we get the infection. So there's a little bit of that spillover spill back population.

376
00:45:52,430 --> 00:45:58,969
And then we also were saying that maybe also with the horse transmission with Hendra like horse bat transmission,

377
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:06,799
that that could also be a little bit of that extra effect where it's just sort of they're both outside of their natural ranges.

378
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,570
And so they kind of end up in a perfect storm of being able to transmit to each other.

379
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,979
Mm hmm. Right. So Nipah Hendra virus is.

380
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:19,610
Are these viruses you really don't want to get, like, hendra?

381
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,660
Like, I don't think anyone has survived the disease and with an intact brain.

382
00:46:23,750 --> 00:46:28,280
Like, if you're lucky enough to survive or unlucky, you know, your brain isn't functioning properly.

383
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:32,090
So these are really scary diseases. This are kind of like the stuff goes.

384
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:40,580
I've seen the film Contagion. It's like a hybrid virus that has elements of silo virus, Ebola and those.

385
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,569
What was that fear was modeled after? It's a really scary disease.

386
00:46:44,570 --> 00:46:56,210
It's pretty, pretty lethal. In any case, these are nice examples of how environmental destruction leads to the emergence of a form of a virus.

387
00:46:56,870 --> 00:47:03,170
So, for example, with Nipah, it's global climate change facilitated a drying of the Indonesian archipelago.

388
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:10,190
Local farmers took advantage of that to torch the rainforests, the burned vast areas of rainforest in Sumatra.

389
00:47:10,490 --> 00:47:15,980
What that then caused is the animals that live in the rainforest, which are these mega bats,

390
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:24,859
this flying foxes to actually they fled the burning rainforest and they ended up in areas where there are humans in peninsular Malaysia.

391
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:27,200
And what happened there is they're fruit eaters.

392
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:37,220
So they hung out in mango trees, they eat mangoes above pig farms, and so they would feed in the mango trees.

393
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:47,810
They would poop mango pulp laced with with Nipah virus down during the day, the pigs from the pig farm would go there and feed on the.

394
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:53,860
Fallen mangoes and the bad [INAUDIBLE] and the virus. And they got infected.

395
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:57,400
And then guess who? They gave the infection to the humans.

396
00:47:57,410 --> 00:48:03,350
Right. And offered wind then. So. So you see this really complex chain of transmission.

397
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:08,150
But at the end of the day, if you look at the causality, at its root, it's environmental destruction.

398
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:17,990
So the next thing. So this gives you just an example of how these things hang together in our complex world.

399
00:48:18,410 --> 00:48:24,380
And the other the one last point I want to make is some of these most of these diseases you guys have never heard of.

400
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:31,220
Right. There are, you know, obscure parts in other kind of obscure parts of the world in a remote place of other continents.

401
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:35,989
But we live in an interconnected world and a pathogen emerging.

402
00:48:35,990 --> 00:48:43,520
And the rainforests of the Congo can be in our doorstep within a few days with air travel.

403
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,780
So we can't ignore these things anymore. Right.

404
00:48:48,170 --> 00:48:58,810
I mean, HIV, which was a global pandemic, was an obscure disease of chimps in Gabon and it killed millions of Americans.

405
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:05,540
Right. We can't ignore these things anymore. So the next thing I want to do is I alluded to these different groups of hosts.

406
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:09,710
One of the big patterns that's emerging from these are noses.

407
00:49:09,950 --> 00:49:18,680
These are not pathogens. Is that typically they have a wildlife host, often bats, but not exclusively.

408
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:24,490
Okay. And then they don't necessarily infect humans directly.

409
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:31,130
And the reason is because even with these mega bats, a flying fox, for example, and they have pretty small lungs.

410
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:37,430
And humans don't really hang out a lot of bats. So sometimes you have direct transmission, but more likely than not,

411
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:45,260
you have an intermediate host that gets infected by these viruses and then they jump over to humans.

412
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:49,310
So people, there's the concept of the bridge host.

413
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:53,960
So these are three, three important concepts that I want you to be aware of.

414
00:49:54,410 --> 00:50:01,130
They are not mutually exclusive, but they are kind of like they they talk about this,

415
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,570
discuss the, the concept of how you can have a host that maintains a virus or a pathogen.

416
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:15,260
That's what we call a reservoir host. This is a population in which the virus circulates and is being maintained.

417
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:23,240
A bridge host is this host that facilitates the spread from one wildlife species into humans typically.

418
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:27,530
All right. And then amplification. Host You can be a bridge.

419
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:34,820
Host So for example, a typical example of an amplification host is is pigs souse and Nipah.

420
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:45,320
Okay. So if a flying fox gives a virus to a it's there's very little the probability of us picking it up directly from bad is pretty small.

421
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:53,120
But if the bat infects a pig and a pig, you have a £600 cell was like massive lungs that's infected.

422
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:59,060
And it's coughing. It's producing huge amounts of virus in the proximity of humans.

423
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:04,489
And as a result, the chances you really forcing a lot of virus into the human population.

424
00:51:04,490 --> 00:51:10,250
So the chances of actually having successful cross-species transmission is much larger.

425
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:17,840
Right. So that's an example of an amplification hoax. Are there any any questions on these concepts, these ideas?

426
00:51:22,630 --> 00:51:24,870
Yeah. Just on that amplification hose.

427
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:34,960
Can that I mean, are all of these application hosts or are they specific species that can only serve as an amplification?

428
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:40,200
So, so here basically. Yeah, you're making a really good point.

429
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:40,750
So here,

430
00:51:40,810 --> 00:51:51,730
this is just an example of how you can have this bridge hosts or amplification hosts that then allow the spread the spillover into human populations.

431
00:51:51,730 --> 00:51:57,250
So for me, I ended up being pigs. For Hendra, it's typically horses.

432
00:51:57,340 --> 00:52:04,300
It's not an Australian setting nurse. It turns out humans picked it up from camels that got infected from bats.

433
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:14,730
Ebola Filovirus Typically people pick it up from finding a dead chimp in the rainforest and say like,

434
00:52:14,770 --> 00:52:18,309
Oh, you know, food, let's take it into the village.

435
00:52:18,310 --> 00:52:25,660
You know, it's not a good thing to find when you find a dead chimp in the rainforest, take it home and cook it up.

436
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:29,680
Okay. Because you may pick up what killed the chimp. Right.

437
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:40,150
And then for rabies, well, typically we get it from some sort of cat or dog and then sorry, it was civet.

438
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:47,530
That was the rich host. So this list, this these were the specific bridge hosts.

439
00:52:47,530 --> 00:52:51,140
But it's not that only those species can act as bridge hosts.

440
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:56,440
There are a million other taxa. Okay, good question.

441
00:52:56,950 --> 00:53:01,140
And any other questions? Okay.

442
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:10,950
So when you look so, by the way, when we're talking about the emergence of pathogens, you guys are mostly interested in human populations.

443
00:53:10,950 --> 00:53:15,120
But exactly what's happening in humans happens in wildlife.

444
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:22,620
So pathogens that the processes that often lead to the emergence of pathogens in human populations

445
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:29,580
are similar to the processes that lead to the emergence of pathogens in wildlife populations.

446
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:43,770
Right. So for example, you can have deforestation that allows wildlife pathogens to spill into human populations.

447
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:50,040
And I'll give you a couple of examples of that. You know, HIV, for example, or Ebola.

448
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:56,740
But the same deforestation actually pushes human pathogens into wildlife populations.

449
00:53:56,940 --> 00:54:02,280
So maybe you have human TB that gets into the great ape populations and wipes them out.

450
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:09,840
Right. So this is a two way process. So I want you to think about I know you're kind of like focused on human health,

451
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:16,440
but as scientists who need to look at the world in a holistic way and the same

452
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,219
processes that affect human health are really wiping out species right now,

453
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,780
they're literally like species going extinct because of human pathogens.

454
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:39,250
Right. So you need to be aware of this. So some of the processes that lead to the emergence of wildlife pathogens.

455
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:43,690
First of all, typically we're talking about viruses and bacteria.

456
00:54:43,930 --> 00:54:51,070
So this is an important distinction. It's the way these species of the parasite world that emerge.

457
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:59,800
You don't hear stories about an emerging macro parasite world as this new species of tapeworm that's taking over the world.

458
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:03,430
Okay, you don't hear that. It's always a virus or a bacteria.

459
00:55:03,940 --> 00:55:08,760
Why do you think that is? Why aren't we?

460
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:14,660
Why isn't the CDC like, wringing its hands over the latest outbreak of of a tapeworm, for example?

461
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,840
What do you know about the life cycle of a macro parasite?

462
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:28,300
Comorbidity is not typically high, so morbidity isn't high and mortality.

463
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:32,940
What about generation time? It's pretty long.

464
00:55:33,090 --> 00:55:36,270
It's pretty long, right. These things are produced really slowly.

465
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:43,110
And if you look at the life of sort of a tapeworm, it has like three or four or five different hosts and it has to infect each host.

466
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:47,040
Each stage has to migrate to the next host to be successful.

467
00:55:47,370 --> 00:55:54,089
So it's this. I often joke about tapeworms being these organisms that shouldn't exist because all

468
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:59,040
these stars have to align for it to get into its final host where it can reproduce.

469
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:04,920
Okay. And I don't want to go into the details of the transmission, but it's a pretty complex process.

470
00:56:04,950 --> 00:56:07,950
It's not like a virus where someone sneezes and off.

471
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:11,250
It is. You're off to the races and then you host species.

472
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:14,970
Okay. It's a pretty involved process. Okay.

473
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:23,610
So we tend to have most of these emerging pathogens, viruses and bacteria that tend to be exotic in origin.

474
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:28,110
All right. And typically, humans are involved in that transmission.

475
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:34,080
So directly or indirectly, it's humans that are actually leading to the emergence of these parasites, pathogens.

476
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:39,810
Okay. So we can lay the responsibility directly at the feet of the human species.

477
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:50,450
Okay. So I promised you that I was going to give you a few case studies so you understand some of these processes in a little bit more detail.

478
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:56,990
So I want to start by talking about the factors that led to the emergence of corona viruses and COVID.

479
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:02,090
These are pretty important pathogens. So I hope you all realize at this point.

480
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:13,309
So so start with that. Then we'll talk about habitat destruction, environmental degradation and pollution, climate change and so on.

481
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:16,400
And I tried to use just like third world pathogens,

482
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:25,280
both because I feel that you may not have heard about those and because in recognition of the fact that these things are potentially really important,

483
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,540
as I mentioned, they can be appear overnight here in the US.

484
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:37,190
So so when we look at the origins of SA's, where did SA's come from?

485
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:46,620
So sort of comment. Let's start with that. Don't tell me China.

486
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:50,640
Okay. Where did the virus evolve?

487
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:56,480
Presumably it came from a bat. Came from a bat.

488
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:01,480
Okay. So it's a corona virus and coronaviruses, for the most part, evolved in bats.

489
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:12,160
So. It's a it has spread spread very quickly because of urbanization and imposed because of international travel.

490
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:17,650
Right. There's a network here of the evolution of.

491
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,770
Of the different strains over the first few months of COVID.

492
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:28,580
And then here, this is how it spread, evolved and spread across the planet.

493
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,760
But if you look at the origins, it's kind of it's it's pretty interesting.

494
00:58:34,850 --> 00:58:41,270
People are not 100% sure yet. But what we know, what we seem to know is that it's this weird hybrid virus.

495
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,440
That part of its genome is a typical run of the mill coronavirus.

496
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:51,710
But then it has these elements in its genome that are related to pangolin viruses.

497
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:56,270
Now, pangolins and bats are very different organisms and they live in different places.

498
00:58:56,690 --> 00:59:05,090
And we it's I'm sure a more clear picture will emerge on this, but it seems that this could have been a virus that evolved in bats,

499
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:12,560
got infected in infected pangolins, evolved into something different and eventually ended up in humans.

500
00:59:13,130 --> 00:59:21,460
So. And here are some of the some of the alternative hypotheses how this thing evolves.

501
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:26,060
One of the big question is what do pangolins have to do with bats?

502
00:59:26,070 --> 00:59:29,130
Different habitats. One is nocturnal. One is diurnal.

503
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:38,760
Different microsites. The one thing they have in common is both of them actually of great importance to traditional East Asian medicine.

504
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:42,390
And people actually farm them and keep them together.

505
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:47,820
So the thinking right now is that these animals were held together,

506
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:55,080
got in contact with each other in the very lucrative wildlife trade, illegal wildlife trade that's happening in East Asia.

507
00:59:55,350 --> 01:00:00,780
And that led first to the emergence of this hybrid virus and then the dissemination.

508
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:09,140
So some of the. I think I have the slight.

509
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:16,770
Later on. Let me see here. Yeah.

510
01:00:17,130 --> 01:00:25,590
So. So it turns out that probably deforestation was part of the problem that pushes human.

511
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:30,659
It's a huge problem in East Asia and Southeast Asia to the point where wildlife

512
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,920
populations are so depleted that it's almost not worth hunting them anymore.

513
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:42,330
They're functionally extinct. So what people are doing now in order to satisfy the market is to breed these animals.

514
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:47,290
So you have these huge wildlife farms where people breed these animals.

515
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:52,390
Sometimes you can. This is a picture I have from south from Laos.

516
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:56,010
You go to the farmers market and people sell bats where they eat them.

517
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:04,050
Okay. And or you have these wet markets that sell either the live animals or the dried products.

518
01:01:05,010 --> 01:01:09,660
And in any case, you have this perfect environment for cross-species transmission can occur.

519
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:20,090
Okay. So and by the way, the wet markets, which you can visit, for example, are just the tip of the iceberg.

520
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:29,310
The real place where a lot of action happens is in these wildlife farms where you have thousands of animals packed together under horrible conditions.

521
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:36,270
And they actually infect each other. Right. And that's something that is it's it's kind of hidden from view.

522
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:47,990
And by the way, just just to drive the point home that these things are not just human problems I have here.

523
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:53,390
So Corvette human disease. It's actually causing conservation problems.

524
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:59,390
There are some animals that can pick up a Corvette, especially mouse pellets, like things like mink, for example.

525
01:01:59,390 --> 01:02:06,020
There have been Corvette outbreaks in mink farms. And when the mink escaped, they've given the infection to wild species.

526
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:10,100
So the genie is out of the bottle and can control it once it's in wildlife.

527
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:16,400
And it actually people are afraid that Wildcats will pick up the Corvette.

528
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:23,660
So there's a concern in India that tigers are just three or 4000 tigers in India, something like that.

529
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:27,980
They'll pick up COVID and they'll die out because of COVID. All right.

530
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:34,400
So there's very much the wildlife conservation aspect to this as well.

531
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:46,280
Right. It's not just about humans. Any questions on this, on Calvert before I move on?

532
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:59,010
Yeah. Question. There's some thought that for like for HIV, they think that HIV made the leap, you know, a century ago or more.

533
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:05,280
And it just sort of smoldered for a while. Do they think that about coronaviruses as well, or do they think that emergence is more recent?

534
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:13,360
So with coronaviruses, they're constantly causing cross infections.

535
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,689
So there was a paper that was suggesting that thousands of these,

536
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:23,240
like micro spillovers reduce stuttering transmission where it just gets across, but then it dies out.

537
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:33,580
So it seems like it's pretty common. It's just like, again, you know, the COVID pandemic was the tip of the iceberg.

538
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:43,100
There's so much more going on. Right. And just because the conditions became right and multiple stars aligned and the virus evolved,

539
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:47,380
the ability to transmit sustainably in the human population.

540
01:03:47,650 --> 01:03:53,080
Right. And typically, it doesn't achieve that, but it's pretty common.

541
01:03:55,810 --> 01:04:05,990
Okay. Great question. And the other. So obviously the reason my mentioning these things is because.

542
01:04:08,050 --> 01:04:13,900
COVID very much followed the playbook of SA's SA as we had a different amplification horse.

543
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:19,810
We had civet cats. But the point is, these stories repeat each other again and again.

544
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:25,390
And unless we change our ways, we'll just get hammered with diseases, right?

545
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:32,230
The COVID pandemic was neither the first nor the last of these things to come our way.

546
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:37,810
And the question is, will people overcome narrow financial and financial interests?

547
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:45,399
Like 15 years ago after SA emerged, public health experts were like talking to the Chinese government to stop the wet markets.

548
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:49,030
This is terrible, this terrible idea of stopping Vietnam with the same story.

549
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:57,430
What did the government do that continued business as normal because people were making money and the result is COVID, right?

550
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:01,510
So unless these things thought, things are just going to continue.

551
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:07,299
Okay. So a couple of other examples of emerging pathogens.

552
01:05:07,300 --> 01:05:10,990
So something called sun or forest fever.

553
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:15,430
I suspect none of you have heard that. That's a South Indian disease.

554
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:25,150
This is a disease that normally is transmitted, it normally circulates and shrew populations, tiny little common mammals.

555
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:31,689
And because of encroachment and environmental degradation, like people cutting down the forest,

556
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:38,950
you get this like grassy weedy vegetation that both the shrews and the ticks really love.

557
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:49,540
So because of environmental degradation, you see this explosion off of infected ticks that then infect primates,

558
01:05:49,540 --> 01:05:56,110
presumably causing conservation problems. Okay. Because they get sick and then also humans who get into the area.

559
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:02,770
Right. So this is an example where you can have environmental degradation causing a disease outbreak.

560
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:11,670
By the way, do you know a similar example here in the U.S. where environmental degradation is leading to a spread of pathogen?

561
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:18,770
Lyme disease. Lyme disease. Exactly. Another tick borne virus.

562
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:25,620
Right. That gets amplified and really takes over integrated, fragmented environment.

563
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:29,250
So talk a little bit more about this in a few minutes. Okay.

564
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:35,030
Let's see what other fun any questions on this? No.

565
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:41,870
Okay. Let's see. What other fun diseases do we have? Filoviruses, Ebola and friends.

566
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:49,190
Okay, that's another. These are the ones that can really turn humans into a pool of virus in 48 hours.

567
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:58,069
Okay. I mean, it's pretty amazing. Pathogens. Natural hosts are things like the Hammerhead and Bat, which is a pretty amazing creature.

568
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:01,160
It's what make up that one of these flying foxes.

569
01:07:02,150 --> 01:07:06,020
Here's what these flu viruses look like. The ecological niche.

570
01:07:06,020 --> 01:07:12,030
This is a tropical African disease for the most part, not exclusively.

571
01:07:12,050 --> 01:07:16,580
This is mapping of the ecological niche of of Ebola.

572
01:07:20,210 --> 01:07:26,480
And if you look at the transmission cycle, normally it just circulates in bat populations.

573
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:35,180
Okay. And when you have some sort of factor that throws the system out of whack and elaborate on that in that in a minute,

574
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:38,660
it spills over into other management mammalian hosts,

575
01:07:38,660 --> 01:07:49,610
whether these are tigers or chimps from great apes and eventually from there into humans, when people go and pick up a dead chimp to put it up for.

576
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:52,970
Sometimes people go and catch bats that are infected and cook them up.

577
01:07:53,270 --> 01:08:01,220
Right. And then you're off to the races again when the pandemic when the epidemic goes off in the human population.

578
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:06,920
But this is kind of like the basic transmission of this pathogen.

579
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:17,960
Now, what's really interesting is I've worked on that a little bit in Gabon work, visited some of these caves where we looked at these bats.

580
01:08:18,170 --> 01:08:21,410
It's like you go into this caves and it's like raining batshit.

581
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:27,830
Right. It's pretty. You're, like plowing through a layer of six feet of bat [INAUDIBLE] on the ground.

582
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:33,130
It's a pretty scary place, actually. It's fun.

583
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:38,480
So what you get there is so first of all, it's also a conservation problem.

584
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:43,910
Okay. So great apes are dying out. Gorillas are going extinct because of Ebola.

585
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:55,880
Okay. So the same processes that push Ebola into human populations seem to be also responsible for wildlife populations.

586
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:03,110
What's going on there? What we think is happening is, first of all, this an association of Ebola outbreaks with deforestation.

587
01:09:03,530 --> 01:09:09,380
So you see you're more likely to see Ebola in places where people had to have cut down the rainforest.

588
01:09:09,830 --> 01:09:14,030
And that leads to disruption in what people think is happening.

589
01:09:14,030 --> 01:09:20,480
And the data are great on that is that the bat populations get disrupted and they

590
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:25,940
get everyone concentrates in the African rainforest on these fruiting trees,

591
01:09:25,940 --> 01:09:29,480
these giant trees that produce a mass of fruit.

592
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:37,400
And everyone goes there for the feast. So that's where the gorilla, for example, may run into a hammerhead at bat and get infected.

593
01:09:37,610 --> 01:09:46,280
Right. So what's happening is when you have environmental degradation, the animals don't have the choice to avoid each other anymore.

594
01:09:46,520 --> 01:09:49,820
They are cramped into the same trees for transmission happens.

595
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:56,150
And some of it comes from habitat fragmentation. The other one comes from global climate change.

596
01:09:56,270 --> 01:10:02,650
So the environment is becoming much more variable, not so much with temperature, but more with precipitation.

597
01:10:02,660 --> 01:10:09,650
So you have these periods of drought. That's how global climate change often expresses itself in the Congo basin.

598
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:16,939
And as a result, you end up getting these animals that normally get separated, competing for the same resources,

599
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:20,690
getting in contact with each other, and then giving the disease to each other.

600
01:10:21,410 --> 01:10:24,110
Does this sort of, like make sense as a concept? Yeah.

601
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:31,520
So what I want you to understand is there are these look beyond like, oh, my God, we have people dying of Ebola.

602
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:35,660
Let's treat the the that the infected patients.

603
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:41,270
Think about where did this came from and what did we do to cause this this epidemic.

604
01:10:41,330 --> 01:10:45,740
Right. And it's our responsibility. We're doing that to ourselves.

605
01:10:46,070 --> 01:10:49,549
And in the process, we're wiping out our closest relatives.

606
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:54,530
We're wiping out chimps. We're wiping out Ebola, the gorillas that are dying of Ebola.

607
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:59,060
Okay. Any questions on this?

608
01:11:03,610 --> 01:11:06,670
Okay. So you think Ebola is pretty gross?

609
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:10,660
Let's look at another gross one. Buruli ulcer.

610
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:14,200
Okay. So that's just a relative of microbes like Mycobacterium.

611
01:11:14,920 --> 01:11:19,840
So this is actually a disease that will actually it's a pretty horrible disease.

612
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:28,959
I have heard about it the first time when I was at a conference and there was this case study of this person who got infected with it.

613
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:32,230
And no one forms this ulcer. Right. That just keeps growing.

614
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:37,839
It's unless you know exactly how to treat it, it just this person lost their legs.

615
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:42,400
It was like really massive. Right. And essentially, this is a mycobacterium.

616
01:11:42,730 --> 01:11:46,980
So it's related to tuberculosis.

617
01:11:47,370 --> 01:11:52,899
It causes this painless ulcers that are very hard to treat.

618
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:56,170
You have to use like injections of antibiotics.

619
01:11:56,620 --> 01:12:02,200
And it turns out that it's another one of these tropical diseases, this neglected tropical diseases.

620
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:05,470
It's like, yeah, it doesn't affect us here in the first world.

621
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:09,940
Let them die of it, you know, benign ignorance, benign neglect.

622
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:14,049
So it's a it's a pretty serious problem in sub-Saharan Africa.

623
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:18,340
And it turns out that it's associated with waterways.

624
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:26,649
And essentially what happens is that you go there, you take a swim in those waterways, so you're associated with it,

625
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:32,530
and then it's wet soil and then it looks like there are some animal bites may be involved.

626
01:12:32,710 --> 01:12:40,390
It's a the transmission of the disease is still a mystery, but it seems like some water bugs are associated.

627
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:49,480
People have found the DNA of the virus on there on this insects and eventually and normally they spread and the circulate in wildlife populations,

628
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:52,930
but now they're spilling over into human populations.

629
01:12:53,650 --> 01:13:01,570
And the main drivers of that is, again, deforestation and again, eutrophication of waterways.

630
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:08,110
So when you get deforestation, the aquatic communities collapse, all the species go extinct,

631
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:14,970
the food webs get simplified, and the species that really harbor this pathogen become really common.

632
01:13:14,980 --> 01:13:20,740
So the chance of a human getting into that area and not getting infected becomes much larger.

633
01:13:21,310 --> 01:13:26,680
So again, association with environmental degradation leads to the emergence of these pathogens.

634
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:31,660
Okay, so I hope you're seeing this a theme here, right?

635
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:41,870
Um, not all diseases are are infectious.

636
01:13:42,490 --> 01:13:49,720
Some things come from nature. You have cross-species infection, but it's not something that really circulates in human populations.

637
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:55,450
How many of you are familiar with, ergo, autism? Oh, that's a great one.

638
01:13:57,940 --> 01:14:02,410
So ergot is a mistrust. It's a disease that comes from a trust.

639
01:14:02,770 --> 01:14:06,080
So this is like it's good party discussion, party fodder.

640
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:09,830
Like, you can. You can shine with, like, crazy stories.

641
01:14:09,850 --> 01:14:15,190
Okay. So this is actually this is a really serious disease in Europe and to some extent in North America.

642
01:14:15,460 --> 01:14:18,280
And it's public health experts who should know about this. Okay.

643
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:25,150
So it turns out that this is a rust type of fungus, if you want, that infects grasses.

644
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:32,200
And when you look at these and fluorescence is here basically of grasses, you see these big black things.

645
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:39,640
They look like black rice grains. All right. What these are is essentially the fruiting body of this fungus that infects the grass.

646
01:14:39,940 --> 01:14:45,970
It's a plant parasite which doesn't infect humans. Here are some drawings of it.

647
01:14:46,150 --> 01:14:49,360
Right. If you you may see that out in nature.

648
01:14:49,370 --> 01:14:55,030
So what you can do is you can grab it and it kind of like breaks apart into a black powder.

649
01:14:55,420 --> 01:15:01,570
Right. So in any case, it turns out that one of these species, Clovis, it's rare.

650
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:05,470
It's a whole group of fungi infects wheat. All right.

651
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:10,270
So if conditions are right, it can really affect a lot of wheat fields.

652
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:20,830
And what it does is you have a lot of grain of of wheat fruit that look like this, where you have this one giant and you're like, okay, who cares?

653
01:15:20,980 --> 01:15:26,020
I mean, fine. This stuff infects grasses.

654
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:29,950
I'm just taking the wheat. I don't care. You know, it doesn't affect me.

655
01:15:30,070 --> 01:15:38,020
Well, it turns out that actually there are it contains a whole bunch of toxins to defend itself against, let's say birds or something like that.

656
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:42,910
And one of these is called it's a diamond of lysergic acid.

657
01:15:43,420 --> 01:15:47,040
No one knows what that is. Medical research accounts said.

658
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:51,300
I'll give you the acronym. Molly.

659
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:57,930
Does that look familiar? Okay.

660
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:07,790
So the chemist, the German chemist who discovered this thing about 100 over 100 years ago were extracted from the fruiting body of this arm,

661
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:09,570
of this fungus.

662
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:18,270
So what do you think will happen to you if you take a whole bunch of wheat and you grind it up and has a couple of these things in there,

663
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:22,410
and then you make bread out of it and you eat the bread. What do you think will happen to you?

664
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:28,080
Have a good day. It's a good thing.

665
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:34,860
Salem Witch Trials. Yeah. So you start having visions.

666
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:40,380
You see saints dancing around, too, and or the devil is chasing you.

667
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:44,960
Okay. Unfortunately, it's worse than that. It's not just a transformation.

668
01:16:45,030 --> 01:16:52,490
It turns out that some of these agents actually end up like using the cause schema in your in your digits.

669
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:57,080
So blood supply goes down and your fingers and toes in the die off.

670
01:16:57,090 --> 01:17:01,500
So people during the so in this in the medieval ages,

671
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:09,000
there were these mysterious epidemics that would sweep through Europe in some summers and people would have these visions,

672
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,840
this horrible vision, and it would get sick and then lose their hands and toes.

673
01:17:13,380 --> 01:17:18,080
And this is by the way, this is the life cycle.

674
01:17:18,240 --> 01:17:26,280
It's in the slide. I don't really want to go over it in detail, but the end result is this was this was a really, really big problem.

675
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:29,430
So people called it St Anthony's fire.

676
01:17:29,610 --> 01:17:35,010
So there was this this feeling that your extremities were burning up.

677
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:41,219
Right. It was very, very painful before you'd lose your fingers. And Saint Anthony was supposed to protect you.

678
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:46,860
And here's an old engraving of Saint Anthony with people coming, they're all the sick.

679
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:53,100
And then here you see the votive offerings. These arms and hands are not real and hands and arms,

680
01:17:53,100 --> 01:18:01,860
but they're kind of like these gifts made out of silver or precious metals that people would give to the saint and said,

681
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:05,399
Please, I'm giving you as a gift, save me of this disease.

682
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:11,070
Basically, it's called a votive gift is a pretty standard thing that people used to do in Europe.

683
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:15,900
So this was a real big public, public problem.

684
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:25,440
Right. And people think that the Salem witches were actually that coincided with the wet summer when there was this.

685
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:32,159
People think that it was a case of ergot ism. All right. So how would they how do we deal with that?

686
01:18:32,160 --> 01:18:37,230
Nowadays, people use special kind of sieves.

687
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:44,250
When you when you harvest them, the grain, the wheat, you just it through.

688
01:18:44,250 --> 01:18:49,110
And because they're the ergo berries, the fruiting voids are a little bit bigger than wheat berries.

689
01:18:49,590 --> 01:18:55,740
You can filter them out. Right. And you can make sure that you just retain regular wheat berries.

690
01:18:56,190 --> 01:18:59,280
Okay. So does this make sense?

691
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:06,600
Yeah. So. So ergo, this is not an infectious disease, at least not to humans.

692
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:14,890
But nonetheless, it is a public health issue, and you should know about that just in terms of general knowledge.

693
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:25,550
Okay. So any questions up to now? Okay.

694
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:28,970
You got a couple minutes. Oh, so wait. That's right.

695
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:32,090
We don't finish that one. Right. Okay. All right.

696
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:37,820
Okay. So, um, let's review briefly what we did.

697
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:44,450
What did you learn today? What are the main things you learned today? Look at your notes.

698
01:19:45,080 --> 01:19:51,680
What do you think? The environment has a lot to do with how we get infected and how we infect other species.

699
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:58,337
And therefore it has a lot to do with how we can interact in our daily lives because there is a lot of things that we do wrong as.
