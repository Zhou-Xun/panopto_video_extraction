1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:03,900
You know, records everything.

2
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:14,730
One thing, too, that I want to start doing at the beginning of class is just checking in to see if anyone has any announcements.

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:23,640
So I know that probably a lot of you are in student groups or are aware of different activities that are coming out.

4
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:31,910
Really, a lot of students in this class are involved in like social arts and social justice activities, things like that.

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,960
So this is a place where you can share any of those.

6
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:44,710
Also, if you want them posted on campus, if you could send them to Akilah after class and then she'll post them on the campus too.

7
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:51,000
So let's say that you have an award that you're part of and they have an open meeting coming up.

8
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,640
Send that to us. We'll post that. So you all will have access to that information.

9
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:01,620
All right. So any announcements and it doesn't have to be, you know, you event related.

10
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,130
So you might be involved in the community in something or with some other, you know, organization.

11
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:15,060
Anyone have any announcements? After all that you just want.

12
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,520
It is the master plan. Everything. Just kidding.

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:30,070
I will do it every week. You know, also, I think that, you know, oftentimes classes are out of touch with reality.

14
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,120
So if there's something going on in the world, too,

15
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:41,950
that you think is relevant to this class and you want to make a comment about at the beginning, we can do that as well.

16
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:46,770
You know, we're definitely in a time right now where there continues to be, you know,

17
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:53,320
mass shootings all the time and extreme weather that's causing a lot of distress.

18
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:58,330
So, yeah, so if anyone has any reflections or anything like that, you can also bring that up.

19
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,940
All right, Akilah, anything from you before we get started? Yes.

20
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,450
I scheduled a room for my office hours for Thursday.

21
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:13,800
So it'll be in Aurora, right?

22
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,530
Right now. 630 and 11.

23
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:26,410
Um, so that is like on the third floor. I don't know what that area is called, like, up in that area.

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,950
So it's on the third floor and you'll go into the door like the big door with the cubicles, and it's on my right hand side.

25
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,730
So I'll post an announcement about that as well. Right. Yeah.

26
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,700
For my office hours, it's in the syllabus. But just to remind you, all my office hours, I can do virtual.

27
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:51,760
So there you can go on to my calendar and sign up for those and then I'll send you a link and then we'll do those three.

28
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:04,580
All right. So last time we ended talking a little bit about Kennedy's definition of anti-racism and what it means to be anti-racist.

29
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,210
Anyone can even remember one or two thoughts of what we talked about.

30
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,530
This is a lot of words up there. So, you know.

31
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:19,910
And I'm going to try with the names I actually wrote today to the office to see if I can get bigger name tags or nameplates.

32
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:26,120
They said that they're back ordered. So I think that's a big need just on my part.

33
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,390
But, you know, the world is not made for older people, so or something like that.

34
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,610
It's only me. That's another discussion. All right.

35
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:40,970
What did you learn or know or what do we think about and talk about about anti-racism and remember anything?

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,920
I know that Labor Day weekend sometimes is a race in your brain. Yes.

37
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:55,870
Really? Start with week, but it's like it's mentor race.

38
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:00,229
Good. So looking at systems that are built to be against certain groups,

39
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:06,200
mostly based on race in this case, and then see how we can kind of dismantle and reconstruct those.

40
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:13,990
What else? Because again, this is a term that gets thrown around the university quite a bit and a lot of times without any of,

41
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,410
you know, the people doing a workshop.

42
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:24,570
Anything else? Tuesday.

43
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,100
Not like Monday. Since you didn't have class yesterday. Like all part time you started.

44
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,110
All right, I won't drag it too much.

45
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:41,780
But, you know, I think one key thing that's really important when we talk about anti-racism is that to truly be racist,

46
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:47,310
I think our anti-racism is a disaster. Not doing anything is not anti-racism.

47
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,900
Not doing anything contributes to racism and allows it to be perpetuated.

48
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:56,159
So it's not like you can just kind of sit back and say, Oh, that doesn't impact me.

49
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,450
I don't have to think about it or talk about it. That's just another example of privilege.

50
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:10,210
And privilege perpetuates racism. So there is an individual component, but there's also, like Brianna said, there's a systems level component.

51
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:14,850
So we have to look at the systems and structures that perpetuate racism.

52
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:26,639
Who can think of a system are structured either at this university or in Michigan that may perpetuate racism and that could be up to the legal level,

53
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,700
or it could be the way that the university is constructed.

54
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:33,540
The way communities are constructed are English.

55
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,910
I'm sorry, I think Greek life perpetuates racism. Can you talk a little more, more about that?

56
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:50,580
I just think it's predominantly white, obviously. And like within each organization, I know that they try to do things to be anti-racist.

57
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:54,560
I don't think anyone in any of those organizations actually cares about anything.

58
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:58,079
They just, like, want to look like they're anti-racist,

59
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,980
but they're actually just like a bunch of white girls that think that they're being super progressive, but they're not okay.

60
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:16,860
And too, there are friends that are specifically for trans sororities, are specifically for black Americans, also black necks.

61
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,430
Are there any Asian specific sororities, fraternities here?

62
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,720
Okay. That's what I thought. Yeah. So yeah.

63
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:32,370
So I think, like, the more if you want to call mainstream, you know, organizations maybe are quite different, but else.

64
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,040
Yeah. Maybe Emmer got, like, leadership.

65
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,909
So I remember one of my jobs that I had, we had, like, someone from,

66
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:52,480
like the CIA office that might come in, and it was just like a white lady trying to educate me.

67
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:58,309
Right. Okay. Yeah. So the people on the leadership, it's really interesting, too.

68
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:01,660
And this is yeah, I'm scared I'm being recorded.

69
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:10,420
But you about like like that's how sometimes it's like, look how many black folks we have in leadership positions.

70
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,740
So like the College of Engineering has a black dean.

71
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:21,370
We had a black dean and became a black provost, but that person also was a predator.

72
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:31,060
So that's highly problematic. You know, and some have said that the reason why he got to advance at certain levels was they wanted to be able to say,

73
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:37,450
we have a black person in that position and just overlooked other signs that there may be challenges.

74
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,760
So yeah, I think when you look at like who's in the leadership positions that have the most power,

75
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:50,620
you know, I think we have our first Asian-American president.

76
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,889
Right, which is huge. And I would university admissions around a black president.

77
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:02,290
I don't know. I don't know the history of the University of Michigan.

78
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:09,970
But, you know, again, when you're looking and and so there's there's positions of power and then there's leadership positions.

79
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:13,209
And like you were talking about, Amber, there's certain things when, you know,

80
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:21,550
we're talking about someone who is supposed to be promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and that the white folks can't be part of that process.

81
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:27,870
But if you have someone who's actually running that process now, it's it does send a message, right,

82
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:37,180
to have someone who is maybe has a lot of privilege and a lot of access to to be writing notes.

83
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,579
Yeah, it's it's ever since I've been here.

84
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:49,540
It is very interesting when you look at the bigger leadership structure in the colleges and schools and also when you look at who gets tenured,

85
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,900
that's a big one, who's getting tenured and who who isn't.

86
00:08:53,500 --> 00:09:06,520
So I think in in the school of nursing, I just heard today, I think I don't think there are any black tenured faculty in the school of nursing.

87
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:13,750
It's like zero or one. Now, when my husband started teaching and civil and environmental,

88
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:19,930
there was only one black faculty member and that whole division, which is a pretty huge division.

89
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:30,219
So looking at who's and what teaching positions and to even when we think again about how hierarchies are set

90
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:36,760
up and I don't know how much you all know about the way we restructure and create hierarchies for our faculty,

91
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:43,870
but it's pretty ridiculous. But, you know, kind of at the top are tenured full professors.

92
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,450
And so when you're a tenured professor that basically can get rid of you unless you do something really egregious.

93
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,140
And then below that is an associate tenured professor.

94
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,690
So that means you've been here for six, seven years, you've done a good job.

95
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:07,000
We're giving you tenure, which means it's hard to get rid of you and we're promoting you then assistant professors who are on the tenure track.

96
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,060
So that means they're working toward associate full with tenure, but you're still in kind of a probationary period.

97
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,139
But then there's a whole slew of faculty that are research faculty.

98
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:21,700
So research faculty have to bring in all the money for their position.

99
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,880
And there's some what they call clinical faculty,

100
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:31,270
and those are faculty who are doing mostly teaching or administration, but they're all on three year contract.

101
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:40,870
So someone can have a lot of power over them because they can be like, Oh, well, you know, if you do that, I'm not sure you're going to do that.

102
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,990
I'm going to make it. So there's all these different positions.

103
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:49,980
And it's very interesting to look at within academic institutions who who are the tenured full

104
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:56,020
professors and then who are the clinical professors and who are the research professors?

105
00:10:56,710 --> 00:11:05,710
And you'll see that tenured full tend to be white, cis, straight men, especially in different fields like in Boston.

106
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:16,390
So the other I'm not sure if we gone through all this on the second slide we see and we did talk about Amazon.

107
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:25,300
But I do think that when we talk about anti-racism that we need to not just talk about it, we need to do it.

108
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:33,460
So if you're going to say that you're doing anti-racism, that's different than if you're doing diversity, equity and inclusion.

109
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,310
I mean, they can be connected, but not always. I mean, you.

110
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:45,530
Could be doing diversity work around people with different abilities and still do it in a racist way because of people's intersectional identities.

111
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:52,380
So I think sometimes we conflate those two, those two terms and we think that they're the same, but they aren't.

112
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:59,580
Anti-Racism is a very specific approach to combatting racism or both an individual and a collective level,

113
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:06,000
and really focuses on structural levels policies because really, you know,

114
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:14,880
let's say I do a lot of amazing things that are anti-racist when I'm here, but then I leave the institution once and,

115
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,160
you know, someone else could step in that is very racist and everything that I've done as a race.

116
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:27,840
But if we change policies and we create new programs and structures, then the focus isn't on me as the creator.

117
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,400
It's on the program. So those programs will continue and be prevented.

118
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,410
Any questions on anti-racism? Anyone want to challenge anything I said?

119
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:46,250
All right. So we're going to watch some videos.

120
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:56,260
Could you help me with watching these just to warn you ahead of time?

121
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:08,690
These videos can be a bit emotional that have to do with race and experiences of parents and children from different ethnic racial groups.

122
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:18,350
Dixon has been a strong advocate for me. I did not do that affirmative action for women.

123
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:22,980
And so I think you do a lot to get out of here, guys.

124
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:29,270
Every time I see the driver's license, they also ask us to visit him.

125
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:36,440
The more he was social, maybe grabbing a woman.

126
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:46,190
To child. Dear child. Your child.

127
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:51,050
I know you hearing a lot of things that are confusing and scary right now.

128
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,520
In the moment, at a time when hate, when you begin to feel the prejudice, it has been legitimized.

129
00:13:58,910 --> 00:14:03,770
So you are now going to be times when you are going to be called a terrorist.

130
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:12,080
They want to get rid of the Muslims in this country or we would be better off without them, or that our religion means hates or is killing.

131
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,610
Are people asking you to explain things about your birth place or questioning whether you are American?

132
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:26,270
You know, I know that you heard about all of these incidents, kids who look like you being bullied.

133
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:31,610
And I'm sure your friends, all those people don't know who we are.

134
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:37,809
And that's what makes it so easy for them to hate. People are just misinformed and they exist.

135
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:47,870
Such is the reality and I was always afraid to share my identity and I don't want to be afraid of that.

136
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:53,240
I want you to really look at yourself and see the light that's in you.

137
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,330
This is an opportunity for us to become stronger.

138
00:14:57,710 --> 00:15:07,250
Help people understand you are a muslim who shares the same dreams, the same aspirations, the same hopes.

139
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:13,070
Like anyone else, you are worthy and your loved one beautiful.

140
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:20,960
You are strong. You are capable of. You are the most amazing child I've ever met.

141
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:29,330
I'm so lucky to be your mom. I want you to be proud of who you are.

142
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:37,270
I want you to frame and see people from different religions and race and ethnicity.

143
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,650
I want you to see beyond our differences.

144
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:49,920
It is our shared humanity that makes us who we are.

145
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,890
There was three of them. So we're going to watch them all. And then.

146
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:09,950
I just, you know, I am really bad with technology, so I hope I won't bring this up too much.

147
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:14,410
Oh, shoot. Well, too soon.

148
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:24,770
This is where you can all talk about. Was.

149
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:35,690
All right. Let's turn to. The last few years have been tough.

150
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,230
Oh, really? That's where I did my writing.

151
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:46,740
Right here. Catholic expansion.

152
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:56,450
I love herbal tea on my day.

153
00:16:56,450 --> 00:17:00,110
Job search on your child's.

154
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:07,550
The reason we have to have this talk is because you are a black child in America.

155
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:27,050
I need you to know that. And there's so many things going on in the world.

156
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:33,890
I will lie to you. You're going to see some things that are going to break you down is going to hurt.

157
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:40,370
I know how hard it is for you to see yourself in the place of Tamir Rice.

158
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,940
So I need you to always be prepared and always do in the garden.

159
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,380
And it takes away from doing a little bit. I know, but I'm trying to protect you right now.

160
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,630
If you are Kobe Bryant. Louis, stay calm. Don't fight back.

161
00:17:53,960 --> 00:18:03,080
Don't give any rebuttals. You have to understand, if you want to stay alive, you have to do what they say as it could be.

162
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:09,760
The difference between me seeing you again and not seeing the same thing.

163
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,270
Sometimes it may not even work because you may not work at all.

164
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:19,880
I'm sorry.

165
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:28,850
I know. Was tough, and I know it sounds really scary, but it's not your fault.

166
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:35,210
We live in a society that is geared that we do not succeed.

167
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,680
It is put together. It is constructed in such a way that we feel it.

168
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:47,090
You have to be creative and know that you always stand your head up and your shoulders back and be proud.

169
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:52,099
And you are a warrior. Always know that you are intelligent, beautiful, bright,

170
00:18:52,100 --> 00:19:00,890
and you have a future and you have inherited word in the society and above all else in my son,

171
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:09,380
regardless of what happens, because I don't know what's going to happen today or tomorrow or whatever.

172
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:15,170
Just don't change. Don't change. And be proud of who you are.

173
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:19,670
I love you with all that I know. I will teach you how to walk in this life.

174
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:22,970
You don't have anything to be afraid of. We'll get through this.

175
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,910
And don't you ever, ever blame yourself for what others do.

176
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:46,580
I love you. I believe in you. And I believe that others, just like you, who hold onto their life together, you will change the world.

177
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:58,220
One more and let's hear from her is important to us.

178
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,960
Whose campaign we get this time? Wow.

179
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:09,180
Actually get it up. And I get closer than the lady at the store.

180
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:13,180
And that's not a compliment. It's an ugly, nasty word.

181
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:19,470
You're going to hear it. But I knew about that one man, that word, her ego.

182
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:33,170
Usually systems that when you get pulled hold on a good driver or is of some emotion getting an attitude.

183
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,220
This is about you not coming home. Okay.

184
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:47,020
Okay. You were not pretty Homeland.

185
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:52,330
You were beautiful, period. Okay. Come.

186
00:20:52,590 --> 00:21:08,970
Never forget that. Her.

187
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,160
So just reactions to those. Again, I realize that this is, you know,

188
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:25,390
will have a different emotional effect for different people depending on your connection and lack of connection.

189
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:32,530
You know, with with the contact with the topic, we're just kind of gut reactions if you feel comfortable.

190
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,560
Yeah. Tanya. Yeah. Just kind of how hard it is to explain it to, like, a child.

191
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,890
What's going on? Why people do streams.

192
00:21:51,540 --> 00:22:05,790
The firm's. Yeah, I noticed that in the first video.

193
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:15,000
And in the second video there was a black Muslim woman which made me realize like how hard it must be to have to explain to their child.

194
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,310
Like, there are two different identities and it's like that.

195
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:27,850
And if you don't want to talk to growing up, I just I just thought, like, I can't imagine to explain.

196
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,959
A different. Reason to be afraid today.

197
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:36,010
And a different reason to be afraid. Another day. Yeah.

198
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:42,600
I think that, again, that's an intersectionality that I have been talking about will continue to talk about saying,

199
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:48,310
you know, sometimes it may feel like just want is so heavy.

200
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,360
Like you said, you can't even imagine having that other weight, you know, put on top.

201
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:59,200
Yeah, it was definitely familiar. I've definitely received a talking point from my parents.

202
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,610
I will say, like the older I get, the more I understand,

203
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:10,269
like a lot of the just nervousness our parents like especially regarding the

204
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:14,380
police and just us being out because of a lot of the racism we experience.

205
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,239
But as a child, you don't really understand that. It's kind of like, oh, I don't, I don't need to have this.

206
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:24,130
Like, it's not going to happen to me. The older you get, the more you realize it can.

207
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:30,639
Yeah, I think for sure. And I suppose I think in the current climate, you know, the past several years,

208
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,700
there's so much, I think more with more people than anything videotaping things, filming.

209
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:41,860
I mean, we're we're unfortunately so much more well, fortunately more aware, but it's fortunately still going on.

210
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:49,959
Yeah, I think one thing that I noticed in Washington was it wasn't just about like talking to them about how to exist in the world.

211
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:57,760
They're also like the mental strain and like how taxing it can be to see things on television

212
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,610
all the time and then over and over again and not really seeing anything changing,

213
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:12,430
like how that can affect you as a child growing up and even going into like adult understanding like now how much that like

214
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:19,360
took a toll basically on me as a kid and like having to watch that and really not seeing anything which even now as an adult.

215
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:24,790
So I think that was one thing that was like stood up to me because I think when I think about the talk,

216
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:29,290
I think about like how to live in the world and like different place for you over.

217
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:38,530
But also I think it was a nice point that they made the parents talking about how taxing that is on you as a child and also as parents.

218
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:48,100
Yeah, that's why, you know, there's so much more research now that shows about the the the strain that that puts on your health.

219
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:57,390
You know, the fact that racism, xenophobia, heterosexism, transphobia, all the different forms of discrimination really play a toll.

220
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:07,020
You know, and we've seen that by many researchers and seeing that it's it's not just your mental health, but it's also your physical health.

221
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:17,080
So increased rates of heart disease, diabetes, other things that have some association with those higher levels of stress and other thoughts.

222
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,040
Yeah. So when I watch the first video,

223
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:31,350
I think I kind of thought about how like so I grew up in Brooklyn and the community in Brooklyn wasn't really Muslim majority,

224
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:34,740
but there were like a lot of Muslim people that lived there.

225
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:43,650
And so that like essentially like the talk that was in the first video, like I think I have,

226
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:49,490
I think I had that talk when I was with my parents once when we were coming home from like Friday prayer.

227
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:56,220
And I don't know, I kind of just made me think about how like depending on where you live,

228
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:00,030
you might have that type of talk in like a different or certain situation.

229
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:06,090
Because I know some, some weeks, like one Friday, Friday prayer was really, really busy.

230
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,690
Like they would just be NYPD like waiting outside our mosque.

231
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:16,290
And I would always ask myself like why they were there. Like, I kind of still don't know the reason by, like, you know.

232
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,690
All the things that happened in New York City around the 2000s. And I don't know.

233
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,490
It was just it was just like I just kind of, like, thought about the talk.

234
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,389
Like, I remember, like, walking home from prayer with my dad and thinking about how,

235
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:35,250
like, he would always tell me to, like, stand strong and proud and not show fear.

236
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:44,630
Yeah. And like. If you were to tell me how the police would look for fear like that would paint a target on your back.

237
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:47,650
But I guess I'm just thinking about that.

238
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:54,580
Thanks for sharing. I think that's a really good point, too, that it's also depends on what kind of community or environment you're in.

239
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:02,410
You know, the the messaging that they would have to be different depending on, you know, how accepting or not accepting.

240
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:08,890
And even if you are in a more accepting environment and getting prepared to get outside of that environment,

241
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:13,840
you know, what do you do when you're going off to school or other things as opposed.

242
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:21,010
What about for folks who don't share any of the identities that were presented?

243
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,870
Was this new to you? Was it different? Was that something you hadn't thought about before?

244
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:35,379
What are some of the reactions that you might have? And there wasn't necessarily new familiar ways, but it was just such like.

245
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,970
I guess what stuck out to me is the sense of inevitability, not necessarily like a conditional,

246
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:46,629
more so kind of this like fearfulness that this does happen every day.

247
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:52,090
And, you know, this is very prominent in our culture and our society and it's not necessarily a conditional now.

248
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:57,450
It's like this is how you should almost expect. Which is really devastating, you know.

249
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,610
But I think that like psychologically it just changes your outlook,

250
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:05,379
especially since so many people made the point about being so young with these situations,

251
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:10,330
it just already informed your way of looking at the world just based on how it exists and how

252
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:14,560
you're being informed and kind of the world that you're going into and how you look at that.

253
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:20,830
Yeah, I think the inevitability I think is something that again, with privilege you too often don't think about,

254
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:27,969
you know, and for a lot of folks it is more of the not if it's going to happen.

255
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:34,600
But what will happen is I have a person I work with for a number of years.

256
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:40,720
We work together on research and community work. She's a black, trans identified woman in Detroit.

257
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:49,600
And, you know, she always says that she or she always worries when she's going to get attacked,

258
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:57,730
not if she's going to get attacked because so many black trans women in Detroit and other major urban cities have been murdered and attacked.

259
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:04,960
And that's how she moves through the world, you know, and she said, as you just said, I've just accepted that this is my reality.

260
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:14,560
And, you know, she she talked about how she tries really hard not to let that control and dictate her life.

261
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,530
But she said it's always in the back of her head, you know,

262
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:23,710
no matter what it means coming out of her apartment or coming to work or going out to dinner,

263
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:31,360
it's always is today going to be the day when I get beaten and potentially shot and think about what that must be like to move through

264
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:39,759
the world and every single day waking up your that's weighing on you others from folks who maybe don't have a shared identity.

265
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,830
What kind of reactions. Yeah.

266
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:48,180
I would just say, like for me watching it, it's kind of almost a sense of like you.

267
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:58,070
I never had to do that. And like, I obviously can't feel what it's like to do that fearful and thinking about that.

268
00:29:58,070 --> 00:30:08,780
And also just that people like me and people that are of my race and my identity are the people are like perpetuating things like that.

269
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:15,410
We talk about not necessarily perpetuating them through like specific acts of violence, but also just by not doing anything.

270
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:20,150
So what can you do about that? And he's right.

271
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,429
And that to put you on the spot. There's a lot of waiting to find out who other people.

272
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:29,150
What can you do about that? Are you going to raise your hand?

273
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:37,010
Yeah, I was thinking that a lot of times parents, white parents say, oh, my child is too young to learn about racism.

274
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:44,480
Right. There are a lot of like state governments don't want to include like lessons on racism because the kids are too young to learn about them.

275
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:54,980
And I think changing that also and encouraging parents to have white parents to help talk about racism with their kids.

276
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,760
Yeah. And again, including that in state curricula, too.

277
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:03,979
Right. Is really important to point. As I'm going to say it again,

278
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:10,250
I was just thinking like it'd be interesting to kind of see the perspective of white family and what

279
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:17,870
kind of how they raise their children and to kind of understanding different identities out there.

280
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:23,059
And so I think it'd be really interesting to see like a YouTube video like that and see

281
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:29,030
kind of what instilled what is being instilled in these children from a young age.

282
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:34,220
You know, are they being taught like, hey, like stay away from, you know, so-and-so, this person,

283
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:40,309
you know, being taught this person may look different, you know, because I actually had an experience.

284
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:48,950
I was walking into a grocery store one time and I was holding the door for someone, and the child behind me was like, thank you.

285
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:53,389
And I could hear him asking his mom. He was like, like, mom, why does she wear that?

286
00:31:53,390 --> 00:32:00,820
Like on her head? And the mom was like, it's just and she actually responded and I don't know how, like, I was expecting, like,

287
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:06,649
her response, but she was like, she's just choosing to be a little bit more modest and, you know, cover up.

288
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:12,440
And he was like a little bit like younger. So, like, I don't even know if you could understand what she meant,

289
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,659
but it was just interesting to see the way that she approached the situation versus like other parents

290
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:24,440
could either ignore it and so they come up with their own misconceptions or whatever it may be.

291
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:28,000
So I think, you know, addressing it like at a young age, just like.

292
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,840
No. She said so. Yeah.

293
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:36,650
I don't remember your name. I'm sorry. Okay.

294
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,920
Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.

295
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:45,160
And I think that, you know, those are all great points that I think it's hard for me to put you on the point that you could answer the whole thing.

296
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:51,129
But yeah, I mean, I think, you know, some of it is starting early, starting young, having those open conversations.

297
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:58,510
And if you are older, you know, still having those conversations, you know, I think as much as we pretend, well,

298
00:32:58,750 --> 00:33:04,210
this is important, as much as we don't know or don't think about the things, that's, again, what keeps it going.

299
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:12,610
But now talking to other white folks about that, talking to other people who may have that privilege about it is important.

300
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:23,110
One one quick thing and then head you. You. I think also when it comes to children, you know, thank you for the children have exposure to books,

301
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:29,280
toys, cartoons, all that stuff that are very diverse.

302
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:41,260
I remember when I had my first grand niece, so it's my niece's child and you know, when she was born,

303
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:48,639
I bombed down like every race ethnicity book you can find and toy and everything.

304
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:56,710
So if you go in her room, it's like there's everything there, different languages, different backgrounds, because then it becomes more normal,

305
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:03,970
more, you know, to see people who don't look like you as opposed to a bunch of lily white, you know, faces that all look exactly the same.

306
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,389
Yeah. Yeah. I was just going to add to that as well, actually,

307
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:17,650
because like when you like I'm learning more about doing incorporating racial social socialization messages in my research and like I think a lot of

308
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:26,380
white parents will be surprised at the types of messages that black and other ethnicities like have to provide to their children for their safety.

309
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,349
And I think they would be surprised at like what age that starts,

310
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:34,450
because I think that that is like a common misconception that like some of the things in those videos,

311
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:41,170
you would assume that a parent is saying that to like a teenager or someone who is like kind of at least becoming an adult,

312
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,360
whereas some of those parents might be telling their five year old that when they go outside to play, you know?

313
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:52,299
So I think that a lot of parents who don't have to think about those things when it comes to their kids will be surprised at,

314
00:34:52,300 --> 00:35:01,000
like, how young these messages start. Um, and kind of like how young they might need to start talking to their kids about race as well.

315
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:11,850
Yeah. And I think too from a developmental perspective, you know, issues of race and racism, those are really abstract concepts, you know.

316
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:19,780
So even trying to describe it to a five year old or six year old, you know, can be challenging because for them to understand, it is really hard.

317
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:29,920
So I remember my my husband, I took our our nephew to in California amusement park and the husband's black nephew's black.

318
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:39,340
He really wanted we were saw telling you, you know, if you do a good job today, this little, you know, reinforcement will buy you a gift, a toy.

319
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,350
So he wanted a gun. And I'm very anti guns.

320
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:49,630
And like with all my nephews, nieces, relatives, I refuse to buy a gun on the water gun or anything.

321
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,920
I wrote around too much of that. You're not going to perpetuate it.

322
00:35:54,250 --> 00:36:00,010
So he kept wanting a gun. I can tell him, No, we're not going to get your gun.

323
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:06,610
You can have anything else you want, but no guns. I want to go. I want to go. So finally at dinner, probably the you know,

324
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:15,410
we're eating chicken in amusement park and we had to have a talk about guns and what it means to be a black kid.

325
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:17,770
He's also was very big for his age.

326
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:27,819
And so, you know, we were sitting there talking and my husband is explaining to him why for him also as a dark skinned,

327
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,090
tall black man, people make so many assumptions.

328
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:37,330
And then when he was younger, they made assumptions, too, because of his size, his skin tone, things like that.

329
00:36:37,690 --> 00:36:44,650
And and I just remember the the the fear in his eyes, you know, at seven.

330
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:50,760
And his first question was, am I going to get shot? You know, because again, you're only thinking about concrete things, right?

331
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:58,390
So if you're talking about this concept of someone may read this wrong and, you know, he got really upset and really scared.

332
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:05,950
But yeah, we really felt like at that point when he kept hounding on and on instead of just saying,

333
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:10,299
no, we don't like guns, we need to be honest with them and share that.

334
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:18,910
And but it was it was hard for him to quite wrap his head around that because he immediately went to, oh, my God, it's someone going to shoot me.

335
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:25,479
And so then you have to go further and further. But I think, too, when we when we send those messages earlier, you know,

336
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,620
and find ways to have those conversations that are developmentally appropriate.

337
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:35,220
Where they can be helpful. And I think that white parents need to be having these talks, too.

338
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:39,080
But it may be a different talk. It may be about, you know, what?

339
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:46,400
What happens on the playground with someone who is different than you and how might your behavior impact others?

340
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:55,219
And that's like with, you know, all the talk now around critical race theory that makes me want to puke, not a negative way, like it's bad,

341
00:37:55,220 --> 00:38:00,800
but around conservatives that are like, we can't have race in school and all the [INAUDIBLE] that's going on in Florida now.

342
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,090
You know, to me, that is totally ridiculous.

343
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:09,620
I mean, first of all, most people who are anti critical race theory don't even know what critical race theory is.

344
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:20,510
And if it's being taught in grade schools, it's not being taught at the level that I, Kimberlé Crenshaw or UCLA School of Law writes about.

345
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,510
I'm sure it's being dealt with in a very different way,

346
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:30,320
but that kind of mindset is what perpetuates and why we need to keep having these conversations because people keep,

347
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,600
you know, not wanting to talk about their tough topics. Any other further comments?

348
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,149
But I like to show these early in the semester,

349
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,500
and especially when we're talking in the beginning about issues of privilege and race and things like that,

350
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,750
because I think we all need to be aware of this.

351
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:53,770
And whether you're a person of color or a person with a disability or sexual gender minority, and there's different ways.

352
00:38:53,780 --> 00:39:00,350
So, you know, if you look at the parallel with someone who may be a sexual and gender minority or part of the LGBT community,

353
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:06,650
you often don't have parents to sit you down and have that talk because a lot of times you you learn what it means to be,

354
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,640
you know, gay or queer from other people in your community.

355
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:20,740
And so you may not have you may have one of these talks by someone later in life after you've already experienced a bashing or other negative things.

356
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:28,550
So there's a lot of parallels. I mean, you can look at this in terms of different religious beliefs, you know, the way that,

357
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,610
you know, Jewish folks have been treated and are treated, that might be a talk.

358
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:38,450
So there's a lot of different kinds of talks. All right.

359
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:46,970
So now we're going to go to something a little more mundane and less emotional as we're going to talk a little bit about public health approaches.

360
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:56,090
And this is really hopefully this should be pretty much of review from 210 and some of the other classes, your public health classes.

361
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:03,499
I'm going to skip this one because that's why I'm so in this class.

362
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:10,700
You will be critiquing a public health intervention and then you will also be developing public health interventions.

363
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:19,250
This is just kind of a framework for how to think about creating a health promotion intervention.

364
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:24,200
At the top, we want to think about what needs to change and where is change needed.

365
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:30,710
And this is where we'll be talking about this in class. That doesn't that should be coming from the community, not from us.

366
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:37,310
All too often people in public health go in and they tell the community what they need or what they want or what they think they want,

367
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:41,030
especially in the global world. So if any of you are interested in global work,

368
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:49,100
so happens a lot where people from the US or high income countries come into different global settings that are like,

369
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:56,090
Hey, we have this great diabetes prevention program and like we need food, you know, don't talk to us about diabetes.

370
00:40:57,230 --> 00:41:05,780
So it's really we will talk about this a lot and really figure out how do we find out what people really need and then what level prevention.

371
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:12,770
So we'll talk a little bit about like primary, secondary and tertiary prevention and then what level of influence.

372
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:16,909
So what that means is are you going to do an intervention that focuses on

373
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:22,490
individuals so individual counseling or health promotion or we talk about groups,

374
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,729
our school based programs, community programs,

375
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:32,810
or are we going to talk about policy policy and organizational level policy at a federal level, things like that.

376
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:43,790
And then when we're starting to look at building interventions, you know, we want to look at what's already been done before because again,

377
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,559
one of the biggest challenges, I think, in in public health,

378
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,140
when I see programs go awry are not really work, is that people get their ego caught up in it too much.

379
00:41:54,530 --> 00:42:01,100
It's like they want to have an intervention that they developed and that's beautiful and wonderful and you want to have your name on it,

380
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:11,149
you know, that's good. Wow. There's a lot of good stuff out there now that many often you can't just pick it up and then dump it in your community.

381
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,900
You're going to have to do some changes, but you want to learn from what other people have done.

382
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:24,050
And again, I see this a lot in global health where people will come in and try and reinvent the wheel.

383
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,440
But other people have done this either through public health work or it could be just like.

384
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:37,470
You know, indigenous community folks who have done this before and you're just helping to create it in a different way.

385
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,690
So then you also want to think about is that single or multiple strategies?

386
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:49,139
So sometimes we only have enough money for a single strategy.

387
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:58,950
So a single strategy might be a social marketing campaign using social media to educate people about HPV.

388
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:04,830
That might be all you can afford. Other times, you might have money to do.

389
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:07,430
Let's say you might have a social media campaign.

390
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:15,900
You also might have groups that are conducted in a community center where people are coming in and learning new skills,

391
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:20,430
learning how to promote health. And then you also may be working at a policy level, too,

392
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:29,790
so working with elected officials to try and put forth legislation and then appropriate for the priority population.

393
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,959
This is really, really, really, really, really important. Yeah, that's right.

394
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:42,090
We talk about race and privilege and all these issues early on because just because you think that it's good doesn't mean it's good.

395
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:50,880
And just because you may think, you know, what's best for our community means is you're probably not exactly right.

396
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,370
So you want to make sure it's a good fit.

397
00:43:53,670 --> 00:44:06,600
So let's say you're working with older adults over the age of 65 and you have created this really cool app for helping them with exercise and diet.

398
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:18,000
The word app, you're already you're already screwed up. That shouldn't go work because people over 65 are not typically using apps.

399
00:44:20,310 --> 00:44:26,700
I give you a real world example. So my parents are both in their eighties, they're in a senior living community, an independent living.

400
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:35,400
And so we're working with this health care company that said that they have this new thing that was like a tablet,

401
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:45,030
but it wasn't like a traditional tablet was pretty big. And I have medication reminders and, you know, brain teasers and other things, all this stuff.

402
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:48,330
And I was going, Yeah, my parents don't really use computers.

403
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:53,430
And I go, No, no, it's super easy. It's super easy. And you can call them.

404
00:44:53,430 --> 00:44:57,390
And, you know, there's a forced call where you can call them and they don't pick up.

405
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,570
You can make it turn on so you can see in their house. So I wrote down.

406
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:08,160
We did it. Yeah, it was a big waste of money.

407
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:14,459
Didn't really work so well. You know, it's like half the time when I would call, they'd be like, Where are you?

408
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,440
Where are you going?

409
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,929
Well, I get around the room, I'm like, Look on this, you know, on the shelf there is a little computer or the medication reminder.

410
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:27,480
There's a part that kill me. There's a little it's a time. Take your medication time and take your medication.

411
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,840
And it says it multiple times. So you push the button. And what I found is my mom would just be yelling at the machine.

412
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:40,000
And then we get so frustrated she would take her medication. So it actually had the opposite effect.

413
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:48,450
But yeah, I heard some new swear words coming out of my mom's mouth and I'm like, Mom, it's just a tangent.

414
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:56,430
I know, but that lady just won't shut up, you know, because again, to her, it's not a tablet to lady talking to her and the lady's in that little box.

415
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:00,330
So, you know, you really have to think about is this really an appropriate fit?

416
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:07,860
And then also what resources are available. You know, sometimes when we're doing public health interventions, we have really small budgets.

417
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:11,790
You know, public health is not always funded as much as other things.

418
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,620
And in public health, the research is funded a lot more than public health practice.

419
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:23,160
And so we're not going to typically have a $2 million grant to do an intervention.

420
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:29,970
We're usually working with a lot less money. So we have to think about, you know, this will be determined.

421
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:34,920
So the single our multiple strategies is partially going to be determined by what resources are available,

422
00:46:35,670 --> 00:46:42,570
resources both financially but human resources, physical resources, all those things.

423
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:53,280
And then you get down to the planned intervention. So as you see, creating a health promotion intervention is not always that easy.

424
00:46:54,060 --> 00:47:01,110
And we're going to walk you through how to do this over the course of this course.

425
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:05,639
Of course. And then hopefully we'll be learning other approaches, too.

426
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,540
And then the classes, as have you seen this before and like 200,

427
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:22,160
200 and other classes and see a couple of enthusiastic ones on maybe you want to explain this to us.

428
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:26,560
I take a drink of water. Yeah, I do.

429
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:31,299
I think it's like. At the bottom of the pyramid.

430
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:42,030
It's like the most affected. Like if you address those things, then you'll see the green as you go up and you're addressing more individual things.

431
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:46,210
And so it has a smaller effect on the community as a whole. Right, exactly.

432
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:50,410
And we want to add anything. We did an exercise for the day.

433
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:59,450
They have things on the tablet. Obviously, the things on the bottom.

434
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:05,860
Also, even though they have the largest impact, their goal is to change things, to give people more education or counseling.

435
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,600
But it's really difficult to, like, eliminate poverty. Yeah, exactly.

436
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:14,990
Yeah. Most of those things at the bottom are really hard and they often take a really long time.

437
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:19,090
Right. So if you're talking about housing stability, that's not going to happen.

438
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,110
You know, over the course of a couple of months or even a couple of years sometimes.

439
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:26,800
I mean, you may have to build new structures and create new systems.

440
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:39,420
What else about this? Dig back into your public health 100 days or is it all a blur?

441
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:44,939
I will stop there. I mean, I'm sorry. I don't think this is what you're going for.

442
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:49,620
But something else that I thought of, like for the pyramid in terms of the things at the bottom,

443
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:52,319
thinking like the one time we're having the most work,

444
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:58,110
they also take like the most collaboration and things that people might not consider in the realm of public health.

445
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:08,070
You're thinking about like housing stability, or you have to work with like urban planning or like it's a lot more like community involvement,

446
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,300
a larger scale, and working with a lot of different partners versus like the top things.

447
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:19,740
It's relatively easier to like create a curriculum or something for education for a specific group with just like

448
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:25,580
public health or just like the one group that you mentioned that not that's exactly what I'm thinking about.

449
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,709
So impressive. Yeah.

450
00:49:28,710 --> 00:49:37,560
So one day I was going to say is to design on top of that is that you often have to go outside of your discipline.

451
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:46,470
So, you know, for the socioeconomic factors and even some of these here, you have to work outside of public health.

452
00:49:46,890 --> 00:49:52,890
So sometimes you have to work with people in urban planning, people on public policy, people and sociology.

453
00:49:53,130 --> 00:50:02,370
I mean, a whole array of different people, lawyers, civil engineers, if we're talking about, you know,

454
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,770
maybe one thing we need to do is we need to create a whole new physical space to increase exercise.

455
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:16,530
Well, you need people that know how to build that and how to people how to you need to get in touch with people who can help you with funding, too.

456
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:21,660
So knowing your elected officials. So yeah, so we're talking about the bottom factors.

457
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:24,030
Takes a lot more time,

458
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:33,270
takes a lot more money and resources and it takes a lot more collaboration and multidisciplinary where we have to then be pulling.

459
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:39,150
And that's part of to why, you know, public health really is such a multidisciplinary field,

460
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:45,870
because we do need to pull from all these different fields, you know, and that's why I like in this program,

461
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,760
when we started undergrad program,

462
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:56,280
we purposely made it just your junior and senior year because we wanted people to come into the program with different viewpoints and perspectives.

463
00:50:56,610 --> 00:51:00,390
We didn't want everyone to be taking the same types of classes for four years.

464
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:09,930
We wanted people to be out there in know, let's say, maybe engineering, maybe other fields, and then bring all those to the table.

465
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:16,080
You know, a lot of interventions are more in the counseling and education realm,

466
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:22,319
especially in the department that I was in, and health behavior and health.

467
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:30,830
And but even in things like nutrition, you know, these are truly said easier.

468
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:35,010
They can be done with less time.

469
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:42,720
So you can create these and implement them in a much shorter amount of time.

470
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:47,970
There's then clinical intervention, so there's medication to control blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes.

471
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:56,400
You know, I think one thing about this, though, I mean, I don't agree with everything in this article, but with things like clinical intervention,

472
00:51:56,670 --> 00:52:01,890
one thing that's important to keep in mind is that in order for this to work, it's all about behavior.

473
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:10,930
All right. So even if I create. I'll say something like, I don't know, a COVID vaccine, people still need to take it, right?

474
00:52:11,260 --> 00:52:15,910
And we live in a day and age, fortunately, where public health has been politicized.

475
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:27,490
And so, you know, you're fighting sometimes to get people to take these or things like medication for high blood pressure and cholesterol.

476
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:34,930
You can have scientists creating the top of the line medication, but at the end of the day, if that pill doesn't go in your mouth.

477
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:42,690
Wasted your time and taking medication is a behavior.

478
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:50,879
I remember a couple of years ago in the HIV field when when Prep came along, pre-exposure prophylaxis,

479
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:58,350
which is a pill that you can take and that if you're exposed to HIV, you won't convert and become HIV positive.

480
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:05,610
And so I first came out, you know, people are like, oh, it's going to be the end of HIV because we have prep and blah, blah.

481
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:10,080
And then we found out it wasn't really working as well as they thought.

482
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:17,999
And so I was actually invited to give a talk at the what is a conference for retroviruses and opportunistic

483
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:27,600
infections and talk to a bunch of like Kiki actually very intelligent lab based folks and some other people,

484
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:38,100
you know, and my whole talk was about behavior that everything comes down to behavior because in order to take prep first,

485
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:44,490
you have to know prep exists. Then you have to find a way to access Prep which can be really hard.

486
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:54,320
And then you need to be able to find a way to take it on time when it's needed.

487
00:53:54,510 --> 00:54:02,240
Also, if you're in a situation where you are not alone about your sexuality, you need to be able to hide your pills, you know?

488
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:07,320
So there's all these different things that go into whether or not people use Prep because all these scientists were like,

489
00:54:07,470 --> 00:54:19,020
Oh, we developed been HIV is over. And not so much that there's long term, long protective interventions, immunizations, smoking cessation.

490
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,550
You know, I think that with this.

491
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:31,280
You know, some of the one time are infrequent interventions or certain health behaviors that would work,

492
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:38,389
but for most they don't because even like smoking cessation, that needs to be a prolonged process.

493
00:54:38,390 --> 00:54:44,690
You don't just like go to one session and we say smoking is bad and then you're like, Oh my God, I'm free.

494
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:47,090
I'm not going to smoke anymore. Come on, that's not realistic.

495
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:55,370
So, you know, one thing I would say is, like I said, it takes a long time to develop a habit or to develop certain behavioral patterns.

496
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:59,210
So it's going to take you a long time to undo those.

497
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:04,180
So we have to keep that in mind. Then changing the environment.

498
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:09,110
So here talking about fluoridated water, smoke free workplaces, things like that,

499
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:14,389
I think there's a lot that goes on in between this and between these as well.

500
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:20,510
So again, I don't agree 1,000% with this, but we can make environmental changes.

501
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:25,909
So kind of like for instance, out in the front of this building in the winter,

502
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:35,240
they block off the steps in the front and you can only come up the sides and that so people don't slip on the steps and hurt themselves.

503
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:43,420
Now, I think it's about liability, but it could be seen as a public health intervention so that people don't fall foul.

504
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:48,950
Many, many billions put down, you know, a mass that you can kind of scrape your feet if you have snow and ice.

505
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:54,530
Those are public health interventions. The fact that you can't smoke on campus, that's a public health intervention.

506
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:58,209
So there's a lot of these things, the environment.

507
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:06,400
And you can also think about changing the environment, too, in such a way that the environment is changed to help facilitate behavior change.

508
00:56:06,890 --> 00:56:18,230
So if you think today, before I came in class, I went to the restroom and in the men's restroom there were menstrual hygiene products,

509
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:26,990
which I thought was really cool because if you were a trans man and you're using the men's bathroom and you need a menstrual product,

510
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:33,530
it's right there. That's a change in the environment that will help with behavior.

511
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,300
Also, people are talking to you about like the whole issue of injection drugs,

512
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:46,580
which in this country, I think we've done a really horrible job with trying to address that issue.

513
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:54,320
But, you know, in different countries, there's places where people can inject drugs safely.

514
00:56:54,410 --> 00:57:00,950
So you can actually go into a physical environment and inject a drug using a clean needle and do it safely.

515
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:02,420
Yeah. Yeah.

516
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:13,400
So California's governor just recently vetoed a law passed pretty overwhelming by his legislature because he has national aspirations to be president.

517
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,600
And so he didn't want that on his record. What is it about like safe injection sites?

518
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:21,919
And it was like last week, you just vetoed it. That's ridiculous.

519
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,739
Yeah, because I heard about that that that was happening. Yeah.

520
00:57:24,740 --> 00:57:33,830
And because California was one of the first places to with medical marijuana to have medical marijuana sites where you could go and use the marijuana.

521
00:57:33,830 --> 00:57:40,910
But yeah, that unfortunately is, again, politics, you know, going in and screwing up a public health intervention.

522
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:52,399
So when we're talking about different kinds of public health interventions, sometimes, you know, we may be working on health promotion activities.

523
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:56,570
So this is where we're trying to modify behaviors,

524
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:06,680
do something so that we're promoting our health so that we don't become sick or have some kind of injury or other things like that.

525
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:17,960
So some might be right, individuals resistance factors or it could be biological virus, bacteria modifying environments, as I just talked about.

526
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:27,380
So to the toxic exposures in the workplace, we don't want those others may occur after the presence of disease or injury.

527
00:58:27,390 --> 00:58:36,440
So early case finding and prompt treatments or screening tests when in when COVID came about and there was all of this testing,

528
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:44,489
that was a good thing because we were able to find out early people treatment also period

529
00:58:44,490 --> 00:58:52,100
of physical exams with I know one thing that like Medicare and Medicaid does is that

530
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:56,540
they have mandatory visits for anyone that are receiving those services that you have

531
00:58:56,540 --> 00:59:02,510
to get semiannual physicals so that they can figure out what's going on ahead of time.

532
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:10,280
So instead of waiting until you have potential long term disability, then also disability limitation.

533
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:16,850
So making sure people get effective treatments and then rehabilitation.

534
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:24,020
So rehabilitation is more where you are at the level where you already have some kind of health condition,

535
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:27,020
but you're trying to help people get to the highest level of functioning.

536
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:37,430
So let's say that someone has injured their arm and have long term nerve damage.

537
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:44,000
How do we work to rehabilitate that person so that they can live their best like possible, even though they do have a limitation?

538
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:49,549
Do you all know the difference between primary and secondary tertiary prevention? Who is me?

539
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:55,590
What primary is? Here is this line where we go.

540
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:59,540
What's primary prevention? Yes. Amelia.

541
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:05,360
It'd be like any intervention that would, like, stop the injury or disease from occurring in the first place.

542
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:09,230
And then secondary, tertiary. Go with treatment. And after that.

543
01:00:09,350 --> 01:00:12,350
Okay. You only have a new primary, but thankfully, you know.

544
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:16,230
So let's talk a little bit about the difference between secondary and tertiary.

545
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:20,800
So what's the difference between secondary and tertiary? Yeah.

546
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:30,250
I think secondary was when you've already been exposed and then tertiary is when you've been diagnosed or when you have like the illness or whatever.

547
01:00:30,650 --> 01:00:35,770
Exactly. All right, good. So we can go through these next slides really super quick.

548
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:40,239
So Primary is trying to control the underlying cause, their condition.

549
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:50,350
So I put this for that because some people think about so if I have a mother is living with HIV and she is taking antiretroviral therapy,

550
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:57,190
that is primary prevention for the infant so that she doesn't pass the HIV along to her infant.

551
01:00:57,190 --> 01:01:04,900
Because if she if her viral load is undetectable and she's on meds, the chances of transmission are basically zero.

552
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:10,660
Another behavior change group for healthy individuals and then immunization against illness.

553
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:15,879
Then we're talking about secondary into identifying health concerns early and

554
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,020
preventing an existing illness or injury from progressing to long term disability.

555
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:26,830
So medication for people with a disease, adherence groups for people on blood pressure medication,

556
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:33,940
heart disease and then dietary changes after heart attack and then tertiary is rehabilitation

557
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:39,790
and special ed services to make sure that you don't go to a state of long term disability.

558
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:44,860
So it could be housing services to homeless people diagnosed with mental illness.

559
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:50,799
There's a lot a lot of research that we're seeing more and more of now that when people

560
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:58,210
who are houseless are provided with some type of stable housing and a place to go,

561
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,080
that their health outcomes improve substantially.

562
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:07,270
It's been looked at with mental illness, with different chronic diseases or ignored infectious diseases, things like that.

563
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:14,139
Also rehabilitation services for people who have suffered a stroke or teaching poorly controlled diabetics,

564
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,990
how to reduce risk of blindness or limb loss.

565
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:25,210
Now, one thing that you're going to find when you're starting to critique interventions that are out there and you're starting to build your own,

566
01:02:25,600 --> 01:02:31,450
is that some interventions may have components of one or two or three of these.

567
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:39,760
So there may be some interventions where part of it or for some people in your your group may it may be tertiary,

568
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:44,170
for others it may be primary and for others that may be secondary.

569
01:02:44,410 --> 01:02:54,520
So, for instance, if you're doing, let's say, an intervention focused on it's a mental health intervention, focus on depression and anxiety.

570
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:58,300
You may have some people, especially if you're doing a large scale intervention,

571
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:07,900
you may have to screen out for people who have severe depression or severe anxiety because they may not be appropriate for a group level intervention.

572
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:12,640
So if you're doing some kind of screener first and then those people get treatment,

573
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,200
that's probably going to be more depending on the severity level that might be more

574
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:23,860
tertiary than if you have people that have more mild levels of depression or anxiety.

575
01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:33,430
The intervention will affect them differently than people that have no known levels or extremely low levels of depression and anxiety.

576
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:38,710
So it's going to have a different effect because not everyone is in a neat little box.

577
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:44,560
You know, I've been diagnosed. I haven't been diagnosed or I have this level of severity.

578
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:51,940
Does that make sense? And yeah, so it's, you know, I think sometimes when people start to get into like critiquing the interventions,

579
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:57,030
which is your first assignment, they're like, Oh, this is going to be easy. This is definitely primary, this is definitely secondary.

580
01:03:57,040 --> 01:04:02,020
Well, it's not always that easy. And also, like I said, you may be bringing more than one.

581
01:04:03,160 --> 01:04:08,470
This is a little graphic to also help you think about primary, secondary, tertiary.

582
01:04:08,890 --> 01:04:10,500
So over here you have the health status.

583
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:19,360
And so the very top is the people that are totally healthy, no signs or symptoms that disease, illness or injury, disability and then death.

584
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:27,350
But you know, I remember when I when I came from I got my MPH after my ADHD insight.

585
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:31,160
And one thing now it's an epidemiology and biostatistics.

586
01:04:31,640 --> 01:04:38,420
And one thing when I was I think in AP classes is like everything was reviewed to like death or no death.

587
01:04:38,870 --> 01:04:43,640
You know, it's like a little, you know, to buy two sweaters is like dead or alive, you know.

588
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:48,540
Mm. No illness. And being a psychologist, I mean, we live in the gray.

589
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:56,990
And academia is all about the black and white. So every time I see that, it brings back memories of life on the H program.

590
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:06,649
So this is a cute little graphic. Well, some like you about the public health approach.

591
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:14,590
So, you know, a lot of approaches to health are pulling people out of the river after they fall in or after you're already sick.

592
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:16,670
We're just giving you meds, giving you drugs.

593
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:24,950
I mean, think about how many times when you're watching television there is a drug, a commercial for some kind of pharmaceutical.

594
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:33,350
I mean, it's it's crazy. When I brought colleagues of mine from Kenya over and they watch TV, like, what is wrong with you people?

595
01:05:33,590 --> 01:05:38,870
It's like all you do is like take medication over and over and over again because that's what most of our commercials are.

596
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:49,260
And. So if we go upriver, then we can stop people from falling in the water in the first place.

597
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:56,009
And so when we're doing interventions, we sometimes have to find out where are all the different parts,

598
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:59,040
because there's not just one place where people may be falling in the water.

599
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:06,959
One thing that isn't in this graphic that some people talk about is that one of the

600
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,790
best ways to keep people from falling into water is to build a bridge over the water.

601
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:15,450
But to build the bridge, it's like the bottom of that pyramid is like you were saying,

602
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:18,670
Camille, you're going to need different people to build that bridge.

603
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:23,430
Right. So people have an age are not really maybe equipped to build a bridge,

604
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:29,430
but you might need to get some civil engineers and then you might need to get some fundraising and then help you raise the money.

605
01:06:30,210 --> 01:06:34,680
And it takes a little bit of time. So if you think about that concept of building bridges,

606
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:40,680
that's that level of structural change that we really want because then that bridge is going to be there for a while.

607
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:43,920
It's not just, Yeah, I could put a board across here,

608
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,420
you use it a couple of times and the boards are going to break or fall or someone's going to fall off of it.

609
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:52,380
So just keep in mind that the public health approach is often not that easy.

610
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:58,490
I do want to add the very end before we leave.

611
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:05,430
Just talk about your first assignment. It's I'm due till the end of September, I think one of those.

612
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:11,220
But this is unplanned for a lot of it. But I just want to make sure that everyone's aware of it.

613
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:15,660
You probably have seen the socio ecological model nine times. Is that right?

614
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:20,350
All right, good. Anyone want to explain what all this stuff is?

615
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:22,440
All these little circles and the pretty colors?

616
01:07:26,890 --> 01:07:34,510
One have a tattoo of the soldier and one he really committed to public health that you want to have that model on your body.

617
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:40,300
Good. That no one wants to say anything about it.

618
01:07:42,930 --> 01:07:46,500
If you can't do that, that's cool.

619
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:53,969
This is a this is a model New Zealand before and it's somewhat similar to the pyramid.

620
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:58,530
Right. But turn into circles. So here we are at the individual level.

621
01:07:58,530 --> 01:08:02,060
We have knowledge, skills, attitude, beliefs, things like that.

622
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:06,660
So when we're sometimes, well, a lot of time for doing individual interventions here.

623
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:10,770
So we're providing knowledge. So a lot of social media,

624
01:08:10,890 --> 01:08:19,890
social marketing interventions are really that individual level because they're just giving the interpersonal level were impacted by our families,

625
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:26,160
friends, social networks. So that's another point of intervention that we could use for public health interventions.

626
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:31,350
So it could be that we do interventions with friendship groups.

627
01:08:32,310 --> 01:08:36,150
It's going to be family based interventions or social network based interventions.

628
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:40,260
The organizational levels of organizations and social institutions.

629
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:51,990
So at that level, we could develop interventions that are looking at changing social structures in terms of institutions and organizations.

630
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:58,860
Community is really the the communication connection between multiple organizations within a community.

631
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:10,050
So again, if we're trying to do something on a larger level, it could be working with youth serving agencies within a particular community.

632
01:09:10,500 --> 01:09:17,940
So I worked on a really big project years ago where we were working in communities,

633
01:09:17,940 --> 01:09:27,300
14 communities across the U.S. and the communities brought together multiple entities within that community to work with young people.

634
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:35,590
So everything from like juvenile justice to child welfare to nonprofit agencies to school districts, all that kind of stuff.

635
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:41,190
So you might bring those together public policy, state, local laws and regulations,

636
01:09:41,190 --> 01:09:46,760
and then society, you know, changing cultural norms, things, the social norms is tough.

637
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:51,180
It doesn't mean it can't happen. You know, it takes time.

638
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:58,280
And I think that, unfortunately, public health, we haven't been really good at changing that.

639
01:09:58,290 --> 01:10:07,769
I think in some arenas I think some things would change. I mean, if you look at things like seatbelt wearing, that was something that was legislated.

640
01:10:07,770 --> 01:10:11,970
But then also I think it became a bit more of a cultural norm as well.

641
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:15,900
So you're all familiar with the model, right? You know this backwards and forwards.

642
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:22,260
I'm going to introduce this and then talk a little bit about the assignment.

643
01:10:22,380 --> 01:10:25,530
How many people have seen the Health Problem Analysis worksheet before?

644
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:32,760
I was blown away. No one else in public health does this except for me when I probably help them.

645
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:39,540
A lot of people do it, but I think because I come from more of a practice background and this is something that practitioners use a lot.

646
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:50,430
So what this does is this is a really good framework for thinking about all the factors that are related to your health problem or your health issue.

647
01:10:51,930 --> 01:11:01,620
And I always do this analysis when I'm working in a new community and with a new issue because it helps us to think about it in a very broad way.

648
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:06,450
Some people do a similar process called root cause analysis,

649
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:12,870
where you're trying to get at some of the root causes of what's contributing to this and this analysis.

650
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:19,710
You want to look at your health problem. I like to call it a health issue because the problem is problem advising can be problematic.

651
01:11:19,830 --> 01:11:25,470
How many times is a problem, but it's some kind of health issue you want to address.

652
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:32,490
Then risk factors are things that are scientifically established, factors that directly impact the health problem.

653
01:11:32,490 --> 01:11:38,520
And I'll show you a couple of examples. The direct contributing factors are scientifically satisfactory.

654
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:48,450
Does it directly impact the risk factor? And then the indirect contributing factors are things that are usually in the community or the culture,

655
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:53,190
then have an influence on the direct and the risk factors.

656
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:56,730
So some examples here.

657
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:04,760
The health issue might be adolescent HIV infection. A determinant or risk factor is an element of sex without a condom or prep.

658
01:12:05,190 --> 01:12:09,930
We know that that is scientifically contributes to infection.

659
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:15,409
One direct contributing factor might be substance use, prior sex.

660
01:12:15,410 --> 01:12:21,420
So if you're using substances prior to sex, you're less likely to use a condom or be adherent to prep.

661
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:28,649
Now things that might contribute to that one might be easier availability of alcohol for adolescents.

662
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:36,420
So if it's really easy in a particular community for adolescents to get alcohol, they're going to be more likely to use substance prior to sex.

663
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:40,680
More likely to have unprotected sex.

664
01:12:40,830 --> 01:12:46,260
And then. Another might be media images glamorizing alcohol and sex.

665
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:55,240
So if every video people are combining alcohol and sex, that's sending a very strong message, especially for young folks that that's cool over here.

666
01:12:55,270 --> 01:13:03,030
Could be a build availability of condoms. Obviously, it's going to condoms or prep, which is going to impact whether or not you have access to these.

667
01:13:03,540 --> 01:13:07,770
One might be a lack of adolescent friendly prep and or condom distribution venues,

668
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:11,430
so they may exist in a community, but they're really geared toward older folks.

669
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:15,240
And so young people may feel really uncomfortable going into a clinic.

670
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:21,030
Another is, again, talking about policy and you talking about the current California policy.

671
01:13:21,540 --> 01:13:30,270
Mandated abstinence only programs in school. So during the George Bush administration, the second George Bush, it was mandated,

672
01:13:30,510 --> 01:13:36,390
mandated that all school based programs had to be abstinence until marriage.

673
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:42,660
And what absolutes until marriage, Matt, since gay marriage was illegal is it can only deal with heterosexual couples.

674
01:13:43,560 --> 01:13:48,240
So it was a way to legislate so that people could not have any access at all

675
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:55,230
to people who are engaged in same sex behavior or premarital sexual activity.

676
01:13:55,980 --> 01:13:57,510
The programs didn't deal with that at all.

677
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:07,500
So you can see here, when you think about prevention, you couldn't do a program that focuses on any of these or those,

678
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,360
and that's going to be a different kind of intervention.

679
01:14:09,930 --> 01:14:24,210
So you could work with the media with different, you know, movie companies or social media outlets to change some of these images.

680
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,990
And that could eventually, over time, have that effect.

681
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:37,710
You could look at doing sting operations with places that are selling alcohol to underage minors that could then also lead to increased rates of HIV.

682
01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:42,870
How more friendly clinics and also changing laws are on abstinence.

683
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:51,180
So you can see that the types of intervention at best, when you look at the indirect level, can look very, very different.

684
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:57,270
Now, the other thing, too, is that these kind of interventions will probably have more than one effect as well.

685
01:14:57,630 --> 01:15:02,550
So up here, I'm just doing a program that increases condom use.

686
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:10,290
I'm going to decrease HIV, probably pregnancy and STIs, but I'm not going to impact a lot of other things.

687
01:15:11,100 --> 01:15:17,040
But if I'm down here and I'm creating clinics, they're probably going to also provide other services, too.

688
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:20,790
So as we go down lower, we can often have a broader impact.

689
01:15:21,210 --> 01:15:24,210
Does that all make sense? All right.

690
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:35,120
So what I'm going to do just real quick is alert you to your assignment, because I think I want to.

691
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:48,140
So we have an assignment coming up. I will go over it in detail next time because I can't figure out how to get back to it.

692
01:15:48,150 --> 01:15:53,910
And as I'm here, I'm thinking like, oh, okay.

693
01:15:54,570 --> 01:15:59,610
Yeah. So with the first assignment, I could just tell you from there from from memory.

694
01:16:00,690 --> 01:16:04,620
So we have set articles that are on the camera side.

695
01:16:04,620 --> 01:16:14,130
So think we have six different articles and all the articles describe some kind of health promotion or prevention intervention.

696
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,990
What you need to do is you need to pick which article you're going to focus in on and

697
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:27,450
then the guidelines talk about the different ways in which you're going to critique it.

698
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:33,540
So there's, I think, six different sections, and so you'll go over in detail about that.

699
01:16:33,660 --> 01:16:41,220
Now, one thing about this assignment and you'll find out in this class in general is I don't like a lot of extra [INAUDIBLE],

700
01:16:42,120 --> 01:16:47,490
so I want you to get to the point. So you will be writing your responses and bullet points.

701
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:52,050
I don't want a bunch of fluff and trying to make things sound flowery and get to the next point.

702
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:57,450
And, you know, having transition sentences, those are beautiful when you're writing prose or other things.

703
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:02,430
But I just want to see where your brain is. So there's an example.

704
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:07,980
I think I put an example on there of what the assignment looks like, how it should be structure, how it should be set up.

705
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:15,300
We give you, like you said, six different articles that you can hopefully find some something that excites you.

706
01:17:15,660 --> 01:17:20,790
But if you don't like any of those six and you want to propose another article,

707
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:28,320
just shoot me an email, give me a copy of the article, and if it's appropriate, you can do it.

708
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:34,229
Any questions on that assignment? Do I know off the top of the head when it's due?

709
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:38,610
I should know that by 29. Yeah, that sounds appropriate.

710
01:17:38,610 --> 01:17:42,300
Yes. We'll say September 29. That's what it was in my head.

711
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:46,830
It was at the end of the month. But I want to just make sure people are aware that that is coming up.

712
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:52,020
Also, next class, you do need to submit your learning agreement.

713
01:17:52,020 --> 01:17:57,750
So the learning agreement is basically just giving us a little more information about who you are, what you want to get out of the class.

714
01:17:58,950 --> 01:18:07,170
I think it says on the syllabus submitted by the beginning in class you can have until midnight to submit it because we used to do it in paper form,

715
01:18:07,530 --> 01:18:13,920
but it's all going to be electronic. So if you can get it done by midday, that's cool.

716
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:21,030
Any questions? Oh, for people who wanted a book but didn't get what I ordered more.

717
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:24,780
And so they're supposed to be coming in. Tomorrow's okay, I'll have some more books.

718
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:32,790
But all the all the Apollo four readings are in electronic format.

719
01:18:33,150 --> 01:18:41,910
One thing I would say, if you haven't done any readings yet for this week, focus more on that to one than two readings outside of prayer.

720
01:18:41,910 --> 01:18:45,870
So there's like one on, I think, white privilege and one on power.

721
01:18:45,870 --> 01:18:49,290
Focus on those before you do the prayer, if you haven't read them.

722
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:51,570
All right. Have a good rest of your day.
