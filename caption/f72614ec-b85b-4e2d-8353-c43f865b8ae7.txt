1
00:00:00,337 --> 00:00:05,709
[MUSIC]

2
00:00:05,709 --> 00:00:09,026
So once we've identified
an environmental health hazard,

3
00:00:09,026 --> 00:00:13,253
it becomes incumbent on us to address that
hazard if it turns out to be exposing

4
00:00:13,253 --> 00:00:15,950
people to unsafe levels of that hazard.

5
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,710
We use something called the hierarchy
of controls to determine

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:22,650
what actions we'll take to
address an environmental hazard.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,920
That's kind of a fancy word for a way for
us to prioritize the different approaches

8
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:30,310
that we could take to reduce
exposures to a particular hazard.

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,410
I'm gonna walk you through the hierarchy
of controls over the next few minutes, but

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:37,830
I just want to introduce the general
levels of this hierarchy or

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,740
ladder as you might think of it.

12
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:44,400
The first thing we want to do in terms of
controlling an exposure is to eliminate it

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,530
If we possibly can, or
substitute it if we can't.

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,400
We'll talk about that again in a moment.

15
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,030
If we can't do that, we have options
such as engineering controls,

16
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:57,490
meaning changing the environment in
some fashion to reduce exposures.

17
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:00,910
If those things don't work,
then we can do what we call warnings or

18
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:02,930
education for people.

19
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:07,740
And last and least, we can ask people
to wear personal protective equipment.

20
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,730
So I'm gonna dive into each of
these in a little more detail now.

21
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,060
When I mentioned elimination or
substitution,

22
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:17,120
this truly is the first thing that we want
to try to do if we have an environmental

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,400
hazard at an unacceptable level.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,189
So for example, if we can pass a policy
and outright ban an environmental health

25
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:28,061
hazard, that's absolutely the best
thing we possibly can do.

26
00:01:28,061 --> 00:01:29,502
It sounds ambitious, but

27
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:33,707
in fact we have some great examples from
history on us having done just that.

28
00:01:33,707 --> 00:01:37,174
So for example,
we no longer have lead in gasoline.

29
00:01:37,174 --> 00:01:39,815
We no longer have lead in house paint.

30
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:43,225
We no longer have asbestos
in construction materials.

31
00:01:43,225 --> 00:01:46,185
We absolutely know that lead and
asbestos are bad for us.

32
00:01:46,185 --> 00:01:50,025
And they're so bad, in fact, that we've
decided to simply ban products that

33
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:54,720
contain those elements,
those substances, for use in America.

34
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,270
So elimination is great, unfortunately,
it's not always possible.

35
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,970
And when it's not, sometimes we
have the option of substitution.

36
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,610
For example, if there's another chemical
that we could use to substitute for

37
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:10,540
a really dangerous chemical that's still
not very good for us, but is not as bad

38
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:14,130
as the original chemical, that's
still a step in the right direction.

39
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,610
So many of you may remember a few years
ago, there were situations where we

40
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:24,360
identified baby bottles as having been
made using a chemical called bisphenol-A.

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,020
And it turns out, bisphenol-A is what's
called an endocrine disruptor, and might

42
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,090
actually have some reproductive effects on
this very vulnerable population, babies.

43
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,280
Manufacturers decided to find
an alternative chemical.

44
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,920
And in fact,
bisphenol-A is largely not used anymore.

45
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,016
They have substituted
a chemical called bisphenol-S.

46
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:46,290
Is bisphenol-S good for us?

47
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:49,290
Probably not, but is it better for
us than bisphenol-A?

48
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,040
Yes.

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,300
So that's an example of
a substation that was effective.

50
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,540
If we can't eliminate or

51
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,400
substitute a hazard, the next option we
have is what we call engineering controls.

52
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,850
And so this would be again
a change to the environment,

53
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:07,820
a change to a behavior or activity
that reduces a person's exposure, or

54
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:12,140
reduces the likelihood that the hazard
will spread through the environment.

55
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,310
So you see examples of this all the time.

56
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:18,700
If you've ever work in a laboratory, the
fume hood in that laboratory is designed

57
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,240
to suck chemicals away so
you don't breathe them in directly.

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,160
That's an engineering control.

59
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,780
Anytime you ride in a car or a bus or

60
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:31,320
out in a motorcycle, the noise levels from
that vehicle are substantially reduced by

61
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,490
the muffler that's installed and
the muffler's only job is to reduce noise.

62
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,630
If you've been in a medical or health care
facility and you've seen what's called

63
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,420
a sharps container, a way for people to
safely dispose of needles and scalpels.

64
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,740
That's an engineering control,
a way to isolate people from that hazard.

65
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,340
And if you've ever driven by a nuclear
plant, the giant concrete dome around

66
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,060
a nuclear reactor is very
much an engineering control,

67
00:03:55,060 --> 00:04:00,070
designed to keep the radiation in and
us safe on the outside.

68
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,340
Sometimes engineering
controls are not enough.

69
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,090
And in those events we can also introduce
what we call warnings or education.

70
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,620
These are things that are designed to
educate people on how to behave in

71
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:13,440
the event that they're exposed
to a particular hazard.

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,390
So if you catch fire,
most of you will know the three words.

73
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,710
Stop, drop, and roll,

74
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,550
that's an educational campaign
that's been drummed into most of us.

75
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:25,150
You may also notice when you check the
weather on your app or on the computer or

76
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,490
the television, often times you
will see not just the weather, but

77
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,470
an air quality index
reported by the government.

78
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:34,930
This is the way for
the government to summarize the conditions

79
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,940
regarding air pollution that day,
and to educate you and

80
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:42,740
inform you as to whether the day is safe
for everybody to go out and exercise.

81
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:47,280
Or the air pollution might actually be
unsafe for certain vulnerable people or

82
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,650
maybe unsafe for
most people to go out and exercise.

83
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,560
These are all ways that
we can educate again and

84
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,120
warn the public to allow them to modify
their behavior and reduce their exposures.

85
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,500
Now sometimes all of those
approaches are still not enough and

86
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,010
in those events we have to implement what
we call personal protective equipment.

87
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,100
And this is things like safety glasses and
ear plugs and

88
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,510
hard hats and steel toed boots.

89
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,480
And that's not to say that
these things don't work,

90
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,430
they can be incredible effective
when they're worn correctly.

91
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:22,510
But the reason this our last approach is
anytime we're asking someone to change

92
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:27,300
their behavior and wear something that is
very often uncomfortable, we are asking

93
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,180
them to do something that requires
them to understand when to wear this,

94
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,780
how to wear it correctly,
how to take care of it.

95
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,000
We're putting the burden on
the person to protect themselves, and

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,770
that's why this is always
the last approach.

97
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,910
If we can not put the burden on the person
and eliminate the exposure in the first

98
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,840
place, that's always a preferable solution
to wearing personal protective equipment.

99
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,550
That said, sometimes the use of earplugs
and other personal protective equipment

100
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:57,566
is absolutely essentially to keep
people safe from environmental hazards.
