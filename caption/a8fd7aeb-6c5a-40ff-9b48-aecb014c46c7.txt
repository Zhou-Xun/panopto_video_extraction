1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,029
Exactly, am starting the recording.

2
00:00:03,029 --> 00:00:03,759
>> I'll stop talking.

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:05,973
>> No, it's okay, you can talk about whatever you want.

4
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:09,445
>> [CROSSTALK] >> No, this was like a year or so ago.

5
00:00:09,445 --> 00:00:09,935
[LAUGH].

6
00:00:09,935 --> 00:00:12,232
>> But it was during the module.

7
00:00:12,232 --> 00:00:17,113
But it was during one of the class exercises.

8
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:17,913
He was young, he's eight now.

9
00:00:17,913 --> 00:00:20,051
I think we could probably handle it.

10
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:21,928
But he was like five at the time.

11
00:00:21,928 --> 00:00:23,018
And I was like.

12
00:00:23,018 --> 00:00:23,292
>> Like mine.

13
00:00:23,292 --> 00:00:28,351
>> Here's

14
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:35,581
your iPad.

15
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:41,174
>> [CROSSTALK] >> You need to go back to the other.

16
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:45,645
I do, it should be in the downloads folder, I think.

17
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:46,392
You don't have to read.

18
00:00:46,392 --> 00:00:46,442
>> It's okay.

19
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:47,402
>> I'm right here anyway.

20
00:00:47,402 --> 00:00:49,700
>> Sorry.

21
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:59,700
>> [CROSSTALK]

22
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:11,081
>> I think so.

23
00:01:11,081 --> 00:01:12,965
>> Yeah.

24
00:01:12,965 --> 00:01:17,518
>> [CROSSTALK].

25
00:01:17,518 --> 00:01:17,644
>> Okay.

26
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:18,747
>> These are both here.

27
00:01:18,747 --> 00:01:18,883
>> Okay, thank you.

28
00:01:18,883 --> 00:01:21,769
>> Just give me a couple of minutes.

29
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:25,550
>> Yeah, do you need this for the couple of minutes?

30
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:25,600
>> No.

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,506
>> Okay, I'll find my slide then.

32
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:28,235
>> You'll what?

33
00:01:28,235 --> 00:01:29,373
>> I'll find my place.

34
00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:35,013
>> [CROSSTALK] >> Okay,

35
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:39,388
let's go ahead

36
00:01:39,388 --> 00:01:44,444
and get started.

37
00:01:44,444 --> 00:01:49,576
If you haven't, like I said, looked at your exam, you could

38
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:54,927
look at them up here, please remember though to turn it back in.

39
00:01:54,927 --> 00:01:57,104
So when you're done looking at it now, you

40
00:01:57,104 --> 00:01:59,289
could even come and walk it over to me here.

41
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:01,572
So you don't forget and put it in your backpack.

42
00:02:01,572 --> 00:02:05,122
Like I announced last time, if you wanna talk

43
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:08,213
to me at all about your score, you can.

44
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:12,589
I know that it was challenging for some people, I'd like to hear why.

45
00:02:12,589 --> 00:02:16,998
If you wanna talk about it, we can talk about it, just send me an email.

46
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:21,031
I am going to, at the request of someone, I think it might

47
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:25,581
help to put up the study guide a little bit earlier for the final.

48
00:02:25,581 --> 00:02:27,618
So, I'm gonna work on that now.

49
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:30,474
And hopefully post that by the end of class.

50
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,621
So that you sort of have that as you go along.

51
00:02:32,621 --> 00:02:34,456
Hopefully, that will be helpful.

52
00:02:34,456 --> 00:02:42,400
Problem set for, originally due on the 26th, before thanksgiving.

53
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,456
I'm gonna just extend that a week so you can turn it in on

54
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:49,720
the 26th, or you can turn it in on December 3rd, whatever works for you.

55
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,784
You can, that's like one of those ones where

56
00:02:52,784 --> 00:02:55,696
you can work in groups of upto four people.

57
00:02:55,696 --> 00:02:57,431
So that should be fine.

58
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:01,525
This week we have, Alison's gonna finish your electronic cancer,

59
00:03:01,525 --> 00:03:05,912
and then on Tuesday, I'll do epigenetics, then we have thanksgiving.

60
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:09,552
And then the following Tuesday we have sort of a follow up epigenetics

61
00:03:09,552 --> 00:03:11,625
focusing more on epigenetics of cancer

62
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:14,479
and epigenetic treatments, which is getting cool.

63
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,012
So some pharma code genomics stuff.

64
00:03:19,012 --> 00:03:21,881
Is there anything else people need right now?

65
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:23,582
Yeah.

66
00:03:23,582 --> 00:03:26,126
>> Final homework still can be worked in groups, right?

67
00:03:26,126 --> 00:03:28,122
>> The final homework can be worked in groups.

68
00:03:28,122 --> 00:03:30,220
Yep, up to four people on problem set four,

69
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,446
just like we did for the initial problem sets.

70
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:37,235
Yeah, and I would suggest and prefer if you wanna do it that way.

71
00:03:37,235 --> 00:03:37,520
>> Okay.

72
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,334
>> [INAUDIBLE]

73
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:43,057
>> The day of the final is the last day of class, which is Tuesday qualify.

74
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,256
So it's in class.

75
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:49,186
So you don't have something during your final exam days.

76
00:03:49,186 --> 00:03:53,380
The final will not be comprehensive, the final is gonna be

77
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:58,103
just focused on this last little piece since our exam two, okay?

78
00:03:58,103 --> 00:03:58,688
And it'll be similar.

79
00:03:58,688 --> 00:04:03,116
And, like I said, I'll post a study guide as soon as possible.

80
00:04:03,116 --> 00:04:04,534
Okay, other things?

81
00:04:04,534 --> 00:04:07,930
Okay, you don't have that.

82
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,098
I'm sorry.

83
00:04:09,098 --> 00:04:10,853
>> No, I was trying to forget, this one.

84
00:04:10,853 --> 00:04:11,540
>> Is my bad.

85
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,891
This one will go on to you.

86
00:04:14,891 --> 00:04:16,712
Wait a second, no, it's coming.

87
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:17,315
>> Okay.

88
00:04:17,315 --> 00:04:18,135
>> Sorry-.

89
00:04:18,135 --> 00:04:20,789
>> No, no, no it's fine.

90
00:04:20,789 --> 00:04:21,985
>> Hold on.

91
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:23,235
>> I got it.

92
00:04:23,235 --> 00:04:24,259
>> [CROSSTALK].

93
00:04:24,259 --> 00:04:29,150
>> Wait, that's the thing that always screws me up every time.

94
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:33,963
Look you guys, it's the end of the semester I finally figured it out.

95
00:04:33,963 --> 00:04:34,893
>> It's coming.

96
00:04:34,893 --> 00:04:36,866
No, it's not, tired.

97
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:40,601
That one's been giving me trouble all year, honestly.

98
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:44,566
When I had my GSI whose PHD student was lecturing

99
00:04:44,566 --> 00:04:49,342
in 643 at the end, and poor guy had worked perfectly.

100
00:04:49,342 --> 00:04:52,325
But then, of course, the new person is giving their lecture.

101
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,373
And suddenly the screen just decided it

102
00:04:54,373 --> 00:04:57,178
didn't wanna work, it was cutting everything off.

103
00:04:57,178 --> 00:05:00,369
It was the weirdest thing.

104
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:01,851
>> [INAUDIBLE]

105
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:09,333
>> All right, you work on that, everybody has to look over here, sorry.

106
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,689
You guys see, okay?

107
00:05:10,689 --> 00:05:11,450
Reasonably?

108
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:15,915
All right, so, last time we ended up with this idea of,

109
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:20,579
we had talked about sort of the normal functions of a cell.

110
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:23,563
And then how those go wrong in cancer.

111
00:05:23,563 --> 00:05:26,011
And we had ended up with this idea of

112
00:05:26,011 --> 00:05:30,916
these sort of different levels of genetic susceptibility, right?

113
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:33,240
So there's sort of, you imagine the general

114
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,251
population is here, most folks fall into this category.

115
00:05:36,251 --> 00:05:39,050
There are some who are resistant, who have some

116
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:43,255
lucky genetics that make them resistant to environmental exposures.

117
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:47,044
There are some people here who are more susceptible to environmental exposures.

118
00:05:47,044 --> 00:05:49,810
And these are the hereditary syndromes that we're gonna talk about later today.

119
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:52,647
So, really, with these hereditary syndromes,

120
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:54,546
the role of exposure is minimal.

121
00:05:54,546 --> 00:05:58,657
Because they already have such a high genetic predisposition that they

122
00:05:58,657 --> 00:06:03,123
almost don't need any real environmental exposures in order to get cancer.

123
00:06:03,123 --> 00:06:07,188
These susceptible people, it takes less exposure to give them the same

124
00:06:07,188 --> 00:06:11,882
cancer risk as someone in the general population, or someone who's resistant.

125
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:15,824
But it still requires exposure in order to give them cancer.

126
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:19,164
Let me talk a little bit about an example of this.

127
00:06:19,164 --> 00:06:21,242
This is going to be in contrast to

128
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:25,102
the hereditary syndromes that we're talking about next.

129
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:28,763
Okay, so this is an example of a genetic susceptibility.

130
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,636
So this is looking at smoking intensity as

131
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:35,423
measured by the average number of cigarettes per day.

132
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:36,876
That's okay.

133
00:06:36,876 --> 00:06:42,430
>> [INAUDIBLE] >> You wanna call the folks?

134
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,670
>> Thank you, am sorry.

135
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:48,376
>> Wait, no, now it's making happy noises.

136
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:50,657
I'll wait a second, it just- >> All right.

137
00:06:50,657 --> 00:06:51,364
It's going on.

138
00:06:51,364 --> 00:06:51,773
>> So- >> Red things.

139
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:51,886
>> Yeah.

140
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:55,569
Mm-hm, okay, so, again, this is looking at the risk of

141
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:00,174
bladder cancer by smoking intensity is measured by cigarettes per day.

142
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:03,024
And, as we said last time, I think cigarette smoking is

143
00:07:03,024 --> 00:07:06,435
the main risk factor for bladder cancer, particularly in the US.

144
00:07:06,435 --> 00:07:08,930
And so you should see a nice dose response where

145
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:12,844
essentially more cigarettes per day increased risk of bladder cancer.

146
00:07:12,844 --> 00:07:17,751
And here it's been stratified by NAT2 genotype, okay?

147
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:23,758
NAT2 is this enzyme that detoxifies essentially these aldimines, all right?

148
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:27,704
So you can get these from tobacco or dyes, for example.

149
00:07:27,704 --> 00:07:30,790
So, dyes that are used in textile manufacturing,

150
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,116
is an occupational exposure that's associated with bladder cancer.

151
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:37,381
So, these aldimines means are really kind of

152
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:39,956
the chemical that we think causes bladder cancer.

153
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,840
And, so, it can kinda go two ways.

154
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,628
It can be activated when you take

155
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:46,876
these aldimines into your body, usually through tobacco

156
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:51,800
smoking, they can either be activated by SIP 1 A2, which goes through this pathway.

157
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,520
And ends up causing DNA adducts and mutations and malignant transformation.

158
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,032
Or it can be detoxified by the NAT2 protein

159
00:08:00,032 --> 00:08:04,432
enzyme, which is encoded for by the NAT 2 genotype.

160
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:07,204
And then be excreted without causing

161
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:11,417
DNA adducts, and, therefore, potentially cancer.

162
00:08:11,417 --> 00:08:17,810
So, there are several different types of this NAT 2 gene, but essentially some

163
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,934
genotypes make you a slow acetylator, and some make you a rapid acetylator.

164
00:08:23,934 --> 00:08:25,796
Okay, so if you're a rapid acetylator,

165
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,986
quickly, these things move down this pathway.

166
00:08:27,986 --> 00:08:31,850
And they don't have the opportunity so much to go down this pathway, right?

167
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,706
So, you would think that being a rapid

168
00:08:33,706 --> 00:08:36,490
acetylator later would protect you from cigarette smoke

169
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:39,216
exposure, say, whereas being a slow acetylator means

170
00:08:39,216 --> 00:08:41,367
that doesn't go down this path is quickly.

171
00:08:41,367 --> 00:08:44,571
So then, has more opportunity to go down the activation pathway and cause cancer.

172
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:47,843
All right, and that's in fact exactly what you see.

173
00:08:47,843 --> 00:08:50,972
In the dark blue here, you see the slowest acetylators, right?

174
00:08:50,972 --> 00:08:54,244
So those are the people who would be more likely to go down this pathway.

175
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:56,885
And in fact, the more cigarettes they smoke,

176
00:08:56,885 --> 00:08:59,264
the more risk they have a bladder cancer.

177
00:08:59,264 --> 00:09:02,142
And that is a statistically significant increased risk.

178
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:06,810
The light blue here, these are those rapid or intermediate acetylators.

179
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,000
And, so, they are kind of going down this pathway more than this one.

180
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,698
And so even if they smoke more, their their risk

181
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:18,224
or odds ratio of bladder cancer just never become statistically significant.

182
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,472
It does appear to increase a little bit, but certainly

183
00:09:21,472 --> 00:09:24,585
not to the level that the slow acetylators do [COUGH].

184
00:09:24,585 --> 00:09:26,869
>> Why does it decrease as you increase the [INAUDIBLE].

185
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:30,157
>> I think that's an artifact, I think there's just a few people out here.

186
00:09:30,157 --> 00:09:32,559
If you look at the point estimate does decrease

187
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:35,586
a bit, but the confidence intervals overlap quite a bit.

188
00:09:35,586 --> 00:09:38,597
So there is the opportunity that the truth is actually a bit higher.

189
00:09:38,597 --> 00:09:42,405
And I just think it could also be that the people

190
00:09:42,405 --> 00:09:47,396
who are way out here at you could have competing risks issue.

191
00:09:47,396 --> 00:09:49,887
People who are smoking that heavily could have been more likely

192
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:53,094
to die of cardiovascular disease before they get bladder cancer, for example.

193
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:58,719
So, I don't think that's a meaningful biologic thing.

194
00:09:58,719 --> 00:09:59,162
>> All right.

195
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:00,417
>> If that makes sense.

196
00:10:00,417 --> 00:10:02,537
>> We can't get this fixed now [LAUGH].

197
00:10:02,537 --> 00:10:05,531
So, I don't know if anybody wants to move over there.

198
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,803
And also- Yeah, feel free to move, if it would help you.

199
00:10:07,803 --> 00:10:09,458
>> Yeah, and I'll also post the slides.

200
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:13,250
I know they're not on our canvas, but I'll post them right now into canvas.

201
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,940
So, if you have your laptop, you can follow along with that.

202
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,440
Or if you wanna move over there, I'm sorry.

203
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,689
>> All right, nice.

204
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:22,790
Technology.

205
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:25,487
Okay, so, does that make sense?

206
00:10:25,487 --> 00:10:28,051
So this is an example of sort of a gene environment interaction.

207
00:10:28,051 --> 00:10:30,842
And that's really kind of what these susceptible things are.

208
00:10:30,842 --> 00:10:34,290
These kinds of genetic changes that make you more susceptible to cancer.

209
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,405
That's an example of those slow escalators, maybe

210
00:10:36,405 --> 00:10:39,153
the intermediate accelerators, kind of the general population.

211
00:10:39,153 --> 00:10:41,922
The rapid oscillators are a bit resistant, right?

212
00:10:41,922 --> 00:10:46,580
So this is sort of like genetic variation, that's not super uncommon.

213
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,858
It's not like a really deleterious mutation, like

214
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:51,615
we're gonna see causing these hereditary cancer syndromes.

215
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:55,768
Someone here might be a person who has like a family history of

216
00:10:55,768 --> 00:11:01,077
cancer, but not like a true familial cancer syndrome, if that makes sense.

217
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,610
And we're gonna kind of differentiate between those as we go on.

218
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,837
Does that make sense to everybody?

219
00:11:06,837 --> 00:11:07,337
Okay.

220
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,567
So this is just a little bit of a history

221
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:15,779
of how we've kind of approached the genetics of cancer susceptibility.

222
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:18,361
And I think this is essentially how we've

223
00:11:18,361 --> 00:11:22,141
approached the genetics of insert chronic condition here.

224
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:24,974
So back in the 1980s, we were doing linkage mapping.

225
00:11:24,974 --> 00:11:29,302
In the 90s, we did some Canada Gene Studies, which is more like, hey, I

226
00:11:29,302 --> 00:11:31,157
know what this gene does, and it

227
00:11:31,157 --> 00:11:34,064
does something that may be important for cancer.

228
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:37,709
So I'm gonna look at this gene in relation to risk of cancer, right?

229
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:38,743
Hypothesis driven.

230
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:42,456
Then we came up with the ability to use these snip chips,

231
00:11:42,456 --> 00:11:47,208
and to really measure the whole genome in the early to mid-2000s.

232
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:51,432
And, so, people started using genome wide approaches, which I know you kind

233
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:55,082
of learned, I heard then telling you the last of last time, right?

234
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:58,160
So then it was this agnostic idea.

235
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,630
I don't know what these genes are.

236
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:02,924
I don't know what they do, but maybe I'm not as smart as I thought I was.

237
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:05,215
So I'm just gonna look at everything and see if something I

238
00:12:05,215 --> 00:12:07,666
never thought of before pops up to the top of the list, right?

239
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,608
And gives me some clues.

240
00:12:09,608 --> 00:12:13,579
And now we're moving toward next generation sequencing, XOM, and whole

241
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,692
genome sequencing, common disease rear variants, and that kind of thing.

242
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:23,499
So these guys up here, we're gonna talk about several of these today.

243
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:27,973
These are those cancer predisposition syndromes, those hereditary

244
00:12:27,973 --> 00:12:31,471
cancer syndromes that we're gonna talk about today.

245
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:32,680
And these are some of the things that

246
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,422
we found out about in those early studies, right?

247
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:37,261
Kind of the low hanging fruit, they really increase cancer

248
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:40,679
risk in families, but they're quite rare in the general population.

249
00:12:40,679 --> 00:12:43,108
So this, you can see, this is the population frequency.

250
00:12:43,108 --> 00:12:45,614
These things are very rare, these things are very common.

251
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:47,407
And here you have the effect size, right?

252
00:12:47,407 --> 00:12:50,212
So, here they are really increase your risk for cancer if you

253
00:12:50,212 --> 00:12:54,123
have a change in these genes, whereas down here they're lower penetrates, okay?

254
00:12:54,123 --> 00:12:57,907
And so then we started maybe finding out about these things over here.

255
00:12:57,907 --> 00:13:00,683
These moderate penetrates risk alleles maybe some of

256
00:13:00,683 --> 00:13:03,774
those were hypothesis driven Canada Gene Study Findings.

257
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:06,742
And now we're really finding these things with GWAS, right.

258
00:13:06,742 --> 00:13:09,592
These things are fairly common in the population,

259
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:12,119
and increase the risk of cancer a little bit.

260
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:17,677
Next, we're really trying to fill in this area, right?

261
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:19,842
So this is kind of where a lot of that

262
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:23,520
next gen sequencing and stuff is really trying to fill in.

263
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,778
Because you just need way more people to find things

264
00:13:26,778 --> 00:13:31,410
that are essentially rare exposures with modest effect sizes, right?

265
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,861
So the rarer your exposure and the less strong your effect size is just

266
00:13:34,861 --> 00:13:37,242
from doing sample size calculations, you know

267
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:39,524
that you're gonna need a really big sample.

268
00:13:39,524 --> 00:13:44,164
And, so, we're kinda trying to move into this spaces where we're headed now.

269
00:13:44,164 --> 00:13:47,797
All right, so, I have some examples in here from my

270
00:13:47,797 --> 00:13:52,033
work, of things that I have done with genetics and cancer.

271
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:54,250
It's kind of interesting, I think, because I

272
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,365
am not a genetic epidemiologist, I'm a cancer epidemiologist.

273
00:13:57,365 --> 00:14:00,845
But if you're a cancer epidemiologist, you have to be

274
00:14:00,845 --> 00:14:04,261
willing to dabble and get into genetics a little bit.

275
00:14:04,261 --> 00:14:09,368
So, this is sort of an example of what people who aren't immersed in

276
00:14:09,368 --> 00:14:14,851
genetic epidemiology are kind of doing with genetics and disease risk.

277
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:16,758
Unfortunately, I think for the sake of time, I

278
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:18,484
don't have time to go through all of this.

279
00:14:18,484 --> 00:14:24,612
But you have some papers that discuss these findings and also you can see, if

280
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:28,060
something is really interesting to you, I

281
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:32,200
think I have the abbreviated reference down here.

282
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,742
So if you guys are really interested in any of this stuff, and

283
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:39,712
you wanna talk to me about it, I'm totally open to you emailing me.

284
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:43,096
Or setting up a meeting, we can chat about it further, okay?

285
00:14:43,096 --> 00:14:47,029
So, before we move on to inherited cancers, are there any questions?

286
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:56,271
Okay, so we're gonna talk.

287
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:58,012
This is our outline, I'm not gonna go over it.

288
00:14:58,012 --> 00:14:59,210
Well, we'll get there.

289
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,220
All right, so I want to mention first that cancer is determined by the joint

290
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,561
effects of multiple genes which is called the

291
00:15:06,561 --> 00:15:10,275
polygenic effect and their interaction with environmental factors.

292
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:12,891
Which really is similar to other chronic diseases, okay.

293
00:15:12,891 --> 00:15:15,397
And that's the normal model of how this works.

294
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:19,729
And as we talked about last time you have normal cells that then acquire some

295
00:15:19,729 --> 00:15:22,273
sort of first mutation, which makes it more

296
00:15:22,273 --> 00:15:25,538
likely that they will then acquire further mutations.

297
00:15:25,538 --> 00:15:28,763
And the consensus is that it's probably four to seven

298
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:32,427
mutations that you really need in order to get frank cancer.

299
00:15:32,427 --> 00:15:35,959
What we're gonna be talking about today are people who

300
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:39,890
are born with, so these are all somatic mutations, right?

301
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:41,276
Have you guys heard that term?

302
00:15:41,276 --> 00:15:43,921
So this is in the cancer tissue that these are happening.

303
00:15:43,921 --> 00:15:45,144
So the rest of the cells in the body

304
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:47,255
all are normal and don't have these mutations, right?

305
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:48,726
It's just at the side of the cancer they

306
00:15:48,726 --> 00:15:51,011
start to acquire these mutations and therefore get a tumor.

307
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,722
What we're gonna talk about today are people who have these

308
00:15:55,722 --> 00:16:00,112
familial cancer syndromes, that are generally inherited and run in families.

309
00:16:00,112 --> 00:16:05,219
And they're born with this first mutation in a key cancer related gene.

310
00:16:05,219 --> 00:16:08,704
So all of the cells in their body have this mutation and

311
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:13,595
therefore can go on to acquire further mutations and cause cancer, okay?

312
00:16:16,966 --> 00:16:20,273
So this is the difference here, this acquired mutation is

313
00:16:20,273 --> 00:16:24,192
what we're talking about for most cancers, you have normal cells.

314
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:28,153
There's still a population of normal cells, some mutation occurs and then you

315
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:31,357
can have altered cells that lead to a tumor at the somatic level.

316
00:16:31,357 --> 00:16:35,082
But with hereditary mutations, either you're inheriting it

317
00:16:35,082 --> 00:16:38,173
from a parent or when conception occurs, there's a

318
00:16:38,173 --> 00:16:41,405
mutation in the fertilized egg that then is propagated

319
00:16:41,405 --> 00:16:46,790
throughout the body and all of the cells, Okay?

320
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:50,153
So germline mutations occur with a frequency less than 1%, so

321
00:16:50,153 --> 00:16:53,845
a very small fraction of DNA sequence variation within a population.

322
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:58,620
The vast majority of variations are due to genetic polymorphisms.

323
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:06,250
So these SNPs or multiple STR or microsatellites are much more common.

324
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,843
So this is a little bit of semantics and I'm sure you guys have

325
00:17:09,843 --> 00:17:14,783
gotten into SNPs versus mutations or what makes something a mutation versus a SNP?

326
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:22,538
And SNPs are changes, differences in the genetic code across individuals, right?

327
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:26,928
Usually they're not disease causing, right?

328
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:30,314
We kind of tend to call something a mutation when it's

329
00:17:30,314 --> 00:17:34,550
rare and also that change causes some sort of deleterious effect.

330
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,953
Is that what you had said, more or less?

331
00:17:35,953 --> 00:17:44,139
>> Yeah, I don't think that [INAUDIBLE] [CROSSTALK]

332
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:46,716
>> Yeah, >> Always related to these things.

333
00:17:46,716 --> 00:17:49,351
>> And it isn't precise, is the thing, right?

334
00:17:49,351 --> 00:17:51,898
Where is the cut off where you call something a

335
00:17:51,898 --> 00:17:55,940
mutation versus a SNP or polymorphism, it's a little bit confusing.

336
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:59,185
But when you read these papers, frequently when people are talking about

337
00:17:59,185 --> 00:18:01,123
these hereditary cancer syndromes that are

338
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:03,813
really deleterious, they'll talk about gene mutations.

339
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:06,056
And when they're talking about some of these

340
00:18:06,056 --> 00:18:08,831
DNA studies where they've looked at genetic variation

341
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:11,015
and a slight increased risk of cancer versus

342
00:18:11,015 --> 00:18:13,511
not, they'll use the term SNP or polymorphism.

343
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:17,324
So just to kind of orient you if you're reading these papers, it's a

344
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:21,557
little bit fuzzy and murky, but that's kind of how people use those words.

345
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:26,116
Okay, so I'm sure you guys have all talked about Mendelian inheritance

346
00:18:26,116 --> 00:18:28,746
a bit if not you talked about it in high school biology.

347
00:18:28,746 --> 00:18:32,069
But the idea is that Mendelian inheritance is determined by a

348
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:36,250
single gene, it follows these dominant, recessive or sex linked models.

349
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,899
Autosomal dominant disorders occur at a

350
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:39,888
higher frequency than recessive within a family

351
00:18:39,888 --> 00:18:42,758
because one bad copy of the gene is sufficient to give you the disease.

352
00:18:45,636 --> 00:18:48,661
For autosomal dominant inheritance of all affected individuals

353
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:50,641
have at least one affected parent and about

354
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:52,731
50% of the offspring are affected when one

355
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,769
parent is affected and the other is normal.

356
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,820
An autosomal recessive diseases occur in individuals who are

357
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,939
homozygous for the defective gene meaning they probably got.

358
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:05,460
Usually they would have two unaffected parents,each who are carrier

359
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:08,763
and then they would get the disease that way [COUGH].

360
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:11,398
So, in this case this is the dominant

361
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:16,247
inheritance where the father is affected, the mother's normal.

362
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:19,027
So the father isn't affected cuz he has this

363
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:21,808
one bad gene in red and then essentially what

364
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:24,439
happens is that 50% of the kids have one

365
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:27,696
bad gene on average and therefore get the disease.

366
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:31,297
Recessive on the other hand, if you have two parents each of whom is not

367
00:19:31,297 --> 00:19:35,712
affected but as a carrier, then about 25% of the offspring will have the disease.

368
00:19:37,771 --> 00:19:38,319
Okay,

369
00:19:41,517 --> 00:19:45,563
So, now I wanna talk briefly about Knudson's Two

370
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:50,200
Hit Model and this was published by Knudson in 1971.

371
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:54,691
Retinoblastoma or RB1 on chromosome 13 is an important tumor suppressor gene.

372
00:19:54,691 --> 00:19:56,737
With one affected parent about 50% of

373
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,280
children inherit one copy of the defective gene.

374
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,000
The tumor will not occur until a second

375
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,041
copy is mutated, cuz remember I told you that

376
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:04,976
the tumor suppressor genes you have to have

377
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:07,090
two bad copies in order to get cancer, right?

378
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,130
So these people inherit one bad copy from a parent and then a second

379
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:16,213
copy becomes mutated or deleted in somatic cells as a result of whatever, right?

380
00:20:16,213 --> 00:20:23,561
Environmental exposure, chance event, whatever it is and then they get cancer.

381
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:28,646
So, this may seem confusing because I told you that most of these things

382
00:20:28,646 --> 00:20:33,758
are inherited in an autosomal dominant way, these cancer syndromes.

383
00:20:33,758 --> 00:20:36,630
But I now have told you that you have to lose two copies

384
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:40,623
in order to get the disease which sounds like a recessive trait, right?

385
00:20:40,623 --> 00:20:44,193
So this is confusing when you read the literature or at least it was to me

386
00:20:44,193 --> 00:20:48,204
when I started reading the literature and so I wanted to make this point to you.

387
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:50,635
A lot of times people will talk about these inherited

388
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:54,181
cancer syndromes and tumor suppressor genes as being autosomal dominant.

389
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:57,549
And what they mean by that is that they are fanatically autosomal dominant.

390
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,810
However, they are genotypically recessive.

391
00:21:00,810 --> 00:21:06,175
So if you just look at a pedigree and your disease is cancer, presuming people live

392
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:11,253
long enough and you have people who are living to adulthood in your pedigree.

393
00:21:11,253 --> 00:21:13,771
About half of the kids who have an

394
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:17,606
affected parent who had cancer will get cancer.

395
00:21:17,606 --> 00:21:22,431
So if you look at these things in a family pedigree, they appear to follow an

396
00:21:22,431 --> 00:21:26,033
autosomal dominant pattern, where when one parent has

397
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,888
cancer half the kids get the cancer, okay?

398
00:21:28,888 --> 00:21:31,632
Now, we could have looked at that back in

399
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:36,610
1971 when we didn't know about the genetics, right?

400
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:40,360
And we didn't know what was happening under the hood in terms of the genes.

401
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:43,363
Now we know that RB1 is a tumor suppressor gene and you

402
00:21:43,363 --> 00:21:46,789
actually have to lose both copies in order to get this tumor.

403
00:21:46,789 --> 00:21:48,911
And the kids are only inheriting one bad copy from

404
00:21:48,911 --> 00:21:51,850
parents so that second one gets lost at some point.

405
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:55,091
So that is a genetically recessive disease.

406
00:21:55,091 --> 00:21:56,610
Does that make sense to people?

407
00:21:56,610 --> 00:21:58,209
Yes.

408
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:01,218
>> Why exactly the second your losses, is it just chance?

409
00:22:01,218 --> 00:22:04,378
>> Chance or you're exposed to something, or any of

410
00:22:04,378 --> 00:22:08,151
the reasons that you get cancer in the first place, right?

411
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:11,506
Any of the reasons that these random, not random,

412
00:22:11,506 --> 00:22:16,202
what's the word I'm looking for, acquired cancers happen, right?

413
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:20,524
These sporadic cancers, as we call them, that aren't familialy related, right?

414
00:22:20,524 --> 00:22:25,341
So it can be you smoked, it can be any of those kinds of lifestyle factors.

415
00:22:25,341 --> 00:22:28,120
It can be environmental exposures cuz you live in a polluted area.

416
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,540
It can be chance because a mistake

417
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:34,612
happened when your cells were replicating and, yeah.

418
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:42,797
Okay, so this idea of typically autosomal dominant but genetically recessive, right?

419
00:22:42,797 --> 00:22:45,925
So just keep in mind many of these, if not most of

420
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:49,138
these, hereditary cancer syndromes are caused

421
00:22:49,138 --> 00:22:51,742
by changes in tumor suppressor genes.

422
00:22:51,742 --> 00:22:55,703
Where a child will inherit one bad copy of the tumor suppressor gene from

423
00:22:55,703 --> 00:22:57,419
a parent and lose the other copy

424
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,603
during their lifetime and therefore get cancer, okay?

425
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:04,430
But if you look at a pedigree, it looks like autosomal dominant.

426
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:08,198
Because coming here with that one bad copy, you're really likely

427
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:11,920
to lose that second copy and get cancer in your lifetime, right?

428
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,556
Just by living in the world as a human who's

429
00:23:13,556 --> 00:23:16,244
exposed to things in the world and having yourselves divide, right?

430
00:23:16,244 --> 00:23:19,423
So that is the answer, okay?

431
00:23:19,423 --> 00:23:22,656
So if you read about hereditary cancer syndromes and it says that it's an

432
00:23:22,656 --> 00:23:26,637
autosomal dominant, you'll be like, but I know that you have to lose both copies.

433
00:23:26,637 --> 00:23:28,953
And then you have to lose both copies and you're going, why are

434
00:23:28,953 --> 00:23:30,264
they saying that, that sounds like

435
00:23:30,264 --> 00:23:32,071
recessive and they just said that's dominant?

436
00:23:32,071 --> 00:23:34,427
So that's the disconnect there and I hope

437
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:36,789
that makes a little bit more sense [COUGH].

438
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:40,255
Okay, so back to RB, so the cancer that

439
00:23:40,255 --> 00:23:45,880
is caused when you lose the RB1 gene is retinoblastoma.

440
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,740
So this is a malignant tumor of the retina.

441
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:52,561
2/3 of these occur before age 2 and 95% occurred by the age of 5 years.

442
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:56,460
Approximately 1 in 15,000, so about 300 cases per year of this occur.

443
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,657
There's about an equal male to female ratio.

444
00:23:58,657 --> 00:24:03,238
There's been no change in the incidents in the past 40 years.

445
00:24:03,238 --> 00:24:05,825
Luukocoria is one of the symptoms which is this,

446
00:24:05,825 --> 00:24:07,915
when you look in the eye and it has this.

447
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:09,855
It can be hereditary or sporadic.

448
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:12,349
1 out of 3 occur in both eyes.

449
00:24:14,531 --> 00:24:17,331
So 40% are heritable.

450
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:19,872
So all cells and individual have the RB mutation

451
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:23,251
whereas about 60% are carrying mutations only in the eyes.

452
00:24:23,251 --> 00:24:26,240
So that means that it's somatic, right?

453
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,380
But they didn't come here with one inherit copy of the RB gene.

454
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,493
All right, so Knudson hypothesized in 1971 that two hits

455
00:24:34,493 --> 00:24:37,647
were needed for the retinoblastoma gene to cause a tumor.

456
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:40,383
With this occurring at the somatic level and the sporadic

457
00:24:40,383 --> 00:24:43,298
form while one hit is inherited in the familial form, okay?

458
00:24:43,298 --> 00:24:45,851
So he looked at the incidence of retinoblastoma in Children.

459
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:48,129
He compared the incidence in the inherited form which

460
00:24:48,129 --> 00:24:50,001
he was defining as that occurring in two eyes

461
00:24:50,001 --> 00:24:51,771
with that at the sporadic form which he was

462
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:53,919
defining as that which occurring in only one eye.

463
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,304
And he fitted a statistical model and the only

464
00:24:56,304 --> 00:24:59,084
plausible explanation was given by a two hit model.

465
00:24:59,084 --> 00:25:04,241
So this is his [COUGH] the dot, the circles and squares.

466
00:25:04,241 --> 00:25:07,084
The squares are the bilateral cases, the circles

467
00:25:07,084 --> 00:25:09,317
are the unilateral cases and this is his

468
00:25:09,317 --> 00:25:13,391
fitted curve for a two hit curve and his fitted curve for a one hit curve.

469
00:25:13,391 --> 00:25:15,910
So, I mean, math isn't that cool.

470
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,359
And I want you to know that

471
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:20,970
the retinoblastoma gene was not identified until 1987.

472
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:26,780
So he figured this out 16 years before they identified the gene.

473
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:30,100
And I think that kind of thing is so cool, like I'll never be that smart.

474
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,960
I'm not gonna be able to figure that out like that, right?

475
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,170
I just think that's amazing.

476
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:38,103
So I think stories like that are really cool.

477
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:39,706
So he was absolutely correct and he was

478
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:41,720
proven correct when they found the gene later.

479
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:48,079
So I think it's important as we start to talk about these hereditary

480
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,961
cancer syndromes that we talk about the ways to express cancer risk, right?

481
00:25:51,961 --> 00:25:56,381
There's relative risk so if you have this exposure or in this case this gene,

482
00:25:56,381 --> 00:25:58,489
what is your risk compared to someone

483
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:01,359
who is unexposed or doesn't have that mutation?

484
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:06,355
Cumulative risk which is age specific and penetrance which is also aged specific.

485
00:26:06,355 --> 00:26:06,855
Okay,

486
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:12,364
So we all know how to calculate the relative risk, right?

487
00:26:12,364 --> 00:26:13,975
So incidents in those with the risk factor

488
00:26:13,975 --> 00:26:16,241
compared to incidents and those without the risk factor.

489
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:21,595
Relative risk of 1 is the baseline risk or no increased or decreased risk.

490
00:26:21,595 --> 00:26:24,528
So relative risk of 3 means there's a threefold increased risk.

491
00:26:24,528 --> 00:26:29,059
Relative risk of .5 is a half, 50% reduction in risk, okay?

492
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:31,198
So examples of this would be, if

493
00:26:31,198 --> 00:26:34,768
you have a sister affected with premenopausal breast

494
00:26:34,768 --> 00:26:38,019
cancer, your relative risk for breast cancer is

495
00:26:38,019 --> 00:26:41,040
in the neighborhood of 3.6 to 5, okay?

496
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,528
If you have a first degree relative with

497
00:26:42,528 --> 00:26:44,795
malignant melanoma, your relative risk is about 2.7,

498
00:26:47,115 --> 00:26:47,795
Okay?

499
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:54,742
Cumulative risk on the other hand, when you're talking

500
00:26:54,742 --> 00:26:59,481
about increase, you're talking about it by age at diagnosis.

501
00:26:59,481 --> 00:27:02,892
So this is the percentage of people who have colorectal cancer.

502
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:05,385
So the yellow line is the general population and

503
00:27:05,385 --> 00:27:07,891
the blue line is people who have untreated FAP.

504
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:11,762
Which is one of these familial syndromes that we're gonna talk about, okay?

505
00:27:11,762 --> 00:27:17,574
So basically, if you're in the general population, your lifetime

506
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:23,710
risk which we're defining is by age 75 here, right, is 6%, okay?

507
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:28,540
6% of the population will get colorectal cancer by the age of 75.

508
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:32,735
Among people with FAP, untreated FAP, the cumulative risk by age 33 is

509
00:27:32,735 --> 00:27:37,830
about 50%, so by age 33 half of these people will have colon cancer.

510
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,835
And the lifetime risk is basically 100%.

511
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:50,478
Note that this is aged dependent though, right?

512
00:27:50,478 --> 00:27:53,070
This is kind of the same idea as penetrance,

513
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:55,593
right, so the penetrance by age 33 is X,

514
00:27:55,593 --> 00:27:57,765
the penetrance by age 70 is so on and

515
00:27:57,765 --> 00:28:00,661
so forth but it's gonna be higher as people age.

516
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,028
[COUGH] So let's talk about some of these features.

517
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:07,763
I've been making this distinction between these hereditary high

518
00:28:07,763 --> 00:28:10,751
penetrance cancers and just having a genetic predisposition, right?

519
00:28:10,751 --> 00:28:12,235
So let's talk about some of these

520
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:14,673
features of these hereditary high penetrance cancers

521
00:28:14,673 --> 00:28:18,118
that make them different from just having a genetic risk or a family history.

522
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:21,135
So these are caused by mutations or

523
00:28:21,135 --> 00:28:23,810
deletions of genes involved in critical functions.

524
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:27,749
Okay, so the tumor suppressor genes, the proto-oncogenes, right?

525
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:32,582
DNA repair, cell proliferation, cell cycle control and apoptosis.

526
00:28:32,582 --> 00:28:34,479
Mutations of these genes lead to altered

527
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:36,840
function or altered production of gene product.

528
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,971
So it's truly a mutation that changes the protein, okay?

529
00:28:41,643 --> 00:28:44,439
>> In contrast these low penetrations genes that we're

530
00:28:44,439 --> 00:28:47,109
finding with us, right, that are fairly common in

531
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:49,843
the population but increased cancer risk by a little

532
00:28:49,843 --> 00:28:52,660
bit they only moderately elevate the risk of cancer.

533
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:57,450
So an example is that NAT2 genotype that we talked about right?

534
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:02,134
It modifies how you handle smoke exposure and increases your risk a little bit.

535
00:29:02,134 --> 00:29:05,214
But basically it's acting by increasing

536
00:29:05,214 --> 00:29:09,973
an individual susceptibility to environmental carcinogens.

537
00:29:09,973 --> 00:29:13,748
They're usually polymorphic and cell function dealing with

538
00:29:13,748 --> 00:29:17,753
metabolism of endogenous and exogenous compounds, all right?

539
00:29:17,753 --> 00:29:23,550
So this is not in a critical function, it's a change in a gene that makes a

540
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:29,267
protein that changes how you handle environmental exposure, right?

541
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,307
You're not to genotype might not ever matter if

542
00:29:32,307 --> 00:29:36,862
you didn't smoke or weren't exposed to means, right?

543
00:29:36,862 --> 00:29:43,079
Okay, so here's a chart kind of comparing that these high penetrance, they tend to

544
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:49,492
be causal, they're basically they may all be more or less necessary and sufficient.

545
00:29:49,492 --> 00:29:51,556
In some cases it almost doesn't matter what

546
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:53,575
you do in terms of your lifestyle factors.

547
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:55,248
We would certainly encourage these people not to

548
00:29:55,248 --> 00:29:56,649
smoke and all of that for other reasons.

549
00:29:56,649 --> 00:29:59,117
And for their cancer it's certainly bad if you

550
00:29:59,117 --> 00:30:02,309
already have this predisposition but it almost doesn't matter.

551
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:05,334
You can do you can do everything perfectly and still

552
00:30:05,334 --> 00:30:09,919
get cancer with these, you know, genetic, these high penetrates things.

553
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,734
So they're very rare is something to note very few cancers are actually

554
00:30:13,734 --> 00:30:15,643
caused by these in the population,

555
00:30:15,643 --> 00:30:18,646
there's a really clear familial hereditary pattern.

556
00:30:18,646 --> 00:30:23,099
When you look at a pedigree, you're like, yeah, clearly something

557
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:27,488
going on in this family, very high strength of association increase.

558
00:30:27,488 --> 00:30:31,368
The relative risk is very big if you have the gene.

559
00:30:31,368 --> 00:30:35,005
But again, the population attributable risk is low because they are rare.

560
00:30:35,005 --> 00:30:38,281
Remember the population attributable risk is a is a function of both

561
00:30:38,281 --> 00:30:39,717
how common the exposure is and

562
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:42,200
the relative risk associated with that exposure.

563
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,462
So even though the relative risk is high, they're very rare.

564
00:30:44,462 --> 00:30:48,589
And so the population attributable risk or the proportion of cancers caused by

565
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:50,277
these genes is small and the role

566
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:53,227
of environmental exposure is secondary and variable.

567
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:55,848
Sometimes it doesn't even matter just having

568
00:30:55,848 --> 00:30:58,003
the gene is enough to give you cancer.

569
00:30:58,003 --> 00:31:02,259
Alright on the other hand, these low penetrations things, the illegal

570
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:07,301
alters your susceptibility that this is neither necessary nor sufficient, right?

571
00:31:07,301 --> 00:31:09,118
They're quite common.

572
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:11,585
The familiar hereditary pattern is, is not clear.

573
00:31:11,585 --> 00:31:12,392
It's kind of equivocal.

574
00:31:12,392 --> 00:31:14,821
Like if you looked at a pedigree, it wouldn't be very clear

575
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:18,041
from looking at who got cancer that there was something going on genetically.

576
00:31:18,041 --> 00:31:21,047
The strength of association is quite low by comparison.

577
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:23,473
But the population attributable risk is high because even

578
00:31:23,473 --> 00:31:26,353
though the relative risk is somewhat low, they're really common.

579
00:31:26,353 --> 00:31:26,659
Right?

580
00:31:26,659 --> 00:31:31,347
So a lot of cancers comparatively are caused by these kinds of genetic changes.

581
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,790
And the role of environmental

582
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,041
environmental exposure is critical, like we

583
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:38,111
said, with that map to gene, if you never smoked, who cares?

584
00:31:38,111 --> 00:31:41,993
Right.

585
00:31:41,993 --> 00:31:43,327
So these are just some examples.

586
00:31:43,327 --> 00:31:48,342
We're gonna go over a few of these, I'm not gonna the labor this graph.

587
00:31:48,342 --> 00:31:51,116
And again, remember we're talking about these things up here that

588
00:31:51,116 --> 00:31:53,851
are very rare in the population that have really high penetrates.

589
00:31:53,851 --> 00:32:02,569
Okay, so have you guys talked about twin studies in this class at all?

590
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:07,961
Okay.

591
00:32:07,961 --> 00:32:11,327
I think the slightest data, I don't think anybody's ever watched this movie now.

592
00:32:11,327 --> 00:32:12,909
It was kind of a terrible movie from

593
00:32:12,909 --> 00:32:15,366
the eighties I think where basically they were trying

594
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:18,043
to convince you that like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny

595
00:32:18,043 --> 00:32:21,431
Devito was somehow these genetically engineered twins, where they've

596
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:25,143
like given one of them all the good genes and one of them, all the bad genes, I'll

597
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,109
let you decide which ones which and it was

598
00:32:27,109 --> 00:32:29,331
really, it was very bad science and hand wavy.

599
00:32:29,331 --> 00:32:32,167
But the idea here is, you know, there's identical twins and fraternal twins.

600
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:32,712
Right?

601
00:32:32,712 --> 00:32:35,315
And so twin studies essentially are a way to kind

602
00:32:35,315 --> 00:32:39,158
of determine the heritable proportion of the disease because the idea

603
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:42,415
is that identical twins and fraternal twins both share kind

604
00:32:42,415 --> 00:32:46,266
of environmental exposures and in utero exposures in the same way.

605
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:50,365
But the identical twins are identical genetically, whereas the fraternal twins

606
00:32:50,365 --> 00:32:53,462
only share as much genetics as you would expect for siblings.

607
00:32:53,462 --> 00:32:53,685
Right?

608
00:32:53,685 --> 00:32:55,085
And so if you look at kind of

609
00:32:55,085 --> 00:32:58,397
the differences in disease incidence between fraternal twin

610
00:32:58,397 --> 00:33:01,326
pairs compared to identical twin pairs, you're sort

611
00:33:01,326 --> 00:33:03,953
of isolating the effect of the genet Component.

612
00:33:03,953 --> 00:33:04,943
Right?

613
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:06,488
So that's kind of a clever thing.

614
00:33:06,488 --> 00:33:09,911
So they've they've done these these things and this gives you some sense.

615
00:33:09,911 --> 00:33:14,275
So as much as 42% prostate actually as the top one for heritability.

616
00:33:14,275 --> 00:33:16,981
And then as you go on down the list, you know,

617
00:33:16,981 --> 00:33:21,290
so there's some large proportion of cancer risk that is heritable.

618
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,986
But that does not mean that they're all hereditary syndromes, right?

619
00:33:25,986 --> 00:33:28,684
So we said this before that the carriers of the

620
00:33:28,684 --> 00:33:32,173
mutant genes have a very high risk of developing cancers.

621
00:33:32,173 --> 00:33:34,440
For example, there's up to an 80% lifetime

622
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,770
risk of breast cancer BRCA one and two carriers.

623
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:39,422
Alright, so we've said a lot of this before.

624
00:33:39,422 --> 00:33:42,258
Other things that are important is that one other

625
00:33:42,258 --> 00:33:45,381
thing that is important is that they are young onset.

626
00:33:45,381 --> 00:33:45,752
Right?

627
00:33:45,752 --> 00:33:51,317
And so these these cancers will tend to happen much younger in age than

628
00:33:51,317 --> 00:33:56,247
Even even cancers in people with a family history for example.

629
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:58,271
So that is another differentiating factor

630
00:33:58,271 --> 00:34:00,408
of these high penetrates familial syndromes

631
00:34:00,408 --> 00:34:03,343
is that they happen quite young and you know why that is right.

632
00:34:03,343 --> 00:34:04,216
They already come here.

633
00:34:04,216 --> 00:34:05,569
So we talked about how it takes a

634
00:34:05,569 --> 00:34:08,078
lifetime to accumulate these 4-7 hits to get cancer.

635
00:34:08,078 --> 00:34:10,649
And that's why age is the biggest risk factor for cancer right?

636
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:13,188
You can see them all go up as people age.

637
00:34:13,188 --> 00:34:15,329
But if you already come here with a critical

638
00:34:15,329 --> 00:34:17,656
hit, well then some of the work is done right?

639
00:34:17,656 --> 00:34:19,982
And so you just keep move on from there.

640
00:34:19,982 --> 00:34:24,857
And so the point at which you get to cancer is much earlier in life.

641
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:25,870
Alright.

642
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:29,278
So here's some examples that we're gonna talk about.

643
00:34:29,278 --> 00:34:32,114
We're gonna talk about lee from any syndrome.

644
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:34,397
We can talk about familial adenomas, polyp sis or F.

645
00:34:34,397 --> 00:34:34,661
A.

646
00:34:34,661 --> 00:34:35,280
P.

647
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:35,509
There.

648
00:34:35,509 --> 00:34:36,321
I said it once.

649
00:34:36,321 --> 00:34:36,912
Now you're getting F.

650
00:34:36,912 --> 00:34:37,111
A.

651
00:34:37,111 --> 00:34:37,335
P.

652
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:41,872
For the rest of the class hereditary non polyp Asus colon cancer.

653
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:42,085
H.

654
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:42,208
N.

655
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:42,363
P.

656
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:42,508
C.

657
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:43,764
C.

658
00:34:43,764 --> 00:34:44,423
Did that one.

659
00:34:44,423 --> 00:34:44,589
Now it's H.

660
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:44,805
N.

661
00:34:44,805 --> 00:34:44,904
P.

662
00:34:44,904 --> 00:34:45,020
C.

663
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:45,453
C.

664
00:34:45,453 --> 00:34:48,134
Forever and familial breast and ovarian cancers.

665
00:34:48,134 --> 00:34:48,489
Okay.

666
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:51,664
And remember again, these are a small percentage of all cancer cases.

667
00:34:51,664 --> 00:34:54,307
So I'm gonna skip that.

668
00:34:54,307 --> 00:34:55,777
Alright, so lee from any symptom is

669
00:34:55,777 --> 00:34:57,740
an example of an autism all dominant disorder.

670
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,169
It's a germline mutation of the P.

671
00:34:59,169 --> 00:35:00,823
53 tumor suppressor gene.

672
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:05,184
Mm So I told you that tumor suppressors you have to lose both copies.

673
00:35:05,184 --> 00:35:06,915
So when I say it's autism all dominant.

674
00:35:06,915 --> 00:35:14,576
Do I mean typically or Jenna typically fino typically autism all dominant.

675
00:35:14,576 --> 00:35:17,417
If you look at a pedigree for the outcome of cancer

676
00:35:17,417 --> 00:35:21,663
it appears to be dominant and autism a dominant pattern of inheritance.

677
00:35:21,663 --> 00:35:25,083
But because we now know about genetics and this is a genetics class.

678
00:35:25,083 --> 00:35:27,905
We know you have to lose both copies in order to actually get the cancer.

679
00:35:27,905 --> 00:35:33,031
So it's a gina typically recessive in these families.

680
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:37,236
You'll see who have this, you'll see familial clustering of

681
00:35:37,236 --> 00:35:41,451
childhood sarcoma which is tumors of the bones and muscles.

682
00:35:41,451 --> 00:35:44,028
You'll also see quite young onset breast and brain cancer.

683
00:35:44,028 --> 00:35:46,160
So people in their twenties and thirties getting

684
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,864
breast and brain cancers there otherwise typically normal.

685
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:51,755
So there's no like other outward appearance where you would know

686
00:35:51,755 --> 00:35:55,390
that these people have from anti syndrome when they're born they're headed.

687
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,568
Hetero sickos were defective.

688
00:35:56,568 --> 00:36:01,244
P 53 the tumor cells become homogeneous when the normal alil is lost or mutated.

689
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:03,589
There is some time needed for that second mutation.

690
00:36:03,589 --> 00:36:06,506
So the penetrates increases with age.

691
00:36:06,506 --> 00:36:12,216
The risk of cancer is 50% by age 45 and 90% by age 65.

692
00:36:12,216 --> 00:36:13,920
This is a tough one to manage clinically.

693
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,398
We're gonna see some examples next when we talk about colorectal cancer.

694
00:36:18,398 --> 00:36:20,624
There are some familial cancer syndromes that

695
00:36:20,624 --> 00:36:23,029
mostly increase your risk of colorectal cancer.

696
00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:25,582
And so there are some actual steps that can

697
00:36:25,582 --> 00:36:28,756
be taken to kind of manage these patients clinically.

698
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:29,875
And we'll talk about that.

699
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:33,565
But lee from any is it's cancer, brain breast all kinds of

700
00:36:33,565 --> 00:36:38,176
places, places that we don't have sarcoma as places that we don't do.

701
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:40,033
We don't really have good screening tests for

702
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:42,088
sometimes these people will get like whole body M.

703
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:42,357
R.

704
00:36:42,357 --> 00:36:42,705
I.

705
00:36:42,705 --> 00:36:44,744
Or whole body imaging periodically.

706
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,363
But it's it's pretty rough.

707
00:36:46,363 --> 00:36:48,251
It's a rough one.

708
00:36:48,251 --> 00:36:51,786
I also want to point out that this is named after two people Dr

709
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:55,402
lee and dr who discovered this doctor from any when I was at N.

710
00:36:55,402 --> 00:36:55,629
C.

711
00:36:55,629 --> 00:36:55,724
I.

712
00:36:55,724 --> 00:36:57,448
For my postdoc was the division head.

713
00:36:57,448 --> 00:37:01,902
So I've met from Amy.

714
00:37:01,902 --> 00:37:04,814
You know you've made it when someone names a syndrome after you and

715
00:37:04,814 --> 00:37:07,739
I've met the man, one of the men after whom the syndrome is named.

716
00:37:07,739 --> 00:37:10,516
So he was like my great grand boss or something.

717
00:37:10,516 --> 00:37:13,614
So that makes me special.

718
00:37:13,614 --> 00:37:15,528
No you're not.

719
00:37:15,528 --> 00:37:19,788
Okay so let's switch gears a little bit and talk about colorectal cancer.

720
00:37:19,788 --> 00:37:21,951
So remember I told you that the vast majority

721
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:24,703
of most cancers and colorectal cancer is no exception.

722
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:28,050
Are sporadic or a current average risk people

723
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,898
as a result of environmental exposure or chance.

724
00:37:31,898 --> 00:37:35,264
About 10-30% are in those people who have a family

725
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:38,773
history or maybe some changes snips in those like common

726
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:42,784
variation kind of areas that increase their low punishments genes

727
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:46,822
that are fairly common in the population that increase your risk.

728
00:37:46,822 --> 00:37:48,962
This these little slices of the pie are the familial

729
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:51,762
cancer syndromes that we know about the cause colorectal cancer.

730
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:54,960
Okay about 1% of colorectal cancers are caused by F.

731
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,229
A.

732
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:55,626
P.

733
00:37:55,626 --> 00:37:57,295
And about 5% are caused by H.

734
00:37:57,295 --> 00:37:57,308
N.

735
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:57,756
P.

736
00:37:57,756 --> 00:37:57,864
C.

737
00:37:57,864 --> 00:37:59,093
C.

738
00:37:59,093 --> 00:38:04,550
Okay so little not a lot of them.

739
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,598
This should give you sort of the visual

740
00:38:06,598 --> 00:38:09,995
representation of kind of the qualitative difference between

741
00:38:09,995 --> 00:38:12,813
these hereditary syndromes and just having a family

742
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:15,328
history or even even a strong family history.

743
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:16,305
Right?

744
00:38:16,305 --> 00:38:19,715
So if you have this is your approximate lifetime colorectal cancer risk.

745
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:20,576
You have no family history.

746
00:38:20,576 --> 00:38:23,110
Your approximate lifetime risk is 2%.

747
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:25,419
You have one first degree relative with colon cancer.

748
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:27,409
Your lifetime risk is like 6%.

749
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:29,333
Even if you get up to people who have two first

750
00:38:29,333 --> 00:38:33,035
degree relatives with with colon cancer, that's a pretty strong family history.

751
00:38:33,035 --> 00:38:35,183
Their lifetime risk is 17%.

752
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:35,932
If you have an H.

753
00:38:35,932 --> 00:38:36,182
N.

754
00:38:36,182 --> 00:38:36,259
P.

755
00:38:36,259 --> 00:38:36,493
C.

756
00:38:36,493 --> 00:38:39,644
C mutation, your lifetime risk is 70%.

757
00:38:39,644 --> 00:38:44,736
So I mean you can just it's it's just a qualitative

758
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:50,665
difference in the risk conferred first degree relatives.

759
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:52,422
Yes, that's right.

760
00:38:52,422 --> 00:38:55,838
Or Children.

761
00:38:55,838 --> 00:38:58,424
But when you're talking about cancer you're normally not a

762
00:38:58,424 --> 00:39:00,868
pro band is normally not coming to you cause their child.

763
00:39:00,868 --> 00:39:04,638
Usually it's a parent or a sibling who had it.

764
00:39:04,638 --> 00:39:07,748
Okay.

765
00:39:07,748 --> 00:39:09,813
Alright so let's talk about F.

766
00:39:09,813 --> 00:39:10,029
A.

767
00:39:10,029 --> 00:39:12,217
P.

768
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:15,547
This accounts for about 1% of all cases of colon cancer.

769
00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:17,103
It's caused by a mutation in the A.

770
00:39:17,103 --> 00:39:17,166
P.

771
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:17,589
C.

772
00:39:17,589 --> 00:39:18,516
Gene for F.

773
00:39:18,516 --> 00:39:19,314
For the A.

774
00:39:19,314 --> 00:39:19,483
P.

775
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:19,674
C.

776
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:20,039
Gene.

777
00:39:20,039 --> 00:39:20,744
Okay.

778
00:39:20,744 --> 00:39:23,336
It's on the long arm of chromosome five.

779
00:39:23,336 --> 00:39:26,472
These people get hundreds to thousands of polyps starting in their teens.

780
00:39:26,472 --> 00:39:29,644
So this is a colon like they've taken a piece of colon and opened it up.

781
00:39:29,644 --> 00:39:33,272
This should be you know smooth with like the little ridges are normal.

782
00:39:33,272 --> 00:39:37,799
But each of these little bitty bumps is a polyp.

783
00:39:37,799 --> 00:39:39,382
That is not normal.

784
00:39:39,382 --> 00:39:41,968
That many polyps is if a person if a clinician does

785
00:39:41,968 --> 00:39:45,704
a colonoscopy and they see that it's just like red flags everywhere.

786
00:39:45,704 --> 00:39:46,287
This is an F.

787
00:39:46,287 --> 00:39:46,416
A.

788
00:39:46,416 --> 00:39:48,425
P patient, right?

789
00:39:48,425 --> 00:39:51,122
All the all of the patients will develop colorectal

790
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,768
cancer from the colon polyps usually by age 40.

791
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:56,300
Okay, patients with a PHP basically have to have

792
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:00,258
their colon and sometimes the rectum removed prophylactically because you

793
00:40:00,258 --> 00:40:03,286
cannot do so normally what happens is you do colonoscopies

794
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:06,290
and you remove the polyps before they can become cancer.

795
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,493
There's just too many.

796
00:40:07,493 --> 00:40:09,894
You cannot possibly keep up with this many polyps.

797
00:40:09,894 --> 00:40:17,648
So yeah collectable prophylactic mastectomy is the treatment for this.

798
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:18,590
So the F.

799
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:18,822
A.

800
00:40:18,822 --> 00:40:20,905
P abnormal gene is present in all of the body cells.

801
00:40:20,905 --> 00:40:23,043
So other organs may develop growths

802
00:40:23,043 --> 00:40:25,758
although it is most penetrating the column.

803
00:40:25,758 --> 00:40:28,478
Alright, so this is a picture from a colonoscopy.

804
00:40:28,478 --> 00:40:31,037
This person has done a lovely job with their prep.

805
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:33,150
You can see everything but each of these little bumps

806
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,889
is a polyp that is not supposed to be there.

807
00:40:34,889 --> 00:40:37,163
And this is just a teeny piece of the colon, Right?

808
00:40:37,163 --> 00:40:40,364
It should be nice and smooth.

809
00:40:40,364 --> 00:40:43,125
Yes, one or 2.

810
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:48,371
Not just one Or two by the age of like so the recommended age at which you start in

811
00:40:48,371 --> 00:40:53,566
the general population which you start colonoscopy screening is age 50.

812
00:40:53,566 --> 00:40:55,500
And so the reason you start at age 50 is

813
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,964
because you're not really expected to have polyps much before that.

814
00:40:58,964 --> 00:40:59,493
Okay.

815
00:40:59,493 --> 00:41:01,676
And then the idea is if you go in and have

816
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:05,028
you a clean colonoscopy they do it every 10 years right?

817
00:41:05,028 --> 00:41:07,533
Because it takes that long for a polyp to develop and you

818
00:41:07,533 --> 00:41:10,748
know that they've they've come up with that screening and role based

819
00:41:10,748 --> 00:41:13,089
on the idea that if a new polyp occurred it would take

820
00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:16,002
more than 10 years for that polyp to then progress to cancer.

821
00:41:16,002 --> 00:41:18,357
So we would catch it if we did that screening interval.

822
00:41:18,357 --> 00:41:21,210
People who have had polyps have colonoscopies a bit

823
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:24,041
more frequently like every 3 to 5 years maybe.

824
00:41:24,041 --> 00:41:26,886
So there are there are clinical guidelines for like if a person had a

825
00:41:26,886 --> 00:41:29,354
polyp and it was this big then we need to do it this frequent.

826
00:41:29,354 --> 00:41:30,275
You know what I mean?

827
00:41:30,275 --> 00:41:39,310
But you know people who go in In their 50s 60s might have a couple two.

828
00:41:39,310 --> 00:41:39,591
Yeah.

829
00:41:39,591 --> 00:41:45,791
So this is really unusual and these people are teenagers or in their twenties.

830
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:46,581
Yeah.

831
00:41:46,581 --> 00:41:55,807
Yeah.

832
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:56,241
Yes.

833
00:41:56,241 --> 00:41:57,554
And we're gonna talk about that.

834
00:41:57,554 --> 00:42:01,305
Yes the kind of clinical management is if there's a history of F.

835
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:01,487
A.

836
00:42:01,487 --> 00:42:01,714
P.

837
00:42:01,714 --> 00:42:03,613
In the family.

838
00:42:03,613 --> 00:42:06,721
Kids will go start getting like when they're 12 they start getting

839
00:42:06,721 --> 00:42:08,814
colonoscopies every year because here's the

840
00:42:08,814 --> 00:42:11,081
thing, the estimated penetrates for adenomas.

841
00:42:11,081 --> 00:42:14,751
The polyps is 90% okay so it is possible to have an A.

842
00:42:14,751 --> 00:42:15,121
P.

843
00:42:15,121 --> 00:42:15,297
C.

844
00:42:15,297 --> 00:42:16,416
Mutation and not get F.

845
00:42:16,416 --> 00:42:16,659
A.

846
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:17,975
P.

847
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:19,363
It's a 90% penetrates.

848
00:42:19,363 --> 00:42:22,096
But 10% of people who have a mutation don't get polyp

849
00:42:22,096 --> 00:42:24,843
Asus and those people don't need to have a collect a me.

850
00:42:24,843 --> 00:42:25,951
Right?

851
00:42:25,951 --> 00:42:27,863
But once you start the polyp sis that's

852
00:42:27,863 --> 00:42:30,650
basically 100% chance you're gonna get cancer from one

853
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,834
of those polyps because there's just so many of

854
00:42:32,834 --> 00:42:34,979
them that one of them is gonna progress right?

855
00:42:34,979 --> 00:42:39,612
So they start colonoscopies quite young every year.

856
00:42:39,612 --> 00:42:43,025
And then once they start to develop polyp sis then there's a conversation

857
00:42:43,025 --> 00:42:46,012
about having the prophylactic collect a me and when and the thing is

858
00:42:46,012 --> 00:42:49,531
that most of these people when they're when the polyp sis presents they're

859
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:53,297
like 18 19 years old they're thinking about going to college they're young.

860
00:42:53,297 --> 00:42:53,796
Right?

861
00:42:53,796 --> 00:42:57,521
And so there are sort of these decision making things about when you

862
00:42:57,521 --> 00:43:02,061
know when is the right moment because that's not that's a major surgery right?

863
00:43:02,061 --> 00:43:03,736
And it's life changing.

864
00:43:03,736 --> 00:43:05,721
You have to have a classmate dad for the rest of your life.

865
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:13,600
And yeah okay I got to sit there with my aunt she's a G.

866
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:13,893
I.

867
00:43:13,893 --> 00:43:21,451
Doctor the pictures make you think of your own.

868
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:26,353
Yeah okay.

869
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:32,577
There's another way so there's another way that F.

870
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:32,627
A.

871
00:43:32,627 --> 00:43:32,887
P.

872
00:43:32,887 --> 00:43:34,071
Can be diagnosed.

873
00:43:34,071 --> 00:43:35,502
So sometimes people will have an F.

874
00:43:35,502 --> 00:43:35,622
A.

875
00:43:35,622 --> 00:43:37,569
P mutation and they don't have a family history.

876
00:43:37,569 --> 00:43:38,718
That's a de novo mutation.

877
00:43:38,718 --> 00:43:41,243
Remember I told you can either inherit a bad copy of a

878
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:45,430
pc from your parents or something to go wrong during fertilization and conception.

879
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:47,877
And and you can get a mutation that way.

880
00:43:47,877 --> 00:43:49,807
Okay so those are called de novo mutations.

881
00:43:49,807 --> 00:43:50,881
And so these people may have F.

882
00:43:50,881 --> 00:43:50,949
A.

883
00:43:50,949 --> 00:43:51,185
P.

884
00:43:51,185 --> 00:43:53,425
And have no idea because they have no family history.

885
00:43:53,425 --> 00:43:54,728
Right?

886
00:43:54,728 --> 00:43:58,260
So one thing that can happen is that an eye exam they might

887
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,740
see this congenital hypertrophy of the

888
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,984
retinal pigment epithelium or chrp forever more.

889
00:44:03,984 --> 00:44:07,368
And it's kind of this black spot in the back

890
00:44:07,368 --> 00:44:10,858
of the retina that can be seen on an eye exam.

891
00:44:10,858 --> 00:44:12,703
So people like going for an eye exam, the

892
00:44:12,703 --> 00:44:14,710
doctor might be like you need to go get your

893
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:16,610
colon checked which must be kind of a nasty

894
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,348
outcome of a routine eye exam that you weren't expecting.

895
00:44:19,348 --> 00:44:23,256
But it's part of the way that sometimes these Genova F.

896
00:44:23,256 --> 00:44:23,427
A.

897
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,633
P cases can be diagnosed.

898
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:27,090
There's also something called attenuated F.

899
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:27,342
A.

900
00:44:27,342 --> 00:44:27,986
P.

901
00:44:27,986 --> 00:44:29,510
And it happens later onset.

902
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:32,367
These people get colorectal cancer by about age 50.

903
00:44:32,367 --> 00:44:36,632
They have fewer fewer adenomas but more than the average person

904
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:40,977
and younger it's not associated with chrp they might have other

905
00:44:40,977 --> 00:44:45,968
upper gi lesions like stomach or esophageal cancers and its associated

906
00:44:45,968 --> 00:44:49,854
mutations at the five prime and three point ends of the A.

907
00:44:49,854 --> 00:44:50,020
P.

908
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,354
C.

909
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,486
Gene.

910
00:44:51,486 --> 00:44:55,760
I'll get to this in a little bit, but there's different.

911
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:55,973
The A.

912
00:44:55,973 --> 00:44:56,206
P.

913
00:44:56,206 --> 00:44:56,295
C.

914
00:44:56,295 --> 00:44:58,526
Gene is one where we've kind of worked out a lot of the

915
00:44:58,526 --> 00:45:01,536
mutations that occur in what they do and like where in the genes.

916
00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:03,960
Different mutations are that cause like

917
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:06,673
sort of different versions of the syndrome.

918
00:45:06,673 --> 00:45:09,085
[COUGH] All right.

919
00:45:09,085 --> 00:45:13,683
So this is autosomal dominant inheritance caused by mutations

920
00:45:13,683 --> 00:45:17,511
in the APC tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 5q.

921
00:45:17,511 --> 00:45:20,470
So when I say that it's a tumor suppressor gene,

922
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:23,293
you have to lose how many copies to get cancer?

923
00:45:23,293 --> 00:45:23,960
Two, right.

924
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,906
So when I say it's autosomal dominant,

925
00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:28,367
do I mean genotypically or phenotypically, I mean

926
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:31,230
phenotypically because the tumor suppressor genes or gene

927
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:33,251
a typically you have to lose both copies.

928
00:45:33,251 --> 00:45:34,700
It's genotypically recessive.

929
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,570
Okay?

930
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:39,650
Up to 30%, [COUGH] Excuse me.

931
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:42,349
Up to 30% of patients have de Novo germline mutations,

932
00:45:42,349 --> 00:45:44,900
meaning that they don't have a family history at all.

933
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:46,900
Okay.

934
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,820
Most families have unique mutations.

935
00:45:49,820 --> 00:45:51,950
Most mutations are protein truncating.

936
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:55,704
And these genotype phenotype relationships are still emerging like where in the

937
00:45:55,704 --> 00:45:59,031
gene mutation is and what that does to the phenotype is still emerging.

938
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:02,013
Although we know quite a bit about this gene, this thing

939
00:46:02,013 --> 00:46:04,426
about most families having unique mutations

940
00:46:04,426 --> 00:46:07,171
that makes genetics testing really interesting.

941
00:46:07,171 --> 00:46:10,350
So, have you guys talked about genetic testing and genetic counseling.

942
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,716
Okay, so you understand then that the fact

943
00:46:12,716 --> 00:46:15,609
that not everybody has the same mutation giving them

944
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:18,633
FAP is challenging from a genetic testing perspective

945
00:46:18,633 --> 00:46:21,064
because you can find a variation in this gene

946
00:46:21,064 --> 00:46:25,532
and it may not be one you've seen before and characterized in terms of what it does

947
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,436
to the protein and so it might not be

948
00:46:27,436 --> 00:46:30,561
clear what their risk is with this particular variant.

949
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:38,591
Okay, so Colorado cancer risk is 100% in untreated FAP patients.

950
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:42,050
Because we know a lot about this gene.

951
00:46:42,050 --> 00:46:44,438
I mean I just said that most families have unique

952
00:46:44,438 --> 00:46:46,891
mutations but we do know a lot about those genes.

953
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:49,389
The genetic testing does a pretty good identify job of

954
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:51,279
identifying most APC mutation carriers

955
00:46:51,279 --> 00:46:54,057
and dystopic surveillance and prophylactic collectively

956
00:46:54,057 --> 00:46:56,889
can improve survival and at risk patients, non carriers can

957
00:46:56,889 --> 00:47:00,310
be spared the anxiety and the need for increased surveillance, right?

958
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,081
Because colonoscopies are not nice.

959
00:47:02,081 --> 00:47:05,870
Does anybody know [COUGH] They're better than getting cancer?

960
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:08,640
Go get your colonoscopies when you're 50, right?

961
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,439
Or when you're required to do it.

962
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:15,441
But it's not like a blood test or even like a pap smear, right?

963
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:18,220
Which is much less invasive, which is still no fun.

964
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,480
But it's not.

965
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,550
I mean, do you guys know what you have to do for a colonoscopy?

966
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,540
What do you do?

967
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:27,744
>> So I don't know my dad is like old, so he had

968
00:47:27,744 --> 00:47:32,831
his when he was 50 and like, I don't like things will change now.

969
00:47:32,831 --> 00:47:37,559
But basically you have to have to drink like a gallon.

970
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:40,712
So there's like a gallon of this like horrendous liquid.

971
00:47:40,712 --> 00:47:41,212
>> [CROSSTALK].

972
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,317
>> It's like hideously large and you have to drink the entire thing

973
00:47:48,317 --> 00:47:52,130
within like a certain amount of time and it basically cleans your colon.

974
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:55,250
Like my dad was in the bathroom for like 12 hours.

975
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:55,850
It's yeah,

976
00:47:55,850 --> 00:47:58,620
>> There's only one way to clean your colon guys.

977
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,850
It's not fun.

978
00:47:59,850 --> 00:48:00,750
It works.

979
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:01,964
But it's not fun.

980
00:48:01,964 --> 00:48:03,066
And the thing is that

981
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:06,337
>> And then you have to like get knocked out

982
00:48:06,337 --> 00:48:11,106
for your exam and like you have like like getting, yeah,

983
00:48:11,106 --> 00:48:13,381
>> t's a two day process at least.

984
00:48:13,381 --> 00:48:13,621
Right?

985
00:48:13,621 --> 00:48:17,110
And so the thing is you also have to have a driver who's 18 and over.

986
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:20,659
You can't go to get your will not give you a colonoscopy unless you have a

987
00:48:20,659 --> 00:48:22,967
driver there signing a paper saying I'm going

988
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:26,070
to drive them home because they've had general anesthesia.

989
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:26,500
Right?

990
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,634
So it requires that the person doing the prep basically take the first

991
00:48:29,634 --> 00:48:33,430
day off because you're not going to work when you're doing colon prep.

992
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:36,250
No bad idea.

993
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,341
Your in home in your jammies during your colon prep.

994
00:48:38,341 --> 00:48:38,700
Right?

995
00:48:38,700 --> 00:48:42,891
And then the next day you have to go in and go under anesthesia.

996
00:48:42,891 --> 00:48:44,440
So you're certainly not going to work that day.

997
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,796
So for people who have jobs where you have time

998
00:48:46,796 --> 00:48:49,485
off and you have flexibility, not such a big deal.

999
00:48:49,485 --> 00:48:51,916
Like I might have to have a family history.

1000
00:48:51,916 --> 00:48:53,036
I've done this several times.

1001
00:48:53,036 --> 00:48:54,435
My husband can take time off.

1002
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:55,065
We're okay.

1003
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:55,336
Right.

1004
00:48:55,336 --> 00:48:56,505
We've got good insurance.

1005
00:48:56,505 --> 00:48:57,665
Not a big deal.

1006
00:48:57,665 --> 00:48:59,555
It's certainly not still not fun to do the prep.

1007
00:48:59,555 --> 00:49:01,465
But you do what you have to do.

1008
00:49:01,465 --> 00:49:06,095
But I mean imagine somebody who has an hourly job.

1009
00:49:06,095 --> 00:49:08,840
They work at Walmart as a cashier.

1010
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,221
You cannot stand at a cash register and do this right?

1011
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:15,150
You have to take that day off and you may not have paid time off.

1012
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:19,811
So you're losing that day of pay probably your partner or whoever friend is taking.

1013
00:49:19,811 --> 00:49:21,090
You also has that type of job.

1014
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:23,246
They're losing a day of pay to take you and then

1015
00:49:23,246 --> 00:49:26,251
you're losing a second day of pay to do the actual colonoscopy.

1016
00:49:26,251 --> 00:49:28,140
And you may not have insurance that covers it all.

1017
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:31,120
And because it's an inpatient procedure it's very expensive.

1018
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:31,581
Right?

1019
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:35,510
So [COUGH] It's not is burdensome.

1020
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,900
Okay.

1021
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,120
And maybe more burdensome to some people than others.

1022
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:42,484
So we do want genetic testing is really useful and that it can identify

1023
00:49:42,484 --> 00:49:46,620
people who don't have to do this every year, starting when they're 10 for 12.

1024
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,060
Right?

1025
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,610
Okay.

1026
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:53,301
So here's an example of a pedigree that has de novo germline mutation.

1027
00:49:53,301 --> 00:49:55,648
This person was diagnosed, this is the pro band

1028
00:49:55,648 --> 00:49:58,471
they were diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age 45.

1029
00:49:58,471 --> 00:50:00,660
And it turned out that they also had FAP.

1030
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:02,221
Nobody in their family had ever had it before.

1031
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:09,400
Okay so we talked about age related penetrates.

1032
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:12,840
So this is the general population over here.

1033
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:15,734
They start developing adenomas maybe in their

1034
00:50:15,734 --> 00:50:18,270
thirties and forties at very low rates.

1035
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:22,083
But then following maybe 10 years after the development

1036
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:26,890
of cinemas the rate of colorectal cancer increases, right?

1037
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:32,115
An FAP they begin developing adenomas in their teens and twenties and then

1038
00:50:32,115 --> 00:50:37,271
it's a shorter interval to development of colorectal cancer from now.

1039
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,160
Okay.

1040
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:44,231
This is an example of a family who has inherited APC mutation.

1041
00:50:44,231 --> 00:50:50,150
So this is the non de novo the inherited version.

1042
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:56,570
So this is the pro band [COUGH] They are now 42.

1043
00:50:56,570 --> 00:50:59,987
They were diagnosed with FAP at age 38 and subsequently had

1044
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:04,370
genetic testing where they were found to have an APC gene mutation.

1045
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:09,832
They were diagnosed with have AP and then subsequently developed

1046
00:51:09,832 --> 00:51:14,700
colon cancer from those polyps right turned out that their

1047
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:19,863
mother had FAP at age 25 died of colorectal cancer at age 31

1048
00:51:19,863 --> 00:51:24,760
their grandfather died of colorectal cancer at age 45.

1049
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:25,990
These are very young.

1050
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,929
The average age of onset for colorectal

1051
00:51:27,929 --> 00:51:30,650
cancer is like mid-60s in the general population.

1052
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:32,040
Okay.

1053
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:32,880
All right.

1054
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,232
So based on this this person got tested and had to collect

1055
00:51:37,232 --> 00:51:42,160
me and they had their Children tested and this one is negative.

1056
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,540
This one is positive.

1057
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:44,431
This mutation carrier.

1058
00:51:44,431 --> 00:51:46,870
So they're undergoing colonoscopies.

1059
00:51:46,870 --> 00:51:49,581
So that's what it can look like in a family.

1060
00:51:49,581 --> 00:51:53,401
So you can see from the pedigree this is not equivocal, right?

1061
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,541
This is very clear.

1062
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:56,381
All right.

1063
00:51:56,381 --> 00:51:59,184
So we said that we know something about the gene and

1064
00:51:59,184 --> 00:52:02,950
where in the gene mutations occur having to do with the phenotype.

1065
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:04,967
So for example the attenuated FAP is here

1066
00:52:04,967 --> 00:52:07,341
in these regions shown by the yellow classic FAP

1067
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:09,179
is kind of in the mutations that occur

1068
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:11,880
in these regions can be associated with classic FAP.

1069
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:14,171
And mutations in these regions.

1070
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:16,889
You have the classic FAP plus CHRPE.

1071
00:52:20,207 --> 00:52:25,914
So I told you remember APC is what you lose early in colorectal tumor a genesis.

1072
00:52:25,914 --> 00:52:28,029
So this is what we know about the natural history of the

1073
00:52:28,029 --> 00:52:31,240
sort of genetic changes associated with the progression to cancer in the colon.

1074
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:36,170
So this is where these mutations FAP people have their mutation.

1075
00:52:36,170 --> 00:52:37,673
So you can see that it just

1076
00:52:37,673 --> 00:52:41,399
really accelerates this creation of polyps essentially that

1077
00:52:41,399 --> 00:52:43,547
then proceed to cancer kind of at the

1078
00:52:43,547 --> 00:52:46,571
normal rate but there's just thousands of them.

1079
00:52:46,571 --> 00:52:49,381
And so your chances of getting cancer enormous.

1080
00:52:49,381 --> 00:52:49,881
Right?

1081
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:53,051
All right.

1082
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:57,320
So these are some of the indications for a pc gene testing.

1083
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,332
If you have a lot of polyposis you would get tested if people if

1084
00:53:01,332 --> 00:53:06,000
you have a relative who has FAP or an APC mutation you would get tested.

1085
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,751
We've talked about the benefits and some of the

1086
00:53:08,751 --> 00:53:12,070
limitations are the same as any kind of genetic testing.

1087
00:53:12,070 --> 00:53:12,601
Right?

1088
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,431
So this is an example.

1089
00:53:15,431 --> 00:53:19,323
This is what Leila was asking about you might this isn't if you have

1090
00:53:19,323 --> 00:53:23,590
if you're tested for the APC gene and it turns out that you are negative.

1091
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:25,464
You might have some sort of baseline colonoscopy

1092
00:53:25,464 --> 00:53:27,475
but recommendations for that very and then you would

1093
00:53:27,475 --> 00:53:30,034
just follow recommendations for colorectal cancer screening for

1094
00:53:30,034 --> 00:53:32,430
the general population because you wouldn't have the gene.

1095
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,090
Right?

1096
00:53:33,090 --> 00:53:34,869
But in a person who ends up being

1097
00:53:34,869 --> 00:53:38,301
mutation positive they would have their test quite young.

1098
00:53:38,301 --> 00:53:39,810
The mutation would be found.

1099
00:53:39,810 --> 00:53:42,834
Then they would do the annual colon examinations and once

1100
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:44,913
they started developing adenomas they

1101
00:53:44,913 --> 00:53:47,730
would probably have a prophylactic mastectomy.

1102
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:50,857
And then they would have to they might enroll in some sort of prevention

1103
00:53:50,857 --> 00:53:52,924
trial and they would probably have subsequent

1104
00:53:52,924 --> 00:53:55,321
surveillance for Bechtel and extra colonic tumors.

1105
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,090
All right so let's talk about HNPCC

1106
00:54:01,090 --> 00:54:05,351
which is the other inherited colorectal cancer syndrome.

1107
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,751
It is the commonest one.

1108
00:54:07,751 --> 00:54:13,801
This is the one that causes about 5% of colon cancers.

1109
00:54:13,801 --> 00:54:14,980
Right?

1110
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:19,410
So again really high lifetime risk.

1111
00:54:19,410 --> 00:54:21,560
And young agent onset if you have this.

1112
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,140
Okay.

1113
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,400
It's also called lynch syndrome.

1114
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,065
There's an increased risk of colorectal cancer but

1115
00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:31,080
can be other extra colonic tumors as well.

1116
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,663
There's kind of divided in the lynch one and lynch to lynch

1117
00:54:33,663 --> 00:54:36,521
one is where you basically only have colon cancer in the family.

1118
00:54:36,521 --> 00:54:39,311
But lynch two is where you have colon plus other things.

1119
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:43,152
So the increased risk is due to inherited mutations

1120
00:54:43,152 --> 00:54:45,220
in DNA repair genes and we'll get into that.

1121
00:54:45,220 --> 00:54:46,470
So I just said this.

1122
00:54:46,470 --> 00:54:48,976
So autosomal dominant with inheritance of the

1123
00:54:48,976 --> 00:54:52,600
condition from apparent autosomal dominant on a pedigree.

1124
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,593
Typically autosomal dominant but you do have

1125
00:54:54,593 --> 00:54:56,340
to lose both copies to get the disease.

1126
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:57,760
Okay.

1127
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,661
And not all patients with HNPCC genetic mutation have a parent who had cancer.

1128
00:55:01,661 --> 00:55:04,610
There are Genova mutations of this as well.

1129
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,136
And it can also be that on a pedigree you don't

1130
00:55:07,136 --> 00:55:11,941
see it because there could be incomplete penetrates variable age cancer diagnosis.

1131
00:55:11,941 --> 00:55:15,179
So if someone died young from something else you wouldn't

1132
00:55:15,179 --> 00:55:19,540
they wouldn't have the opportunity to get cancer for example.

1133
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,941
Okay so it's probably will present with no symptoms.

1134
00:55:22,941 --> 00:55:23,111
Right?

1135
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:27,120
The symptoms of HNPCC are going to be when you have colon cancer

1136
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:32,000
and you're gonna have symptoms of your cancer or whatever cancer you get.

1137
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,720
Okay.

1138
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,346
People develop polyps at a rate similar to the general population but

1139
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:39,490
in HNPCC the polyps degenerate the cancer in 2 to 3 years.

1140
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:44,000
Okay because they have a mutation further down the list in that natural history.

1141
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,346
Right So the majority of HNPCC is caused by mutations in

1142
00:55:48,346 --> 00:55:54,600
one or more of several mismatch repair genes which are listed here.

1143
00:55:54,600 --> 00:56:03,070
MSH2 and too many MLH1 account for the majority.

1144
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:08,170
Okay but this is what I'm saying right am

1145
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:13,130
I saying the right one heterogeneity.

1146
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:13,580
Right?

1147
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:17,970
Lots of different gene mutations and lots of different genes cause the same outcome.

1148
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:21,921
>> Locus heterogeneity.

1149
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:22,480
>> That's right.

1150
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,757
APC is an example of heterogeneity because different

1151
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,690
alleles in the gene can cause the same outcome.

1152
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:30,681
This is locus heterogeneity because changes the

1153
00:56:30,681 --> 00:56:32,640
different low side can cause the same outcome.

1154
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:33,120
Thank you.

1155
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,540
I don't know why my brain.

1156
00:56:34,540 --> 00:56:35,440
It's too early.

1157
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,451
More coffee.

1158
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:40,291
Okay.

1159
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:43,790
All right.

1160
00:56:43,790 --> 00:56:47,500
So specifically there's about 70-82% lifetime risk of colon cancer.

1161
00:56:47,500 --> 00:56:51,381
12% chance of ovarian and 60% chance of endometrial.

1162
00:56:53,990 --> 00:56:57,270
[COUGH] So this was our little pie.

1163
00:56:57,270 --> 00:57:00,420
This was our 5% of colon cancer caused by HNPCC if

1164
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,420
you take that 5% to make it its own pie, you can

1165
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:07,320
see that the majority are caused by mutations in MSH2 or MLH1

1166
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,761
and then kind of these other rare things and these unknown mutations.

1167
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:12,990
Right?

1168
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:17,120
So this is a tougher scenario for genetic testing, right?

1169
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:20,888
Because there's way more genes where more things that can cause it and so

1170
00:57:20,888 --> 00:57:24,680
you're more likely not to be able to find the exact mutation in a family.

1171
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:25,221
Right.

1172
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,470
Okay.

1173
00:57:28,470 --> 00:57:30,950
So if you suspect HNPCC one approach is to proceed

1174
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:34,639
directly to mutation analysis of these genes blood testing for germline

1175
00:57:34,639 --> 00:57:38,269
mutations in these mismatch repair genes when a family history clearly

1176
00:57:38,269 --> 00:57:42,038
meets it or tumor testing for MSI before considering mutation analysis.

1177
00:57:42,038 --> 00:57:44,410
I think honestly now one of the things that's

1178
00:57:44,410 --> 00:57:46,908
really been going on in genetic testing and I'm

1179
00:57:46,908 --> 00:57:49,157
sure you guys have talked about this is that

1180
00:57:49,157 --> 00:57:51,110
the cost of it is coming down so much.

1181
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:54,761
It used to be that it was thousands of dollars to do a handful of genes.

1182
00:57:54,761 --> 00:57:57,770
And you had to get all this okaying from the insurance companies in

1183
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:00,021
order to do it and you do this kind of one at a time.

1184
00:58:00,021 --> 00:58:02,531
You pick the most likely want to do that.

1185
00:58:02,531 --> 00:58:04,485
And if that didn't pan out, then you have to go back

1186
00:58:04,485 --> 00:58:07,150
to the insurance company and get permission to do the next one.

1187
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:09,541
And now you can do these multi gene panels.

1188
00:58:09,541 --> 00:58:13,142
There's probably colorectal cancer panel out there that has like 30 genes on it

1189
00:58:13,142 --> 00:58:16,190
that a patient can pay out of pocket $250 and they can get it done.

1190
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:21,410
Okay so I think this kind of conservative.

1191
00:58:21,410 --> 00:58:24,370
Well let's test for MSI and really make sure

1192
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:27,260
I think I think that is less commonly done.

1193
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:32,701
I think they still try to steer patients genetic counselors at least at the

1194
00:58:32,701 --> 00:58:38,496
cancer genetics clinic here will still try to steer patients toward choosing a

1195
00:58:38,496 --> 00:58:44,643
more limited panel that has genes where there's some known clinical significance

1196
00:58:44,643 --> 00:58:50,210
and known clinical guidelines for what to do if you have a mutation in them.

1197
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:51,611
You can include 30 genes.

1198
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,372
But some of those genes may be things where

1199
00:58:53,372 --> 00:58:55,232
we don't really know that much about what to

1200
00:58:55,232 --> 00:58:56,992
do if you have a mutation and then there's

1201
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:59,290
no evidence to base any recommendations on for them.

1202
00:58:59,290 --> 00:58:59,760
Right.

1203
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,761
So I think that this kind of approach

1204
00:59:01,761 --> 00:59:04,565
maybe being phased out and then maybe jumping just

1205
00:59:04,565 --> 00:59:06,834
to doing some sort of panel that includes

1206
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,521
these kinds of genes on it because it's cheap.

1207
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:16,771
But that said MSI are really common in HNPCC tumors.

1208
00:59:16,771 --> 00:59:19,945
These are repeated sequences of DNA although the length varies from

1209
00:59:19,945 --> 00:59:23,061
person to person, each one, each person has a micro satellites of

1210
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:25,787
a set length and in cells that have mutations in these genes

1211
00:59:25,787 --> 00:59:29,440
some of these DNA sequences accumulate errors and become longer or shorter.

1212
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,783
Okay so what you can do is you can kind of

1213
00:59:31,783 --> 00:59:35,170
look at this is an example of what this might look like.

1214
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:40,791
This is a micro satellite normal and tumor.

1215
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:44,401
Okay so you can see that this is what the normal looks like.

1216
00:59:44,401 --> 00:59:46,170
And the tumor kind of follows the normal light.

1217
00:59:46,170 --> 00:59:49,081
But this is micro micro satellite instability.

1218
00:59:49,081 --> 00:59:50,496
So you can kind of see that in the

1219
00:59:50,496 --> 00:59:53,546
tumor these microsatellites are really changing in terms of their

1220
00:59:53,546 --> 00:59:55,779
length compared to the normal and that would be an

1221
00:59:55,779 --> 00:59:58,640
indication that you might have a mismatch repair gene issue.

1222
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,800
Okay.

1223
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,230
So this can happen.

1224
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:08,871
And this is 90% in HNPCC tumors but 15 to 20% in sporadic colorectal cancer tumors.

1225
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:12,729
So it's not like a perfect correlation, okay?

1226
01:00:12,729 --> 01:00:16,901
[COUGH] All right.

1227
01:00:18,730 --> 01:00:24,150
So again both copies have to be altered before a person will develop cancer.

1228
01:00:24,150 --> 01:00:27,454
And that's why you can get these kind of for whatever reason, this

1229
01:00:27,454 --> 01:00:31,411
particular mutation tends to manifest more in the colon than in other tissues.

1230
01:00:31,411 --> 01:00:35,140
But you can get tumors in these other places as well.

1231
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:41,642
All right, remember that the loss of any of these genes that these people with

1232
01:00:41,642 --> 01:00:47,770
the hereditary syndromes come with, you have to lose that second copy.

1233
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:49,861
And then you also have to have other mutations.

1234
01:00:49,861 --> 01:00:53,589
Remember our picture of the normal cells and then the first mutation cells.

1235
01:00:53,589 --> 01:00:58,630
Remember they're starting kind of halfway to that first mutation, right?

1236
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:01,871
And then they have to lose that second copy and then they continue on.

1237
01:01:01,871 --> 01:01:04,890
Then they've got the first mutation and they continue on essentially, right?

1238
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,731
So they still have to have these other mutations.

1239
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:11,430
It's just that it's really likely it's gonna happen in their lifetime, right?

1240
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:13,871
Because they come here with kind of that one big hit already.

1241
01:01:15,100 --> 01:01:17,767
All right, so these are some of the criteria that people

1242
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:21,246
have used to try to identify candidates for molecular genetic testing.

1243
01:01:21,246 --> 01:01:24,397
They have been revised over the years.

1244
01:01:24,397 --> 01:01:26,561
[COUGH] And again, I think as the cost

1245
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:29,448
of genetic testing comes down ,people are much

1246
01:01:29,448 --> 01:01:32,698
less concerned about making sure that these criteria

1247
01:01:32,698 --> 01:01:35,970
are met in order to get somebody genetically tested.

1248
01:01:35,970 --> 01:01:41,861
These are the 1999 version and as I say, they've changed over time.

1249
01:01:41,861 --> 01:01:45,300
And I think these are the criteria that clinicians will use to

1250
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:49,710
refer somebody for genetic testing that would then be covered by insurance.

1251
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:54,481
But a lot of patients will opt for genetic testing for cancer susceptibility.

1252
01:01:54,481 --> 01:01:56,980
If they have a family history and they're worried about

1253
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:59,861
it, they'll pay out of pocket $250 for the panel, right?

1254
01:02:01,470 --> 01:02:06,215
So that kind of direct consumer marketing of these genetic panels is

1255
01:02:06,215 --> 01:02:11,400
becoming more of an issue and genetic counselors don't love it, right?

1256
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,489
Because then these patients are gonna be getting this information and they may

1257
01:02:14,489 --> 01:02:16,221
not be seeking genetic counseling to really

1258
01:02:16,221 --> 01:02:18,066
understand what to do with that information.

1259
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:23,311
[COUGH] All right, so as I said these have evolved.

1260
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:29,081
And if you if you know the thing is that if you can identify the HNPCC

1261
01:02:29,081 --> 01:02:34,480
mutation, then you can test the rest of the family members for it, right?

1262
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,164
Because now you know, it's this change now I'm looking

1263
01:02:37,164 --> 01:02:39,911
for that change in the offspring of this person for example.

1264
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:47,450
All right, so there are limitations of the screening criteria, right?

1265
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:50,580
Many but not all families meet these strict criteria.

1266
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,602
And it's kind of unreliable from family

1267
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:55,770
history verification especially in small families, right?

1268
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:56,983
So if you have a suggestive

1269
01:02:56,983 --> 01:02:59,578
family history, a discussion with genetic counselors

1270
01:02:59,578 --> 01:03:03,401
or geneticists may be warranted and they may still refer you for genetic testing.

1271
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:10,540
Okay, [COUGH] so here's some surveillance options.

1272
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:13,690
Since we're worried about multiple cancers in these patients, if you're

1273
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:17,195
worried about colorectal cancer, the intervention would be to do colonoscopies.

1274
01:03:17,195 --> 01:03:18,847
Beginning quite young compared to the

1275
01:03:18,847 --> 01:03:21,240
general population and repeating quite frequently.

1276
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,559
Because remember they get polyps at a rate

1277
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:26,409
similar to the general population but those polyps

1278
01:03:26,409 --> 01:03:29,324
degenerate to cancer very quickly in HNPCC patients

1279
01:03:29,324 --> 01:03:32,330
which is why the screening interval is much shorter.

1280
01:03:32,330 --> 01:03:35,311
And you really don't want to miss a polyp by starting when they're older.

1281
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,541
So you start young, right?

1282
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:41,865
We don't actually have any population based screening

1283
01:03:41,865 --> 01:03:44,901
for endometrial cancer and for the general population.

1284
01:03:44,901 --> 01:03:49,532
And so these things have not actually been evaluated terribly positively in terms

1285
01:03:49,532 --> 01:03:51,748
of their likelihood of really catching

1286
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:54,311
cancers and preventing death due to cancer.

1287
01:03:54,311 --> 01:03:55,757
But it's kind of all we have and so in

1288
01:03:55,757 --> 01:03:58,140
these very high risk people, we'll still do it, right?

1289
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:01,091
So transvaginal ultrasound which is essentially just

1290
01:04:01,091 --> 01:04:03,271
put an ultrasound wand that's the shape

1291
01:04:03,271 --> 01:04:06,950
to go into the vagina and then you can look into the uterus with that.

1292
01:04:06,950 --> 01:04:10,061
This is what they use in early pregnancy, right?

1293
01:04:10,061 --> 01:04:11,481
When pregnancies are later, you can use

1294
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:13,041
the ultrasound on the outside of the belly.

1295
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:15,792
But in very early pregnancy, they use the

1296
01:04:15,792 --> 01:04:20,281
transvaginal ultrasound or TVU or endometrial aspirate, right?

1297
01:04:20,281 --> 01:04:25,890
So trying to get some sort of like cells from endometrial lining and look at them.

1298
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:29,821
Okay, and that might be done annually starting at age 25 to 35.

1299
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:34,868
So this works, right, especially for colorectal cancer

1300
01:04:34,868 --> 01:04:37,770
because we know that colonoscopy is very effective.

1301
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:40,722
So this was an older study but it looked at these

1302
01:04:40,722 --> 01:04:45,890
people patients in HNPCC families who had not developed colorectal cancer yet.

1303
01:04:45,890 --> 01:04:48,343
And you can see that they were followed for 10 years

1304
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:51,380
and in those who had no surveillance, that's the yellow line.

1305
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,520
Almost 12% of them developed colon cancer over the 12 years.

1306
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:55,947
But in those who did have the

1307
01:04:55,947 --> 01:04:59,623
recommended colonoscopy surveillance, only 4.5% did, okay?

1308
01:04:59,623 --> 01:05:00,714
So this it works.

1309
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:07,373
You could do prophylactic surgery.

1310
01:05:07,373 --> 01:05:11,301
You could have colectomy, hysterectomy and oophorectomy.

1311
01:05:11,301 --> 01:05:15,500
So this is removing the ovaries and hysterectomy is removing the uterus.

1312
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:18,030
But surgery doesn't totally eliminate cancer risk.

1313
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:20,760
And an expert panel has made no recommendation

1314
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,351
for or against it due to unproven efficacy.

1315
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:27,709
All right.

1316
01:05:27,709 --> 01:05:32,397
Any questions about that before we switch gears to breast and ovarian?

1317
01:05:32,397 --> 01:05:35,185
[COUGH] All right, so these are kind of the

1318
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:39,299
risk factors for breast cancer in the general population.

1319
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:41,777
A lot of them are related to hormonal factors kind

1320
01:05:41,777 --> 01:05:45,108
of lifetime exposure to estrogen sort of the running theme here.

1321
01:05:45,108 --> 01:05:49,591
Note that these are risk factors for kind of the most common types of breast cancer.

1322
01:05:49,591 --> 01:05:52,529
There are some subtypes of breast cancer like triple negative

1323
01:05:52,529 --> 01:05:55,761
breast cancer for example, for which these are not as meaningful.

1324
01:05:57,020 --> 01:06:00,410
This is another pie showing you how much is hereditary.

1325
01:06:00,410 --> 01:06:05,664
You have this sporadic family kind of the family history but this 5 to 10% of

1326
01:06:05,664 --> 01:06:08,930
breast cancer is really thought to be hereditary

1327
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:12,447
and a similar proportion of ovarian cancer, okay?

1328
01:06:12,447 --> 01:06:13,957
So these are some of the

1329
01:06:13,957 --> 01:06:17,781
causes of hereditary susceptibility to breast cancer.

1330
01:06:17,781 --> 01:06:20,010
The big ones of course are BRCA1 and 2.

1331
01:06:20,010 --> 01:06:22,575
How many of you guys have heard of this?

1332
01:06:22,575 --> 01:06:24,246
Yeah, most people have.

1333
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:29,161
You also have locus heterogeneity in breast cancer.

1334
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:31,841
So mutations in different genes can cause the same disease.

1335
01:06:31,841 --> 01:06:36,151
So BRCA1 or BRCA2, right, which are on totally different chromosomes in fact.

1336
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:42,092
So BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 17.

1337
01:06:42,092 --> 01:06:46,300
Again in a pedigree, it looks like autosomal dominant transmission.

1338
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:50,650
Okay, about 500 different mutations have been reported.

1339
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,433
And in fact, did anybody see Mary Claire

1340
01:06:52,433 --> 01:06:54,486
King's talk when she came earlier this year?

1341
01:06:54,486 --> 01:06:59,302
So she was one of the people who was responsible for identifying this gene.

1342
01:06:59,302 --> 01:07:00,359
>> She will revisit.

1343
01:07:00,359 --> 01:07:03,000
>> Okay, cool.

1344
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:08,891
All right, so the lifetime risk for cancers for BRCA1 mutation

1345
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:13,921
carriers for breast cancer, it can be 50 to 85%.

1346
01:07:13,921 --> 01:07:15,905
Usually it has an early age of onset.

1347
01:07:15,905 --> 01:07:18,493
A second primary breast cancer, the risk is 40 to 60%.

1348
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:21,474
Ovarian cancer 15 to 45.

1349
01:07:21,474 --> 01:07:25,582
Does anyone know why we have these kind of wildly different penetrance estimates?

1350
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:34,113
>> Does it depend on where they have been?

1351
01:07:34,113 --> 01:07:36,266
>> Yeah, it kind of depends on where in the

1352
01:07:36,266 --> 01:07:39,151
mutation or where in the gene you have the mutation.

1353
01:07:39,151 --> 01:07:41,670
Sorry, I just skip some words in the middle there.

1354
01:07:41,670 --> 01:07:44,760
Yeah, that's part of it.

1355
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,839
And also part of it is that when they first identified these [COUGH]

1356
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:52,851
genes, do you remember kind of how they did that in that paper?

1357
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:57,280
Who did they recruit?

1358
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:00,278
Families, yeah.

1359
01:08:00,278 --> 01:08:01,504
How did they pick those families?

1360
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,201
What did they have in common?

1361
01:08:08,201 --> 01:08:09,920
Why did they pick them?

1362
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:10,634
>> History of breast cancer.

1363
01:08:10,634 --> 01:08:11,910
>> History of breast cancer.

1364
01:08:11,910 --> 01:08:14,769
But when you're looking for a gene for the

1365
01:08:14,769 --> 01:08:19,360
first time, you're kind of picking the worst families, right?

1366
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:23,711
So in these early studies, they kind of chose these families to study

1367
01:08:23,711 --> 01:08:28,310
that had just the most profound history of breast cancer in that family.

1368
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,160
Just tons of breast cancer, right?

1369
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,626
So you're kind of automatically picking the families that have the

1370
01:08:33,626 --> 01:08:37,910
highest penetrance and then getting your penetrance estimate from that, right?

1371
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:41,330
So as we've learned more and identified the gene and now can look for the gene

1372
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:43,414
in other families, it's clear that there are

1373
01:08:43,414 --> 01:08:45,831
some families in which the penetrance is much lower.

1374
01:08:45,831 --> 01:08:49,796
So these 85% estimates are from those earlier studies where but by

1375
01:08:49,796 --> 01:08:52,256
the way, you're selecting your sample,

1376
01:08:52,256 --> 01:08:55,281
you're picking the highest penetrates families.

1377
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:56,110
Does that make sense?

1378
01:08:56,110 --> 01:08:58,361
I mean it makes sense for finding the gene.

1379
01:08:58,361 --> 01:08:59,570
Like that's how you find the gene, right?

1380
01:08:59,570 --> 01:09:03,240
But it just means that it's probably not that high for most people.

1381
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:11,430
Okay, men who are BRCA1 carriers have increased prostate risk for example, okay?

1382
01:09:11,430 --> 01:09:14,347
[COUGH] So this is an example of

1383
01:09:14,347 --> 01:09:19,701
that comparing the risk in different populations.

1384
01:09:19,701 --> 01:09:23,350
So this is the general population breast cancer risk by age.

1385
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:26,851
Here at BRCA1, carriers are Ashkenazi Jewish population.

1386
01:09:26,851 --> 01:09:28,958
So Ashkenazi Jews have a kind of a

1387
01:09:28,958 --> 01:09:32,960
high rate of these mutations in that population.

1388
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:36,238
And here are BRCA1 carriers from some particular study

1389
01:09:36,238 --> 01:09:39,871
where they were recruiting very high risk families, right?

1390
01:09:39,871 --> 01:09:41,696
So you can see that kind of what

1391
01:09:41,696 --> 01:09:45,433
population you picked to study penetrance estimates vary.

1392
01:09:45,433 --> 01:09:47,901
BRCA2 is on chromosome 13.

1393
01:09:47,901 --> 01:09:52,010
As we said, it also has phenotypically autosomal dominant transmission.

1394
01:09:52,010 --> 01:09:54,871
About 300 different mutations have been reported.

1395
01:09:56,340 --> 01:10:00,570
And you can see here that the ovarian cancer risk is a bit higher with BRCA2.

1396
01:10:00,570 --> 01:10:02,239
And here are the breast cancer risks.

1397
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:08,161
This BRCA2 mutation also carries a somewhat increased risk of male breast

1398
01:10:08,161 --> 01:10:13,998
cancer which is very rare and other things pancreatic perhaps., okay?

1399
01:10:13,998 --> 01:10:15,066
Yeah.

1400
01:10:15,066 --> 01:10:19,103
>> So why is breast cancer or ovarian cancer so tied together

1401
01:10:19,103 --> 01:10:23,574
but you don't really get the same with male breast cancer and-

1402
01:10:23,574 --> 01:10:24,988
>> Testicular or something like that?

1403
01:10:24,988 --> 01:10:25,932
>> Yeah.

1404
01:10:25,932 --> 01:10:28,420
>> I think I don't know.

1405
01:10:28,420 --> 01:10:30,341
I don't know that anybody necessarily knows that.

1406
01:10:30,341 --> 01:10:36,482
I mean kind of why these mutations in these specific genes cause these specific

1407
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:42,270
cancers is a little kind of one of those things that's still under study.

1408
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:44,100
It's interesting though.

1409
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,338
I mean if they have the mutation in

1410
01:10:45,338 --> 01:10:47,871
every swollen body, why aren't they getting cancer everywhere?

1411
01:10:47,871 --> 01:10:49,441
Why is it mostly in this tissue?

1412
01:10:49,441 --> 01:10:53,461
And that's kind of an interesting thing.

1413
01:10:53,461 --> 01:10:55,083
>> I'm obviously kind of curious why wasn't ovarian cancer

1414
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:57,178
specifically more tide to like testicular cancer or something like that?

1415
01:10:57,178 --> 01:11:00,257
>> I know, they do have sort of a different ideology.

1416
01:11:00,257 --> 01:11:02,577
I mean breast and ovarian cancer have similar risk factors.

1417
01:11:02,577 --> 01:11:03,421
>> Okay.

1418
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:06,581
>> So I don't know.

1419
01:11:07,780 --> 01:11:10,530
Yeah, it's I don't know.

1420
01:11:10,530 --> 01:11:14,501
That's a good question for a cancer biologist.

1421
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:22,798
All right, so as we said, an estimated 1 in 40 Ashkenazi Jews carry a BRCA1

1422
01:11:22,798 --> 01:11:29,051
or 2 mutation and they tend to have specific mutations in those populations.

1423
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:33,214
All right, so we said that there

1424
01:11:33,214 --> 01:11:36,141
are other conditions associated with increased breast cancers.

1425
01:11:36,141 --> 01:11:37,903
Remember at the beginning we said that

1426
01:11:37,903 --> 01:11:40,270
people who have Li-Fraumeni syndrome tend to have

1427
01:11:40,270 --> 01:11:42,305
young onset breast cancers and some of these

1428
01:11:42,305 --> 01:11:44,741
other things also can increase breast cancer risk.

1429
01:11:44,741 --> 01:11:46,769
So I certainly don't want to give you the impression.

1430
01:11:46,769 --> 01:11:48,642
Those tables that I showed you that have this kind of

1431
01:11:48,642 --> 01:11:51,370
long list of things that are associated with familial cancer syndromes.

1432
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:54,348
There are other things and genetic counselors will test

1433
01:11:54,348 --> 01:11:57,135
for multiple genes that there's a family history of

1434
01:11:57,135 --> 01:12:01,398
breast but kind of the big one with the bullet that they look for is BRCA1 and 2.

1435
01:12:01,398 --> 01:12:04,808
So for ovarian as we said, about 5 tp 10% of hereditary.

1436
01:12:04,808 --> 01:12:08,427
70% of those are caused by BRCA1 mutations and about

1437
01:12:08,427 --> 01:12:12,671
20% caused by BRCA2 mutations and then other things as well.

1438
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:16,601
So these are the red flags.

1439
01:12:16,601 --> 01:12:20,271
If you were to go to a cancer genetics clinic or a physician oncologist and

1440
01:12:20,271 --> 01:12:22,980
you started talking about these families, these are

1441
01:12:22,980 --> 01:12:25,045
the red flags that would pop up, right?

1442
01:12:25,045 --> 01:12:28,268
So multiple cases of early onset breast cancer in the family.

1443
01:12:28,268 --> 01:12:32,687
Ovarian cancer with a family history of breast in particular

1444
01:12:32,687 --> 01:12:36,941
is like big red flags start waving or just ovarian cancer.

1445
01:12:36,941 --> 01:12:40,781
Breast and ovarian cancer in the same woman, right?

1446
01:12:40,781 --> 01:12:44,440
So if an individual has had both breast and ovarian and you're like

1447
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:48,181
we should test you for back and one and two bilateral breast cancer.

1448
01:12:48,181 --> 01:12:52,623
So separate breast separate cancers in both breasts occurring

1449
01:12:52,623 --> 01:12:57,500
kind of simultaneously but not like a metastases, right?

1450
01:12:57,500 --> 01:12:59,444
If a woman has Ashkenazi Jewish heritage or

1451
01:12:59,444 --> 01:13:01,560
if there's male breast cancer in the family.

1452
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:04,726
So these are those things that if a patient comes in and starts talking

1453
01:13:04,726 --> 01:13:08,350
about these things in their family, it's like ding ding ding ding ding ding.

1454
01:13:08,350 --> 01:13:11,271
Everyone wants to start testing for BRCA1 or 2.

1455
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:18,321
I will say now that the cost of genetic testing has come down and we also have

1456
01:13:18,321 --> 01:13:21,841
some drugs part inhibitors in particular that are

1457
01:13:21,841 --> 01:13:26,139
really good at treating BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutated cancers.

1458
01:13:26,139 --> 01:13:28,282
They will now as part of clinical practice in some

1459
01:13:28,282 --> 01:13:30,916
places do BRCA1 and 2 testing on breast cancer patients.

1460
01:13:30,916 --> 01:13:33,108
Just as part of their clinical treatment to kind of

1461
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:36,940
determine if they're good candidates for these part inhibitor treatments, right?

1462
01:13:36,940 --> 01:13:39,260
So I don't know that's being done everywhere but certainly a

1463
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:43,550
cancer center like University of Michigan that's something that would likely happen.

1464
01:13:43,550 --> 01:13:46,579
Does that make sense?

1465
01:13:46,579 --> 01:13:51,264
Okay, so again these are the benefits, risks and limitations of BRCA testing.

1466
01:13:51,264 --> 01:13:54,975
[COUGH] Similar to any other kind of genetic testing, it will

1467
01:13:54,975 --> 01:14:00,520
identify high risk individuals and noncarriers so they don't have to worry.

1468
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:03,541
It allows for early detection and prevention strategies.

1469
01:14:03,541 --> 01:14:05,800
What would be a prevention strategy?

1470
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:10,012
What kind of the clinical prevention strategy is if you have a BRCA1 or 2?

1471
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:10,983
>> Masectomy.

1472
01:14:10,983 --> 01:14:13,513
>> Prophylactic mastectomy and oopherectomy.

1473
01:14:13,513 --> 01:14:16,121
Of course we have a very high profile famous person

1474
01:14:16,121 --> 01:14:18,611
who's come out and said that she had this done.

1475
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:19,817
Does anyone remember?

1476
01:14:19,817 --> 01:14:20,679
>> Angelina Jolie.

1477
01:14:20,679 --> 01:14:21,550
>> Angelina Jolie.

1478
01:14:21,550 --> 01:14:24,937
Yeah, and in fact the genetic counselors that I've talked to have said that after

1479
01:14:24,937 --> 01:14:26,310
she did that, a lot of people were

1480
01:14:26,310 --> 01:14:28,500
self referring for BRCA1 and 2 testing actually.

1481
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:35,480
So it actually did impact clinical things in the clinic.

1482
01:14:35,480 --> 01:14:37,738
All right, and it can relieve anxiety if you're in a

1483
01:14:37,738 --> 01:14:40,840
family with a strong family history that you don't have this, right?

1484
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:43,340
Unfortunately it doesn't detect all mutations.

1485
01:14:43,340 --> 01:14:46,430
Some mutations are gonna be of unknown clinical significance.

1486
01:14:46,430 --> 01:14:48,667
The likelihood that you're gonna get a

1487
01:14:48,667 --> 01:14:52,263
variant of unknown significance or uncertain significance of

1488
01:14:52,263 --> 01:14:56,290
the US is what they call it increases a lot if you're not white, okay?

1489
01:14:56,290 --> 01:15:01,290
Because the genetic structure in nonwhite populations is less well.

1490
01:15:01,290 --> 01:15:03,768
Studied because there are fewer people in

1491
01:15:03,768 --> 01:15:06,755
those populations who have had testing, right?

1492
01:15:06,755 --> 01:15:10,493
So black women have come down quite a

1493
01:15:10,493 --> 01:15:15,737
bit, Asian women are still lagging a bit behind.

1494
01:15:15,737 --> 01:15:21,629
So the more genes you test and the more likely that you're gonna have this VUS.

1495
01:15:21,629 --> 01:15:23,590
And if you're not white more likely, yeah.

1496
01:15:23,590 --> 01:15:30,054
>> So in a situation like this where [INAUDIBLE] Are

1497
01:15:30,054 --> 01:15:36,366
there variants more better characterized-

1498
01:15:36,366 --> 01:15:40,864
>> I think the variants that are common showed you that picture back here.

1499
01:15:40,864 --> 01:15:44,187
So, the common variants in Ashkenazi Jews have been sorta, it

1500
01:15:44,187 --> 01:15:47,968
is clear that there are certain variants are common in the population.

1501
01:15:47,968 --> 01:15:51,593
I don't know for sure but I assume that there can be other ones, right?

1502
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:54,946
But there are certain ones that pop up a lot in Ashkenazi Jews.

1503
01:15:54,946 --> 01:15:55,850
Does that make sense?

1504
01:15:55,850 --> 01:16:02,658
>> Yeah and of all the mutations that we have a decent idea about [INAUDIBLE]

1505
01:16:02,658 --> 01:16:09,364
>> I don't know, that is a good question, we're getting better.

1506
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:13,819
And the other thing is that if a woman gets tested and has a VUS.

1507
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:17,173
Most labs will continue to try to characterize those variants and

1508
01:16:17,173 --> 01:16:20,346
eventually if they find out that it really does do something.

1509
01:16:20,346 --> 01:16:24,729
They will then report back to the provider who ordered the test.

1510
01:16:24,729 --> 01:16:26,454
And then they can contact the person say, turns

1511
01:16:26,454 --> 01:16:28,844
out that variant actually doesn't do anything, you're fine.

1512
01:16:28,844 --> 01:16:31,331
Or it does turn out actually that that's a deleterious

1513
01:16:31,331 --> 01:16:34,265
variant and we should talk more about your management, right?

1514
01:16:34,265 --> 01:16:38,140
So as more knowledge comes up there is a pipeline in place

1515
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:43,762
for disseminating that information to people who've been tested and have VUS.

1516
01:16:43,762 --> 01:16:49,257
Okay, so some of these other things are important as well.

1517
01:16:49,257 --> 01:16:53,398
Okay, so I'm not gonna go through this.

1518
01:16:53,398 --> 01:16:57,276
You can look through this, it basically gives you some idea of

1519
01:16:57,276 --> 01:17:01,395
what you might do based on different BRCA one or two test results.

1520
01:17:01,395 --> 01:17:03,957
I will note that you can also, if you have a

1521
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:08,584
positive BRCA one or two test results, prophylatic surgery is an option.

1522
01:17:08,584 --> 01:17:11,437
There all, are also some chemo prevention options available.

1523
01:17:11,437 --> 01:17:14,342
So tamoxifen for example is a drug [COUGH]

1524
01:17:14,342 --> 01:17:18,226
that can prevent breast cancer and high risk women.

1525
01:17:18,226 --> 01:17:20,925
The trouble is I don't wanna be on it for too long because I think it has a.

1526
01:17:20,925 --> 01:17:22,470
If I remember correctly it has a different

1527
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:24,731
relationship with ovarian cancer than it does with breast.

1528
01:17:24,731 --> 01:17:26,877
And so it's kinda this seesaw effect.

1529
01:17:26,877 --> 01:17:29,787
So if you're on it for too long it can start increasing ovarian cancer risk.

1530
01:17:29,787 --> 01:17:32,118
And so it's not a long term strategy.

1531
01:17:32,118 --> 01:17:39,767
But if for example you wanna give yourself some time then, all right.

1532
01:17:39,767 --> 01:17:42,161
[COUGH] So if you have a BRCA one or

1533
01:17:42,161 --> 01:17:46,137
two mutation you can do monthly breast self exams.

1534
01:17:46,137 --> 01:17:49,198
Which are sorta evidence on those is a bit wishy washy

1535
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:53,246
but it's one of those things where the downside is minimal, right?

1536
01:17:53,246 --> 01:17:54,244
What's the downside?

1537
01:17:54,244 --> 01:17:56,317
If you find something that seems weird you go to the doctor, right?

1538
01:17:56,317 --> 01:17:58,665
So, there are some,

1539
01:18:00,831 --> 01:18:03,526
Screening strategies where they don't seem to work terribly

1540
01:18:03,526 --> 01:18:05,610
well and if you do them it's gonna harm people.

1541
01:18:05,610 --> 01:18:07,440
But this is one where they're gonna go ahead.

1542
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:11,356
But they would also start doing early clinical surveillance.

1543
01:18:11,356 --> 01:18:17,519
Annual assembly, annual clinical breast exams or mammography or MRI even.

1544
01:18:17,519 --> 01:18:23,491
There's no great way to surveil for ovarian cancer, which is why

1545
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:29,256
they really do kinda recommend that women have oophorectomy.

1546
01:18:29,256 --> 01:18:34,137
Particularly once they've kinda sorted out their childbearing choices, right?

1547
01:18:34,137 --> 01:18:36,840
So in a BRCA one or two mutation carrier.

1548
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:40,506
For ovarian cancer the recommendation would be to kinda figure

1549
01:18:40,506 --> 01:18:44,535
out your childbearing choices and plans earlier rather than later.

1550
01:18:44,535 --> 01:18:51,822
And then have your ovaries removed because surveillance is much worse for that.

1551
01:18:51,822 --> 01:18:55,816
[COUGH] Okay, so we said prophylactic mastectomy and

1552
01:18:55,816 --> 01:19:01,188
prophylactic oophorectomy but these are not without risks, right?

1553
01:19:01,188 --> 01:19:04,235
So prophylactic mastectomy removes most but not all breast tissue.

1554
01:19:04,235 --> 01:19:06,237
And there can be a lot of quality of life and

1555
01:19:06,237 --> 01:19:09,570
body image issues related to having your breasts removed for women.

1556
01:19:09,570 --> 01:19:14,611
I think that's kinda obvious and then prophylactic oophorectomy.

1557
01:19:14,611 --> 01:19:23,762
You can still have a residual risk of peritoneal carcinomatosis cancers.

1558
01:19:23,762 --> 01:19:26,016
It does induce surgical menopause.

1559
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:30,837
Okay, so if you have your ovaries removed you're not postmenopausal, right?

1560
01:19:30,837 --> 01:19:33,011
And so you might have to have home replacement

1561
01:19:33,011 --> 01:19:35,768
therapy and that kinda thing if you're a younger woman.

1562
01:19:35,768 --> 01:19:39,196
And of course there's childbearing considerations.

1563
01:19:39,196 --> 01:19:44,027
All right, I told you tamoxifen is an important chemo prevention strategy.

1564
01:19:44,027 --> 01:19:46,683
Taking tamoxifen for 2 to 4 years will reduce the risk

1565
01:19:46,683 --> 01:19:50,172
of contra lateral breast cancer by 75% meaning in the other breast.

1566
01:19:50,172 --> 01:19:52,168
So, this was from a trial where they took women

1567
01:19:52,168 --> 01:19:54,896
who were BRCA carriers who'd had breast cancer in one breast.

1568
01:19:54,896 --> 01:19:57,098
And they gave some of them tamoxifen and actually

1569
01:19:57,098 --> 01:19:59,475
reduced the risk of getting a second breast cancer.

1570
01:19:59,475 --> 01:20:04,612
For high risk women it can reduce the incidence of breast cancer by up to 50%.

1571
01:20:04,612 --> 01:20:08,071
But in this study high risk didn't mean BRCA mutation status.

1572
01:20:08,071 --> 01:20:09,666
They were using other kinda risk

1573
01:20:09,666 --> 01:20:12,277
calculators based on your lifestyle risk factors.

1574
01:20:12,277 --> 01:20:16,614
[COUGH] So, that is another option.

1575
01:20:16,614 --> 01:20:18,261
All right, did I do it?

1576
01:20:18,261 --> 01:20:19,777
I did, it's exactly 9:50AM.

1577
01:20:19,777 --> 01:20:22,243
Do you guys have any any questions about that?

1578
01:20:26,681 --> 01:20:29,895
So, I mean, the hereditary syndromes are kinda rough, right.

1579
01:20:29,895 --> 01:20:34,520
The management is not fun, but all right.

1580
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,155
But they do give us a lot of information about sorta the genetics of cancer.

1581
01:20:37,155 --> 01:20:39,234
And we've learned a lot from what happens

1582
01:20:39,234 --> 01:20:41,503
to people who have these kinds of mutations.

1583
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,109
All right, thanks guys.

1584
01:20:43,109 --> 01:20:44,156
Yeah, thanks for having me.

1585
01:20:44,156 --> 01:20:48,204
>> [APPLAUSE] >> If you still have your exam.

1586
01:20:48,204 --> 01:20:50,531
If you could bring it back and also quick lead.

1587
01:20:50,531 --> 01:20:55,066
Is anybody having trouble registering for 516

1588
01:20:55,066 --> 01:20:59,066
who wants to register for 516 next year?

1589
01:20:59,066 --> 01:21:01,734
>> Time for that is completely different.
