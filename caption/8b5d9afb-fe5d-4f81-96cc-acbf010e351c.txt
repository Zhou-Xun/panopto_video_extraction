1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Now, I'll upload the recordings I've downloaded into Panopto to share with my students.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Look for the Panopto recordings link in your course menu.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you don't see it, you may need to enable it. Scroll all the way down to the settings menu.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:33,000
And navigate to the navigation tab. If Panopto recording's is not in the top list, it will be in this bottom list.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You'll locate it. Clicking the three dots and choosing enable.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That will move it to the top list of tools. You can click and drag to move this around in your menu.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But before you leave this page, go all the way to the bottom and click the save button.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Now we're ready to click on the Panopto recordings link.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:22,000
In my example here, I already have some videos, but we're going to click create to add our meeting recordings and we're gonna choose upload media.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Click the option to choose video and audio files to browse your computer where the downloads are saved.

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:34,000
On my computer, downloaded files saved to the downloads folder.

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Zoom recording start with a GMT file name.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
You can choose one or more videos to upload at one time and click open.

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
These are gonna begin uploading and then begin processing now that the upload is complete.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I can exit this window. Once processing is complete, the video titles will become links to open and play the recording.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
To edit the meeting title, click on the settings button.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The first option is name, click, edit.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Enter in a new title and click Save to upload the transcript file we downloaded.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Go to the captions menu in the left hand of the video settings, I can select Choose File.

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'll look for the GMT and this file type ends in a vtt.

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:03:06,803
And I'll open. And I'll choose upload captions.
