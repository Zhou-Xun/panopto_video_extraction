1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,260
One of the most valuable things

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:08,820
that we can do for
another person is to

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,585
provide constructive
feedback to their work.

4
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:14,820
It's an expression of care,

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,300
right I'm investing
my time into you,

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,315
and if I didn't care I wouldn't
bother to say anything.

7
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:24,195
It's also a really
important thing

8
00:00:24,195 --> 00:00:26,700
for that person and it
validates their work,

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,570
it validates the person as
being worth your attention.

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,110
Now, as much as giving
constructive feedback

11
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,485
is a valuable thing that
we should be doing,

12
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:37,910
the honest truth is we don't
practice it very much.

13
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,429
So I'd like to take
a few moments to discuss

14
00:00:40,429 --> 00:00:44,835
some basic principles of
good constructive feedback.

15
00:00:44,835 --> 00:00:46,970
Now, you may have heard
these before but I

16
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,975
think it's always worth
being reminded of these.

17
00:00:49,975 --> 00:00:53,085
First of all, let's talk
about bad feedback.

18
00:00:53,085 --> 00:00:57,090
Well, bad feedback
dehumanizes the person,

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,050
puts them down, it attacks them,

20
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,970
and it's still directed
globally at that person.

21
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,145
It's about the person,

22
00:01:03,145 --> 00:01:04,410
you're a bad person,

23
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,420
you don't know what you're doing.

24
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,510
As a result, bad feedback
hurts them as an individual.

25
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:15,050
As a result, it's also not
very helpful right it's

26
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,510
not giving them anything
for them to do about it,

27
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,430
I can't change who I am.

28
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,790
So if you just rip into me,

29
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,305
I'm going to feel bad

30
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:27,040
and I can't even do
anything to fix it.

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,050
As a result, bad feedback
is usually about meeting

32
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,310
the needs of the one
who's doing the

33
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,720
criticizing in the first place.

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,390
It's about making that person
feel good as opposed to

35
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,710
helping the other person

36
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,675
feel better and making
their work better.

37
00:01:38,675 --> 00:01:40,820
So let's put that stuff aside.

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,280
We don't want bad feedback.

39
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,690
What are some of the
characteristics of good feedback?

40
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,780
Well, good feedback
values the person.

41
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,030
Explicitly says,

42
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:53,680
your work is important
let's make it better.

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
It provides support for
that person and enables them to

44
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,570
move towards that larger goal

45
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:02,135
of having their work be better.

46
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:05,300
As a result, good
feedback is directed

47
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,470
specifically at aspects of
the work not the person.

48
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,615
Let me reinforce that last point.

49
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:15,365
Bad feedback is about
the person, you are bad.

50
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:17,540
Good feedback is about the work.

51
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,570
We never can't forget
that good people can

52
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,010
sometimes do bad work even

53
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,520
potentially offensive
or problematic work.

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:27,165
When we provide
constructive feedback

55
00:02:27,165 --> 00:02:29,785
always focus the
feedback on the work.

56
00:02:29,785 --> 00:02:33,190
This is the problem with
this piece of work.

57
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:36,910
That now allows the person
whose work it is,

58
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:41,645
to hopefully own that
there is a problem,

59
00:02:41,645 --> 00:02:43,270
but also feel empowered

60
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:45,430
that they might be
able to change it.

61
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,460
So when you've got this idea,

62
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,230
you're directing the feedback

63
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,310
directly at the aspects of the
work that are problematic.

64
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,230
That's when feedback becomes

65
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,735
helpful because it gives
people action steps.

66
00:02:58,735 --> 00:03:02,590
I need to change
this part of the work.

67
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:05,435
That's what needs work so
that I can make it better.

68
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,680
As a result, good
feedback is going to be

69
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,910
sensitive to the person's needs
and to their goals.

70
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:15,730
What are they trying to
accomplish with this?

71
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,760
So how can you make sure that

72
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,440
the feedback you provide will

73
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,565
be positive and constructive?

74
00:03:22,565 --> 00:03:25,105
So let me give you
a few pieces of advice.

75
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:27,115
First, just what I would say,

76
00:03:27,115 --> 00:03:30,250
think about their goals
before you start.

77
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,460
You might think you know
what they're trying to

78
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,895
do with this report or
with this presentation,

79
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:40,045
or this brochure whatever it is,

80
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:42,340
but maybe you're
not sure of that,

81
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,725
find out, think about
what their goals are,

82
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,290
then start with a positive.

83
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:53,795
There's always, and
I do mean always,

84
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:57,235
something that can be
framed positively.

85
00:03:57,235 --> 00:03:59,500
There's two reasons why
you need to do that.

86
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,700
First, starting with
the positive benefits of them,

87
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,720
benefits the person you're
trying to speak to.

88
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,095
It makes them better able
to accept that there is

89
00:04:08,095 --> 00:04:10,060
good in their work as

90
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,520
well as the problems that
you're going to talk about.

91
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,005
Second, it benefits you,

92
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,760
it reminds you that there
is in fact value in

93
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,750
this work even if
the problems are large,

94
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,180
it's going to help
you be more balanced,

95
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,745
be more fair in your criticisms,

96
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:30,650
if you take the time to
think about the positives.

97
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,580
Third, prioritize
your main points.

98
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,800
Now, sometimes there's
lots and lots of things

99
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,890
wrong but this point

100
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:42,155
about prioritizing
is really important.

101
00:04:42,155 --> 00:04:46,230
I review a lot of journal
articles for fellow scientists,

102
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,185
and I've done
this hundreds of times.

103
00:04:48,185 --> 00:04:50,030
When I write these reviews,

104
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,985
I always separate, move aside,

105
00:04:52,985 --> 00:04:54,620
put right up front the first

106
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,100
two or maybe three main points,

107
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,120
then I have all the
other little issues

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,575
and I put them secondary.

109
00:05:00,575 --> 00:05:03,215
The reason I do that
is, I want to be clear.

110
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:05,030
These things, these are

111
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,280
the things that you need to
pay the most attention to,

112
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,010
these are the things
that if you fix them,

113
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,650
will help you the most in
making this paper better.

114
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,430
I take that same idea
of prioritizing

115
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:19,234
the primary messages everytime

116
00:05:19,234 --> 00:05:21,790
I provide constructive feedback.

117
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:25,890
Fourth, be realistic
about what it

118
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:29,210
is you're going to ask
somebody to try and change,

119
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,800
and be specific and

120
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,420
direct about what it

121
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,550
is that you think
needs to be changed.

122
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:37,890
Put another way, if
they can't fix it,

123
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,830
either because of
circumstances there's

124
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,710
no way that they can
possibly change this,

125
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,520
or because you can't
explain how to fix it.

126
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,440
It's probably not
going to be very

127
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,575
helpful to spend lots of
time talking about it.

128
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:54,245
Focus your attention on
the things that can be changed.

129
00:05:54,245 --> 00:05:56,525
That's what will be
the most helpful.

130
00:05:56,525 --> 00:05:58,870
So why do I think it's

131
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:01,925
important to learn how to
give constructive feedback?

132
00:06:01,925 --> 00:06:04,240
Because honestly one of
the things I've learned in

133
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,090
my career is that I
do it all the time.

134
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:09,910
A couple of examples.

135
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,320
Grading. I grade students,
that's constructive feedback.

136
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,200
I supervise employees,

137
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,070
I have to do
performance evaluations,

138
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:21,220
I have to give them
feedback about their work.

139
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,470
Was it good? Was it not good?

140
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:26,530
I also provide feedback
on colleague's work,

141
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:28,985
right I've already
mentioned doing reviewing,

142
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:31,065
or editing of
journal submissions,

143
00:06:31,065 --> 00:06:32,590
but I also have to work with

144
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,780
co-authors on papers or reports,

145
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,840
and sometimes have to critique
this was a good paragraph,

146
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,400
this isn't really clear.

147
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,550
I do teaching observations of
my fellow faculty members,

148
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:47,870
and provide constructive
feedback about how they teach.

149
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,000
All of these things,

150
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,550
are situations in which
these principles of

151
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,050
constructive feedback have proven

152
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,615
to be useful time and time again.

153
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:58,820
Providing feedback is one of

154
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,260
the most common tasks we all

155
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,955
have to do in
our professional lives.

156
00:07:01,955 --> 00:07:03,890
So we really should

157
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,526
invest the effort to
learn how to do it well.
