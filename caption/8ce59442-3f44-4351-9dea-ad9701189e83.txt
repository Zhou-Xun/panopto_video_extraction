1
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:31,930
OK. Good afternoon, everyone. See? Which means there'll be no recording.

2
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:45,470
Oh, get out, I got use. I have to be a little.

3
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:55,430
OK, I'm going to try this and feel like, OK, up here, a little weird, but in order for it to record, get the recording.

4
00:00:55,430 --> 00:01:06,290
So good afternoon. Good to see you again. So one of the things that we are going to start most is with is with the jacket.

5
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:15,290
So lots of people contributed some really incredible stuff to the discussion page because last year,

6
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:20,510
since we were on remotes, I was having people contribute to the chat.

7
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:26,240
And so nice to be able to have a little moment to just write something down.

8
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:31,080
But this is not a this is not an assignment.

9
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:40,830
This is not something for you to do ahead of time. The idea of the check in is that at this moment, we're all here together.

10
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:47,240
Now, you take a moment to say, OK, let's get ready for this class.

11
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,070
You might just walk out of class. And I've just come from lunch with your friends.

12
00:01:52,070 --> 00:02:02,450
You might have just done a lot of things. And so it's a check in say, OK, let's think about what are we doing in this class.

13
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:13,580
So the check in this one sentence is just about not all of these just one of these things.

14
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:24,530
So I really appreciate the people who contributed some really thoughtful contributions to the discussion page.

15
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,750
And people should take a look at those.

16
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:37,190
But this is going to be a moment just for us in the classroom to say, OK, who wants to share something that they're thinking about?

17
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:49,460
And if people usually what I would do is randomly call people to have to share something you learned yesterday or in one of the readings that you

18
00:02:49,460 --> 00:03:01,100
are thinking about or something you heard on the news that connects in some way to the themes and ideas we're talking about in this class or,

19
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,830
you know, some observation that you made as something stuck with you from the last class.

20
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,790
So that's really all it is. It's not meant to be a big assignment.

21
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:17,450
It's just a moment to say, OK, let me try to think about what this class is about,

22
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:24,440
what we've been reading, what last class was OK, so I'm going to make sure no one thinks they have to.

23
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:33,260
This is a big obligation. It should be something that is that that you don't have to prepare for.

24
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:51,570
So so let's give it a shot. Anybody want to share something they've been thinking about?

25
00:03:51,570 --> 00:04:01,540
Obviously, the first week of classes barely done anything except get the introduction to new classes, you maybe read a little bit.

26
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:07,890
So maybe what you're thinking about is, you know, I really want to read the books I mentioned on Tuesdays class.

27
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:18,540
That's OK. But you also might have heard of something in one of your new classes that you're like, wow, I just that's that's sticking with me.

28
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:30,690
And I'm thinking about that. And some of you who wrote really thoughtful things on the discussion page,

29
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:39,630
some of you can take a look at that if you want to, here on the campus side, you can react to that.

30
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:50,340
You might want to volunteer today. Maybe you stated that we all like this.

31
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:57,260
The so I actually I was nervous, but I thought that it was nice to hear the.

32
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:06,420
A lot of to anyone into this. University.

33
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:18,740
Robert. And just like you just said, I'm going to try to learn your names.

34
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:25,460
I definitely don't know everybody's names. And if I must pronounce your name, I really apologize, but I will.

35
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,860
Please tell me how to say your name correctly.

36
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:40,100
And I will I will try and remind you again to use the name recorder in hand to strike down on one of those left hand buttons toward the bottom,

37
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:51,840
I think. And all you do is record yourself saying your name so that other people here to say.

38
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,020
I feel like I.

39
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:03,090
Board, but the article that.

40
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:11,720
Mean, I'm going to think about this a lot, but I can't find anything more about how our health care system is designed.

41
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:17,840
Reactive instead of proactive and how that relates to.

42
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:27,780
I know just as a patient in our health care system, I don't have any tests or scans or platelet.

43
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:34,510
And I've seen it throughout my career in social work, many clients.

44
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:39,730
OK, so connecting and thinking about health care and waste in health care,

45
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:50,970
unnecessary care connected to the health as a soccer game metaphor, the article today, we're going to talk a little more about that today.

46
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:58,660
Thank you. So I hope this discussion work well, like many of us,

47
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:04,600
but I was contemplating the discussion we had about like teamwork and responsibility, accountability, communication,

48
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,500
and I was thinking about the fact that these are good things for developing in the course of the semester because,

49
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:12,850
after all, will be a career in a professional setting.

50
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:18,160
So we're already over when we're done with our master's program as well, right?

51
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:27,250
Yes, absolutely. Most of you. Very few of us that work as independent agents in any field.

52
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:37,070
You might go into fields. So working together, professionally, learning how to communicate, that is really important.

53
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:46,830
No. You go home with the other five kids.

54
00:07:46,830 --> 00:08:00,180
I think, well, it's something that I really like about.

55
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:11,740
Especially with the. So, right, you are only your background, your field, your knowledge, your people,

56
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:20,230
and so that's another connection to working with others and communicating is getting people that.

57
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:47,380
Right, let's do one more video for sure. I think there was a lot of faith in the fact that the U.S. the biggest.

58
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:53,800
OK, that's going to be a theme we're going to talk a lot about how much we spend, like you said earlier,

59
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:03,610
and what we get for all that spending, all that, all the dollars, all those resources that we put into health and health care.

60
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:14,740
And then what is the level of health, the level of quality across the population thinking about that.

61
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,570
OK, so what we were going to be in our mountain teams,

62
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:26,890
we're still not quite there because we getting money from the districts with all the distancing and everything else.

63
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:36,550
So today for discussion, what I mean and what I'd like you to do is talk to some of the people closest to you.

64
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:42,010
So some of you might have to kind of turn your sideways or back.

65
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:45,940
And I know it's a little awkward or distance or wearing masks,

66
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:58,680
but the idea is for you to be able to talk to each other if you feel like you're in a place where you're too far to talk to somebody and you want to,

67
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:06,790
you can do that. People want to anybody wants to kind of move.

68
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:23,840
But what we're going to do. Is just put up some of the reminders about how we approach communicating and talking with each other before you begin.

69
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,880
Make sure you introduce yourself to to each other and so you can talk in twos.

70
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,100
You can talk in threes and fours, if you like.

71
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:40,220
That could work without having, like, yell across the room.

72
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:50,580
And so introduce yourself. And we're going to start by just taking this really basic question.

73
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:56,090
If we're going to be talking about health services, what is health?

74
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:07,370
What do we mean by how how are different ways you would think about what you healthy means, an individual or the population,

75
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:15,830
how what you might be familiar with different ways, different groups or people that are in health.

76
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:21,890
You might want to talk about that. You might want to just think about it from your own perspective.

77
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:27,200
Some of their meetings talk about this. So this is like a really basic question.

78
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:35,750
Right. But it's important to reflect a little bit on what do we even mean by health?

79
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:41,860
And then does that is that the same as disease? Is it the absence of disease or what's that?

80
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:50,220
The connection between health and conflict like disease and illness?

81
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:59,940
And finally, then, if we if we define health in a particular way,

82
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,130
then what are the implications of that for how we might evaluate whether we're healthy,

83
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:12,670
how we might try to measure that we might try to be producing that.

84
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:23,640
That's going to be the next we're going to start with these. And where we're going is to think about then what kind of health services that means.

85
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:36,170
But first, let's start with this question. So we're going to have 15, 20 minutes for you to talk with somebody next to you, Tom.

86
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:43,091
You're the person here you are a couple of people in a in a group that's the.
