1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,670
In this session we'll study inferences and special considerations for

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,290
genetic association studies.

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,470
Learning objectives are to identify the sources of confounding and

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:14,456
genetic association studies.

5
00:00:14,456 --> 00:00:18,190
To describe population stratification and admixture and

6
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,712
identify methods to account for them.

7
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:26,438
And to identify some of the challenges of genome-wide association studies and

8
00:00:26,438 --> 00:00:30,203
describe strategies to address these challenges.

9
00:00:30,203 --> 00:00:34,266
The first thing that we wanna keep in mind when we're looking at

10
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:37,409
the inferences of a genetic association study,

11
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:41,102
is that association is not the same as actual causation.

12
00:00:41,102 --> 00:00:45,545
And that means that if you have a positive statistical finding it

13
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:49,085
doesn't definitively mean that the genotype that

14
00:00:49,085 --> 00:00:52,801
you're testing is causing the outcome of interest.

15
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:57,254
And so if you do detect a statistical association it might be the result

16
00:00:57,254 --> 00:01:01,418
of a direct causal relationship between the SNP and the outcome.

17
00:01:01,418 --> 00:01:05,958
It could be a result of confounding and we think about two different kinds

18
00:01:05,958 --> 00:01:10,798
of confounding, linkage disequilibrium or the good kind of confounding and

19
00:01:10,798 --> 00:01:14,612
population stratification or the bad kind of confounding.

20
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:19,408
Or it could be that you have a spurious association or

21
00:01:19,408 --> 00:01:24,426
a false positive result that happened just by chance.

22
00:01:24,426 --> 00:01:28,384
In epidemiology we think about confounding as a confusion or

23
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:33,896
a mixing of effects from the underlying associations between some third variable,

24
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:37,717
the confounder and the exposure and outcome of interest.

25
00:01:37,717 --> 00:01:42,580
So you're interested in looking at the relationship between the exposure or

26
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,258
the genotype and the outcome your phenotype of interest.

27
00:01:46,258 --> 00:01:50,921
But if you have a confounder which is a variable that's associated with

28
00:01:50,921 --> 00:01:53,563
the phenotype or outcome of interest and

29
00:01:53,563 --> 00:01:58,788
it's also associated with the exposure but it's not a result of the exposure.

30
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:03,700
Then you have this mixing of effects caused by the confounder

31
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,414
called confounding.

32
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,995
Two common sources of confounding and genetic association

33
00:02:08,995 --> 00:02:13,700
studies are from linkage disequilibrium and from population stratification.

34
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,043
Remember that with linkage disequilibrium we're just

35
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:20,457
talking about the correlation between alleles of SNPs in

36
00:02:20,457 --> 00:02:24,244
the same region of the genome within the same haplotype block.

37
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:29,147
So if you're interested in understanding the relationship between a SNP of

38
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:32,978
interest and disease you could measure the SNP directly and

39
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:36,132
test that SNP for association with the disease.

40
00:02:36,132 --> 00:02:41,430
And if you see a result that's a direct association where you've measured the SNP

41
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:46,496
that's causal of the disease, you found the association and so you can say yes

42
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:51,910
this SNP is directly associated with the disease and let's say that it's causal.

43
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:57,188
However one thing that we've been talking about is identifying

44
00:02:57,188 --> 00:03:03,844
tag SNPs across the genome and using them as proxies for other SNPs in the region.

45
00:03:03,844 --> 00:03:09,193
So it could be for example that you've got this SNP in blue and this is the causal

46
00:03:09,193 --> 00:03:15,047
SNP and it's associated with your disease of interest but you haven't measured it.

47
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:18,292
Instead you've measured these tag SNPs in the region the ones in red,

48
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:20,830
all of the tag SNPs are correlated with the causal SNP.

49
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:25,053
So even though you haven't measured the causal SNP you can still see

50
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:27,647
an association between these tag SNPs and

51
00:03:27,647 --> 00:03:31,299
your outcome of interest due to linkage disequilibrium.

52
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:35,901
And that's why it's kind of a good kind of confounding in genetic

53
00:03:35,901 --> 00:03:41,005
association studies because it can allow you to detect an association in

54
00:03:41,005 --> 00:03:46,040
this genomic region without actually measuring the causal variants.

55
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,964
Population stratification is kind of confounding that we don't

56
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,924
want in genetic association studies.

57
00:03:53,924 --> 00:04:00,055
So this occurs remember when two populations are analyzed together and

58
00:04:00,055 --> 00:04:05,990
when I say populations, I mean two groups of different ancestries.

59
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:10,961
And because of this, allele frequencies are correlated with your trait of interest

60
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:13,490
or your phenotype as a result of ancestry.

61
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,002
So for example, you've got some SNP and it has different allele frequencies and

62
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:21,134
African ancestry and European ancestry populations.

63
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:25,062
And you want to see if the SNP is related to diabetes,

64
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:29,707
your trade of interest but you have sampled your population so

65
00:04:29,707 --> 00:04:34,998
that you have African ancestry and European ancestry participants.

66
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:39,367
And this SNP has different allele frequencies in both of those populations.

67
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:43,418
And so because the SNP has different allele frequencies,

68
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:46,400
it's correlated with African ancestry.

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,000
And if African ancestry is also correlated with having diabetes because of

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,620
different reasons it'll look like this SNP is associated with diabetes.

71
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,511
And actually if you're doing this, you'll see a lot of SNPs across

72
00:04:59,511 --> 00:05:03,416
the genome that also look like they're associated with diabetes.

73
00:05:03,416 --> 00:05:07,657
Because any SNP that has a different allele frequency between European and

74
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:12,034
African ancestry populations will look like it's associated with diabetes

75
00:05:12,034 --> 00:05:13,065
statistically.

76
00:05:13,065 --> 00:05:16,404
But that doesn't mean that it's actually causally related to diabetes.

77
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:21,495
So we need to be very careful of population stratification taken into

78
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:26,777
consideration and account for it in our genetic association studies.

79
00:05:26,777 --> 00:05:31,259
Another phenomenon that we need to consider is that of admixture.

80
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:34,602
So this happens when one specific ethnic

81
00:05:34,602 --> 00:05:39,423
group is comprised of multiple ancestral populations and

82
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:44,654
the proportion of each ancestry differs across individuals.

83
00:05:44,654 --> 00:05:49,194
This can lead to SNP associations due to the percent ancestry that's different

84
00:05:49,194 --> 00:05:50,830
across people in the study.

85
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:55,459
So for example, this is showing how you can infer local ancestry or

86
00:05:55,459 --> 00:06:00,351
ancestry differences along the chromosomes in a single individual.

87
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:05,646
So this is a single individual, this is their two copies of chromosome one, let's

88
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:10,431
say the one from the mom is on the top and the one from the dad is on the bottom.

89
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,910
And you can see the different colors of where this chromosome came from.

90
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,323
So the chromosome one from the mom was inferred to be Aafrican ancestry and

91
00:06:20,323 --> 00:06:25,645
then there was a break point where somewhere in that person's history,

92
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:30,553
an ancestor contributed part of a European ancestry chromosome.

93
00:06:30,553 --> 00:06:32,553
And then again, there was another break point and

94
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:34,516
then there was an African ancestry chromosome.

95
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:39,296
And from the dad, you can see that there's also a different combination of African

96
00:06:39,296 --> 00:06:41,840
and European ancestry on that chromosome.

97
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:47,410
And even in the mom and the dad, you can also see for example, some native American

98
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:52,700
ancestry in there at different parts, but there's not a strong influence.

99
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,640
So my point is, is that you can estimate the ancestry

100
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,248
along chromosomes for individuals.

101
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:05,637
Both population stratification and a mixture must be accounted for

102
00:07:05,637 --> 00:07:08,951
to prevent false inferences and genetic studies.

103
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:13,441
And there are a couple of different programs or methods that try to detect and

104
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:16,824
correct for population stratification and admixture.

105
00:07:16,824 --> 00:07:22,330
And that includes the structure program statistical method called genomic control.

106
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:24,463
There are programs like Eigenstrat that can account for

107
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:32,560
population stratification as you're doing your association study.

108
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,839
And this last one principal components analysis is one that is kind

109
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:44,249
of the mainstay of genetic epidemiologists and really is used a lot to account for

110
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:49,823
population stratification and admixture and association studies.

111
00:07:49,823 --> 00:07:53,640
Also you should know the standard in the field is to perform the genetic

112
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,212
association studies separate separately by race, ethnicity.

113
00:07:57,212 --> 00:08:02,920
And so not only do we want to correct for admixture within ancestry group.

114
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:07,515
We also want to make sure that we're analyzing our ancestral

115
00:08:07,515 --> 00:08:11,662
populations independently so that we don't get false

116
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:16,637
associations due to population stratification and admixture.

117
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:22,360
Here we're looking at some plots generated by the Structure program.

118
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,244
So Structure is a program that actually takes parent populations and

119
00:08:27,244 --> 00:08:32,885
looks at your studies sample and kind of distributes them along the ancestral,

120
00:08:32,885 --> 00:08:36,195
distribution between the two parent populations.

121
00:08:36,605 --> 00:08:41,649
In Structure you can specify how many clusters you would like and so

122
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:46,604
here is a triangle plot we've specified K equals two clusters and

123
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:51,590
the clusters that were giving structure are European ancestry.

124
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:56,187
And so in blue is the European ancestry reference panel in

125
00:08:56,187 --> 00:09:01,180
yellow is the African ancestry reference panel.

126
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:03,258
We've also added our study sample.

127
00:09:03,258 --> 00:09:08,099
So I worked with a study called the Genetic Epidemiology Network of

128
00:09:08,099 --> 00:09:13,990
Arteriopathy and we have European ancestry and African ancestry individuals.

129
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:18,350
And so our European ancestry individuals are in red and

130
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:23,186
they are from Rochester Minnesota and that African ancestry

131
00:09:23,186 --> 00:09:28,710
individuals are African-Americans from Jackson, Mississippi.

132
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:34,109
And you can see that the African-Americans cluster these are all

133
00:09:34,109 --> 00:09:39,018
the individual dots are individual people in our sample and

134
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:43,242
most of them have an African ancestry more than they

135
00:09:43,242 --> 00:09:47,095
have European ancestry which is on this side.

136
00:09:47,095 --> 00:09:51,729
The whites in our sample in red alter in the cluster with

137
00:09:51,729 --> 00:09:56,576
the European ancestry sample, the parent population.

138
00:09:56,576 --> 00:10:00,576
So what you can also see is there's a much larger distribution in

139
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:06,225
the African-American individuals because they actually are more admixed population.

140
00:10:06,225 --> 00:10:12,300
Where they have some contribution from the African ancestry and some from European.

141
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,304
And so what we were able to do is take this cluster of Africa-Americans and

142
00:10:17,304 --> 00:10:22,148
actually look at the histogram that shows the percent African ancestry

143
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:24,021
among people in our study.

144
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:28,616
And what you can see is that there are some people in our study who had

145
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:33,650
a strong influence of African ancestry and not much European ancestry.

146
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:38,294
Some people had 100% African ancestry, but there were some

147
00:10:38,294 --> 00:10:44,142
African-Americans who actually had 40% or only 35% African ancestry and

148
00:10:44,142 --> 00:10:49,733
the rest was European ancestry or potentially some other influence as well.

149
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:54,543
And so what you could do is you could take this percent African ancestry across

150
00:10:54,543 --> 00:10:59,279
someone's chromosome and you could put that as a co-variant directly into

151
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,941
your model where you're looking at the relationship between genotype and

152
00:11:03,941 --> 00:11:04,755
phenotype.

153
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:09,954
And you could account for admixture within the African

154
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:16,520
ancestry sample by putting that in as a co-variant for each person.

155
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:21,373
The other thing that's used all the time is principal components analysis.

156
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:27,038
And so, principal component analysis is the data reduction technique that

157
00:11:27,038 --> 00:11:32,982
seeks to find vectors that explain the largest variation in the data possible.

158
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:38,643
So imagine that you're trying to get some indication

159
00:11:38,643 --> 00:11:43,061
of someone's overall body size or type.

160
00:11:43,061 --> 00:11:49,996
Okay, so let's say the x-axis is weight and the y-axis is height.

161
00:11:49,996 --> 00:11:52,410
Height and weight are generally correlated.

162
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:56,830
And if these are individuals you can see that as someone's weight gets higher

163
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,080
usually their height gets higher too.

164
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:01,690
But there's some variability around that.

165
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:07,327
So principal components analysis would seek to draw a line through the axis of

166
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:12,717
the most variation explained which here would be this access right here.

167
00:12:12,717 --> 00:12:18,103
If we draw a line here and we project each of these points onto the line.

168
00:12:18,103 --> 00:12:23,222
What we can see is that if we take a linear combination of someone's weight and

169
00:12:23,222 --> 00:12:27,080
their height and we call that vector one we can explain a lot

170
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:31,370
of the variability in what we see in terms of body size.

171
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:34,895
Then we could take a second vector which is orthogonal or

172
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:38,270
perpendicular to this first vector, which explains

173
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,772
the next largest amount of variability and that would be the axis here.

174
00:12:42,772 --> 00:12:47,496
This is the only variability that's not already accounted for by vector one.

175
00:12:47,496 --> 00:12:55,482
Okay the point is we're taking linear combinations of multiple variables and

176
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:59,846
trying to make a single variable out of it.

177
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:04,008
What you can do with principal components analysis for

178
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:08,986
genetic data is take, let's say one million genetic markers get

179
00:13:08,986 --> 00:13:14,054
the principal components from them and have a principal component

180
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:18,778
one that explains the most variability in that genetic data.

181
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:23,039
And then the principal component two would explain the next most variability in that

182
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:23,827
genetic data.

183
00:13:23,827 --> 00:13:28,684
And it's just a linear combination of the SNPs that someone has the alleles

184
00:13:28,684 --> 00:13:30,940
that someone has at at those SNPs.

185
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:35,470
So one thing that's really interesting is that the SNPs do a great job of

186
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,680
capturing ancestral variation.

187
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,286
And so here you have a plot of Europe and

188
00:13:40,286 --> 00:13:44,770
each of the countries are are colored a different color.

189
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:49,668
And what this study did was they took people from each of these countries in

190
00:13:49,668 --> 00:13:50,310
Europe.

191
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,056
And they actually found people who all four grandparents were from that country.

192
00:13:55,056 --> 00:13:59,771
So they're trying to get pretty representative genetic sample

193
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:02,049
from the country of interest.

194
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:05,594
And what they did was they took genotypes from those people and

195
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,458
they estimated the first principal component and

196
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:12,093
the second principal component, just based on genetic data.

197
00:14:12,093 --> 00:14:16,511
And then they plotted people's values for principal component one and

198
00:14:16,511 --> 00:14:18,506
principal component two here.

199
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:23,576
And what you can see is that principal component one, the largest access of

200
00:14:23,576 --> 00:14:28,820
variability actually ran pretty much along the north south klein in Europe.

201
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,712
And principal component two kind of ran along the east west klein in europe.

202
00:14:32,712 --> 00:14:37,795
Okay, you can see that each individual

203
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:42,270
here is represented as one point.

204
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,450
So that these are all people from Italy down here,

205
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:50,144
these are all people from Italy and where you see the bigger dot that says IT

206
00:14:50,144 --> 00:14:54,780
that's sort of like the central point for everybody who was from Italy.

207
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,871
And if you actually really look at this you can see that

208
00:14:57,871 --> 00:15:02,482
this genetic information almost completely recapitulates the map of Europe.

209
00:15:02,482 --> 00:15:08,957
So people from Portugal over here, here's Spain, here's France, right?

210
00:15:08,957 --> 00:15:13,049
So you can see that the genetics do a pretty good job

211
00:15:13,049 --> 00:15:17,351
of capturing the ancestral information of Europe.

212
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,219
If you look at something like a nationally representative sample of

213
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:26,130
the United States here is what you would see.

214
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:31,525
So we looked at 15,000 participants in the health and retirement study and

215
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:35,830
they were color coded here by self reported race and ethnicity.

216
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:40,732
So what's happening is we have the first genetic principal component on the x-axis,

217
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:43,980
the second genetic principal component on the y-axis.

218
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:50,551
The first principal component explains 4.5% of the information in the genetics.

219
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:59,030
The second the second principal component explains about an additional 1.1%.

220
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:04,506
So the major axis of variability is here between the green and the red.

221
00:16:04,506 --> 00:16:09,610
So the green here are self reported black or African-American and you

222
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:15,667
can see again that distribution where it's going from mostly African ancestry and

223
00:16:15,667 --> 00:16:20,527
then over here is white caucasian, so mostly European ancestry.

224
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:22,657
In the middle here is American-Indian and Alaska native.

225
00:16:22,657 --> 00:16:26,319
And you can also see on the second axis of variability,

226
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:30,856
you're pulling apart the European ancestry with things like Asian

227
00:16:30,856 --> 00:16:35,724
ancestry which is down here and kind of makes a spectrum along this line.

228
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:43,979
One thing that's not captured well is Latino or Latinex ancestry.

229
00:16:43,979 --> 00:16:49,244
So people who are self identified as Mexican-American are marked as squares

230
00:16:49,244 --> 00:16:54,428
not Hispanic are marked as triangles and other Hispanic are marked as plus.

231
00:16:54,428 --> 00:17:00,832
And what you'll see is that a lot of these squares ar kind of together but

232
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:05,875
they're really in this European ancestry kind of mix.

233
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:10,987
The triangles are the vast majority of the sample and the plus is this

234
00:17:10,987 --> 00:17:16,646
other Hispanic, there's an awful lot of pluses in this middle area here.

235
00:17:16,646 --> 00:17:21,814
So we're not really capturing in these two major axes of variability,

236
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:25,710
we're not really capturing that dimension as well.

237
00:17:25,710 --> 00:17:30,751
And part of that is because other hispanic is from a lot of different places.

238
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:34,183
They could be from spain, they could be from Portugal,

239
00:17:34,183 --> 00:17:37,851
they could be from other places that are outside of Mexico.

240
00:17:37,851 --> 00:17:44,141
So it's a it's a more ancestral e heterogeneous group.

241
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:50,410
Some other special considerations for genetic association studies.

242
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,568
We're gonna talk a little bit about candidate gene studies versus genome wide

243
00:17:54,568 --> 00:17:55,150
studies.

244
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:59,468
We're gonna talk about the multiple testing issues involved in genetic

245
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:00,120
studies.

246
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,796
So when multiple SNPs are being tested,

247
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:07,510
finding a significant one by random chance becomes pretty likely.

248
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:11,640
And that problem is amplified when we we test the entire genome because

249
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,380
of the large number of SNPs we're looking at.

250
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,589
That means we're gonna conduct a large number of statistical tests and

251
00:18:18,018 --> 00:18:20,271
we're not gonna talk too much about it now.

252
00:18:20,271 --> 00:18:24,616
But I also want you to keep in mind that if there are environments or

253
00:18:24,616 --> 00:18:28,882
other genes that influence the SNPs that we're interested in,

254
00:18:28,882 --> 00:18:33,781
they're gonna be difficult to capture in genetic association studies.

255
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:38,658
And so these context dependent effects like gene environment interactions

256
00:18:38,658 --> 00:18:42,171
are really difficult to study in this kind of context.

257
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,150
Just to note about candidate gene versus genome wide association studies.

258
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:53,237
Candidate gene studies focus on testing the SNPs usually within biologically

259
00:18:53,237 --> 00:18:58,218
relevant pathways with potential functional implications for

260
00:18:58,218 --> 00:19:04,030
proteins or underneath linkage peaks that were identified previously and

261
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:09,194
the biological candidate gene studies where we kind of look at only

262
00:19:09,194 --> 00:19:15,556
the genes we think might be biologically relevant are sort of problematic because

263
00:19:15,556 --> 00:19:21,271
what we found is that a lot of times we can't predict necessarily the genes

264
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:26,490
that are gonna be most involved in diseases or traits of interest.

265
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,763
So although we sometimes find that the genetic association

266
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:36,420
findings are in genes that we would have predicted.

267
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,974
We also find a lot of genetic association study results that are outside of

268
00:19:40,974 --> 00:19:43,480
genes that we would have thought of.

269
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:48,111
And so genome wide association studies are preferred because they can test

270
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:52,520
millions of polymorphisms that are spaced across the entire genome for

271
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,190
association with your trade of interest.

272
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,670
And they're kind of agnostic.

273
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:59,630
They don't care if it's in a biologically relevant pathway.

274
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:04,214
They don't necessarily care if it's in a gene, they're just gonna tag, you know,

275
00:20:04,214 --> 00:20:07,411
all kinds of variation across the genome and go from there.

276
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,735
So for genome wide association studies,

277
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:12,990
why do we want to search the entire genome?

278
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:17,090
Well, the technology is available and it's it's affordable.

279
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,830
It's not limited by this prior knowledge of the disease process or

280
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:26,824
results of positional or linkage studies and it's more powerful when

281
00:20:26,824 --> 00:20:31,564
you have diseases with complex etiology because you don't really

282
00:20:31,564 --> 00:20:37,086
know where how many genes are involved or where they are on the genome.

283
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,801
It's cheaper for example to test the xOM versus testing the entire genome.

284
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:44,361
So the X is much smaller.

285
00:20:44,361 --> 00:20:46,600
Obviously it's only 2% of the genome.

286
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,630
So it's less expensive on the whole.

287
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,836
You're more likely to find functional variants or

288
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,940
things that change amino acids.

289
00:20:54,940 --> 00:21:01,150
or you know other kinds of changes that are really important to the protein.

290
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:05,650
But the other 98% of the genome is also a place where

291
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:09,351
we find a lot of associations with disease.

292
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:13,171
And so SNPs that are outside of coding regions and

293
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:17,290
promoters enhancers in micro RNA and splice sites.

294
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,511
These are also very important and

295
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:24,281
we find a lot of associations with disease in the entire genome as well.

296
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:31,707
There is a question now about should we be using these genotype micro raise the gos

297
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:36,030
chips and things like that or should we just sequence the entire genome?

298
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:40,253
So the micro rays are nice because they're available available and

299
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:43,090
very affordable as low as $50 per sample.

300
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:47,164
And the genotype and in quality control are more straightforward than whole genome

301
00:21:47,164 --> 00:21:48,480
sequencing.

302
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,506
They do a pretty good job of measuring common variants but

303
00:21:51,506 --> 00:21:53,730
they don't do as well for rare variants.

304
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,906
in part because it's harder to really do the genotype calling for

305
00:21:59,906 --> 00:22:05,521
rare variants and also because we're only gonna be tagging

306
00:22:05,521 --> 00:22:11,400
common variants better than we would rare variants.

307
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,208
Another downside is it's really only tag SNPs so it's unlikely to

308
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,812
contain functional variants and it might be less effective for

309
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:22,300
race ethnic groups depending on how you chose your tag SNPs.

310
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,511
And so the genome sequencing offers a lot of benefits.

311
00:22:25,511 --> 00:22:29,931
I mean the biggest thing is that it directly measures all kinds of common and

312
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:34,138
rare variants and you can use it for someone of any kind of ethnic group or

313
00:22:34,138 --> 00:22:37,951
ancestry because it it just measures every single base in the D.

314
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:40,640
N. A. But of course it's much more expensive.

315
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,223
And so today most us have been formed performed using micro raise with

316
00:22:45,223 --> 00:22:46,980
common variants or SNPs.

317
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,873
But we're seeing a lot more now in the literature of sequencing studies because

318
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:55,901
it's becoming less expensive and a little bit more mainstream.

319
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:03,520
So both of these kinds of studies have huge multiple testing burden.

320
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,687
So because we're testing so many SNPs the p value of being less than

321
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:13,672
five times 10 to the minus eight or bond for only correction for

322
00:23:13,672 --> 00:23:20,490
one million tests is considered genome wide significant for array based tests.

323
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:24,175
And if you're doing sequencing people have been using one or

324
00:23:24,175 --> 00:23:26,415
two times 10 to the minus eighth for

325
00:23:26,415 --> 00:23:31,041
being considered significant when we're using these whole genome studies

326
00:23:31,041 --> 00:23:35,410
whole genome sequencing studies that are measuring all the DNA bases.

327
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:39,316
And in addition to this really stringent p value,

328
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:44,617
we also need to do meta analysis across a lot of studies, samples and

329
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:50,391
our replication to convince ourselves that our genetic finding is true.

330
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,040
So huge sample sizes are now required to find significant associations.

331
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,900
So the sample size is often more than 50,000 people.

332
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:05,454
There have been now studies of over two million people for certain genotype for

333
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:07,120
certain types of interest.

334
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,600
The G was typically consists of many cohorts or case control samples.

335
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,876
Usually at least 20 to 50 cohorts are now required for

336
00:24:15,876 --> 00:24:17,940
genome wide association studies.

337
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:23,240
like I said before meta analysis or replication designs are used.

338
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:27,956
So in meta analysis, each of the study cohorts performs a on their

339
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:32,490
trade of interest according to a common analysis plan.

340
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:38,109
The results from all the bosses are combined using meta analysis methods and

341
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:42,161
the effect sizes for each SNP on the trade of interest.

342
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:47,808
So the beta coefficients from a linear regression and the P values

343
00:24:47,808 --> 00:24:53,680
are estimated from the combined set of GOS results in replication.

344
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:58,603
We're using an independent study sample to confirm the original findings

345
00:24:58,603 --> 00:25:02,920
that will help us separate true positives from false positives.

346
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:07,491
So a lot of times people will call the first sample, the discovery sample.

347
00:25:07,491 --> 00:25:10,560
And those are the cohorts that provide results for

348
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,240
all of the steps across the genome.

349
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,526
And sometimes the most highly significant SNPs are selected for

350
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:20,640
replication and independent study samples.

351
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,387
And so we have the distinction between the discovery sample and

352
00:25:24,387 --> 00:25:26,690
the replication samples.

353
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,235
We also might see what's called a joint analysis or

354
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:34,605
a global analysis where we take everyone from the discovery and

355
00:25:34,605 --> 00:25:40,311
replication sample to jointly estimate the best effect estimate and the p value.

356
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,617
So here this is a one stage design, you've got all your samples and

357
00:25:46,617 --> 00:25:49,391
all of your SNPs and everything is tested.

358
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:52,987
So the samples can be from a single study or from multiple studies and

359
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:53,890
meta analysis.

360
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:55,581
Most of the G.

361
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:58,166
O. S now are done in two stage design where

362
00:25:58,166 --> 00:26:03,039
you've done the first stage where you test all of your SNPs against some of

363
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,911
your sample and then replicate in an independent sample.

364
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:11,438
So here you've got your stage one, your discovery sample and

365
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:16,399
you've tested all of your SNPs and then some of them you test again in

366
00:26:16,399 --> 00:26:21,012
stage two with a different set of samples so that you can look for

367
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:25,230
replication and the joint analysis does the same thing.

368
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:31,572
Except it is going to consider the results from both stages when it's estimating

369
00:26:31,572 --> 00:26:36,811
the beta coefficients and the p values for these SNPs of interest.

370
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,519
One important a couple of important things Fergie was is

371
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,440
the need to homogenize phenotype.

372
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,343
So the phenotype is that we're looking at the traits or

373
00:26:49,343 --> 00:26:52,710
the outcomes are often measured differently across studies.

374
00:26:52,710 --> 00:26:57,018
And so investigators need to try to homogenize or make those phenotype is

375
00:26:57,018 --> 00:27:00,850
the same across all the different studies they're looking at.

376
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,907
So for example if you have two studies that measure your trait differently,

377
00:27:05,907 --> 00:27:09,067
you can do some tricks like obtains the scores or

378
00:27:09,067 --> 00:27:12,490
do a normalization in order to make those results.

379
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:16,330
Those phenotype is comparable across studies.

380
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:19,740
Another way you can do it is scale one type of data to match another.

381
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,155
So, for example, if one study measured whole blood glucose and

382
00:27:24,155 --> 00:27:28,816
another study measured plasma glucose, we could do a trick where we

383
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:32,824
multiply whole blood glucose values by some known value,

384
00:27:32,824 --> 00:27:38,223
like 1.13 to match plasma glucose levels, because on average your plasma

385
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:43,321
glucose is 1.13 times your whole blood glucose level, for example.
