1
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:22,120
So. For those of you who found that I didn't record the mycobacterial lecture, it's now been recorded.

2
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:28,660
I came in an hour and a half early and recorded the entire thing, so it's there and I had Joanne's help.

3
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:41,830
So we know it's right. OK, now the next question is we have a test scheduled for the next class period.

4
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:50,500
I am willing to put it off till Monday. And then on Wednesday, we'll ask if you have any questions.

5
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,490
You know, start another lecture. But the new lecture will not be on the test.

6
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:01,330
So I want everyone's input. I mean, I know it's it'd be put off until the Monday after spring break.

7
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:09,170
So many people don't like the study over spring break, so I want your input.

8
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:17,390
Anybody? Yes. Thanks for this. That are the Monday ceremony after spring break, is that everybody good with that?

9
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:24,350
I mean, some people are probably going for lovely vacations on some place where it's a tropical island or something.

10
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:32,890
I'll be here with snow. I find it rather.

11
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:39,520
OK, well, I'm going to go with what the majority says, and I'll ask this question at the end of the class when the people who aren't here yet.

12
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:48,700
And then I will go with the majority. OK, so the lecture last time that did not record it has now been recorded, as I said.

13
00:01:48,700 --> 00:02:00,680
So we are going to go on and find how to do this.

14
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:36,250
I have no idea. OK.

15
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:45,040
So as I said, I just rerecorded the entire mycobacterial lecture, all 100 and whatever slide, no slides, it was, so that's online.

16
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,310
This is the last one before the test. Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, Treponema OK.

17
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,800
I would certainly recommend that people who have access to the textbook and I know that it's in the library.

18
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,470
Also here the access to the textbook with your friends who don't have the textbook.

19
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:06,760
There's a lot of material more material than I can present in lecture.

20
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:15,700
OK. But those of you who want to be doing infection prevention or doing something in public health epidemiology, you need to know this information.

21
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:23,560
There's no question about you have to know this information, so please, please, please study the chapters as well as the notes.

22
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,580
OK, OK, I'm going to get going. This is not a long what you.

23
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:34,870
This is a short lecture. It's only thirty seven slides, so that will give everybody a little bit of break also.

24
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:40,200
OK. How should I hit the record button?

25
00:03:40,200 --> 00:04:15,660
OK. By the end of the term, I'll probably be comfortable with this computer, okay, except nothing is predicting.

26
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:38,270
I think it's a short lecture because. I'm going to call her back.

27
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:46,150
Yeah. Do you know how to do this? I don't, but I can try to set it next on the yeah, it is, but the only thing it's not.

28
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,200
I can't. But this one is not projecting.

29
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:58,820
I'm not sure it's on the way. They were having problems with the cameras in here.

30
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:13,200
Hold on. Probably have to go there.

31
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:25,810
You were having problems with the camera, so we got camera that was always coming on.

32
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:29,950
But is there anything else that I can? No, no, I can hear it.

33
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:36,270
I just didn't have any cameras. So this one's going to be a little bit slow.

34
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:41,760
That's coming out, though I know she told me that they were having problems with the projector.

35
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:47,790
OK. This is like your 12th. Thank you. I gratefully accept all help.

36
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:54,090
And you didn't want to say what my sons do, which is, ma'am, I've told you this before. OK.

37
00:05:54,090 --> 00:06:00,960
Chlamydia mycoplasma troponins. So.

38
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:10,380
Chlamydia. These are interesting organisms, they are obligate intracellular bacteria.

39
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,450
OK. They exist inside cells. They can't exist outside cells.

40
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:23,940
They require the hosts the ATP to multiply. Now what about culturing chlamydia?

41
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,220
We can't culture chlamydia unless we cultured them in tissue cells.

42
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:38,370
They don't grow on organs. OK, so we have to use tissue cells to grow the chlamydia.

43
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:46,170
That's why the movement in clinical laboratories has been away from culture methods and to molecular methods.

44
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,240
Because even if you do set up tissue culture,

45
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:55,470
it's going to take weeks to get a positive result whereby if you do a molecular method to get it the next day.

46
00:06:55,470 --> 00:07:05,360
OK, so here's our life cycle so you can start, say, with host cell nucleus.

47
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,720
In the wrong place. Host cell nucleus is right here. OK.

48
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:19,170
And then the ingested into side side toast and residues are in the membrane right here, OK?

49
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:30,090
They're bound to bind the vascular fatty, so the elementary bodies from the chlamydia reorganizes into a large particulate by down here in the bottom.

50
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:38,610
See this large reticular body and it is free after about six to eight hours after it's taken up by a Ferguson home or vacuole.

51
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,570
OK, so it's in the it's in the cell infected cell and it gets larger and larger.

52
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:48,840
It multiplies this multiplication of the reticulum bodies by binary fission within the host cell.

53
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,010
See here they've they've multiplied. The Ferguson enlarges into a structure called an inclusion.

54
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,390
This is where you can finally see it if you're looking at a slide.

55
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:06,990
And then there's condensation of the elementary bodies and they grow to a point where the cell ruptures, OK?

56
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:22,500
Then they can spread to additional cells. OK, so general characteristics of Chlamydia trachomatis, it is divided into a minimum of 17 seer bars,

57
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:32,920
they keep increasing the sphere bars with additional molecular work. And the servers are based on major outer membrane proteins mop.

58
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:38,920
OK. The different servers are associated with different clinical syndromes.

59
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:44,860
So what do we know about chlamydia? It is one of the very important sexually transmitted diseases.

60
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:51,010
Very, very common. It can cause pelvic inflammatory disease in women.

61
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:58,740
And over four million infections annually. And it can cause women to become sterile.

62
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:06,270
It can cause ocular trachoma, which we don't see hardly at all in the United States, but in other countries they do have it.

63
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,540
And that can result in blindness.

64
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:18,910
The natural habitat is humans, we don't get it from our dogs, we don't get it from birds, rats, anything else, gerbils.

65
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:25,840
The pathogenesis is still poorly understood, understood after all these years of people doing research on it.

66
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:34,990
And people can have recurrent infections, and every time it recurs, the severity of the infection will be more.

67
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:40,780
There will be more increases in severity of the manifestations get worse and worse.

68
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:46,690
Most people with their primary infection of chlamydia don't even know they've gotten it OK.

69
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:53,840
Then, after a while, they get more symptoms. So the spectrum of disease,

70
00:09:53,840 --> 00:10:00,380
depending on whether you're looking at the 14th or 15th edition of the book because it is probably in Table forty three point two.

71
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,340
So I don't know how many of you have heard about trachoma.

72
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:15,500
It has three servers, a four zero virus A, B, B and then small A and C, and it's chronic inflammation of the conjunctiva and can lead to blindness.

73
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,690
And it has been in countries where they don't have good medical care.

74
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:27,390
Parts of Africa, parts of India and parts of parts of Southeast Asia. This disease can be rampant.

75
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:33,750
Then there's little granuloma of area, and it is caused by Sarah L1, L2 and L3.

76
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,430
It's an s t d OK, so it's a sexually transmitted disease.

77
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:46,260
It's unusual in Europe and North America, but it's more common in Africa, Asia and South America.

78
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,200
So it's then recently, within the last five to 10 years,

79
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:59,430
there have been outbreaks of it in New York City and other highly populated areas among men who have sex with men.

80
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:03,600
So it's an STD. It is.

81
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:11,050
This causes a small lesion that goes away, and then the patient develops a very swollen glands.

82
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:15,620
So if it's an s t t, it's going to be in the in the groin area.

83
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:21,510
They're going to be swollen bubbles, which are very large, swollen glands. And these can rupture.

84
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:28,890
Obviously, if they rupture, the tissue was destroyed, then it can then develop into systemic disease.

85
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:33,180
And so if you look to see where the country is or the areas of the world where they have it in Africa,

86
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:40,750
Asia and South America, there may not be good medical care to take care of this disease there.

87
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:43,930
There can be at low genital infections,

88
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:54,640
and these are caused by Cerberus D through K and the ocular infections here don't necessarily lead to blindness.

89
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:00,460
But any time you have an ocular infection, your eyes are swollen, they're itchy, they're draining and so on.

90
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,870
Nobody wants it. And many infections can be asymptomatic.

91
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:11,580
People don't know that they're infected, but they can certainly pass it on because hand-washing is not so good.

92
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,470
OK.

93
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:20,220
And then there can be perinatal infections in that, I think is always the worst because you've got helpless babies just born and they're born with it.

94
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:31,920
Also caused by Serwaa's D K and 25 to 50 percent of women are babies born to women who are infected, develop inclusion conjunctivitis.

95
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,080
Oftentimes, this is not treated and 10 to 20 percent can develop pneumonia.

96
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:44,130
Anything in a neonates, any infection, any disease in the neonatal is serious and can be life threatening.

97
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,730
And particularly when you look at the areas of the world Asia, Africa and South America,

98
00:12:47,730 --> 00:13:03,040
where they may not have the good type of medical care needed to take care of people with these infections very, very serious in the unit.

99
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,260
OK, so here we have primary syndromes caused by Chlamydia trachomatis,

100
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:14,110
and you could tell that I like to take pictures of charts and just plug them into slides subtypes.

101
00:13:14,110 --> 00:13:24,700
It's listed by subtypes, clinical syndrome and routes of transmission. So sometimes A, B, B, small A and C endemic trachoma,

102
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:36,970
which can be multiple or persistent infections that eventually lead to blindness and rates of transmission or hand to eye from fomites or flies.

103
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:48,530
OK, L1, L2 and L3 that would be live for granuloma area and that sexual transmission and then subtypes D through K.

104
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:52,490
Uri three, the service side is pelvic inflammatory disease, epidermidis,

105
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:57,560
infant pneumonia and conjunctivitis that does not lead to blindness but can lead to more people getting

106
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:04,640
infected and transmission here a sexual hand to eye by auto inoculation of genital secretions.

107
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:11,410
Not intentionally, obviously. Eye to eye by infected secretions or neonatal.

108
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,080
So it can cause some very serious infections, and once again in the areas where this is predominant,

109
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:24,350
they don't have the kind of medical care that we have most places in the United States.

110
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,880
So what do we do in the laboratory? Well, we have to get this personally.

111
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,700
And it needs to be collected appropriately. We can use swabs or brushes of the urethra.

112
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:41,000
Cervix conjunctiva is a pharynx rectum, but in a cervical is preferred for women.

113
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:46,130
And you place it in transport media or on a slide for a DFA now, if you put it directly on the slide.

114
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:52,190
That's all you can do with that slide that DFA. So if you're gonna to make slides, make multiple slides,

115
00:14:52,190 --> 00:15:01,010
but the better thing to do is to put it in transport media that is appropriate for this disease and send it to the laboratory.

116
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:08,540
Therefore, when it's in transport media, you mix your swab, you make sure it's impossible to swallow materials emulsified in the transport media.

117
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:14,030
Then you can take out amounts by a pipette and use it for multiple purposes.

118
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:25,700
If you are wanting to grow it, which in this day and age most people don't want to, you need it to get to the laboratory fairly rapidly.

119
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:33,230
So growth in the lab cultivation is the gold standard, but it is difficult and costly.

120
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:39,830
We've done a I've done a lot of chlamydia cultures, both through the state and both for Beaumont, and you can do them.

121
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:42,180
But the molecular methods are better.

122
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:51,630
OK, you don't have the problems with the organism dying out, not being transported correctly, not getting the culture set up in time and so on.

123
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:57,000
And if you do a slide for DFA, there may be very few organisms and they may be very,

124
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,900
very difficult to see if there's a lot of organisms, it's a lot easier.

125
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:08,700
But still you have to have someone trained in reviewing those slides, reading those slides know what they're looking for.

126
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,980
So I guess that culture is the gold standard,

127
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:24,180
but it's difficult and not 70 to 90 percent sensitive at best and expensive because you need to ship the first tissue culture cells.

128
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:33,120
There's a lack of security there. Transport may be a major die out, and transport is not handled appropriately and gets to the lab right away.

129
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:41,190
So it requires specific cell lines. And the cell line that most people use to culture Chlamydia trachomatis is the mckoy cells.

130
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:50,010
OK. You perform, show vile culture and stained with iodine RFA reagents to visualize the inclusions.

131
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:56,640
Sure, miles. Does anybody know what your miles are so vile about this big as tissue culture media and has a

132
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:05,130
glass slide in it and the the cells are on the glass slide so you can transport your specimen,

133
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:17,400
inoculate your specimen from the swab into the transport to that that and the the the if you emulsifiers swab there, the cells will come off.

134
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:23,580
Hopefully, the infected cells will come off and and inoculate themselves onto that slide.

135
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:30,480
And so then they start growing in the culture media and on the tissue, on the slide, and hopefully you'll be able to.

136
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,130
That's how it was before molecular tests.

137
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:41,180
Now, with molecular tests, we don't have to say hopefully it will do this.

138
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:46,700
So these are what chlamydia inclusions look like, this is an iodine stain, so where there's an inclusion,

139
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:57,400
they've taken up the iodine and you can see that that's easy if they all look like that, but they don't all look like that.

140
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,510
So you can also do a fluorescent stain and you can see the green ones,

141
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:06,010
fluorescent or the positive, so there's a lot more than you saw the three on the previous slide.

142
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:17,600
Okay. But still, this is labor intensive and the the if your lab can handle it, the best way to go is with the molecular tests in most labs, I don't.

143
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,480
Unless you're doing research on chlamydia, most labs are you're not going to do culture, it's just too expensive and too time consuming.

144
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,790
Nobody has enough laboratory space to do all that.

145
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:31,310
The incubators at all. And the technologists, we have a shortage of technologists.

146
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:35,510
The way to go, much more sensitive and accurate test is a molecular test.

147
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:46,770
And if you can't do amplified test, even a DFA would be better than than spending the time on culture which may not work out.

148
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,910
So direct detection,

149
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:57,180
we don't generally use antigen detection or DNA probes anymore because we have better methods and we do nucleic acid amplification.

150
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:03,480
There are many, many different tests on the market made by many different companies.

151
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:07,920
They almost all of that are FDA approved, work very, very well.

152
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:13,140
They're not perfect. It's not a test in the world that's perfect, but they work very well.

153
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:19,630
There are multiple formats, formats, they're much more sensitive and they are as specific as a culture.

154
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,520
OK, serology doesn't tell us much.

155
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,660
So if the person has been infected and then treated, they may still have some antibodies.

156
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:39,910
It doesn't tell you anything. So serology is very limited. What about susceptibility testing, we don't do susceptibility testing for chlamydia.

157
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:44,230
They are treated with macrolides. You all know that my boys are like erythromycin, OK?

158
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:49,060
That's not the way tetracyclines and put them on. And then how do you prevent it?

159
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,930
There's no vaccine, so it's all behavioral changes.

160
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:58,060
And the problem with chlamydia is most people that have it don't know that they're infected unless they have.

161
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:06,400
They've been infected for a while. So prevention is to identify and treat infected people and their contacts.

162
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,880
And so have any of you ever worked in a public health clinic?

163
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:21,490
Anybody. I volunteered in public health clinics, particularly in county, as well as Boulder County and in the city clinic.

164
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:30,550
It's all very low key. You know, no finger pointing, but you are infected.

165
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:37,390
We need to treat you, but we also need to treat whomever you have been in contact with and the public health people.

166
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,640
The nurses are fabulous, absolutely fabulous with how they approach people.

167
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,280
Well, there's no finger pointing there. You've been infected.

168
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:50,920
There's a possibility you may be infected. We'd like to test you.

169
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:56,050
We'd like to treat you at no cost if you are infected.

170
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:06,980
And that's what public health does. OK. So that's chlamydia and certainly can cause genital infections,

171
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:14,150
chlamydia can also cause pulmonary infections and pulmonary infections, particularly in India.

172
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:27,470
They are very, very bad. Chlamydia pneumoniae is easy to treat women as easy to treat as any other bacterial infection, but preferable not to have it.

173
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:36,740
OK, so now we have mycoplasma and these are the smallest known free living forms.

174
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:41,810
And I guess I'm I don't know any couple of reference labs that might do a mycoplasma culture,

175
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:46,310
but most everybody relies upon a molecular test for mycoplasma.

176
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:56,120
They do not have cell walls, so they can be all different shapes to genera in infect people, mycoplasma and urea plasma.

177
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,150
And these are fastidious, extremely fastidious anaerobic organisms.

178
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:15,110
So if you were to try to grow them, you would have to have very specialized culture media and grow them within cells.

179
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:22,520
So many mycoplasma are part of our normal flora, the upper respiratory tract and genital urinary tract,

180
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:31,250
but sometimes the pathogenic pathogenic species gets in and it can attach to and invade epithelial cells.

181
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:44,810
And then the host's immune response takes over a foreign substance in its host's body, and it will get rid of that foreign substance, that mycoplasma.

182
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:53,900
But in doing so, it can damage lost cells. OK, so there's a wide spectrum of disease.

183
00:22:53,900 --> 00:23:02,660
But remember, mycoplasma? No pneumonia is the agent the main agent of atypical pneumonia when somebody talks about atypical pneumonia?

184
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:09,940
First thing you should think about is mycoplasma pneumonia. OK.

185
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:13,900
So here's a table, I'm not sure if it's the right number from the one I showed you before,

186
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:17,950
but this because I'm working with the 13th, 14th and 15th editions.

187
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:25,510
So here we have Mycoplasma pneumoniae, the clinical manifestations of mycoplasma infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae,

188
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,500
urea, plasma, Uriel Finicum and Mycoplasma A.

189
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:36,430
OK, so there's a group of about four organisms here, so mycoplasma pneumoniae, I can cause an asymptomatic infection.

190
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:42,610
People don't know they're infected. It can cause upper respiratory tract infections in very young children.

191
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:52,530
And these might be mild might be nonspecific symptoms, including a runny nose, a little cough and mostly without fever.

192
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:55,390
OK, itchy eyes, maybe a little bit.

193
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:04,750
They can have lower respiratory, so those asymptomatic and there's mild infection, and then they can have lower respiratory tract infection in adults.

194
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:09,790
And with adults, they have a kind of a mild illness with a non productive cough.

195
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:17,660
You might have fever malaise not feeling, well, pharyngitis muscle aches, sort of,

196
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:23,950
but three to 13 percent of the patients will develop pneumonia, and that is not mild.

197
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:34,630
Pneumonia complications can include a rash, arthritis and syphilis or brain side effect myocarditis, pericarditis and hemolytic anemia.

198
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:42,910
So the side effects the after effects of lower respiratory tract infection with mycoplasma pneumoniae are very serious,

199
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:47,320
and it's not something to ignore. It's something that patients need therapy. They need to be monitored.

200
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:54,890
And if things don't get better, they start to get worse. They need to be seen very rapidly.

201
00:24:54,890 --> 00:25:01,640
Then we have the genital mycoplasma so that that's your plasma, you really have come and mycoplasma from A.

202
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,010
And these can cause systemic infections in neonates and any infection in any any serious.

203
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:12,770
And I never want to say that they're not. You got a newborn. Their immune system is not up and running.

204
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:18,200
They're working off their mother's immune system, basically. It can be very, very serious.

205
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:22,640
They can cause meningitis, abscess and pneumonia.

206
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,470
You re a plasma is also associated with development of chronic lung disease.

207
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:32,000
And can you imagine having a baby and being told your baby's been infected with three?

208
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:42,080
A plasma may have chronic lung disease in their later years? You know, it's devastating.

209
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:49,010
And I will tell you, when I talk about devastating diseases, my oldest son was born with heart disease and has had three open heart surgeries.

210
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:53,960
He's now 26 and doing well, living in down in Ohio, doing it.

211
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,320
But if you have a baby. Baby's born.

212
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:05,240
You don't think anything's wrong. And then you're told we're transferring your child to another hospital because they're very sick.

213
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:10,610
It's probably the most devastating thing that can happen. So I'm getting back to this.

214
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:15,650
There can be invasive disease in immunosuppressed patients.

215
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:23,540
They can be bacteremia arthritis, particularly in patients who are a gamma globulin E-Myth.

216
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:28,400
They can have abscesses and other types of wound infections with the general mycoplasma.

217
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:36,290
And they can have pneumonia or peritonitis. So there's a lot of different ways that this can present a lot of different ways.

218
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:40,970
They can have your genital tract infection, which is what most people think about with the genital mycoplasma.

219
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:46,280
So could it be prostatitis in a male, pelvic and flat and pelvic inflammatory disease,

220
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,970
bacterial vaginosis and unitas or non-gun a couple of your throat?

221
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:59,630
I'm going. I got a couple. Yeah, your arthritis. So there are a lot of different things that can cause urinary urogenital tract infection.

222
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:09,430
We always think of non gynecological urethra as chlamydia, but the genital mycoplasma can cause that also.

223
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:13,150
So what do we do in the lab? No, we're not going to work.

224
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:17,320
We're going to get this specimen into the lab and that means having the right transport media.

225
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,090
And so for most institutions, you have a lab test directory right on line.

226
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:25,330
So if somebody needs to see how to send a specimen to the laboratory,

227
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:36,340
they can look at the lab test directly or they call out and ask and it includes transport or you transport the specimen what the specimen should be.

228
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:41,140
How long does it take to get the results? How long can you allow the disbursement in the laboratory?

229
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:46,480
How do you keep it in your office until the courier car comes and so on?

230
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:56,680
So diagnosis can be very challenging, particularly if you don't have the assays available in your laboratory to diagnose these types of infections.

231
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,550
Culture test once again, no, not for these organisms. They're too unreliable.

232
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,370
They take too much time. Your cells may die out at the last minute.

233
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:09,380
You think your cells, you don't have cells. Now you need to use a non culture method.

234
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,970
Okay, so acceptable specimens, body fluids.

235
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:18,340
If there's a fluid that we can, can access other specimens.

236
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:23,800
Do you use swabs, respiratory tract specimens until I get them to the laboratory?

237
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:28,720
Get it. And not just, you know, people think, Oh, it just takes a little bit to inoculate you.

238
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:40,990
We need more sometimes than just a little bit. Well, collected swab is is is wonderful because these organisms are highly susceptible to drying.

239
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:50,230
They are highly susceptible because they don't have any cell wall. OK, so that means that the appropriate transport medium is even more important.

240
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:56,890
So most places use the M4, which is a multipurpose transport for culture specimens for these organisms.

241
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:02,180
So if whether you're getting it from one company or another, they should have for transport media.

242
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:10,690
The direct detection methods Gram Stain will work, no cell wall can't grow into an organism if there's no cell wall,

243
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,860
but molecular as it's not just PCR, but other molecular assays are available in.

244
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:23,220
Most laboratories have gone to those other molecular assays.

245
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:29,460
So before we go on to laboratory diagnosis, I don't remember if I told you the difference between a flat swab and a wound swab,

246
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,040
did I tell you that I want to go over that?

247
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:41,490
So all other types of swabs, the fibers are wound around the swab and to keep the fibers there, they're glued on.

248
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:46,140
Well, the glue is oftentimes toxic to the cells we're trying to culture.

249
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,250
So a better way is our flex swabs and they look like little brushes.

250
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,420
The real soft the fibers are just stick out on all sides.

251
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:59,520
And that's a much better way because you collect more material with that fluff swab.

252
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:06,480
And when you put it in transport media, more of that material leaves the swab and it's in the transport media.

253
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,020
It's not tied to the swab and there's no toxic glue.

254
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:20,760
So most laboratories have gone to using floppy swabs, if at all possible, and they're usually included in containers for collecting specimens.

255
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,230
They'll have the flock swabs. So if you have anybody ever asked you about that?

256
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:33,840
Generally, the flock swabs collect a better specimen than a wound swab wound and instantly wound and wound or smell the same way.

257
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:39,540
So just thought I'd bring that up. OK, laboratory diagnosis, accommodation, growing it in the lab?

258
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:47,310
These organisms are extremely fastidious. They require many supplements and inhibitors to prevent overgrowth of other organisms.

259
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:51,060
Not most labs do not culture these organisms. It's just too difficult.

260
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:57,750
We do molecular assays. So but if you do culture, how do you tell us something's there?

261
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:02,880
Well, the colonies are very small and they look like fried eggs.

262
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:10,330
They don't smell like fried eggs and just look like fried eggs. You can't stay in them with with a gram stain because they don't have cell walls.

263
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:17,800
Gram stain is still a stain, so off, but you have to use equity in orange and then they will fluoresce,

264
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,880
you can just zero diagnosis if it has been a while.

265
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:27,820
You know, if it's been more than a week or two for a person to develop an immune response to an infection.

266
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:35,830
So if you're using an enzyme linked immunosorbent, then ELIZA assay you can detect IDM and or IgG.

267
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:38,560
And these have been the main tool for diagnosis for a long time.

268
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,940
But then along came the molecular assays, and they've kind of kicked the others aside.

269
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:49,810
We have molecular assays for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and I think they're out for urea plasma now also.

270
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:58,360
OK. And the major reference laboratories major hospital laboratories will be doing the best molecular lab because they don't like to have to

271
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:05,230
retest and retest the retest of the same patient patients not getting the kind of care that they would expect from any institutions.

272
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:16,750
That that's not the testing is not up to date. So here are some colonial morphologies for mycoplasma plasma.

273
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,220
If you were to culture them, which I'm not recommending unless you're doing research,

274
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:27,340
so on the left, you see mycoplasma and some urea plasma in the center,

275
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:35,680
you have different formats, but you can see that the urea plasma, they're usually smaller and they look like they're more condensed.

276
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:42,930
That would be the word to use whereby the mycoplasma are larger and it looks like there's more cytoplasm.

277
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:51,030
But these all have to be grown in tissue culture. So what about susceptibility testing?

278
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:55,000
No, we don't do susceptibility testing, it's not routinely performed,

279
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,110
I would guess that the only time susceptibility testing is done would be in a research

280
00:32:59,110 --> 00:33:05,140
project or maybe a like it may or when they're trying to figure something out.

281
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:12,730
Most disease is self-limiting, but can relapse if patients not on appropriate therapy.

282
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:18,040
If they relapse, they need to be put on the appropriate therapy right away.

283
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:24,520
Beta lactamase should never be used because beta lectins work on cell walls, and these organisms don't have any cell walls.

284
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,440
So beta lactamase do not work,

285
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:35,710
but macrolides into tetracycline to maximize remember like erythromycin and the secondsSo I have certainly they work very well for these organisms.

286
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:42,420
There is no vaccine to prevent the infection.

287
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:49,470
So here's an exam type question, what staining technique is useful for visualizing mycoplasma gram stain zeal?

288
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:59,910
Nielsen warming wrote a or an equity norms? If you miss this, you have to sift through every single lecture again that I've given this term.

289
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:05,920
Anybody want to say the answer? D, yes, who said you did?

290
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:11,670
Oh, yeah. Yes, Orange.

291
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:22,440
OK, now we go to Sparky's overall characteristics, these are very interesting organisms, they're long, slender helix, curved gram, negative bacilli.

292
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:28,230
And if you ever get the chance to see one off movie, you find a swimming in circles.

293
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:35,730
They process they have axial filaments that are contained in and out of sheath that wraps around the organism's cell wall.

294
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:42,120
And this helps them swim kind of a corkscrew, more motion, highly more organisms.

295
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,140
There are several different genera of different numbers of filaments and different

296
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:51,470
levels of tightness of their coils and to show you something just on the next slide.

297
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:53,840
I think I'm this with you. There we go.

298
00:34:53,840 --> 00:35:04,940
So here we have Borrelia left aspiring Typekit Trevor Nyima the the the corkscrews are much looser in Borrelia and much tighter in Leptospira,

299
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:13,910
and Treponema is kind of in the middle. OK, I set up cultures for Borrelia burgdorferi, for the state,

300
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:20,060
and it was interesting because when we first started seeing it in Michigan and we started doing culture,

301
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:27,380
sport and we could track where it was across the state.

302
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:37,610
OK, so Trevor Nyima, general characteristics of a pallidum infects only humans, so anybody who says they got it from the dog on cat is lying.

303
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:43,130
Other names are part of the normal flora or flora and genital flora.

304
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:50,150
They don't act. They don't look like Treponema pallidum. What about the epidemiology and pathogenesis?

305
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:53,810
I think everybody in this room knows the name of pallidum causes.

306
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:59,090
Syphilis is an STD transmitted by direct contact.

307
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:04,550
It can penetrate into skin or breaks in the skin.

308
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:11,720
And then eventually it will invade the bloodstream and spread to other body sites and cause tissue destruction,

309
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:24,390
so it's a very serious type of an infection. So the spectrum of disease, T. Pallidum causes syphilis.

310
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:33,060
We're lucky that we don't see much syphilis anymore, but it could pop up become more prevalent at any time in the primary disease.

311
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:36,780
There is formation of a or shakers, a painless ulcer.

312
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:41,580
It's usually in the genitalia, but it could be other places that will heal within three to six weeks.

313
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:46,020
But that doesn't mean the patient is cured. It just means that they don't have a shaker anymore.

314
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:55,110
The organism is disseminating during that time period, then secondary syphilis can occur two to 24 weeks later.

315
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:59,790
It has nonspecific symptoms, ache, fever and so on.

316
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:06,400
And then a widespread rash. And that rash is infectious.

317
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:16,120
And then there's late tertiary syphilis, which can happen 10 to twenty five years later and people who are not treated appropriately, it's a cause.

318
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:20,980
It causes tissue destruction in thirty five percent of untreated patients,

319
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:30,010
and the tissues that it can destroy that it can destroy include the central nervous system, cardiovascular tissue and ocular tissue.

320
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:39,370
So heart eyes and central nervous system. What do we do about diagnosis?

321
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:43,360
Well, we can do a dark field slide.

322
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:52,300
Say we get genital secretions or something from a shank, or we could do a dark field or a fight phase contrast, but they don't stain very well.

323
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:59,200
And if somebody is not an expert at looking for them, it's really not the best test to use.

324
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,520
You can do a DFA also that works fairly well.

325
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:08,110
Fluorescent antibody with the specimen in this case would be a touch prep of serious fluid from the lesion.

326
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:11,590
Now, if you collect it with a swab, it can cut up in the fat.

327
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:15,100
In the fibers, you may not be able to get it off from.

328
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:20,080
If you collect enough specimen, you can put in transport me and may be able to use it that way.

329
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:31,440
The organisms are aged eight to 10 microns in size, with eight to 14 coiled spirals.

330
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,020
And this is what T. pallidum looks like and Darfield.

331
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:47,370
And you can see how tightly coiled those spirals are, and they are on a dark field, they'd be moving around also.

332
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:51,190
So what about strategy strategy works very well for syphilis?

333
00:38:51,190 --> 00:39:00,300
Classic test and test trap animal and non-Trump animal antibodies, trap animal or target organism specific antigens,

334
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:07,740
non-Trump, animal or target mammalian cell antigens, and we use antibodies.

335
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:13,440
They're not necessarily useful for syphilis, but oftentimes they're used in tests.

336
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,580
So there are non-Trump animal tests, and Tripoli will test the non-Trump animal test.

337
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:20,740
One of them is a viral test that you may have heard of before,

338
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:27,330
stands for a venereal disease research lab test and then the R-Pa, which is the rapid plasma reagent test.

339
00:39:27,330 --> 00:39:35,260
And it's a formulation test that uses charcoal added to party of life in innovative and visualizing one that things are clumping up.

340
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:40,840
OK, then the trip animal testing is the one that most people use.

341
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:48,670
Well, there are two of them FDA labels, and it may take up the FDA. Absa's fluorescent animal antibody absorbed.

342
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:53,980
And this this, the patient serum is absorbed with non-Trump animal antigens.

343
00:39:53,980 --> 00:40:01,060
Then immunofluorescence is done with slides of all cell types out pallidum as an antigen.

344
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:10,340
OK, so it's like a combination test. If that is a confirmatory test for an R positive PR and then the MHRA is a microbe,

345
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:19,750
a micro hemagglutinin assay with Kevin T. Pallidum Red Blood Red blood cells are coated with T. pallidum antigens and these are obtained commercially.

346
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:24,040
You don't do it in your laboratory, you don't call yourself. They're incubated with serum.

347
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:34,160
And if the serum contains T. pallidum, it will obligate.

348
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,960
What about susceptibility testing? Nope. We can't culture the organism easily,

349
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,320
so we can't do susceptibility testing patients can be treated with penicillin if they can't be treated with penicillin.

350
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:51,170
They may have to be treated with something else or be treated in hospital patient.

351
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:55,040
Patients who are penicillin learned how to prevent it.

352
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:00,770
Early identification and treatment prevent spread and then behavioral changes, which I won't go into.

353
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:10,930
But you should know more about them. OK, Morelia, which is much more, I think, interesting for me because I've worked with it.

354
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:20,410
It has the cell has three to 10 loose coils and it's actively model, has it swimming around and it actually stands very well against the state.

355
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:25,990
Very, very well. What does it cost? Well, we have all heard about Lyme disease, have we not?

356
00:41:25,990 --> 00:41:29,500
There are several species of gorilla that can cause Lyme disease.

357
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:38,290
It's transmitted through the bite of the city's tick, and there are different species that can spread it in different geographic areas.

358
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:46,390
But in Michigan, we have expertize. We also have other ticks, all the ticks, national natural hosts, our deer and rodents.

359
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:48,610
But they can attach to humans or pets.

360
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:56,040
So if you go through a nice, nice walk through the woods with your dog, track your body and track your dog when you get back.

361
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:02,380
And good idea to check yourself when you come back and then like a couple of hours later, OK.

362
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:08,740
Doesn't hurt to do a double check. The ticks natural hosts our deer and rodents, but they can attach to us.

363
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:18,370
They can attach to our pets. And it's not just one stage of the tick, but all stages of the ticks can harbor the organism.

364
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:24,220
But the good thing is, if you get them off your body or off your dog's body rapidly, they won't transmit.

365
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:30,340
It takes them 24 hours to transmit. OK, so get them off, body.

366
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,230
In Michigan, we have endemic areas.

367
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:38,620
They started up in the U.P. and they're now emerging elsewhere in Michigan and something that I worked with quite a bit.

368
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:45,490
What state? Where is where is it emerging? How can we diagnosis?

369
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:51,070
So this is the 2018 Michigan Lyme disease risk map, have you all ever seen this before?

370
00:42:51,070 --> 00:43:07,000
Anybody ever seen it? OK, so we had it in the U.P. And then it came in from Illinois and Ohio, and it came up Lake Michigan and spread up there.

371
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:16,150
And now it's spreading across the state. And I know that we've had cases in twenty eighteen in the Lansing area, but we never thought we would.

372
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:25,390
OK, we have. My family has a cottage up in Mecosta County, which is also the most underserved county in the state.

373
00:43:25,390 --> 00:43:30,700
And whenever I take my dog for a walk because she likes to go through the weeds,

374
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:36,070
I have to check her afterwards, make sure she hasn't picked up any ticks.

375
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:45,340
So the red areas are the counties with known risk of Lyme disease, at least two confirmed local exposures and or ticks or animals with Lyme bacteria.

376
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:51,040
The spotted Spicoli counties are with potential risk for Lyme disease,

377
00:43:51,040 --> 00:44:01,030
and they're adjacent to a confirmed a county that has confirmed cases and we have black legged ticks present but not infect with Lyme bacteria.

378
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:07,740
And then the ones that don't have any speckling in them are counties with negative tick sampling information or lacking information.

379
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:14,800
But every county public health department is on the lookout for Lyme disease.

380
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:19,140
And up here, we see I don't know if you can see it very well.

381
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:25,610
How large the black legged ticks compared to, say, a dime.

382
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:31,100
The very small, very hard to find, and if you go to Michigan Dot Gov slash line,

383
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:36,660
you get a lot more and a lot more information if you're interested in it.

384
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:43,770
So what's the spectrum of disease for Lyme disease in most often presents with a rash that's called erythema migrants,

385
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,370
and that means it's reddish and it can move on.

386
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:52,260
It's got characteristic blue or both eyes shape and the side of the bite.

387
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:57,960
And then it can occur in other spots and it can spread. May not always talk like this may not be present or maybe present.

388
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:07,710
It's quite variable. Patient, though, can have a headache, fever, joint pain, and they just feel horrible or they have malaise.

389
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:12,300
And that's the first phase, the second phase, which occurs weeks two months later,

390
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:19,530
can occur because it can have arthritis or neurologic symptoms, so it can be a very serious illness.

391
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:24,330
And the third phase of this is chronic arthritis that can occur years later.

392
00:45:24,330 --> 00:45:28,440
So the most important thing is to find the ticks on the people, get them off,

393
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:32,070
tell their doctor with the tick is engaged and the patient is going to need them.

394
00:45:32,070 --> 00:45:39,020
They're engaged in large. It's going to need some therapy.

395
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:48,010
Here's the method erythema migrans, this is the CDC drawing, I've never seen one look quite that good.

396
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:56,920
So what do we do in the lab? Well, we're not going to grow it important, do the very best specimen collection, transport and processing.

397
00:45:56,920 --> 00:46:07,120
You can do so for Lyme disease testing. We can do serum for serology if person has developed antibodies and we can get tissue and CSF for culture.

398
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:14,200
But most places are not doing culture because we'd have to keep that tissue culture medium going and it it's just too expensive.

399
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:18,310
We can do direct detection if you have a tissue.

400
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:24,700
We can do a silver stain before we can do a molecular test on tissue.

401
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:29,080
We, as I said, that says home cultivation is not routinely performed.

402
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:33,040
Serology is not reliable.

403
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:42,860
But if for rheumatic, for the Lyme serology are two step process, you can't do a one step, it's going to be a two step process.

404
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:47,020
You do an analyze at a screen and then you confirm that with a western blot.

405
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,310
That is a good series of assays to test for Lyme disease.

406
00:46:51,310 --> 00:46:59,980
You can only find AGM an acute disease, as we would expect, because if it if the patient has acute disease within a certain number of days,

407
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:12,810
because if it's gone on longer, there's too much chance of cross-reactivity. And we use CDC criteria for interpreting the bans on the Western blot.

408
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:15,340
So here's a DFA stain of Borelli Bergdorf, right,

409
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:30,140
and you can see that they're they're circles are not there are much more spread apart than in other organisms that we've been talking about today.

410
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:38,780
What about susceptibility testing now when we can't grow it on an artificial media as we would do a Kirby Bower test or anything,

411
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:46,700
we can use tetracycline for relapsing fever or just regular doxycycline for Lyme disease?

412
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:51,080
So it's easily treated if a person can take a tetracycline type drug.

413
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:56,460
There is a Lyme vaccine, but most people don't take it.

414
00:47:56,460 --> 00:48:01,130
OK, it is. There is a line vaccine, but it's it's not used routinely.

415
00:48:01,130 --> 00:48:07,130
If you go to your doctor and say, I want to be brought up to date on my vaccines. I did that just last year.

416
00:48:07,130 --> 00:48:14,780
It took months. They don't give Lyme unless you have a specific need to have the one vaccine.

417
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:19,130
But what we could all do, you say, OK, let's go for a walk in the woods.

418
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:25,640
Or when I was a kid living in Nebraska, we'd go out in the cornfields near our house and have our secret hideaways.

419
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:40,730
You know, put a bug spray bug spray the same way you would do to combat mosquitoes, use bug spray that will help.

420
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:50,870
OK, we go from that to Leptospira, and this left the live in water contaminated by urine from infected animals b dogs,

421
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:57,860
rats, cattle, pigs, horses and wild animals just about everything across the spectrum except for cats.

422
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:03,500
How do we see the despair we have to use a dark field on CSF or urine?

423
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:12,080
It can also be detected by a rise in antibody titer, and there are multiple serologic assays available for leptospirosis.

424
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:17,870
The veterinary labs may culture for Leptospira, but the human labs do not.

425
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:23,120
So I'm wait. I'm trying to get invited to see the machine veterinary lab.

426
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:32,420
My friends at work there, I want to see the lab, so I want to see how they what they would do with what they actually do cultures there.

427
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:39,260
But it would only be a large veterinary lab that would do that. But as I said, it's not news.

428
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:49,950
Culture is not used much for for humans. We have molecular tests, we have dark field, we have antibody tests and we have a lot of antibiotics.

429
00:49:49,950 --> 00:49:57,300
So let this virus a month, inspire kids. They may be free living, they may be associated with animal health.

430
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,400
They are like fresh water. They like soil. They like mud in tropical areas.

431
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,730
So if you're wandering around in Michigan, it's not really tropical, even in the summer.

432
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:17,340
So we don't have to worry too much about let the spray. Although, you know, if you go wandering in the woods, always you need to have bug spray on.

433
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:24,490
The organisms are really energetically complexes over 250, nor no one serologic types of live.

434
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:32,130
This let this fire up. Certain geographic areas may have certainly left the spiral servers and species.

435
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:39,350
But that doesn't mean the serializing characterization is not an absolute predictor of where it came from.

436
00:50:39,350 --> 00:50:42,960
OK, it's not like if you cross this line, you can't have the serology you have to have.

437
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,490
This strategy doesn't happen that way.

438
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:56,490
So after the first phase, the first phase is fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, vomiting and diarrhea does not sound pleasant at all.

439
00:50:56,490 --> 00:51:01,560
Then the patient may recover. Think that they're over it? No, but they become ill again.

440
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:06,540
OK. This is the second phase that occurs. It's more severe.

441
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:19,820
Patient may have kidney or liver failure or meningitis. So it's important to even if you have mild symptoms, get it treated initially.

442
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:26,180
But the tree is treated with antibiotics, such as doxycycline, a type of tetracycline or penicillin,

443
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:30,890
should be given earlier in the course of infection if it goes on further.

444
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:38,570
The patient may need intravenous antibiotics with if they have severe symptoms.

445
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:47,030
Certainly, anybody who has an illness that they can't figure out, they need to call a doctor, get in and get seen and if the doctor can handle it.

446
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:53,420
I do dr. And that's it for today.

447
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:58,670
So do you have any questions on this lecture?

448
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:04,190
It was pretty sure I know that we have a test and I'm going to take them the vote again.

449
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:11,360
How many want the test in the next lecture period versus the day you come back from spring break?

450
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:17,860
So look first for the next leg, which would be this coming Wednesday. How many votes for this coming?

451
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:26,890
To how many want the that you come back from spring break day one?

452
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:32,980
OK, so the test will be there. I will be in here on Wednesday.

453
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:37,270
I'll probably give you a short lecture for something that won't be on the test.

454
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:42,370
And then we'll go over some things I would say, remember this and this and this and this for the test.

455
00:52:42,370 --> 00:52:51,450
OK, so will be a real test review. Any questions?

456
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:58,560
Yes, we can get her back. Yes, I was going to bring them today, and I forgot the whole.

457
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:04,120
I'm sorry about that. Yeah. Any other questions?

458
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:19,210
Yes. You know, a lot of different.

459
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:26,230
They to make the therapy over this conflict, the mechanisms of the disease are always important.

460
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:31,000
I don't get into a lot of therapy.

461
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:37,330
You know, if I mentioned in the lecture that that's about the extent of what I would get into, I would never say how much?

462
00:53:37,330 --> 00:53:43,500
How long. You know, anything like that. OK.

463
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:54,300
More questions. I don't suppose we all want to stay here for another hour and just waste that time.

464
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:59,470
You know, if you want to let your questions.

465
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:11,410
OK, well, we will have a lecture on Wednesday, and then you all take off for a week of spring break and we'll have the test when you come back.

466
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:17,710
And if you're not here on Wednesday, I hope you have a wonderful spring break. I hope somebody is here on Wednesday because I'll be here.

467
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:32,980
OK. And then we'll start on either if anybody wants to review what's on the test or start on the next lecture, which of course will be reported.

468
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:42,833
Thank you all.
