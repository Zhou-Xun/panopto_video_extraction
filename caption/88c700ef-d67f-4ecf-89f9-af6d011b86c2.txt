00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:12,186
Welcome back to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:16,162
Today we're going to talk about
the role of genomic imprinting and

3
00:00:16,162 --> 00:00:19,230
early environmental exposures.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,630
The Dutch winter famine is a great example
suggesting that adult disease risk is

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,560
associated with our adverse environmental
conditions early in development.

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,330
However, have you ever wondered the
mechanisms behind this relationship and

7
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:40,570
why the gestational timing of the insult
and the sex of the exposed individual

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:44,860
could result in different
later in life consequences?

9
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,750
What kinds of environments
could lead to these variations?

10
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,020
Following the previous video we are now
going to further examine the associations

11
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,310
between genomic imprinting and
early environmental exposures.

12
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,534
The first objective is to
understand that imprinted gene

13
00:01:02,534 --> 00:01:07,462
expression is affected by dietary and
environmental exposures.

14
00:01:07,462 --> 00:01:12,688
Second, we will use a case study from
the primary literature to evaluate

15
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:20,030
the effects of folic acid supplementation
on imprinted gene DNA methylation.

16
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:24,584
Over the years we've learned a lot about
the environmental effects on genomic

17
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,416
imprinting.

18
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:30,597
Assisted reproductive technologies,
like in vitro fertilization or

19
00:01:30,597 --> 00:01:37,172
egg cryopreservation can result in altered
epigenetic programming at imprinted genes.

20
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:42,328
Additionally, in animal studies
we know that the diet right

21
00:01:42,328 --> 00:01:48,810
after birth can affect genomic imprinting
at those Igf2 imprinted genes.

22
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,699
Third, exposure of mouse embryos to
ethanol during early pre-implantation

23
00:01:54,699 --> 00:01:59,874
development prior to when most women
know that they're pregnant can

24
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:04,890
affect DNA methylation at that
H19 imprinting control region.

25
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:12,535
And finally, the chemical acrylamide can
disturb genomic imprinting in sperm.

26
00:02:12,535 --> 00:02:15,910
While in the previous slide we have listed
some of the journal articles that have

27
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:19,610
examined environmental effects
on genomic imprinting.

28
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,935
Now we want to study this
example in greater detail.

29
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:28,220
This research article examined
the association between

30
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:31,523
periconceptual maternal folic acid use and

31
00:02:31,523 --> 00:02:38,220
increased DNA methylation of the IGF2
gene in the young offspring.

32
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,228
Many countries worldwide recommend
that women planning pregnancy

33
00:02:43,228 --> 00:02:49,122
take 400 micrograms of synthetic folic
acid in the periconceptual period.

34
00:02:49,122 --> 00:02:52,580
And this is thought to prevent
birth defects in children.

35
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:58,900
Yet the underlying mechanisms of this
preventive effect are not entirely clear.

36
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:04,770
It turns out if you review the one carbon
metabolism pathway presented earlier,

37
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:09,210
that folic acid is what
we call a methyl donor.

38
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:13,151
So these researchers
hypothesized that maternal folic

39
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:17,269
acid use would affect markers
of global DNA methylation.

40
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:21,359
Including the availability
of s-adenosylmethionine and

41
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:26,266
s-adenosyl homocysteine to complete
the one carbon metabolism cycle

42
00:03:26,266 --> 00:03:31,660
that ends up in the methylation
of that IGF2 imprinted gene.

43
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,052
In this study they used
a cross-sectional design in mothers and

44
00:03:36,052 --> 00:03:40,217
children between 12 and
18 months of age were enrolled.

45
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:44,792
The children were eligible as
controls if they did not have a major

46
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,376
congenital malformation or
chromosomal defect.

47
00:03:48,376 --> 00:03:52,910
The final mother study
sample included 120.

48
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:57,220
This was 86 exposed mother-child pairs and

49
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:02,060
34 mother-child pairs who
were unexposed to folic acid.

50
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,930
They collected folic acid use via
a self-administered questionnaire.

51
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,990
And DNA methylation levels
were performed on genomic

52
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:17,670
DNA that was extracted from whole blood
samples obtained from the children.

53
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,994
And in fact, they looked at
five particular cpg sites in

54
00:04:21,994 --> 00:04:25,582
the IGF2 deferentially methylated region.

55
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:28,945
And they did this measurement in
triplicate to ensure rigor and

56
00:04:28,945 --> 00:04:31,110
reproducibility.

57
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:35,140
This is one of the tables from
the results section of this slide.

58
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:40,327
And what table two shows is that
absolute DNA methylation of

59
00:04:40,327 --> 00:04:45,835
the CpG sites in IGF2 gene
are associated with folic acid use.

60
00:04:45,835 --> 00:04:50,948
For example in IGF2-R there
was a 4.5% increase in

61
00:04:50,948 --> 00:04:58,845
the number of cells methylated in
the folic acid exposed children.

62
00:04:58,845 --> 00:05:02,220
While finding an altered DNA
methylation State at IGF2

63
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,600
is a pretty significant finding.

64
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,680
It's also important to realize that
many epigenetic epidemiology studies

65
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,000
have limitations.

66
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,990
One of the limitations of this study
is that they did not find a positive

67
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,990
association between the mother's folic
acid use and higher infant birth rate.

68
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:27,050
This indicates that other factors together
such as macronutrients, micronutrients and

69
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:34,880
even exposure to toxins are also
contributing to changes in birth weight.

70
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,813
Additionally, this study relied on genomic
DNA that was extracted from the whole

71
00:05:39,813 --> 00:05:41,251
blood of the children.

72
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:46,080
And blood is a very
heterogeneous cell population.

73
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,610
Therefore any changes in DNA
methylation may reflect changes

74
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:55,830
in cell populations and not necessarily
changes in DNA methylation.

75
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,600
Therefore, it's important for future
cities to not only look at things like

76
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,019
blood but to look at Target tissues
including perhaps live for biopsies
