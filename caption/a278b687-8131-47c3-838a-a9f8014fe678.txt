00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,740
Hi, my name is Daniel Lee.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:12,100
I'm professor and associate chair of health management and

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,740
policy in the school of public health.

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,430
Welcome to the module.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:23,350
In this module, we'll continue to discuss management of health organizations,

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,800
focusing on another critical element of organizations.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,960
Human resources, that is people.

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,230
Now, you may say, why is this topic relevant to me?

9
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:39,020
I'm not gonna be human resource manager.

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,900
Well, it is relevant to you, unless you plan to be an entrepreneur and

11
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,170
form a one person company throughout your entire career,

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,290
otherwise understanding the knowledge of management and

13
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:56,510
human resource management is highly relevant to you.

14
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,150
Because we all work in organizations and

15
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:04,510
because many, if not all of you will be in management positions.

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,542
In charge of managing people.

17
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:14,309
Until robots can completely replace human beings as the work force, it's impossible

18
00:01:14,309 --> 00:01:20,710
to talk about organizations and management without thinking about people.

19
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,540
Other than financial capital, people are the most important element and

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:30,960
constitutes the largest category of expenses in organizations,

21
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,206
including health organizations.

22
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:39,600
Lets take CHASS, a community health center in Detroit as an example.

23
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,685
At CHASS, it's personnel costs, salary and

24
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:50,290
benefits consume almost 60% of the total operating expenses.

25
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:56,960
And this doesn't count the costs due to turnover, recruitment, and training.

26
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,770
On the other hand, poor management of human resources could be very costly.

27
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:08,120
Every year employee turnover and disengagement costs the US

28
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:13,471
economy more than $500 billion.

29
00:02:13,471 --> 00:02:18,510
Now, we know how important human resource are to organizations.

30
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,200
What is human resource management then?

31
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,000
What does it do?

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,860
Human resource management or HRM broadly speaking

33
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:33,850
is the management and development of employees in an organization.

34
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:39,540
Basically, Human Resource Management involves overseeing everything

35
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,150
related to managing on organizations human capital.

36
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:49,417
It also includes creating, managing, and

37
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:55,810
cultivating the relationship between the employer and the employees.

38
00:02:55,810 --> 00:03:02,010
So basically, there's six basic human resource functions.

39
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,180
The first functions is tracking applicants and hiring strategically.

40
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:11,840
In other words, managing the hiring process.

41
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,020
Let me give you two quotes.

42
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,985
First, in his best selling book, Good to Great,

43
00:03:16,985 --> 00:03:22,850
author Jim Collins stressed, I quote, leaders of company

44
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:28,490
that go from good to great start not with where but with who.

45
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,150
They start by getting the right people on the bus,

46
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,110
first the people, then the direction.

47
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,530
Unquote.

48
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:41,155
Similarly, the famed former GE, CEO Jack Welch once said,

49
00:03:41,155 --> 00:03:45,800
I quote, I only have three things to do.

50
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,440
I have to choose the right people, allocate the right number or dollars and

51
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,010
transit the ideas from one division to another, with a speed on light.

52
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,220
So I'm really in the business so being the gate keeper and

53
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,050
the transmitter of ideas, unquote.

54
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,450
Notice that the first thing that he focused on is the right people.

55
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,300
Similar to what Jim Collins said, getting the right people on the bus.

56
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,041
Indeed, supplying organizations with qualified and

57
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:23,978
reliable talents is a critical function of human resources management.

58
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:29,070
The second basic function is training managers and employees.

59
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:34,610
Once hired, Talents need development there for

60
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,170
Human Resource Management play a critical role in training manager to be better

61
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:48,830
leaders and training people employees to have a deeper and wider skill set.

62
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:55,200
The third basic function is designing the on-boarding process for new employees.

63
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,380
Many health organizations in particular are complex and

64
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:02,180
have very distinct culture.

65
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:07,990
So it is difficult for new employees to hit the ground running right away.

66
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:13,130
It is human resource management's responsibility to make it easy or

67
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:16,710
easier for new employees to adjust and

68
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:22,060
be integrated into a new environment and culture.

69
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,310
To fourth basic function is managing pay, benefits and time off.

70
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:32,040
It's actually quite easy to think about the importance of this function

71
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,300
by asking ourselves.

72
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,990
Do we stay long in an organization,

73
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,640
if it pays you poorly, offers limited benefits including time off?

74
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,000
I wouldn't.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,590
So solve design and management of time off benefits

76
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:54,420
can save organizations lots of money, time and effort

77
00:05:54,420 --> 00:06:02,380
in employee retention, and reduce the loss of talents due to turnover.

78
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:08,430
The next basic function is conflict resolution, which is quickly important

79
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,490
simply because conflicts are inevitable where there are people.

80
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:19,350
Conflict resolution is particularly important in health organizations because

81
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:24,240
many employees tend to have diverse professional backgrounds in for

82
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,340
example Medicine, nursing, public health, social work, nutrition,

83
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:36,740
pharmacy, business, psychology and other social science so you name it.

84
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:40,570
Because of the diverse background, they bring different values and

85
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:43,050
preferences to the workplace.

86
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,780
If managed well.

87
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:48,370
The differences are the source of innovation and synergy.

88
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:52,110
That's why we celebrate difference and diversity,

89
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:57,243
but managing poorly, the differences may lead to conflict.

90
00:06:57,243 --> 00:07:01,480
Studies have shown that 67% of

91
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:07,480
people avoid coworkers because of office conflicts.

92
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:13,560
And 25% avoid conflicts by simply not coming to work.

93
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:20,030
So imagine the cost if conflicts are not properly managed.

94
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,520
Finally human resources management may have to handle legal issues

95
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:31,630
on behalf of organizations, human resource management is responsible for

96
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:35,860
the compliance of labor and employment laws.

97
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:40,740
It also handles discrimination and harassment complaints.

98
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,940
In 2016 alone There were over 91,000 discrimination and

99
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:51,450
harassment charges filed with the EEOC,

100
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:55,760
The US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

101
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:59,660
So having a dedicated human resources specialist

102
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:06,280
handling legal issues is very important for organizations.

103
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:09,900
Don't take those six function for granted.

104
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:13,990
Let's just imagine what this duration maybe

105
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:17,980
if human resources management is completely absent.

106
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,850
Or, if they're doing a very poor job.

107
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:23,650
There would be poor hiring.

108
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,670
Meaning, getting wrong and wrong people on the bus, so to speak.

109
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:34,970
Poor pay and benefits management, as a result the morale

110
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:42,050
among employees will be low and they have very poor commitment to the organization.

111
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:45,121
And because this dissatisfaction and conflict,

112
00:08:45,121 --> 00:08:48,320
the work environment could be toxic.

113
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,180
And the organization ends up with a terrible reputation.

114
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,150
Now, just imagine all these consequences.

115
00:08:57,150 --> 00:09:00,110
Would you want to be in that kind of organization?

116
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:03,959
I'm sure the answer is absolutely no.

117
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,860
Finally, it's useful to think about human resources management

118
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,290
as a piece in a puzzle.

119
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,890
As a matter of fact,

120
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:19,040
human resource management is the piece that links everything together.

121
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,720
It's critically important for the organizations and for that fact,

122
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,160
any organization's future development, strategic planning and

123
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,306
implementation, productivity and performance, and reputation.
