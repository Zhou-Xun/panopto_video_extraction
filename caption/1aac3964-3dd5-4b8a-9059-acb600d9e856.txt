1
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:12,425
In this module, I'm going to introduce you
to some of the agencies that are focused

2
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,280
on occupational Health.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,410
You may think that OSHA, the occupational
safety and health administration,

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,550
is a monolithic Federal agency with
incredible power that's constantly out

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:27,040
enforcing and making sure that our
workers are safe and healthy on the job.

6
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,297
However, that in fact is often
not the case as we'll see.

7
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:35,254
So the US Occupational Health framework
is actually quite fragmented and

8
00:00:35,254 --> 00:00:37,564
involves a number of different agencies.

9
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:41,576
From a regulatory perspective, we've
talked about the Occupational Safety and

10
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:45,713
Health Administration or OSHA, which is
actually part of the Department of Labor.

11
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:50,370
And they cover all private industry
employees in the United States.

12
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,330
It turns out though that mining as
an industry has historically been so

13
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,250
dangerous that they have their own
administration, the Mine Safety and

14
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:02,950
Health Administration or MSHA, which is
also part of the Department of Labor.

15
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,290
However, if you are a railroad employee,

16
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,800
you are covered by the Federal
Railroad Administration or FRA,

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,666
which is part of the Department
of Transportation.

18
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:13,787
And if you work in the aviation industry,

19
00:01:13,787 --> 00:01:17,120
you're covered by the Federal
Aviation Administration or FAA,

20
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,540
which is also part of
the Department of Transportation.

21
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,580
So you can see here even
at the Federal level,

22
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:26,870
we have many different agencies who
are responsible for keeping workers saf.

23
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:30,050
From a research perspective,
we have the National Institute for

24
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,330
Occupational Safety and Health,
which is housed within the Centers for

25
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,640
Disease Control and prevention.

26
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,820
So to distinguish these groups,
the regulatory groups are responsible for

27
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,400
setting and enforcing standards.

28
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,175
And NIOSH is responsible for researching
hazards and making recommendations for

29
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:49,747
things that The Regulators should look at.

30
00:01:49,747 --> 00:01:53,527
If we go back in time to 1970
when the Occupational Safety and

31
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:57,595
Health Act was passed,
that actually established OSHA and NIOSHA.

32
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:01,499
And at the time OSHA was given
to means for protecting workers,

33
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:04,594
one is what's called
a statutory general duty and

34
00:02:04,594 --> 00:02:10,000
that's a requirement that employers
provide a safe and healthful workplace.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,590
And the second is the ability for
OSHA to pass standards on specific hazards

36
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:19,510
to say if this hazardous present you
need to take these additional steps.

37
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,650
A recognized hazards in the workplace
is a substance or an exposure for

38
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,800
which OSHA has a standard, so they may
have a standard for a particular chemical.

39
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,388
But again, they may not have a standard
but sort of rely on the fact that any

40
00:02:33,388 --> 00:02:37,606
reasonable person looking at this
substance would know that this is

41
00:02:37,606 --> 00:02:41,089
something that's unsafe for
workers to be exposed to.

42
00:02:41,089 --> 00:02:44,390
So they do, in fact,
have quite broad powers.

43
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:49,310
So OSHA requires virtually every employer
in the private sector to basically furnish

44
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:54,170
their employees a place of employment and
a job which are free from these recognized

45
00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:00,360
hazards that are causing or likely to
cause death or serious physical harm.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,112
So that sounds great and for
OSHA it's quite powerful mandate.

47
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:08,838
But the situation is actually even
more complicated than I've led on.

48
00:03:08,838 --> 00:03:13,797
I already hinted that Federal agencies can
have different jurisdictional conflicts,

49
00:03:13,797 --> 00:03:17,023
and if that happens workers
can fall through the cracks.

50
00:03:17,023 --> 00:03:19,637
An example it's flight attendants, who for

51
00:03:19,637 --> 00:03:24,248
many years lobbied the Federal Aviation
Administration for better coverage,

52
00:03:24,248 --> 00:03:26,670
approached OSHA and said can you help us?

53
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,969
OSHA then approached the FAA and said
can we help and the FAA said no, thanks,

54
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:34,428
we've got it taken care of while
they continue to do nothing.

55
00:03:34,428 --> 00:03:36,610
So at the Federal level things are bad,
but

56
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:39,161
even at the state level
it gets more complicated.

57
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:43,513
As the you'll see from the graphic here,
we've got a map of the United States and

58
00:03:43,513 --> 00:03:46,521
you'll see about half of
the states have adopted to have

59
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:49,401
a so-called State OSHA plan,
including Michigan.

60
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:53,383
So here in the state of Michigan
we have Michigan OSHA or MIOSHA,

61
00:03:53,383 --> 00:03:57,386
which only focuses on work that
occurs in the state of Michigan.

62
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:01,077
So half of the states rely on the Federal
government for enforcement and

63
00:04:01,077 --> 00:04:02,810
the other half do it themselves.

64
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:07,401
And that means you can have two
states side-by-side like Michigan and

65
00:04:07,401 --> 00:04:13,004
Ohio that can have potentially different
occupational health and safety standards.

66
00:04:13,004 --> 00:04:16,969
Also, there are some industries that
aren't covered at all by OSHA or

67
00:04:16,969 --> 00:04:17,985
other agencies.

68
00:04:17,985 --> 00:04:22,669
Forestry, farming, and fishing is a good
example of one that's not well-covered.

69
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,590
Oil and gas production is
another that's not well-covered.

70
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:29,165
And offshore work is for
the most part completely not covered by

71
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:34,030
Occupational Safety and
Health Regulations from the US.

72
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:37,130
I'd like to take a moment and
walk you through how a standard gets set

73
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,190
in the United States for
occupational health.

74
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:41,803
So on the left side of this graphic,
you see a notation for

75
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,878
factors that influence decision-making.

76
00:04:43,878 --> 00:04:46,004
That could be things like time or

77
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:50,033
scientific controversy about
a particular type of hazard.

78
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:53,090
Then at the top of the graph,
you'll see risk science decisions.

79
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:56,146
So this includes things like
selecting a point of departure.

80
00:04:56,146 --> 00:04:59,985
In toxicology, that's effectively
identifying what is the level of

81
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:04,290
a chemical above which workers
start to be adversely impacted.

82
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,724
It can involve things like
an uncertainty factor saying well,

83
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:11,805
we don't actually know enough to be
precise in knowing how much it chemical

84
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:15,133
causes harm to workers, so
we'll build in a safety factor.

85
00:05:15,133 --> 00:05:19,324
And it involves integration of all the
weight of scientific evidence that we have

86
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:20,780
available.

87
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,900
There are also as you'll see at
the bottom policy decisions here.

88
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,990
So what's the feasibility of passing
a standard, is it economically feasible?

89
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:29,850
Is it technically feasible?

90
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,680
And what's the acceptance of risk?

91
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,369
Do we set a standard that protects
all workers from any impact or are we

92
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:39,709
comfortable with some fraction of workers
dying, but most workers being fine?

93
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:42,957
And all those things come together
ultimately to set a standard for

94
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:46,090
occupational health.

95
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:48,930
OSHA and other agencies have a couple
of different types of standards

96
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:49,540
they can pass.

97
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:54,375
So OSHA sets what are called Occupational
Exposure Limits generically and

98
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:59,095
OSHA specifically cause there's
Permissible Exposure Limits or PEL.

99
00:05:59,095 --> 00:06:00,575
These come in a variety of flavors.

100
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:05,435
So for example, a PEL might say the
concentration of a chemical that we have

101
00:06:05,435 --> 00:06:09,061
to keep a worker below over
an eight-hour working day or

102
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:13,634
a lifetime to keep the risk of a health
outcome to an acceptable level.

103
00:06:13,634 --> 00:06:17,869
It could also be some level of physical
agent radiation or noise that's not

104
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:22,257
expected to produce any health effect or
perhaps only a small health effect.

105
00:06:22,257 --> 00:06:26,222
Or it could be very specific like the
number of hours in one day that a truck

106
00:06:26,222 --> 00:06:28,890
driver can drive safely.

107
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,700
OSHA also sets different time limits for
their standard.

108
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,630
So one might be a daily limit.

109
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:38,308
A lot of OSHA limits are specified
as a time-weighted average or

110
00:06:38,308 --> 00:06:40,482
TWA over an 8-hour period.

111
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:45,042
These daily limits are designed to protect
workers from being exposed day after

112
00:06:45,042 --> 00:06:50,025
day over a 40-year career and, again,
protect them from chronic health effects.

113
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:54,270
OSHA could also set what's called a
short-term limit over a 15-minute period.

114
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:58,249
And that's designed to protect
workers against a very acute effect

115
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:02,103
from a chemical that might harm or
kill them almost immediately.

116
00:07:02,103 --> 00:07:04,658
OSHA does sometimes set what's
called a ceiling limit.

117
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:08,069
So that's a level above
which workers can never go.

118
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:11,340
And then some other agencies will
set an emergency chemical limit.

119
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:16,208
Basically, how much of a chemical in
the air, for example, after a disaster or

120
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:20,785
a chemical spill is going to be allowable
before someone is either killed or

121
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:22,695
permanently incapacitated.

122
00:07:22,695 --> 00:07:25,888
Or may be impaired enough
that they couldn't

123
00:07:25,888 --> 00:07:30,518
escape from the the chemical cloud
from the spill, for example.

124
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:32,698
Switching to tracking occupational health.

125
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:34,226
We have a number of ways to do this.

126
00:07:34,226 --> 00:07:37,792
The Bureau of Labor Statistics at
the Federal level conducts what's

127
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,129
called a Survey of
Occupational Injuries and

128
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:44,090
Illnesses to get a sense of all of
these things that happen in the US.

129
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,350
They also conduct a census of
Fatal Occupational Injuries to

130
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:52,050
make sure we count every single
worker death in the United States.

131
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:55,340
There's Insurance data that's
available from workers compensation or

132
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,790
from private health insurance.

133
00:07:57,790 --> 00:08:00,900
Unfortunately, we know in all of
these mechanisms under reporting is

134
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,620
a huge problem.

135
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,833
In other words, workers not reporting to
someone that they got hurt or they're ill.

136
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:10,471
The graph shown here basically highlights
a single study's results where they

137
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:13,863
interviewed a bunch of workers
in a particular setting and

138
00:08:13,863 --> 00:08:16,925
also looked at the records
kept in their workplace.

139
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:21,392
The gray bars in this graph here show the
fraction of the workers they looked at who

140
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:23,238
were hurt over the study period.

141
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:28,307
So that's a good thing that most workers
in this workplace did not have an injury.

142
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:32,549
The blue bars show the fraction of workers
who were hurt but never told anybody,

143
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:35,228
other than the researchers
when they were asked.

144
00:08:35,228 --> 00:08:39,285
The green bars show an incident that
was reported to the employer, but

145
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,667
that the individual worker
did not tell the researchers.

146
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:47,564
And then the red bar shows the fraction
of injuries that were reported both to

147
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:50,025
the employer and to the researchers.

148
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:54,042
So you can see here that there's
a pretty small fraction that

149
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:59,310
are actually captured and reported to
the employer and tracked formerly.

150
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:01,890
The vast majority
are actually not reported.

151
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,820
We also see here that there are
differences by racial and ethnic groups.

152
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,700
So that's something else
we need to account for

153
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:12,720
when we think about occupational
injuries and illnesses in the US.

154
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,460
I mentioned in a previous module that
we have very good information on worker

155
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,220
fatalities.

156
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,590
This is something we focus on and

157
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:22,500
we do truly try to capture every
fatality as part of a census.

158
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,120
Where does that information come from?

159
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,809
Well, as you can see here a lot of
it comes from death certificates or

160
00:09:27,809 --> 00:09:28,536
autopsies.

161
00:09:28,536 --> 00:09:31,743
But some of it comes from
things like the news media, or

162
00:09:31,743 --> 00:09:34,670
OSHA following up on a reported fatality.

163
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:37,880
Or state workers compensation or
even police reports.

164
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,704
So we have to look across many different
sources to come up with an accurate count

165
00:09:42,704 --> 00:09:45,018
of, unfortunately, dead workers.

166
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:47,282
I'd like to spend a moment
just to compare and

167
00:09:47,282 --> 00:09:50,872
contrast how we regulate worker
health versus environmental health.

168
00:09:50,872 --> 00:09:55,077
In a previous module, we've talked
about the EPA which is responsible for

169
00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:57,826
monitoring air, and water,
and soil in the US.

170
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:00,343
And setting and
enforcing pollution regulations.

171
00:10:00,343 --> 00:10:06,274
This is a big agency about 14,000
employees and a budget of over $8 billion.

172
00:10:06,274 --> 00:10:10,278
If they find that someone is
intentionally breaking the law,

173
00:10:10,278 --> 00:10:14,981
they can apply civil penalties
of $32,000 per incident per day.

174
00:10:14,981 --> 00:10:18,494
And they can send someone to jail for
up to 15 years.

175
00:10:18,494 --> 00:10:23,150
And EPA when they're setting their
acceptable risk level often says we don't

176
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:27,099
want to see more than 1 in 1 million
exposed people, for example,

177
00:10:27,099 --> 00:10:29,230
get a cancer case from an exposure.

178
00:10:29,230 --> 00:10:31,918
If we contrast that to
OSHA who's responsible for

179
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:34,926
working environments,
they set and enforce health and

180
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:39,215
safety regulations much smaller agency,
only about 2,000 inspectors.

181
00:10:39,215 --> 00:10:41,024
A budget of only half a billion dollars.

182
00:10:41,024 --> 00:10:44,167
That's 16 times less than the EPA.

183
00:10:44,167 --> 00:10:48,638
A maximum civil penalty of
$70,000 if OSHA can prove that

184
00:10:48,638 --> 00:10:51,466
an employer knowingly killed a worker.

185
00:10:51,466 --> 00:10:56,348
So think about that you are worth to your
employer's $70,000 in the event that they

186
00:10:56,348 --> 00:10:59,059
knowingly do something
that leads to your death.

187
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,178
And only six months in jail for
killing you.

188
00:11:02,178 --> 00:11:06,827
And OSHA sets an acceptable risk
of not 1 in a million people but

189
00:11:06,827 --> 00:11:09,737
more like 1 in 10,000 workers.

190
00:11:09,737 --> 00:11:12,852
I want to spend a moment here talking
about international occupational

191
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:13,596
health as well.

192
00:11:13,596 --> 00:11:17,220
You may have heard of the International
Labor Organization or ILO.

193
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:20,961
This is part of the United Nations and
their job is to promote rights at work,

194
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:23,598
including the right to a safe and
healthy workplace.

195
00:11:23,598 --> 00:11:26,966
The work they do is designed
to inform the legislation and

196
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:30,490
management in all of
the United Nations member countries.

197
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,794
Among other things, they anticipate and
identify emerging issues.

198
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:38,410
And they're also very integral to
developing international standards.

199
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,680
Multinational companies also have
a role to play in international

200
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,570
occupational health.

201
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:47,190
They often employ more than 100,000 or
even a greater number of workers.

202
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,915
Because they work in many different
countries, these companies are subject to

203
00:11:50,915 --> 00:11:54,037
many different and sometimes
conflicting regulations and laws.

204
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:58,289
So a lot of times what a multinational
company will do is look and see what is

205
00:11:58,289 --> 00:12:02,558
the most protective or restrictive law
in any of the countries we work in.

206
00:12:02,558 --> 00:12:06,527
And then we apply that rule across our
facilities knowing that they're all

207
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,920
going to be compliant then.

208
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,578
That actually gives additional protections
to workers in countries where the health

209
00:12:12,578 --> 00:12:15,823
standards are not so protective,
which is a real benefit.

210
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:19,435
I want to wrap up and just note that there
are huge international differences in

211
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:20,946
terms of occupational health.

212
00:12:20,946 --> 00:12:26,092
So here we're looking at accident fatality
rates per 100,000 workers in 2014.

213
00:12:26,092 --> 00:12:28,102
You'll see in Europe and America,

214
00:12:28,102 --> 00:12:31,960
workers are much safer by
comparison than in Asia and Africa.

215
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,846
So this does just highlight that workers
around the world are in need of improved

216
00:12:35,846 --> 00:12:37,008
occupational health.

217
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:40,886
But there are certain areas where that
need is even greater than we have here

218
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:42,709
in the US.
