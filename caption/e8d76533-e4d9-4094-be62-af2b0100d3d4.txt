1
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:30,350
I'm not sure you're going to be joining us today. So.

2
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:34,910
Before I went to allergy,

3
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:51,650
I moved this lecture to another date and it pertains to the use of omega three fatty acids in people at risk for cardiovascular events.

4
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,089
And there was a question or comment of, oh,

5
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:01,309
I had heard that some of you had heard this is a recommendation supplementing their

6
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,660
diets with a fish oil capsule to prevent them from getting cardiovascular disease.

7
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:18,800
And I had mentioned well, the recommendation from the American Heart Association was to consume two fish meals a week, preferably fatty fish.

8
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:28,670
Salmon would be an example. And that's been shown to be associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events.

9
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:40,190
And if you look at data focusing on the use of these omega three fatty acid supplements, the waters are a bit more muddy there.

10
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,090
Their benefit is somewhat questionable.

11
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:50,240
And we're going to walk through this study that was recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

12
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:56,059
So so the title of the paper,

13
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:06,090
effective high dose omega three fatty acids versus corn oil on adverse cardiovascular events in patients at high risk of cardiovascular risk.

14
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:09,140
And this is the strength randomized clinical trial.

15
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:18,230
So the high dose refers to four gram dosage of the supplement, which is which is actually really high.

16
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,830
How many of you consume fish oil supplements? Anybody you have just started yesterday, you did all the intestinal issues, actually.

17
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:36,890
Oh, really? Okay. Well, you'll be able to share your experience so far when we get to the side effects.

18
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:46,610
So let's start out just going through the introduction and they bring up some really interesting ideas and concepts here.

19
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:54,410
So when I hear duction, the authors mention the potential for cardiovascular benefits of omega three fatty acids.

20
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:58,850
What were they in particular and what was mentioned in this paper?

21
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:13,799
Yeah, it might get three fatty acids so she can reduce the risk of cardiovascular events through favorable impacts on lipoprotein

22
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:21,390
metabolism and inflammatory oxidative thrombotic vascular and with more genetic factors linked to cardiovascular disease.

23
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:31,680
Yeah. And we had talked a bit about these that the omega three fatty acids in the form of Eicosapentaenoic acid,

24
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:41,670
EPA or Docosahexaenoic acid DHEA were the lipids here that were correlated, inversely correlated with cardiovascular risk.

25
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:52,979
And as she said, they seem to exert favorable effects on lipoprotein metabolism, inflammatory and oxidative,

26
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:08,460
thrombotic and vascular pathways and events and arrhythmia genic factors relating to heart arrhythmias and implicated in cardiovascular disease.

27
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:16,770
So did any of this surprise you in terms of the background which you read?

28
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:22,860
No. Okay. So they cited this one particular group of studies.

29
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,730
This was a meta analysis.

30
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:39,600
So this is a a paper looking at a number of studies in this, collecting data, looking at now this multivariate adjusted hazard ratio.

31
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:49,680
They're looking at now plasma phospholipids and risk here for cardiovascular events.

32
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:56,759
And they're looking at plasma, EPA, plasma, EPA eicosapentaenoic acid.

33
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,870
We haven't talked about that one,

34
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:04,380
but that's another omega three fatty acids that you would find in the blood after you've gotten one of these supplements.

35
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:11,190
And then that cause a hexane awk acid shown here in the bottom and there's the spleen

36
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:19,500
showing you what's happening to the group and the variability here within this population.

37
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:27,840
This is actually a collection of studies and meta analysis. You see that there's there's some variability associated with this response.

38
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:36,060
But you can see in all cases, more lipids, more omega three fatty acids in your in your plasma,

39
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:41,790
lower a hazard ratio for cardiovascular disease events.

40
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:51,210
And then here's another way to look at this data.

41
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:58,950
And this is, look, looking at fish consumption in this particular example where you had the adjusted risk ratio.

42
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:02,660
And in this case, they're not looking at the lipids per se in the blood.

43
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,250
They're looking at fish consumption, fatty and fatty fish consumption and grams per day.

44
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:18,810
And you see a similar relationship. But the spread of the dots is a little bit all over the place with the lower doses.

45
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:26,520
So it's not until you get out to here the higher consumption of fish that you start to see this decline,

46
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,520
a greater decline in the relative risk, adjusted relative risk.

47
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:40,770
So what does that say about comparing the supplement to consuming fish?

48
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,260
Fair dose response.

49
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:06,200
The EPA appeared to be, you know, the more of these snippets you had in your blood, that there was a an easily recognizable decline,

50
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:12,440
even when you concluded all of the data points in terms of the variability that you would see here.

51
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:23,180
Here's that the same sort of variability that you would see if you were to get us blind and look at the mean effect that the standard deviations,

52
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,460
variability of the response.

53
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:35,690
But here's here's one and here's the elevated risk, though it's not until you get to the higher doses that you actually see a shift in these lines.

54
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:43,910
And they only have one data point from one particular study here where they looked at a really high fish consumption and grams per day.

55
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:58,820
So there does appear to be a dose response with fish, but it's not as the data aren't as tight as you would see in the supplemental trial.

56
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,240
So we're looking at the levels of these fatty acids in plasma.

57
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:10,009
So it appears that that's the key behind the effects of this this intervention.

58
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,930
It's getting the levels of omega three fatty acids up in the blood.

59
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:21,530
And this is what seems to have the beneficial effects in terms of reducing your risk of cardiovascular events.

60
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:37,770
Okay. So in question to what were the results of the previous clinical trials that evaluated the effectiveness of fatty acids,

61
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,420
omega three fatty acids and the prevention of cardiovascular events?

62
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:52,700
Yeah. One of them, we concluded that low doses of omega three fatty acids did increase EPA, DHEA concentrations.

63
00:08:52,710 --> 00:09:02,700
Right. And then I guess I think it was a separate study said that the low dose incidence in a wider range of participants.

64
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:06,090
Did it decrease cardiovascular events? Right.

65
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:11,580
So what else what else about these studies?

66
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:25,760
So there was also another study that gave higher doses of Omega three and they saw effects on the EPA concentrations.

67
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:29,020
So I think there's a lot of. Well.

68
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,630
Well, will you stop here for.
