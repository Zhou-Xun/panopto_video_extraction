1
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:24,690
You. Whenever you're ready.

2
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:34,200
Yeah, I've been. We did have artificial heart and beating cancer.

3
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,820
Um, so, like, what is artificial intelligence?

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,190
I could use, like, computers to do tasks that, like, normally like humans or performs like visual tasks, like perception tasks, things like that.

5
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,520
So it's applying artificial intelligence to cancer.

6
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:53,670
They want to they're doing a clinical trial right now at Northwestern University so that they can view visual scans.

7
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:58,260
So this is like this specific study. Um, so is breast cancer.

8
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,530
So, like, thinking about, like mammograms and things like that.

9
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:07,140
But the current system for mammograms right now, so you get your mammogram, you wait 30 days.

10
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,190
And then if there's like problems with the mammogram, like they catch something,

11
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,280
then you have to like follow up with like another scan so that they can do like a more intensive mammogram.

12
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,390
And then depending on like the availability of radiologists, basically wait again with that scan to get your diagnosis.

13
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,920
Um, so it's this new like artificial intelligence, like algorithm.

14
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,310
Basically, the mammograms are read by a computer and this is done within minutes.

15
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:38,699
And then basically if the movie room by the theater is like flagged, like they think something's not normal, then they can have like a radiologist.

16
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,770
Ron Paul Just read that like immediately and then follow up with the patient then within like a few minutes.

17
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:48,770
Um, so obviously this is like a lot quicker and eliminates like the article talked about,

18
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,439
like scans are really like you're waiting these like 30 days for results or something.

19
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,770
It's like you're waiting even longer.

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:59,400
Um, so that way, like it would eliminate that anxiety and thinking about it would also be beneficial because like,

21
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:05,160
you wouldn't have to follow up as much. So like if you're having to go in for a mammogram, take the day off or things like that,

22
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,800
find someone like walk your kid, you wouldn't have to like go back just because they thought they found something.

23
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,709
And then another possible guess is that it would like eliminate the workload for the radiologist,

24
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,150
because right now there's a really high demand for cancer screening. So this would just a lot more people get screened.

25
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,950
Another part of this article was talking about pancreatic lesions or or things like that.

26
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,650
And so the article was talking about a project that's being done right now at Johns Hopkins.

27
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,460
It's called the Felix Project, and it's working on identifying pancreatic cancer.

28
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,160
And right now they have a prototype in development and they've been testing it,

29
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,760
but it's not like far long enough for it to be used in medical settings yet.

30
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,610
But they're saying it's been very accurate so far. Um, so basically like radiologists in, um,

31
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:59,460
colleges have gone through thousands of CT scans of pancreatic cancer and are identifying what it looks like so that the A.I. can then identify it.

32
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,909
And it's interesting because it actually has been successful and the article is

33
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:12,299
saying that pancreatic cancer has like a 10% survival rate after five years,

34
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,990
and that's largely due to the fact that it's diagnosed so late.

35
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:24,720
So like this was saying that the AI could potentially pick it up a lot earlier in its progression so that it can bend the survival curve.

36
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:27,300
So we thought that was really interesting. Um, yeah.

37
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:34,019
And then like they talked about, like looking ahead with this type of like technology, um, so they want to make a note that like,

38
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:38,430
while these advances are important, like a tool is only good as an application and it's user.

39
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:43,439
So like, these are like important, but like you have to be able,

40
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,849
they want to like make sure that they're using like a comprehensive look at everything so that they're not just using like the visual scans,

41
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:56,100
they're using imaging data, clinical data or other lab data, and then being able to like look and predict like what cancers exist.

42
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,450
So yeah. And then like kind of like a why we picked this article.

43
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:06,870
Um, so with the cancer growing like continue to increase, it's really important that we come up with new technologies and things like this.

44
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:09,299
And obviously like the part about breast cancer,

45
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,860
like it's Breast Cancer Awareness Month and they all know about like the earlier detection for breast cancer,

46
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:18,720
the better prognosis you're likely to have. So finding those earlier or getting more people screened is really important.

47
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,500
Yeah, another reason you picked it was because you're talking about earlier in the semester

48
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,690
how like doctors have to go through and manually see if a scan shows cancer.

49
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:32,270
But this is saying that maybe we can use technology to help with that.

50
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,310
So other. Interesting. Very cool.

51
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:43,120
Any thoughts? Yeah, we have lots of comments.

52
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,149
So I a couple of things that I'm thinking. So first of all, so I've had a mammogram.

53
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:56,010
I'm over 40 yay. Mammograms, right? And actually, my results came back super fast.

54
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:01,509
So I think that there's probably a disparity actually in terms of like who is getting their results more quickly.

55
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:06,219
Like if you're in a higher X area, more radiologists, you know,

56
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,720
you're going to a hospital that has tons of staff, then you probably are getting your results pretty quickly.

57
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,270
So I think that this actually could really help with disparities, and I think it could actually really help them.

58
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:20,170
Like thinking ahead, I'm thinking this could be really good in a global setting,

59
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:25,600
right where they don't have a ton of pathologists or radiologists to read these things.

60
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,020
They can do it and then I can flag and then the handful of people that they have can actually look at the scans.

61
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:36,250
I think that is actually where this could be super useful right now,

62
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,290
this thinking because like I've only AP and so like I looked it up and the only place you can get a mammogram is in Marquette, Michigan.

63
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:44,800
So like for me, that's like an hour and a half drive for other people, it could be like a three hour drive.

64
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:50,020
So like, yeah, creating like technology like that could be important for like the thing I sort of

65
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:53,499
like follow up like if they wouldn't have to come back so that I didn't understand,

66
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,120
right? Because there's a certain picture.

67
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,400
Like anybody I know who's had to go for a follow up, it's for a biopsy, usually because they see something weird.

68
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,389
They don't know what it is just from a mammogram. They're like, there's a weird thing.

69
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:10,810
We can't tell what it is. And then you have to go back for like for the product, which is a biopsy or maybe an MRI or something like that.

70
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:19,480
Right? But like a different picture. Like, it's it's not that they can't the doctor can't, can't read it in a computer could.

71
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,340
It's just that like you need a different technology or a different test done in order to be able to tell.

72
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:31,900
So I don't know. I thought that was a little odd. Yes. Like I understood it from the article is like so like they just do the scan like

73
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,570
someone just came up with a regular screening and then they like saw something,

74
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:37,719
but they weren't because of that scan, they were able to figure out what it was.

75
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,030
So then they want you to come back for the more intensive mammogram, which is usually a mirror and a biopsy.

76
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:47,530
Yeah. So I think that's what it was kind of aiming towards in this particular like vertical.

77
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:47,859
Right.

78
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:54,280
But I guess if you're flagged by a computer or by a person, you would still have to come back to that test because the article said that like before,

79
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,879
the patients even dressed like they would already have already. Oh, you're already.

80
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,940
Oh, that's cool. That's cool. Okay. Yes, yes.

81
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:04,120
That is very cool. Yeah, I like that.

82
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:10,390
That makes sense. Yeah. So that's great that it's actually going to be super helpful because I've had a friend my age who

83
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,800
got flagged because she had like calcifications or something which you can get if you breastfeed.

84
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:22,900
It's nothing. But like she had to go back and have a biopsy and like she was a wreck for like the two weeks because she had just had a,

85
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,300
a friend our age who'd got had breast cancer.

86
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:32,139
And so I think she was like, I don't know what, you know, because she had someone close to her who actually did get diagnosed with breast cancer.

87
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,890
So it didn't seem like this far up and impossible thing for somebody her age.

88
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,300
So she was losing her mind for like two weeks before she. It was only two weeks.

89
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,400
Like if it was a month. Oh, my God, what a nightmare.

90
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:48,010
The other thing I wanted to point out is with pancreatic cancer, which group is doing pancreatic cancer?

91
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,810
What's survival like for people diagnosed at stage one? Do you remember offhand?

92
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,799
No, but survival. Yeah. So that's the thing.

93
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,720
If you look up like all these people who are like we had a screening test for pancreatic cancer because survival is so bad,

94
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,720
I'm like, yeah, it's still like 36%, five year survival for people diagnosed at stage one,

95
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:14,679
which is very different than something like ovarian, right, which is like 90% survival at stage one.

96
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,570
So for ovarian cancer, I'm like, yes, if we had a screening test for ovarian cancer, people would not be dying.

97
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:24,190
It would be like breast cancer, right? Sure. If we had a screening test for pancreatic.

98
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,190
It's still rough. Right.

99
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:33,010
And so there's more to it than that. What are you going to say? The big reason why the mortality rate is so high is because you can.

100
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,790
Screened for pancreatic cancer at such an early stage.

101
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:44,270
It's a ball in your body. Yes, it is, I'm sure.

102
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:48,840
But if you were able to. But for people who are diagnosed at stage one, it's still bad.

103
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:54,920
So even if you had a perfect screening test to diagnose everybody at stage one, it's still bad.

104
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:01,070
I mean, if you can identify a precancerous lesion and screen for that and take it out before it became cancer, that would be great.

105
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:07,730
I don't know. I feel like there's there's more things that need to happen with pancreatic cancer.

106
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:13,610
It's not just screening. And then the current treatment that we have, it's a screening plus some improvements.

107
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:18,200
Right. Or figuring out why it is so ugly even at an early stage.

108
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,700
Right. But yeah, I mean, whatever we do for pancreatic would be great.

109
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,370
But I just wanted to point that out because I think everyone is like, Oh, it's just because it's diagnosed late.

110
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:35,060
And I'm like, I mean, for, for something like ovarian, for sure, for something like pancreas, that's more it's that plus, right?

111
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,200
That makes sense. Yeah. Cool. Any other thoughts or questions?

112
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:45,640
All right. Diet in obesity today.

113
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:55,390
Oh, I already opened it only to redownload it through here. Okay,

114
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:08,440
so today I want us all to sort of I want to think about the biologic mechanisms by which body fatness and obesity might actually be causing disease.

115
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:19,089
But also think about how some of our social the lens through which we view this and health is is steeped in our society.

116
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,100
Right. And our society is very anti fat.

117
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:29,980
And I want to think about that and think about how that could be influencing a lot of the kind of the rhetoric around obesity and health.

118
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:38,319
Right. So let's first talk about dietary assessment and we have two questions here.

119
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:43,290
Over the past year, how often did you drink caffeinated coffee and what is the first thing you ate or drank yesterday morning?

120
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,300
So this is obviously the two different assessments that you did, right?

121
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:53,379
You did kind the food frequency questionnaire, which asked sort of the first question and then you did the assay 24,

122
00:10:53,380 --> 00:11:00,790
the dietary recall, which sort of asked the second question and this is the exact involved the food frequency questionnaire.

123
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,699
I'm not going to go into that because you already did it. All right.

124
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:12,790
So, you know, this is really getting at you guys all had great thoughts about the differences between these, right?

125
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:19,930
You came up with a lot of what I'm going to mention today. So food frequency questionnaire or that is more like a meal or food based.

126
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,530
It talks about your past diet or your long term average diet, right?

127
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:30,879
24 hour recall is really getting at your current diet. The thing you also have to think about and a lot of you came up with this, right,

128
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:36,300
is so I noticed one person was like, I had a really weird diet this day, though I filled it out today.

129
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,610
My diet was really weird because I had I ate out twice, right?

130
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:44,319
Like what if you filled it out weekday versus weekend, right?

131
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,200
Like how many people eat really differently on the weekends than they do during the week?

132
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:52,569
Like if you're going to a football game or going out to eat or something is totally it's not the same, right?

133
00:11:52,570 --> 00:12:00,790
You might like that's your cheat day or whatever. Right. Seasonally, how many people eat differently in the summer than they do in the winter?

134
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,690
Like the winter rolls around and I want like stew and soup and I want bread, you know, and then like seven rolls around.

135
00:12:07,690 --> 00:12:14,200
I'm like, I want all of the fresh tomatoes in this one and a half month period because other than that, the trash and I have no interest, right?

136
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:19,120
So bring it on. And then the rest of the summer rest, the rest of the year, I don't want it.

137
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:26,709
So I think it's very different. Right. The diet record you can a lot of you said it was easier to be accurate, right?

138
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,390
Because you were you were you had sort of the database immediately.

139
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,280
But some of you also mentioned it wasn't right.

140
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,809
Some of you were talking about like, well, the brand of the thing that I ate wasn't in there in that database.

141
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:44,049
And so or I made a dish that had a lot of ingredients and it was really hard to to put it into this system.

142
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:49,240
Right. And then a few of you were saying, you know, this is really skewed toward a Western diet.

143
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,200
The things that I eat aren't in this database. Right.

144
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,320
So it's really it is really hard, right, to do it.

145
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,710
There are pros and cons. That's why we have both. Right. The food.

146
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,660
But also think about this. What if you're interviewing cancer patients who are currently sick?

147
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:12,340
Like if you're going to interview a head, neck cancer patient, for example,

148
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:16,300
and you're going to see some surgical pictures and sorry for anybody who doesn't want to see that you're

149
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,110
going to see some surgical pictures and you're going to see that these people are not eating a normal diet.

150
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:20,349
Right.

151
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:26,980
Even before the surgery, some of them are experiencing a lot of pain, difficulty swallowing, and they are not eating what they normally would eat.

152
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:34,230
Right. So if you ask them, what did you eat in the last 24 hours, you're going to get a weird answer here.

153
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:39,070
If you're interested in what their diet did to cause their cancer,

154
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:45,460
you're not going to get the right answer because the diet they're telling you about is not the diet that they were eating with their cancer developed.

155
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,320
Right. So you have to think carefully about which one is right.

156
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:57,310
If you're going to do a 24 hour recall, it might be good to do it multiple times, right?

157
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:02,950
Get a few weekdays, get a few weekends, get some summer, get some winter.

158
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:08,200
Do you know what I mean? Like take it multiple times throughout the year, get them to do like a full week or two.

159
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:14,200
Right? So you have to be thoughtful about how you do it.

160
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,420
And like for cancer, patients will often say like, what was your usual diet?

161
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:26,139
We will do a food frequency questionnaire and ask about usual diet prior to your cancer

162
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,590
diagnosis for like a year prior to your cancer diagnosis or something like that.

163
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:33,910
Right. But of course, that's really hard to do. Like and you all identified this is really hard.

164
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,220
Like I eat a handful I'd one of you I remember that I eat a handful of Eminem's I don't

165
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,380
like occasionally I don't know how to write that into a food frequency questionnaire.

166
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,250
Right like that's I agree like I don't know cooking.

167
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:49,120
The other thing that is really hard to capture well is like oils and cooking.

168
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,240
Like how much? I don't know.

169
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:58,319
I put some in so that the onions didn't. You know what I mean?

170
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,670
Like, it's really hard to quantify that on a food frequency questionnaire.

171
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:08,820
Right. So those kinds of things are top people are also really bad at.

172
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:14,160
This was a picture back here. Sometimes they'll have these pictures like how well-done was your meat?

173
00:15:14,970 --> 00:15:18,930
Please, please not d like, just don't eat it if it's like that.

174
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:25,110
But you know, how well-done do you usually cook your meal or like, what size portion do you normally eat?

175
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,360
Right. Because people are really, really bad at telling you how big of a portion they eat.

176
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:37,280
Most people are, right. How many people have ever, like, measured a portion of ice cream?

177
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:46,900
It's very sad. If you actually measure what the with the cartoon says is a portion of ice cream and put it in your bowl, you're like, oh no,

178
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:55,510
that's not very much ice cream at all, you know, or even cereal, like breakfast cereal you put in your bowl, you're like, That's a postage stamp.

179
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,180
What's happening? So, like, people don't actually eat what the serving size is of a food.

180
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:06,880
Who do you suppose is really, really good at telling you what serving size they've eaten of something?

181
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:16,310
Maybe diabetics, people who have a particular health condition that requires them.

182
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:24,760
Maybe bodybuilders. What about people who have suffered from an eating disorder?

183
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:34,300
They're going to be real good at it. Right. So the people who are more accurate are going to be different than the people who are less accurate.

184
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:43,240
Right. So that could be a problem. So all of this is to say that this is really hard to do and we don't have a perfect way to do it yet.

185
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,960
You have to have a valid and appropriate food frequency questionnaire for your population.

186
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:55,330
If I'm going to go into Dearborn and do a study in the MENA population, I am not going to take that food frequency questionnaire that I showed you.

187
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,480
I see you rolling your eyes. Yeah, right.

188
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:06,070
I mean, you would need something different. You would need an appropriate food frequency questionnaire for the population that you're going in.

189
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:11,859
If I'm going to go to an Asian pop and East Asian population like in L.A., I'm not taking that food frequency questionnaire.

190
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:17,200
I'm not taking the one I talk to, the minor population. I'm taking something different. Right. Some of these have been worked out.

191
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:25,360
Some of them have not been worked out. Right. There may not be a food frequency questionnaire for your population, and that is a whole thing.

192
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:30,370
Like you're going to need a dietician, you're going to need people who do all of this kind of research.

193
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,980
Then you need a nutrient database to back it up, because what you do is you take all these answers to your food frequency questionnaire.

194
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:42,219
You run it through existing computer software that has a nutrient database to back it up,

195
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:50,590
and then you can get out of it like grams of protein, grams of fat, different fats, micronutrients like calcium.

196
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:58,149
You know what I mean? Like, what you get out of that is this very detailed data about all of these things that people eat.

197
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,059
But the way you get that is that there's a nutrient database that says, Oh,

198
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:05,520
if they eat a hamburger, it has this much protein, this much fat, this much higher, this size.

199
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:15,100
And so if you don't have a database to underlie the food frequency questionnaire for this particular population you're interested in,

200
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:22,570
you can't it doesn't matter. Right. So there's a lot of development that goes into these things to be able to use them in the end.

201
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,670
And that is sometimes there for certain populations and sometimes not.

202
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:38,440
Right. That makes sense. Any questions or things you wanted to bring up after having done those questionnaires or comments that you wanted to make?

203
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:49,320
Okay. Did you guys think it was useful to do those to see?

204
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:57,260
I mean, even even so it shows you that even people who are very health literate, who are very health conscious, we're going to be doing this research.

205
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:02,719
It's hard to fill those out right accurately. But we don't have anything better.

206
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,800
Right. What what they will do for you.

207
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:13,330
So it's going to be really difficult to to get perfectly accurate.

208
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:19,670
Like if you get a food frequency questionnaire from somebody who eats a ton of something versus somebody with very little of it,

209
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:24,680
you can probably be sure that you are discriminating between very high and very low intake.

210
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,570
Right? It's pretty good at that. So if you get some sort of result from your food frequency,

211
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:39,230
food frequency questionnaire and you categorize those people into high and low or like very high,

212
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:45,320
medium, high, medium, low, very low, you probably are getting good discrimination between very high, very low.

213
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:49,190
And that's kind of what we've relied on a lot with these food frequency questionnaires.

214
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,879
Um, what it doesn't do well is measure absolute levels of intake.

215
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,610
So if you find people who eat a lot of vitamin D have a lower risk of cancer than people who eat very little.

216
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,200
What's a lot how much vitamin D should you tell people to eat?

217
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:12,190
It's very hard to get that information from the data you've collected.

218
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,750
Right. Plenty versus very little is better.

219
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:26,350
But we can't make an absolute recommendation. So lots of measurement error, like we've said, particularly in prospective cohort studies,

220
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:31,210
this is likely to be non differential with respect to the outcome. Everybody's equally bad.

221
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:38,050
I mean, I gave you some examples about people who might be more accurate, but they're probably a minority of your population, right?

222
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:44,260
So on average, everybody's pretty bad at this, pretty equally bad.

223
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:53,980
And it would likely mostly bias toward the null. And it means that what that does is it makes it difficult to find smaller effect sizes,

224
00:20:54,260 --> 00:21:00,459
more modest effects, which is kind of what we anticipate dietary effects are on chronic disease.

225
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,540
Right. That makes sense. So this is a challenging area.

226
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,950
We really need more accurate and objective dietary assessment methods.

227
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:17,920
People are working on this, right? One like cool thing that people are working on is this idea that like you take a picture before and after you eat,

228
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:26,230
you calibrate your camera using this kind of chessboard thing so that like it's calibrated to size.

229
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:33,090
And then you take a picture of your meal before and after and like the computer can figure out how much of it you ate there.

230
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,090
It's going to be still very hard for like mixed dishes. Like if I make a stew, how much oil is in there?

231
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,880
They don't know. Right? Did I use butter or did I not?

232
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,290
You know, so it's going to be it's this is in its infancy,

233
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,700
but these are the kinds of like creative solutions that people are trying to come up

234
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,010
with to be a little bit more objective about serving size and how much of it you eat.

235
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:02,830
There's also some biomarkers that people have used, like laboratory measurements, right?

236
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:09,280
We can do this for certain micronutrients in your blood. For example, there are some biomarkers for food groups.

237
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:12,549
There's also blood biomarkers of cooking methods.

238
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:20,440
So patches, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, that's what you get when you eat like the charred part of the meat.

239
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,080
That's why we were asking about the done this level of your meat.

240
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:31,770
If you eat charred meat, it makes these which are carcinogenic and you can actually find them in like in adults and like colon cancer is,

241
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:37,360
for example, stomach cancers. So and in the blood.

242
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,170
So you can look at these biomarkers of exposure to those kinds of things.

243
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:48,310
But none of this is looking at your diet as a whole, right? It's like looking at pieces of your diet.

244
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:53,350
And people don't eat foods. They eat meals. Right?

245
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:58,600
You don't eat pages. You eat things kind of together.

246
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:03,400
So dietary patterns are kind of this attempt to capture the totality of the diet.

247
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,020
And we get this again from from the food frequency questionnaire or the dietary recall data, right?

248
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:15,160
So you're trying to define how people are eating and identify kind of similarities and different differences across foods, people or observations.

249
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,960
You're kind of partitioning food items and people into groups summarizing their variability.

250
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:28,300
So essentially these usually generate hypotheses and answer different research questions then like the micronutrient biomarker data, for example.

251
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,950
So here's a cheesy example. Say you're craving a burger.

252
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:37,900
Sounds even better with the cheese and the bacon. Why not get the fries in the coke or the milkshake too?

253
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:46,420
Now you're going to get the veggie burger, the side salad and the green tea. So most people fall somewhere between.

254
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,229
But you don't eat in isolation is the point.

255
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:56,530
Right? And people who tend to eat healthier in one way, often kind of eat healthier in all of those ways.

256
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,160
Does that make sense? Things go together.

257
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:06,279
What do you eat with a steak? Yeah. Big potatoes.

258
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,730
Yeah, that's right. What do you with a burger? French fries.

259
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,070
What do you eat with your salad?

260
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:20,290
Well, you're probably eating healthy vegetable kinds, united saying like so it's not we we already have in our head what things go together.

261
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:30,069
Right. All right. So kind of you end up finding the way this is done is you kind of receive a score for

262
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:36,700
each pattern and then you are classified into levels and this is modeled together.

263
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:42,880
This can be done in a more or less requiring more or less priority knowledge.

264
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,629
You can do something called factor analysis or principal components analysis,

265
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:55,090
which basically just the data tells you how to group things or you can't go all the way down to like diet quality indices,

266
00:24:55,090 --> 00:25:00,340
which is based on like recommendations about like healthy people 2010 or things like that,

267
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:07,600
where people have already assigned scores to foods and these are all useful.

268
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:12,820
But you just have to understand what you're doing and how much knowledge you're putting in.

269
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:21,850
Okay. There's a lot of ongoing research for trying to find biomarkers of dietary patterns.

270
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:29,740
Metabolomics is one way that people are doing this. So we've talked a bit about Gwas, which is an agnostic method, right?

271
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,520
You're kind of measuring everything and seeing what's associated with your outcome.

272
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,770
In this case, we're going to measure all of the low molecular weight compounds, say, in blood.

273
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:43,450
People are doing this in saliva. They're doing it with other kinds of things.

274
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:52,060
Right. And we're looking at those in relation to your dietary patterns from your food frequency questionnaire.

275
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:59,349
Right. So you're trying to associate blood biomarkers with dietary patterns and it's in its infancy.

276
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,220
This is not something people are actually using.

277
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:10,000
We're still trying to identify those things, but it's trying to find a more objective measure of dietary intake.

278
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:16,900
That makes sense. So dietary assessment is messy.

279
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:23,050
It's really hard. There's no perfect way. All of the things that you guys commented on are drawbacks.

280
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:29,530
Both the food frequency questionnaire and the dietary recall are useful, but for different things, maybe in a different populations.

281
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:34,420
And they both have pros and cons and neither are great.

282
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:44,140
Right. So we still do this because we think diet is important in relation to chronic disease and cancer, but we know we're not doing it perfectly.

283
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,670
It's tough, tough road health. All right.

284
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:55,659
So what do we know about nutrition and cancer? So this is put out by the American Institute for Cancer Research.

285
00:26:55,660 --> 00:27:00,880
They used to put out like a whole book every few years. Now it's an ongoing update online.

286
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:05,930
So this is very comprehensive, talks about foods, multiple cancers, both incidence and survival,

287
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,429
talks of physical activity, obesity, your body composition, composition.

288
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:21,669
And it has a global perspective. So now you can get this online at this website and it is ongoing.

289
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,710
So they're continually updating it. They're not like putting out a new one every so often.

290
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,010
It's just continually updated.

291
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:36,610
So these are their recommendations generally be as long as possible without becoming underweight, be physically active as a part of everyday life.

292
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:41,310
What is it? That seems weird. What's that? Was that as a part of everyday life?

293
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:45,760
Part? Been like, you know, an exercise.

294
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:58,169
That's right. It's getting at this idea that sedentary time is independently associated with disease risk from physical activity.

295
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:03,870
Right. So if you sit all day and then go work out for an hour, like that's great that it works out, but the sitting is still bad, right?

296
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:08,130
Okay. Limit the consumption of energy dense foods and avoid sugary drinks.

297
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:12,900
Eat mostly foods of plant origin. Limit intake of red and processed meat.

298
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,849
Because those have been shown to be associated. Cancer risk. Limit.

299
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:25,290
Alcoholic drinks are also associated with cancer risk. Limit consumption of salt and avoid moldy cereals or pulses.

300
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:30,300
That's kind of the British English term for seeds like beans, lentils and peas.

301
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:34,280
As a pulse. You think of that?

302
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:38,960
Yeah. I like to love the wording, especially on the first line.

303
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,460
Great. Yeah.

304
00:28:53,130 --> 00:29:05,400
I will say that most of the public health recommendations and discourse around weight and health I find to be very does not consider that at all.

305
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:15,720
It feels very blind to its own fatphobia, blind to its own kind of.

306
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:23,520
It blames people for their weight a lot. And we're going to talk about that and how that's inappropriate, I think.

307
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:34,110
And it does ignore kind of the negative mental health and negative stuff around eating disorders and that kind of thing.

308
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:41,060
I think. Yeah. I don't think that.

309
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,820
Is in everybody's genetic.

310
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,290
It's everybody's genetic body type. Yeah. Agreed.

311
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,830
I agree. Yeah.

312
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:05,240
Also, like a lot of this is like not really taking. Not everyone is, is or housing.

313
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:14,120
Like something like breastfeeding? Yeah. There's a reasons why people like.

314
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:23,960
We're eating mostly. Yeah.

315
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:30,850
Agreed. I mean, if we take this if we if we take this is like these are the ideal recommendations.

316
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:34,030
And then we recognize that there are barriers to that that we could address.

317
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:39,340
I think that's one thing. It doesn't feel like that the way it's been worded.

318
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:51,220
I agree. But I agree that putting the onus on individuals to do all of this is is inappropriate and impossible in many situations.

319
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:55,850
Yeah. But actually the first time I think for me.

320
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:03,070
Yeah, I guess that. Three on top of the heroin in the diet.

321
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:08,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

322
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,879
I agree. And I think people are coming around to this a bit more, this idea that,

323
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:21,260
like we have conflated for so long what people find attractive versus what is healthy.

324
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:27,130
Right. And there has really been this kind of push to to say everybody should be thin

325
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,069
without really paying attention to the fact that some people can be unhealthy.

326
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:34,300
And people who are overweight or even like low level obese can be perfectly healthy.

327
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:42,100
Right. It's not you know, a lot of what we've seen is kind of like BMI and mortality or BMI and cancer risk.

328
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,280
And BMI is associated with a lot of things.

329
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:50,020
I'm going to talk about that. So I agree with all those. And we're going to get into that more detail in a few slides.

330
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:56,049
This multi cereals and pulses thing is about aflatoxin and this is the global perspective we were talking about.

331
00:31:56,050 --> 00:32:03,610
There are some places where people who are subsistence farming, for example, may store grains inappropriately and they become moldy.

332
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:09,840
And if you eat them, it's a very potent liver carcinogen. But again, if you don't have anything else to eat, what are you going to do?

333
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:13,260
Be like, Oh, that looks a little moldy. I can't eat it. Probably not.

334
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:18,249
Right. Um. Aim to meet your nutritional needs through diet alone.

335
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:24,190
This is getting at the idea that supplements have not really panned out as being preventative for cancers,

336
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,410
and this mother should breastfeed and children should be breastfed. We touched on that.

337
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:35,710
So, okay, these are kind of some very specific recommendations for specific parts of the world.

338
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,340
Avoid consumption of multi as drunk in parts of Latin America, very hot and through a metal straw.

339
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,760
Anybody heard of this type of tea?

340
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:52,989
The metal straw keeps it real, real hot. And there have been studies showing that consumption of very hot beverages

341
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:57,700
can actually cause irritation to the esophagus and lead to esophageal cancer.

342
00:33:00,390 --> 00:33:04,230
So most of you're all like, oh, god, I'm drinking my tea.

343
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:09,900
Too hot. Probably not. Like, this is a very cultural thing and specific parts of the world.

344
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,290
I think if you went to these places and they offered you tea, you'd be like, Oh my God, I'm going to die if I drink that.

345
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:18,120
Like, it's just it's one of those things that's like, we probably don't do it here, right?

346
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,590
For the most part, avoid consumption of Cantonese style salted fish.

347
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,080
Children are not to eat this type of fish. So this is a salting kind of preservation thing.

348
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:36,660
It's a very specific cultural dish, and it's carcinogenic and avoid the use of any source of water that may be contaminated with arsenic.

349
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:43,800
Probably don't want to do that anyway, but if you don't die from the arsenic because it's low enough levels, it can give you cancer over time.

350
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:57,840
Okay. So this is one of these things that we've looked at, the approximate relative risk associated with obesity.

351
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:04,800
Right. So this is obesity as measured by BMI, which is not ideal, which we're going to talk about.

352
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,639
Right. And all of these things are on the list.

353
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:16,320
But cancer with this relative risk of 1 to 2 is here. And I want to say that even physically, obesity is not just BMI.

354
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:22,040
Okay. So there's always the you know, who's got a really high BMI that's super healthy, right.

355
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:24,390
Bodybuilders. Everyone wants to use that example. Right.

356
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:29,970
So people who have a ton of muscle mass are going to be have a big BMI but not be actually overweight.

357
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,170
Fine. There's also all of this other kind of stuff, right.

358
00:34:34,770 --> 00:34:45,000
So abdominal obesity is actually much more strongly associated with risk of cancer and other diseases compared with just subcutaneous fat.

359
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:53,190
Right. So having really abdominal obesity is caused by this visceral fat, which is around the abdominal organs.

360
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:57,230
And having more of that visceral fat is actually associated with type two diabetes.

361
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,129
It's associated with all of these kind of it's it's an active and different organ and it's

362
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:06,600
associated with a lot more of this of like metabolic disorders and that kind of thing.

363
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,659
Right. And so that is actually a health concern, right?

364
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:15,360
So people who have like the really big belly might be people who have this abdominal obesity.

365
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:20,790
And you can measure this by waist size or waist to hip ratio, for example.

366
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:32,099
And so that has been actually more strongly associated with health outcomes in some studies compared to just BMI, weirdly.

367
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:41,579
Also, skeletal muscle is protective. And so this is people who are obese tend to have more muscle, right.

368
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,820
Because they have to move a larger body around. Right.

369
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:50,340
So just if you look at like a DEXA scan of a person's body who is obese, they tend to have more muscle.

370
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:56,489
The people who tend to be at the highest risk are people who have a lot of fat but little muscle.

371
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,120
Right. And so this is not really captured well by BMI alone.

372
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:09,660
And so also, this is not really on the slide, but the type of fat, the visceral fat is one thing.

373
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:16,860
But people have looked like brown fat versus white fat, which is something that you can tell with like these more detailed abdominal or DEXA scans.

374
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:19,950
And there have been studies looking at that and finding some associations.

375
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:28,170
And so it's really much more even if you're trying to capture body fatness, BMI is very, very bad because overall fatness,

376
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:36,670
even if even if BMI was good at capturing overall fatness, that is actually not the best measure for looking at relationships to health.

377
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,680
You need some more like detailed scans and things like that, to get at the visceral adiposity, or does that make sense?

378
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:50,360
So BMI is a bad measure, I would say. Okay.

379
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:56,390
So these are some of the things that we use weight in height, which can be used to calculate BMI.

380
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:05,600
Another thing that we talked about is this idea of estimating visceral versus subcutaneous fat deposition, this idea of waist circumference.

381
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:09,020
So you measure the waist circumference to measure the hip circumference, then you take the ratio.

382
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:13,490
You can also look at DEXA scans. Who knows what a DEXA scan is?

383
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:27,999
You're almost like that. So I think you might be thinking about bio impedance,

384
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,650
which is like the little hand-held thing that puts like an electrical current through and measures the resistance.

385
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,399
Is that what you're thinking about? Okay, so we'll talk about that in a minute.

386
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,000
But exascale is actually a giant machine that you lie down in and it scans your whole body.

387
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:46,960
And this is what they use, like for older. One of the more frequent kind of clinical uses of it that you may have heard about is in menopausal women.

388
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:53,020
They might look at it to look at bone density and determine if they need to take like a drug to help improve bone density.

389
00:37:54,730 --> 00:38:02,320
But you can use it and it'll give you a full look at a person's body. You can look at all of their fat versus muscle mass.

390
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,920
You can look at their bone density. You can look at where their fat is deposited.

391
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:13,670
You can even get like what kind of fat it is. So that is obviously the Cadillac of measurements if you're going to do it in a study of 50,000 people.

392
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:17,230
Do you think you can do DEXA scans on everybody now?

393
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,550
So this is again that population based study C saw of.

394
00:38:22,930 --> 00:38:25,960
Is it you know how many?

395
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:30,969
We need a lot of people to study cancer. If we have a ton of people, we can't get these detailed measurements right.

396
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:38,200
So you kind of have to find a sweet spot. You can also differentiate fat from lean mass, which is, again,

397
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:44,049
one of the things that BMI cannot do by doing DEXA scan, but also by all means and skillful.

398
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:49,630
So by you impedance is going to be one of those scales as like the little metal patches on it where you stand out and told you your percent body fat.

399
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,930
You can also do this with like a handheld thing that you like.

400
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:57,040
It looks like a heart rate monitor because it has like the little things on the handles and you put it there.

401
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:02,140
What that is doing is it's running a little electrical current through the body and it's measuring the resistance

402
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:10,270
and it determines calculations based on like age and gender and stuff that based on the resistance it reads,

403
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:15,880
it'll tell you like your body fat percentage versus muscle, essentially body fat versus other.

404
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:21,480
Okay. So you get a body fat percentage from that. It's sensitive to hydration.

405
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,659
So if you're very dehydrated, it will give you like a wrong answer kind of a thing.

406
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,020
But it's better than nothing, right? Yeah.

407
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:39,010
I don't know offhand, actually. Skin fold test.

408
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,150
Anybody know what that is?

409
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:50,170
I'm so glad you don't know what this is, because when I was in junior high and high school, this was part of the presidential fitness test in school.

410
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,290
They would line you up and do the skin full test.

411
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:59,410
The skin full test is where they take a little set of calipers and they hold up your arm and they measure how

412
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:04,960
much you have here and they measure how much fat you have here and they measure how much fat you have here.

413
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:09,490
Yeah, you look horrified. It was absolutely traumatizing.

414
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:14,800
Yes. And then you're in front of everybody and they tell you your number and they measure your body fat percentage that way.

415
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:21,820
Horrifying to a teenager, particularly, I think at the time, to teenage girls, but horrifying to everybody.

416
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:25,180
Right. I'm sure nobody enjoyed this. They don't do it anymore, right?

417
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:29,680
No. Nobody had to do this. Thank God, because that was awful.

418
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:33,820
But yes, that is one way you can do it. You can measure how much fat somebody has.

419
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:39,160
You have to be good at it, though. Like if you really squeeze, you're going to get a lower measurement.

420
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:44,080
But if you do it, the amount you're supposed to write like so it is user.

421
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:50,050
There's some user skill in actually doing this correctly, but that is one way you can measure body fat percentage.

422
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:54,280
Also, you can traumatize people if that's your goal.

423
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:03,429
Right. And so this is you can see how some of this is more possible in large studies than other things.

424
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:10,210
Right. This is why in cancer studies, we mostly get BMI, sometimes waist to hip ratio.

425
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:15,999
Right. Because you have to have somebody be able to report it to you.

426
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,020
If you're doing a study of 100,000 people, you just cannot go out there and measure these things.

427
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,010
All those people. Right. So it's rough. It's it's hard to get great data.

428
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:34,230
All right. There's a lot of biologic mechanisms that have been proposed for why being obese might cause cancer fat tissue.

429
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:40,450
One of the biggest ones that I think is the most clear is that in men and in post-menopausal women,

430
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:44,170
the primary source of circulating estrogen is fat tissue.

431
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:53,680
Okay. So for estrogen sensitive cancers like breast and a matriarchal being,

432
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,380
having a lot of body fat post menopause increases your circulating estrogen levels.

433
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:04,360
And if these are estrogen sensitive cancers and estrogen makes them grow, then that is a risk factor.

434
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:08,230
Right. So that does make some sense for some of these cancers.

435
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:18,670
It's associated with hyper insulin. Insulin. Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance.

436
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,740
All of these things are growth promoting, right?

437
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:28,700
Fat cells produce hormones and signaling signaling molecules like out of the kinds that may stimulator inhibit cell growth.

438
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:36,350
Leptin and adiponectin. For example, fat cells may also have direct and indirect effects on other tumor growth regulators,

439
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,819
and obesity is associated with chronic liver and systemic inflammation.

440
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:47,960
So all of these have been proposed as mechanisms by which obesity may be increasing kind of risk of cancer generally.

441
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,280
I think the strongest one is this one I think is pretty, pretty clear.

442
00:42:52,520 --> 00:43:00,530
Right. But the rest of them, I would also suggest there could be alternative explanations.

443
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,719
So if being fat causes disease, what is the logical intervention?

444
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:13,140
What should we be telling people to do? An easy question.

445
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,130
Yeah. Healthy exercise. Sure. To what end?

446
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,980
What is the goal? Right.

447
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:30,330
Lose weight. Exactly right. Does that work? No weight loss interventions that we currently have are ineffective.

448
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,890
People can do it for a short time and then they get it back.

449
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:40,920
Often, if they're being really restrictive, it reduces their metabolic activity, making it harder.

450
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:44,790
Like that's why people hit a plateau. They can't lose any more weight and then they gain it back.

451
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:49,230
Right. And people just can't restrict like that for that long.

452
00:43:49,740 --> 00:44:00,870
It's very, very difficult. Here is some population based data on 76,704 men and 99,000 women.

453
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,890
This is anyone who is in these obesity categories 30 or higher.

454
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,950
And I think that this is really interesting.

455
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:17,790
Even people in this 30 to 35 category, the annual probability of attaining normal BMI, meaning less than 30, is one in 210.

456
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,980
For people who are very obvious, you know, one in 608 or one in 677.

457
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:38,570
Right. And this is like who decreased or increased and people who showed an initial decrease in BMI.

458
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:44,720
So if people showed an initial decrease in BMI, most of them, 60% of them increased after that.

459
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:58,490
Very few of them were able to maintain. And this is just people who decreased if you're BMI, greater than 45 and you decrease your BMI.

460
00:44:59,390 --> 00:45:02,390
That does not mean that you attained a normal BMI. Right.

461
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:08,000
You'd have to lose probably over £100 at that point to be normal BMI.

462
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:12,590
Right. So even small weight loss is difficult to maintain.

463
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:16,880
Maintaining this kind of weight loss is almost impossible for most people.

464
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:21,470
Right. You're just fighting biology at a lot of ways.

465
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:25,750
So do you think that it is? Ethical.

466
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:32,770
If you're a public health practitioner or even a clinician to say you need to lose weight to

467
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:38,470
somebody if we do not have an evidence based way that people have been successful at doing that.

468
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:48,140
I don't think so. Right. Like, it would be like telling somebody you need to lower your cholesterol and we had no way of telling them to do that.

469
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:55,310
You don't do that to. You don't tell them that they need to change something about their their health or their body.

470
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:59,000
If you actually have no way to tell them how to successfully do that.

471
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,190
And that's where we're at. Right.

472
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:11,360
We think being fat is bad and we kind of shame people into you need to be less fat and we have no way to tell them how to do that.

473
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,030
But we still want to make it their fault when they don't. Right.

474
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:27,710
So then that begs the question, okay, if you can't ethically and successfully get people to be less fat, what else can we do?

475
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:33,800
Is being fat even the problem I proposed to a few mechanisms by wide body fatness might actually be the problem.

476
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:39,440
But here's some other things. What else is obesity associated with? Well, it's a subset of physical activity, right?

477
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:46,580
Generally, people can be larger and physically active, certainly, but often higher.

478
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:52,250
BMI is associated with lower physical activity kind of on the population level. Weight cycling.

479
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:58,640
Who are the people who have been on multiple diets over their life? Is that skinny people who have always been skinny?

480
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:04,580
Probably not. I mean, you ask any person who's been fat since they were a kid.

481
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:09,170
I guarantee you they've all been on Weight Watchers. And then they tried Jenny Craig and then they did the SlimFast Shakes.

482
00:47:09,170 --> 00:47:13,130
And then, I mean, like every single diet that's come along, you're like, maybe this is the one, right?

483
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:16,630
And a lot of them have lost weight and then get it back and lost it and gained it back.

484
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,110
Right. So the people who have gone through a lot of this weight cycling are generally the people with higher BMI.

485
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,390
And there is some evidence that weight cycling itself is actually bad for your health.

486
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:38,630
Avoidance of medical care, poor quality of medical care. Both of these things are very common for obese people, and weight stigma is bad.

487
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:47,580
There's a lot of evidence that stigma and kind of the stress that comes along with experiencing stigma is bad for people's health.

488
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:52,280
A lot of that evidence comes from literature on racial discrimination and racial stigma,

489
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,780
but fat people experience a great deal of stigma and discrimination as well.

490
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,040
And if one kind causes, you know, poor health outcomes,

491
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:06,650
I would be shocked if another crime didn't as well, although there is much less actual work in this area.

492
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:11,969
Okay. All right.

493
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:18,630
So let's talk about physical activity and cancer. This is a big article that came out, a commentary in the NCI in 2018,

494
00:48:19,890 --> 00:48:24,000
an integrated approach for deciphering the causal associations of physical activity and cancer risk.

495
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:29,129
The role of adiposity. So obesity and physical activity related cancers overlap considerably.

496
00:48:29,130 --> 00:48:34,530
That's what this table is showing, right? That these are there's a lot of diseases.

497
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:39,750
Right. That are both obesity and physical activity related or sorry, obesity related.

498
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,999
A lot of these are also physical physical activity related about obesity and

499
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,059
physical activity operate through a lot of the same biological mechanisms.

500
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:52,530
So a lot of those potential biologic mechanisms that I showed you for why fat

501
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:56,950
might be related to cancer are also ways that physical activity seems to deepen.

502
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,520
Those are the same pathways through which physical activity seems to work. Okay.

503
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:05,580
Physical activity reduces visceral fat and independently of effects on weight loss or BMI.

504
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:10,410
So they've actually done studies that have shown that people who are obese, if you put them on an exercise regimen,

505
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:16,620
if they do exercise, they may not have an overall change in their body weight and therefore their BMI does not change.

506
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:19,380
But what does change is their visceral fat will decrease.

507
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:26,459
And if that's the fat that's causing metabolic problems and causing cancer, then by all means, let's do that.

508
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:31,860
Right. The trouble is that people often undertake physical activity in order to lose weight,

509
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:38,399
not as its own kind of health related intervention independent of weight loss.

510
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,070
Right. And I think that's kind of the perception that needs to change.

511
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:46,340
So the conclusion is, if these conclusions are valid, physical activity may help prevent many more cancers,

512
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:53,790
and is currently appreciating physical activity by acting on the same obesity related mechanisms is likely to reduce risk of obesity related cancers,

513
00:49:53,790 --> 00:50:02,160
even if its impact on obesity is minimal. Given the difficulty in achieving lasting weight loss, this advice may be important.

514
00:50:02,250 --> 00:50:05,850
So maybe what people should be doing is encouraging people like, Hey, don't worry about losing weight.

515
00:50:05,850 --> 00:50:11,730
You should go out and start an exercise program. Go, go, walk, go do whatever you enjoy.

516
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:19,480
Right. Any trouble with that? It's not always like.

517
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:28,160
Yep. Not always safe and easy for people to talk. How about gyms and obese people?

518
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:34,270
How do you think that feels? That's a lot of fat shaming, right?

519
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:42,870
Or a lot of like, I don't belong here. I don't look like everybody else here. So but those are problems that maybe could be addressed.

520
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:49,920
Right. Like those are things that could be addressed and interventions could be developed that might be successful.

521
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:56,420
Right. All right.

522
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:57,920
So how do we measure physical activity?

523
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:04,220
If you measure the time that someone is doing and the intensity, you can calculate something called metabolic equivalence of task.

524
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:14,390
There's also this Act 24, which is very similar to the the Dietary 24 hour recall that you did,

525
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:20,860
but it's asking you to remember all that activity in the setting that you did. There's also activity monitors, right?

526
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:28,280
Everybody's like a Fitbit or your Apple Watch or whatever. So a lot of a lot of that data is actually being used to monitor physical activity levels.

527
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:38,980
So we actually have I would say we've made a lot more strides in objective ways of measuring physical activity than we have for diet.

528
00:51:42,970 --> 00:51:48,490
This is the oldest picture of the most rudimentary possible physical activity.

529
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:53,410
Monitor the pedometer you put on your belt. All right.

530
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,890
Any comments or thoughts about the physical activity discussion?

531
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:08,930
So divorcing physical activity from weight loss and concentrating on it as its own intervention, I think could be really beneficial.

532
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,230
All right. Let's talk about obese patients and medical care.

533
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:23,270
So patient obesity, you know, there may be threatening environmental cues or provider attitudes that result in enacted stigma.

534
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:27,650
All of this leads to the patient avoiding care. Patient experiencing stress.

535
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:34,550
Patient mistrust in provider. Patients having poor adherence to recommendations or poor communication in the patient provider interaction.

536
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:42,990
What do we mean by threatening environmental cues? Maybe not having.

537
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,389
For some women who are hesitant, obese women who are hesitant to go get a mammogram,

538
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:54,810
it's that they feel like the machine might be too small for them or the seats in the waiting area are too small,

539
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:59,430
or they don't have a scale that will measure up to their body weight,

540
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:04,769
or they don't have a big enough thing for the blood pressure, blood pressure cuff.

541
00:53:04,770 --> 00:53:06,030
Like that's what that things called.

542
00:53:08,910 --> 00:53:15,690
There's also more like explicit bias whereby providers may have stereotypes of the patient and that may influence their decision making.

543
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:25,000
And all of this leads to poor patient outcomes. Impact of obesity on gynecologic cancer screening.

544
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:30,250
So evidence indicates lower rates of breast and cervical cancer screening among obese, converted non-obese women.

545
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:37,120
So they're saying that appropriate equipment and supplies,

546
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:42,520
alternative screening methodologies and more culturally sensitive counseling approaches may improve screening rates in obese women.

547
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,760
I really like this culturally sensitive counseling approaches thing.

548
00:53:46,210 --> 00:53:49,780
I mean, how many people hate going to the doctor because they make you get weighed?

549
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:57,659
Yeah, me too. I actually tell them, no, I don't want to be weird and they never push back.

550
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:03,049
They're like, okay, but like it feels like you're going to be shamed.

551
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:06,920
Like you're worried that you're going to go. If you're, if you're an overweight person or an obese person,

552
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,379
like you're worried that you're going to end up with a doctor who's going to

553
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:12,500
spend the whole time not listening to what you're telling them as the problem,

554
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,630
but rather telling you that you're fat. Yeah.

555
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:21,860
Thanks. I also have mirrors, so maybe we could concentrate on what I'm here to talk about.

556
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:27,230
Right, is sort of the attitude that a lot of people have, but they avoid they avoid the interaction because they're worried about it.

557
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:37,520
This is a more explicit kind of bias under treatment of obese women receiving breast cancer chemotherapy.

558
00:54:37,550 --> 00:54:41,570
So this is our Jennifer Griggs is one of our professors here. I think she's in that department.

559
00:54:42,710 --> 00:54:52,100
She's also a clinician and this is looking at providers who are providing chemotherapy to obese women,

560
00:54:52,100 --> 00:54:56,870
are not actually titrating up the dose correctly for their weight.

561
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:59,480
Right. And so they're getting undertreated.

562
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:08,930
So for example, so if you look at the severely obese here, they're getting 85% of the total dose that they're meant to be getting.

563
00:55:10,970 --> 00:55:17,670
Chemotherapy. So obesity is associated with worse outcomes in breast cancer.

564
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:23,670
Is it because they're fat or is it because they're not getting treated the same way?

565
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:30,180
You know, maybe a little from column, maybe a little from column B, but we can't ignore this.

566
00:55:30,210 --> 00:55:35,280
Right. And just be like, well, you should lose weight or maybe you should give them the chemotherapy they need.

567
00:55:35,310 --> 00:55:39,970
Right? Okay.

568
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,129
Explicit provider bias impacts obese patients.

569
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:47,740
So primary care providers may spend less time educating patients with obesity about their health providers who evaluated

570
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:53,230
obese patients records were more likely to rate the encounter as a waste of time and spend 28% less time with the patients.

571
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:58,810
Physicians over attribute symptoms and problems to obesity.

572
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:07,960
Virtual patients with shortness of breath were more likely to receive lifestyle change recommendations if they were obese 54% versus 13%,

573
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:12,100
and who were more likely to receive medication if he were normal weight?

574
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:17,550
23% who are normal. They got medication versus 5% who were obese.

575
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:23,160
So obese patients are not getting the same treatment as normal weight patients.

576
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:30,360
Right. And so all of these health outcomes that we're attributing to their obesity could also partly because they're

577
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:35,490
not getting the same quality and standard of medical treatment that people who are normal weight are.

578
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:46,430
Right. And then this is just getting at like how actual discrimination and stigma might negatively impact health.

579
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:52,089
Right. So you have all of these different things, social,

580
00:56:52,090 --> 00:56:59,950
psychological and behavioral impacts of discrimination that can impact that have really been shown to impact actual biomarkers.

581
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:08,680
Right. Cardiovascular dysfunction, metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, all of this inflammation that people are saying is associated with obesity.

582
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:17,680
How much of that is due to the fat on this person and how much of that is due to some of the discrimination they're receiving in the world?

583
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:26,569
Right. Glucose dysregulation, sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system dysregulation, axis dysregulation.

584
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:30,020
Right. And all of these things have been shown to be related to things like cancer.

585
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:37,190
So, you know, I think there is some pathway probably like all those biologic mechanisms that we showed,

586
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:41,630
right, that obesity itself can increase some of these things that may lead to cancer.

587
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:47,180
But at least some piece of the obesity cancer puzzle is through some of these other things that we've talked about,

588
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:57,560
I would say and if you look at high allosteric load and perceived baseline and long term weight discrimination,

589
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,680
so this is people who have long term perceived weight discrimination.

590
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:07,040
So they ask these people like have you experienced long term weight discrimination?

591
00:58:07,610 --> 00:58:13,130
And they say, yeah, these people have a higher static load, two times higher.

592
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:18,650
Right, compared to people who do not experience weight discrimination.

593
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:30,540
Among obese people. All right.

594
00:58:31,170 --> 00:58:37,030
I also talked about weight cycling. There has been less evidence that this is true for overall cancer.

595
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:42,200
Some individual cancers seem to be more they're seen with with greater weight cycling.

596
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:46,560
There seems to be a higher risk of cancer, but it's certainly associated with all cause and CVD mortality.

597
00:58:47,250 --> 00:58:54,420
So this thing may be less applicable to cancer, but I think it's still worth talking about.

598
00:58:55,320 --> 00:59:04,800
One of the ways that it may actually one of the biologic mechanisms by which weight cycling may impact health outcomes is that when you lose weight.

599
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:11,040
The chemicals that are sequestered in fat cells are released into circulation.

600
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,089
And they actually did this study on people who had bariatric surgery.

601
00:59:15,090 --> 00:59:23,760
So they immediately lost quite a bit of weight. And their circulating levels of environmental toxins were much higher after their weight loss.

602
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:30,610
So that is one potential mechanism by which we cycling might if you are weight cycling,

603
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:36,700
you kind of sequester these chemicals in your fat cells and then you lose weight and they're released in kind of high levels.

604
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:42,729
Right. As opposed to people who aren't weight cycling, who are exposed to them sort of in this kind of continuous level of your weight cycling.

605
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:46,170
It's like you keep getting these big boluses.

606
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:52,749
This is one of the this is not proven. This is a hypothesis about one way that weight cycling could impact some of these health outcomes.

607
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:58,770
I think it's really interesting, though. All right.

608
00:59:59,250 --> 01:00:02,760
So then the question is, is body size within an individual's control?

609
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:13,540
When you guys think. Not entirely, certainly, and not in the long term, I would say.

610
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:20,680
Right. People can usually lose weight short term, but but really, particularly for people who have been overweight their whole life.

611
01:00:20,690 --> 01:00:24,700
Right. Like people who were overweight as kids and are overweight or obese adults.

612
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:30,010
I think it's those people in particular have a really hard time kind of anecdotally,

613
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:38,469
I would say the people I know of who have been able to maintain some sort of meaningful weight loss are people who may be like we're thin gain weight,

614
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:43,330
like with a pregnancy or something, and then we're able to lose it and kind of go back to being center.

615
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:47,200
Does that make sense? Like I anecdotally, I would say in my experience,

616
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:53,290
I don't know a lot of people who have just sort of been fat their whole life and then managed to like completely change that.

617
01:00:53,290 --> 01:01:00,160
Right. So I think there is definitely evidence that no twin studies suggest that 40 to 70% of obesity is genetic.

618
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:06,340
There have been more than 400 steps identified through Gwas that are associated with body size and body fatness.

619
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:14,590
There are certainly epigenetic contributions and there's a whole like new idea coming out about the microbiome.

620
01:01:14,710 --> 01:01:18,940
Right. Who knows about this, this idea about the microbiome and obesity.

621
01:01:18,940 --> 01:01:25,720
A couple of you, right? You want to say what you think it's about or. Yeah.

622
01:01:26,170 --> 01:01:31,569
Like the bacteria in your gut and like the composition of those bacteria may be associated with obesity.

623
01:01:31,570 --> 01:01:39,520
And people are looking into like, can you change a person's gut bacteria composition?

624
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,790
And if so, does that change their weight? Right, or is it kind of the other way?

625
01:01:43,810 --> 01:01:49,870
You have a chicken and egg problem, right? Because, again, diet composition affects gut microbiome.

626
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:55,090
The composition is associated with body size to some to some degree.

627
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:58,830
Right. And all of these things are related.

628
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:03,309
So like, which one is causing which? Like, if you can influence change on the microbiome,

629
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:10,270
will it change body size or does changing body size change microbiome because you change your diet to achieve that?

630
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:17,230
It's very confusing. Right. And we're still in there trying to, like, pick all these threads apart and figure out.

631
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:22,620
Right. But that is something that people are interested in. All right.

632
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:33,330
So it's kind of a different obesity talk than I have given or that you might get in a lot of a lot of classes.

633
01:02:33,330 --> 01:02:42,900
But I think it's to me, the number one thing is if you think that weight loss is important and that being thin is important for health, that's fine.

634
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:47,820
But we still don't know how to tell people to successfully do that.

635
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:54,360
And I think that shaming people and telling people to do something that we can't tell

636
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:58,180
them how to be successful at doing is not an appropriate public health intervention.

637
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,720
It's not an appropriate clinical intervention. Right.

638
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:09,299
So maybe concentrating on some of these other things can have impacts until maybe maybe it'll be the full story.

639
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:13,650
Right? Maybe if we can change the way people are treated and the way they're given

640
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:17,190
medical care and all of that kind of stuff and get them to be physically active,

641
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:21,930
maybe that would fix it. Maybe it wouldn't entirely.

642
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:28,650
But, you know, if we can't do anything about this piece, why not work on some of the other things, I guess is what I'm thinking, right?

643
01:03:30,330 --> 01:03:37,559
What I didn't also talk about here is diet quality, right? Changing your diet quality, eating more vegetables if you can.

644
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:41,400
And like you said, there are definitely barriers to that for some people.

645
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:48,300
But like improving diet quality to the extent that you can may actually not strongly affect your BMI.

646
01:03:48,870 --> 01:03:52,110
But would that be beneficial in and of itself? Maybe so. Right.

647
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:56,530
Yeah. What are your thoughts on.

648
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:05,650
In. Newer and hasn't been around for a long time.

649
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:12,760
Partial explanation. I think that that could be like so I think there is I'm not super well versed in that.

650
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,999
That is a good that is definitely another thing that people are looking at.

651
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:19,120
So this idea of Obesogenic, what are some examples of those? Can you remind me?

652
01:04:23,390 --> 01:04:26,640
Certainly like some of the plastic things, right?

653
01:04:26,690 --> 01:04:29,479
Like BPA or something like that that I think people are talking about some of the

654
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,570
exposure to plastics or microplastics is one of the things people are talking about.

655
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:37,220
I mean, I think that that is just high fructose corn sirup, maybe,

656
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:45,020
although I think there's been a fair amount of work done on that to show that kind of sugar is sugar when it comes to weight.

657
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:53,509
But I'm not like I said, don't take my word for that. But I think there is definitely some like some of these environmental chemicals that are exposed

658
01:04:53,510 --> 01:05:00,950
to do seem to change the body's response to fat and and weight gain and that kind of thing.

659
01:05:00,950 --> 01:05:05,839
So I think that that is definitely something to and that's part of the epigenetic thing too,

660
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:09,140
I think, is that those things can affect our epigenetics, which are associated with weight.

661
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:16,420
And there's a significant difference between. Your body.

662
01:05:18,930 --> 01:05:22,649
And I think that that's part of the recommendation for like avoiding sugar sweetened

663
01:05:22,650 --> 01:05:26,760
beverages because that's one of the biggest contributors to added sugar in the diet.

664
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:30,840
Yeah. Yeah.

665
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:38,610
And that has been something, although I know people who have looked at like glucose intake and cancer risk and have not seen strong associations.

666
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:50,389
Yeah. Yeah. So I think it depends. Yes. You know, there's also a lot of like artificial sweeteners.

667
01:05:50,390 --> 01:05:56,510
Is that associated with something like certainly I think in terms of like as a chemical causing cancer, it's sort of been ruled out.

668
01:05:56,510 --> 01:06:02,150
But in the how it changes the insulin response and all that, I mean, there's so much, right?

669
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:07,970
There's so much to focus on and we get so narrowly focused on.

670
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:16,520
Telling people to lose weight like that has been really the the public health and the clinical response.

671
01:06:16,820 --> 01:06:21,680
The the the the intervention that we're we're recommending.

672
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:30,320
And that's really putting all of the onus on individuals who, as we just said, you know, maybe can't control it.

673
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:35,150
And certainly, even if it's possible, we haven't come up with the way to do it yet.

674
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:44,110
So like, you know, I think that coming up, I think that backing away and finding a different coming at it from a different angle,

675
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:46,040
if you keep doing the same thing,

676
01:06:46,130 --> 01:06:53,530
what would it what is the saying that like insanity is doing the same thing over and over, inspecting a different outcome?

677
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:58,940
Like that's what we've been doing for 30 years and people just keep getting

678
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:03,500
fatter and yelling at them and shaming them for it does not seem to be working,

679
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:11,180
you know? Right. So anyway, that's my my take on the obesity thing.

680
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:15,740
I don't know that we have time to get in our groups and discuss these articles.

681
01:07:15,740 --> 01:07:22,200
Did you guys read these? No one, no one read them, even though they were assigned reading for today.

682
01:07:22,950 --> 01:07:32,100
All right. Well, let's pretend I didn't see that, but this was a giant like controversy, right?

683
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:36,839
So I worked at the American Cancer Society, like I said, at the master's level.

684
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:42,629
And Jean Carroll was my grand boss. Right? She was the head of the analytic side and she's since passed away.

685
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:51,000
But she was pretty awesome. And she put out this paper that she put out that looked at obesity and mortality from cancers and found kind

686
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:58,140
of this nice stair step increase in obesity and risk of dying of various cancers with increasing obesity.

687
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:07,260
And then Flegal, Katherine Flegal put out her article very shortly thereafter.

688
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:15,029
In the end, Haines data looking at overall mortality, not just cancer, all cancer mortality, but overall mortality and obesity,

689
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:23,400
and found actually that there was not a strong increase in overall mortality for like only really for the highest obesity groups.

690
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:29,130
Right. People who are like lower grade obesity, overweight, not really any increased risk.

691
01:08:30,150 --> 01:08:34,920
This sparked a huge debate and the debate that everybody says in in Gene's article,

692
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:40,950
they excluded smokers because smoking decreases body weight but also increases mortality.

693
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:49,920
Right. So if you're thin because you smoke and you're in that referent group, so let's say you're in the lowest BMI group.

694
01:08:50,220 --> 01:08:55,020
So your lowest BMI group is like 18.5 to 23, right?

695
01:08:56,360 --> 01:08:59,840
This is your referent group. You're comparing everybody to these people.

696
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:06,830
If the risk of dying of cancer or anything else is high, you're here because your smokers are in here.

697
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:12,170
When you compare them to like you're 30 plus people, this is going to look too small.

698
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:16,490
Your hazard ratio is going to look smaller. Right. Because you're dominator is too big.

699
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:20,300
The risk in yourself is today. So they excluded smokers.

700
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:26,030
They also excluded anybody who had recently lost weight. Why might you want to do that?

701
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:37,240
If you've recently lost a significant amount of weight, it could be because you're sick, right?

702
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:40,960
So people who've recently lost one might be more likely to die.

703
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:45,250
And so if your people who are sick are in here because they've recently lost a bunch of weight,

704
01:09:45,250 --> 01:09:49,350
again, you would see an inappropriately low relative risk.

705
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:55,520
The legal people didn't do that, but there was a letter written about these issues.

706
01:09:55,540 --> 01:10:00,070
They then reran their analysis, trying to do as much of that as they could. They still didn't see anything different.

707
01:10:00,550 --> 01:10:06,370
Everybody has jumped all over Katherine Flegal for years for this, and she people have published similar studies.

708
01:10:07,480 --> 01:10:13,930
So, you know, it doesn't always hold up that like overweight and obesity are strongly associated with mortality.

709
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:20,770
Certainly, I think for the most overweight and obese like BMI, 35 plus or 40 plus,

710
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:24,820
that tends to be associated with higher risk of death and things like that.

711
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:36,639
But in sort of the more common categories of overweight and obesity, 25 to 30, 30 to 35, 35, even right around 35, not so much.

712
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:45,240
Right, necessarily. And so people have always tried to argue that those studies that are finding those things are methodologically flawed,

713
01:10:46,060 --> 01:10:49,420
but they argue that they've that they've done their best to address those issues

714
01:10:49,420 --> 01:10:53,770
and still see not be as strong associations that everybody thinks they should see.

715
01:10:54,580 --> 01:11:01,750
So there's definitely pushback even in the scientific community, about results that aren't what people expect with respect to BMI.

716
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:12,010
And some of this is true. Right. But even if you address these things, sometimes you don't see what you would expect and people still argue about it.

717
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:16,450
It's worth noting that the Flegal article is in Haines, which is nationally representative data.

718
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:24,540
Which is a plus. Plus, they had measured BMI by professionals as opposed to self-reported.

719
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:34,300
So that was a big controversy. Any thoughts you want to bring up about this?

720
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:42,860
Yes. No. To the articles.

721
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:51,430
Yeah, but. Gastric. Yeah.

722
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:57,130
I don't know that we I don't know of any articles that look specifically at

723
01:11:57,130 --> 01:12:02,160
gastric bypass patients and whether that changes their risk of cancer to be.

724
01:12:02,410 --> 01:12:09,850
I didn't get that. Because cancer is rare and gastric bypass surgery is fairly rare.

725
01:12:09,850 --> 01:12:13,780
And getting together a whole group of people who have had it would be tough, right.

726
01:12:14,770 --> 01:12:20,320
So I think people have shown that like some of these intermediate biomarkers improved.

727
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:26,829
But yeah, I don't know the answer to that. That's a great question and I gotta look that up and see if there's a study.

728
01:12:26,830 --> 01:12:30,639
I don't I don't think there has been because think about how you have to do that.

729
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:35,950
You have to get it would be a cohort study, right? And you have to get where you were selecting on exposure.

730
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:40,510
You're exposed. People would be people with the guy, obese people with gastric bypass,

731
01:12:41,170 --> 01:12:47,140
you're unexposed would be obese people without and then you'd be following them over time for cancer.

732
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,400
So you'd have to have a lot of them, right? So.

733
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:57,909
It would be tough to do, but it would be very interesting because that is I mean, I glossed over it,

734
01:12:57,910 --> 01:13:03,630
didn't say, but that is the one intervention that actually does achieve longer term weight loss but at a cost.

735
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:07,800
Right. Like it is not without negative consequences on various things.

736
01:13:08,970 --> 01:13:12,660
So I don't think that it is an intervention. I mean, it works.

737
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:17,370
I don't think every overweight or obese person who walks into a clinician's office should be offered that as their solution.

738
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:23,460
Right. Particularly since we don't have evidence that it fixes everything.

739
01:13:27,010 --> 01:13:30,430
Yeah. I did a study with.

740
01:13:31,830 --> 01:13:38,870
Yeah. And I. We lost a very interesting.

741
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:51,840
48% of. Okay. So 32% lower risk of cancer, 48% lower risk of overall death.

742
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:56,380
Keep in mind, though, that the people who are again,

743
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:03,060
the people who are getting bariatric surgery are usually the very obese people who we just said probably do have increased risk of these things.

744
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:11,400
And then you've got this kind of little group. Where would you recommend something that stringent for them?

745
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:15,600
I don't know. Even if we're not sure if their risk is really that much higher.

746
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:27,370
You know what I mean? Now it is only ten years on how some of the people must've been fairly young when they had.

747
01:14:28,210 --> 01:14:32,640
That's weird. So that's the other question, too, right?

748
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:37,149
So they only went for ten years and most cancers happened in the sixties.

749
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:41,350
Are these people who had bariatric surgery? Yeah. Yeah.

750
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:45,639
You know, I mean, I don't I'm not asking you to necessarily answer that question, but they must have had a later in life.

751
01:14:45,640 --> 01:14:50,300
Like then the question is like, if you had bariatric surgery when you were younger, would that really reduce your risk or.

752
01:14:50,380 --> 01:14:55,330
I don't know. Interesting. Yeah.

753
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,169
This is I mean, it's a very tough topic, right? It's a very difficult thing.

754
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:05,500
And I think our our response to it as public health as a whole has been kind of overly simplistic.

755
01:15:06,610 --> 01:15:09,730
It's sort of my take home from this. I hope I hope is your take home for this.

756
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:21,460
And those of you who want to become clinicians. Have you bear all this in mind when you're treating obese patients?

757
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:29,240
Someday. All right, everybody, have a great rest of your day.
