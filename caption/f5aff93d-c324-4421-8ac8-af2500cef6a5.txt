1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:07,640
Yeah. This is. Okay, so. So this is a lecture eight, right?

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:14,820
So there are two more stationary distribution and then the Markov chain, Monte Carlo.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,629
That's all of the topics we're going to cover for the midterm one.

4
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,370
So. It's probably like ten or 11 hours.

5
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,460
Make sure that's the case.

6
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:37,070
Okay. So let's continue our discussion on the classification of states.

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,150
So so far we know the Markov property, we know the Markov chain.

8
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:54,010
And then the most important message here is, you know, if you know the if we know the transition kernel, we almost know everything, right?

9
00:00:54,230 --> 00:01:00,350
In terms of, um, in terms of marginal distribution for any random variable you.

10
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:11,050
We're interested in what? Well, I mean, at this point, though, we still need to know the initial state distribution, the offer,

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:22,630
so we can actually read more from the transition kernel or the transition probability transition matrix.

12
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:35,350
So this is so-called a classification of things at the end of the day, the classification of state.

13
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:52,310
There are some various classifications of states, but the oh, the all of the classifications of states are determined by the transition kernel.

14
00:01:52,330 --> 00:02:02,230
So this is the basically the bottom line that we need to look into the different perspective to classify the states.

15
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,720
So the first one we're going to talk about is communication class.

16
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:20,400
So communication class concern the issue from one state.

17
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,440
So they were talking about the state space output, Markov chain.

18
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:29,680
Right. You start from like in the simple random walk, you start from the point zero.

19
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:38,230
And then in this case, you can reach any other in any other states, meaning they've set integer values.

20
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:49,360
Oh, the old the older integers of 1 to 3, so and so forth, even negative one, negative two of the negative into a positive integers.

21
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,730
Now, older markups change like that.

22
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:02,080
So that basically is the point of starting communications class.

23
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:06,730
All right. So first, we define accessibility.

24
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:20,080
So this is talking about the state space. So state J is accessible.

25
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,340
So the keyword is accessible from.

26
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:42,340
Stay. I think about this sometimes we use this notation so from I.

27
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:49,020
The Markov chain kind of trouble to state. J so j as we say, j is accessible from state.

28
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:56,970
So starting from state, I mean, we got the marketing and problem to state gave if but only here.

29
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:02,880
So this is just need to give us a definition not connecting the transition kernel.

30
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:18,059
So as you can imagine, this is basically means probabilistically possible which is API j and greater than zero for something.

31
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,410
And so this is a means there exists a integer value and here.

32
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:32,140
If so, this denotes the untapped transition kernels there.

33
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,980
There is that transition from ITU jay with a positive probability.

34
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:44,470
So it's a well, it's a intuitive definition, right?

35
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:52,540
So if it doesn't require you have one step transition, as long as and this is accessible means after finite,

36
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,740
static transition after finite steps, there is a non-zero probability.

37
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,450
Okay, if we start I, we can get Jay. So it's pretty general.

38
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:08,580
I think this is. So this is a pretty self.

39
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:16,860
This is a pretty clear definition. We don't need a lot of explanation.

40
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,940
The second definition is external accessible.

41
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:28,180
So accessibility is a one direction. So from I to J.

42
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:38,470
If you have accessibility from both directions, from I to J and then J to I that make the whole thing a little bit special.

43
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:59,210
So that's just the second definition. So if we have, I think J is accessible from I and I, accessible from J and.

44
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:10,410
Then we call on my communications.

45
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,440
And this with James.

46
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,590
And then we use this double arrow, you know, that communication relationship.

47
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:31,990
So I communicate with Jay if they're both.

48
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,070
They are accessible from each other. Um.

49
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:52,120
Write any questions about this. So. Well, I mean, the point is, you could have said, oh,

50
00:06:52,130 --> 00:07:01,390
the communication relationship or accessibility relationship can be right from the transition kernel, right?

51
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:13,910
So because the definition accessibility depends on PJ to the end, which is a function of just one step transition kernel from one state,

52
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:23,300
one step transition, we can calculate arbitrary as that transition kernel using Chatman for my growth equation.

53
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:32,930
So therefore this is a property of transition of the transition kernel and then similar for the communication cost as well.

54
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:40,310
So in homeworks, you don't really need to do a lot of algebra to calculate API and.

55
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:45,530
Right. So this is the definition. Basically sets of here exists.

56
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,059
So you only need to show the existence.

57
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:55,370
You don't need to enumerate all possible ways of getting from I to J.

58
00:07:55,640 --> 00:08:05,330
Right? A useful way to deal with like homework or exam problem is actually draw the state diagram, right?

59
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:14,400
So if your if you have this is only useful for mostly useful for a finite state Markov chain, right?

60
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:21,170
So you have a transition kernel, then you can write out into a matrix and then from the matrix.

61
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:30,010
So this is a12 and then you have bits and different state one, two, three and,

62
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:36,860
and then from the, the transition kernel from here you can translate this into a diagram.

63
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:42,680
The point of that is trying to figure all over this accessibility relationship.

64
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:46,490
So if an entry is not zero, then you draw arrow.

65
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:58,219
So for example, the first one is like 2.2 regardless of the probability, this is a function, there is a rolled going one.

66
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:08,990
Is that back to itself that you draw one and then the second one's from 1 to 2, let's say 2.1, regardless of the probability you make an arrow.

67
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,300
Third one is zero. Now you don't have an arrow from.

68
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:16,430
So this is just draw the one step transition diagram, right?

69
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:23,030
And then for the four, let's say that I mean this for here this has to be point seven.

70
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:31,310
Now you have an arrow like this and now you can complete this diagram that you see.

71
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:39,470
So look like a map. And this helps you to figure out if one state is accessible from the other.

72
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,420
Right. I'm just looking at you inspecting if possible.

73
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:50,930
We're all following these arrows if you can get from ones that have been one point to the other.

74
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:59,840
Right. So so it's determined to find the transition kernel.

75
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:14,550
All right. Second thing is that. The communication relationship is much stronger than the accessibility and the communication.

76
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:27,180
If you're in spec, that is actually inside and it's actually it's called equivalence relationships.

77
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:39,080
So there is a proposition. So the equivalent relationship is it's a it's just a general terminology at the end as you cross right.

78
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,680
Communication. So this is a proposition one.

79
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:58,440
Probably communication is an equivalent, relational equivalent.

80
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,940
The relation is it's come from the abstract and it's not very difficult.

81
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,650
Well, it's a jargon, but it's is a really simple.

82
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:17,700
So you need to what is equivalent the relationship. You need to satisfy the following three properties.

83
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,340
One is the relationship has to be reflected reflexive.

84
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,350
So if that requires from eye to eye.

85
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:34,830
So it is accessible. To communicate with itself, by definition is always true.

86
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:47,850
All right. So so this is a reflexive that means this communication relationship is always reflexive.

87
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:56,490
Oh, did I? So just make sure this is.

88
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:08,800
This is a cleaner. I think. I think that in there I forgot to write one.

89
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,260
So this is 42 or equal to zero.

90
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:23,740
Right. So it's important to include it in equal to zero.

91
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,820
This is a basic rule all any confusions about.

92
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,750
So the p i0 is always one.

93
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:38,740
Right. If you start from the state by, you know, transition, you always state that state.

94
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,170
I mean, that's kind of a trivial thing.

95
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:55,610
But the definition that ensures that this reflexive relationship always holds, that's kind of important just for the mathematical reasons.

96
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,740
All right. So reflexive.

97
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:09,910
The communication relationship is always the reflexive, and the second requirement is symmetrical.

98
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:17,980
So if I communicate with Jay, then Jay has to communicate with BI.

99
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:21,660
So this goes without saying. This isn't a defamation.

100
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:29,860
If I if I access accessible from Jay and a jay accessible from I, they call it communication.

101
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:34,090
They communicate with each other. So obviously this is true.

102
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:47,370
So. If a relationship is symmetric and reflexive, then they are almost always there.

103
00:13:47,580 --> 00:14:00,420
There need be a third relationship. This is the final requirement for equivalence in relationship.

104
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:15,050
It's the transatlantic relationship. So the third one, if I communicated with J.

105
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:25,500
J. Communicate with K. Then I is communicating.

106
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:34,990
With. Okay, so this is called, I'm sorry, transitive.

107
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:48,520
So the communication relationship is transit. So to show a communication relationship is actually an equivalent relationship, we need to start.

108
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:54,270
We need to prove this. Three things on all of these things are satisfied.

109
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:58,320
So the first one is come from the definition.

110
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:03,450
The second one is from the definition as well. The third one is not hard to prove.

111
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:12,900
I think intuitively, if I communicate with with J, then you know, a path with non-zero probability from Y to J.

112
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,550
Right. I know you have a path from J to K which non-zero probability.

113
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:21,750
Then you have a path from I took. Just follow that path.

114
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:26,340
You only need a existence, i.e. to j with non-zero probability.

115
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:30,180
Well, there's a lose. This is a lose argument, but is true.

116
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:36,780
Similarly, you can prove k i is accessible from k.

117
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:48,300
The same argument k is communicated with J. So there is a path from pain to J net zero of similar things.

118
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:59,310
You can make this argument a lot more formal by invoking the term growth equation.

119
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:11,540
So the more formal type of the rules or try transitivity.

120
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:31,740
So because of the definition under exist and so there exist a path from A to j pj am greater than zero and that t j pay and greater than zero.

121
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,260
Right. This is because we this is a given.

122
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:45,720
This is a kind of a condition your ears assumption if I'm and exist that I am greater than 0p0.

123
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:53,520
And then we can show the p i k in and plus and steps.

124
00:16:54,810 --> 00:17:03,510
So I'm trying to show this this particular and plus in transition probability is nine zero.

125
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,860
Right. Why? Because we can use.

126
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:14,490
So how do we calculate this thing? So we can always use the Chapman chromatography feature to represent this.

127
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:22,350
So we can start after and step and then enumerate all the intermediate steps.

128
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:36,630
Possible intermediate stops. Right. So as using the r here we have a p i r m multiply by p, r k and all right.

129
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:44,880
So because this is a numerator, all possible states are that would include J.

130
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:49,380
J is one of those in the summation.

131
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:55,860
So this one definitely greater than I say greater or equal to or to make it just.

132
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:05,040
Now I'll just remove the summation here i j k again.

133
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:11,790
And then from here, you know, that's the multiplication of the two things this morning like this.

134
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,300
This is a greater than zero. Then the product is greater than zero.

135
00:18:15,330 --> 00:18:21,860
Now you show, you know, and plus is that spike is greater than zero.

136
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:30,870
Right? So this only this step is the benefit of using this.

137
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,290
This becomes a rigorous argument. Yes. You play one more time.

138
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:40,770
What are these? Because you said it includes J, right. So R is all the possible state space, right?

139
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:47,010
It's all of the states, because that's what the Chapman core growth equation requires.

140
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,220
Right. So you need to enumerate all possible intermediates.

141
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:56,580
Oh, possible stops after. And then that's basically the assumption.

142
00:18:56,610 --> 00:19:00,660
This is kind of a summation over all possible states.

143
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:11,040
So our ideas are is so as is the state of space.

144
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:28,460
All right. So. Well, I think we just proved the three properties for equivalent relationship are satisfied.

145
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:35,040
So they're for communication class. So sorry, the communication relationship is equivalent.

146
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:51,090
So. The most important consequence of equivalence relationship is that it actually defines a partition right or equivalent,

147
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:58,190
and all of the classes communicate with each other are following the same communication

148
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:08,510
and then all the transitions are going to be within as close to partition.

149
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:34,670
So, so this again is coming from the, the attribution abstract adage equivalent relationships relation relations defines a partition.

150
00:20:44,990 --> 00:21:01,729
Such that if you have so this position is let's call this partnership P so such that if I and J are communicate with each

151
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:13,280
other and then both of for for the iron j belongs to this partition that I and J are communicating with each other.

152
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:21,540
All right. So the partition is a partition of the state space.

153
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:29,180
And so before we introduce the concept of communication relationship, there are kind of a flat relationship, right?

154
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:38,640
So the state ise so you have your discrete states space, including all these states,

155
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:47,339
but you don't know that you know, the detailed relationship or this communication class define a relation.

156
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,000
They are partition. Partition. It's always new, mutually exclusive.

157
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,840
All right. If you're in one partition, you can not in the other.

158
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,830
All right. So if I and J is communicate with each other, that means they find one partition.

159
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:12,809
If I say I'm on another, communicate with each other, then they are for into a different partition, while all necessary.

160
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:16,440
Let's say in this case I'm avoiding to the same partition.

161
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:23,670
But if I and the is not communicate with each other, they're not in the same partition.

162
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:29,730
Okay, so let me draw a diagram like this that help you understand this.

163
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,870
So I'm not going to label a state, but just say.

164
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,360
So these states obviously communicate with each other.

165
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:51,860
So from any states, I can travel to any other states and I'm going to do the same thing for the other states.

166
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:58,010
So these three states communicate with each other, obviously,

167
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:08,780
that that's the this is a means there's a one step transition to see all of us have to go this way.

168
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,460
Right. Otherwise, it's not communication with each other.

169
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:24,200
So but these two, if I just have an arrow from here, are this, you know, at this stage to communicate with this one.

170
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:30,580
Why not? There is no way back.

171
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:39,850
Right. So what does it mean? So every state's here for into this one partition, and then this is the second partition.

172
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:48,310
Right. So the the importance of this is what if we're considering kind of a long run?

173
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:57,620
So long term. If you run this Markov chain long enough, if you track the state space, what going to happen?

174
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:01,550
Right. So the communication class is very, very important.

175
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:08,030
If you're running the Markov chain here, then it may go in here, right?

176
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,020
Because there is a non-zero transition from this partition to this partition.

177
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,630
But what does it go into here? It will never get back.

178
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:25,540
Right. So if you can see the long run behavior of the Markoff train, this type of the structure, you need to be very clear.

179
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:33,300
But if it's within that communication class, then you can ask the question the what you are pretty sure.

180
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:37,930
So if you're the only one communication class in this, well,

181
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:46,090
I can make it only one communication class by adding in an arrow from this partition to it that that is one.

182
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:56,680
And then they become the same part that becomes the same partition that you know, that eventually every single states can be.

183
00:24:58,430 --> 00:25:12,540
Access. If you run this Markov chain long enough, but for now, it seems like if you run this long enough, only this one can be accessed.

184
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:23,750
So this is all related to the the transit state and then the recurrence states, which we'll talk about next.

185
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:28,370
And all right. So so this is an important thing.

186
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,730
This is the communication class defined as the partition and then the partition.

187
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:46,730
The other thing is we're going to see as of the partition, we'll share a lot of these state level properties.

188
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,170
So we just need to define something very useful.

189
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:56,960
So this call the definition of irreducible mark.

190
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:09,440
Equally irreducible means you can not simplify that and further.

191
00:26:16,490 --> 00:26:20,970
So for you, a usable Markov chain is simply the case.

192
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:39,110
All states are communicate with each other and with each other.

193
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:50,520
That is, there is only one communication clause right there.

194
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,640
Only one. There is a single partition of the state space.

195
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:02,530
Remember this definition. We say irreducible.

196
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:07,450
That means a single communication class or a single partitioned space.

197
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,880
So we have to say this upfront because all a lot of these.

198
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:24,680
And a lot of the subsequent properties are shared by the communication class.

199
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:34,400
Okay. All right.

200
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:44,420
So the next one is probably the most important one.

201
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:58,940
This is a really what we why we study the classification of the things, because we care about the long run behavior of the.

202
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:14,730
Off the mark. So the next topic is recurrent transit status.

203
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:33,950
So this isn't really how we define states in terms of the Markov chain will ever return to that particular state, right?

204
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:41,819
So remember we calculate that the error return probability in simple random log and then

205
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:49,830
the conclusion is in the if you have symmetric one dimensional simple random walk,

206
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:56,820
then the Markov chain or the random walk will eventually get back to the starting point

207
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:05,639
that make that particular starting point a recurrence state because with probability one,

208
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,060
the Markov chain will return. All right.

209
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:19,950
It's now the same story when you change one dimension to three dimensions, and then there is a non-zero probability that the chain will never return.

210
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:27,720
Right. So that becomes the transient change that the terminology from a recurrent state to a transient state.

211
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,010
So that's the basic definition. All right.

212
00:29:32,010 --> 00:29:44,480
So last time we define the actually, we have this if I define your checker nodes, this is our return probability.

213
00:29:44,490 --> 00:30:15,630
So this is defined as different ways to define this, a return probability to state I given the given the the Markov chain starts at the bottom.

214
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:31,080
Right so this is kind of a over sorry ever return probability the probability return probability to state I think given that we get the other way.

215
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,980
Well, there are different ways to to define this.

216
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:45,370
So we could define a reason. So this is a random time.

217
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,850
We used this trick in the Golden Blossom process.

218
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,750
And on a simple, random walk, we find this.

219
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:01,170
Yeah. On.

220
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:10,160
Max zero. Right.

221
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:13,740
So the access zero you go to, I just stress the point.

222
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,900
The Markov chain starts at the state I from the state I.

223
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:22,820
And then there's the first time it returns. Then that's defined as random time.

224
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,020
So this is the first or return time. All right.

225
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:38,989
So how the FBI is related to the T, so the FBI is essentially in the probability he is the last name.

226
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:47,720
And so those are the same thing. We're going to interchangeably use a lot of these different expressions, but this should be clear.

227
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:53,120
So if this is ever returned, that means the first return probability.

228
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,010
Sorry, the first the return time has to be finite.

229
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:12,770
Yeah. So this is that. And then this one is also the same as I to say what is equal to one to infinity.

230
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:22,130
The probability I'm going to use I this a number of transition.

231
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:37,730
So then how do we calculate that this t last infinitive and we need to enumerate the possibilities the t I take.

232
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:46,620
And then you find that your value. Right. So they could return to one stop or two or three start any finite step.

233
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:57,420
And the reason we can just simply add them up, because by the definition of the tie, these events are mutually exclusive.

234
00:32:57,570 --> 00:33:04,230
If your first return is in one step, then it cannot be one two.

235
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:12,330
Right. So those things are mutually exclusive. And this is how we deal with the probabilities of union of mutually exclusive.

236
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:20,640
We add the mob. Right. So sometimes you will see today we're going to call this one.

237
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:25,170
I use a different notation for this one. Just this is a hard to write.

238
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:30,300
We're going to call this a summation of PI.

239
00:33:30,650 --> 00:33:35,580
Okay. So that means the first return probability in case steps.

240
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:45,570
Okay. So this is I k it's essentially the probability.

241
00:33:51,300 --> 00:34:09,640
Those are the same things. There's a hollow notation of it's for the convenience of writing for the Theory of Asia later on.

242
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:16,300
But it's not necessarily convenient for you to pass through your notes.

243
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:23,200
So you can label this highlight this destination.

244
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:28,530
The important thing is understanding what notation exactly represented.

245
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:43,630
All right. So the recurrent and then the transient state essentially is defined the by the if I ever return probability,

246
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:52,390
if we know there is a certain ever return event, then we call this particular state in a recurrent state.

247
00:34:53,890 --> 00:35:02,860
So the recurrent is I equals one.

248
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:13,230
And then this is also a implies the probability t the first return probability has to be also one, right?

249
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:21,270
Why, let's say. So they take.

250
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:28,620
So these two things are equivalent and a transient state.

251
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:40,020
So as stated four times is if I if I have less than one.

252
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:51,510
In that case, you know, the probability API, I say infinity will be strictly less than one and.

253
00:36:02,590 --> 00:36:09,910
And the other thing is I think we have already written there.

254
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:21,610
I if I was ever return probability is the summation of K I write and then the

255
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:29,100
same thing you can write out that the probability I use the probability is.

256
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:39,610
All right? Yes, please. So the transient state can be zero.

257
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:43,330
The probability as well. It can be zero, yes.

258
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:47,410
Once you leave that. Never. Yes, it can be zero. The thing is.

259
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:54,050
Yeah, that's true. So this is a yes.

260
00:36:58,170 --> 00:37:06,250
Mr. So the important thing actually that's an important point.

261
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:09,370
Later on, you will see. So this is a K from one.

262
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,450
So you need a one step transition. So the P II.

263
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:22,930
So. You know, this may relate to the the previous argument on why the state I always communicate with state that in there we

264
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:32,020
are zero transition here ever return probability it doesn't allow does doesn't include zeros that transition.

265
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:38,860
Okay. It's good for continuous state space.

266
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:43,000
Are there ever for current states that possible?

267
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,650
Right. We're not talking about. So, yes, that's interesting.

268
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:52,899
Interesting. You know, I think in that domain, if we're talking about continuous state space,

269
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:57,580
we probably we still have something similar, but we're not using the same language.

270
00:37:58,270 --> 00:38:04,850
Right. So. Right.

271
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:13,800
So it's just the structure. That's precisely the reason that we have to classify the states and then talk to each state.

272
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:19,700
But but you are right that there are some sort of a connections there.

273
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:27,450
There are. We probably should talk more about the controls over the state space.

274
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:44,410
No particular values. I.

275
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,610
All right. So hopefully this is a kind of a straightforward.

276
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:59,870
Well, I mean, you know, notation wise is kind of a mess, but you need to get used to it.

277
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:04,550
Now, hopefully, the conceptually, this is not a difficult one to understand.

278
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:12,050
It's just what we are concerned about. The long run behavior of the mark of may leave certain states.

279
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,800
Will it ever return? Right. So that's some of the the motivation to consider it.

280
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:26,950
Now it defines through this. If I wore this equivalently, that's a random time distribution.

281
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:34,610
The time. The issue here is not so in that description of the mark chain.

282
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:44,570
We're interested in how this quantity will connect to the transition curve right now towards what

283
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:51,470
can we know about this data is transient or recurring by just inspecting the transition kernel.

284
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:58,160
All right. So it's the for us for now. It's not it is not obvious.

285
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,360
So there are some you know, we need to dove in and let's see.

286
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:10,370
But this it this much we know. I think all these things should be able to be used to from the properties of the transition kernel.

287
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:16,000
So that's the next thing we're going to do in acting.

288
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:29,420
And finally, to transition kernel.

289
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,020
So we have something similar in transition kernel.

290
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:53,710
So this is API, and we're going to define this shorthand notation as a probability X and equal to II completion along the zero line.

291
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:57,590
Right. This is just the start of transition kernel eight.

292
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:07,220
It says a different thing. Right. So this is the after in this type of transition, the Markov chain return back to the state.

293
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:11,800
Right. So this is a transition kernel.

294
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:19,250
We can calculate this quantity from the ones that transition kernel using chipmunk for a macro equation.

295
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:23,000
Right. Can we connect that?

296
00:41:23,310 --> 00:41:31,250
So the issue is can we derive EI through P and here.

297
00:41:34,490 --> 00:41:38,360
There is some connection and then that's what we're going to do.

298
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:46,059
So if you consider this. If you're trying to calculate I phi pi.

299
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:55,570
But. We can use the total expectation, Launchbury said.

300
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:31,190
All right. So to make a connection. So the key I am right here, we know, is the probability that it's an equal to PI and then it's a zero in line.

301
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:41,450
Right? So what we want to do here, we can compute this by conditioning on more things, right?

302
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:49,879
What is the thing we want to in addition we want to introduce here is actually the first return time.

303
00:42:49,880 --> 00:43:00,660
So the T.I is zero we find right.

304
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:09,230
We can always do this. And then the benefit of doing this is we know the t the first return time is a starting time.

305
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:15,340
So we also have. The the mark of the strong mark of property.

306
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:23,470
We can also rely on the the the the strong mark of property here.

307
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:40,600
So if you're conditional on the tie, then invoking what happens is so the tie, the possible values tie can take is one up to and right.

308
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:48,580
So well, I mean anything greater than this happens in the future that will have probabilities zero right.

309
00:43:50,140 --> 00:44:00,160
So if you're conditional on the tie equals any small value less than and then you can break down the mark off chain into two parts.

310
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:06,340
One is conditional on the first return time. And describe what happens after the first return.

311
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,480
Yeah. Because of the strong mark of property. Right.

312
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:14,020
And then so this is all going to happen.

313
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:17,680
So if you do this, what can happen is.

314
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:29,510
You can do the summation k equal to C, k equal to one, c two.

315
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:41,690
And so the K is the value of but T going to take the probability if the first return happened in the case stack,

316
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:55,310
then what happens is you cannot evaluate this probability x you call it high, high k zero equal to one.

317
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:03,020
And then because this one is if you're no tie equals I so you know this because of the strong mark of property,

318
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:15,950
then you basically saying this is equal to the probability x equals y I guess k you were like, oh,

319
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:27,930
can you see actually I'm not acknowledging the T is a strong it's a, it's a stopping time and it's zero.

320
00:45:27,950 --> 00:45:34,880
You go to I the strong Markoff's property indicates this conditional probability what equals this one.

321
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:45,379
Right. You know, the first time the start, the mark of change start at the end of get back to state in case of ABS.

322
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:50,870
So that's x k equal to I guess that's that you run your and then the pattern of future.

323
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:56,430
Becomes irrelevant given the present. Right. So the only way.

324
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:06,270
Well, I mean, the only the reason you need to provide is the tie is a stopping time.

325
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:16,610
Therefore, there's this strong mark off property. So. So we're going to have this multiplied by an additional five additional.

326
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:30,810
I ask you. All right, I'm going to trace the rest of these or speculate about what is this?

327
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,919
And then this is a summation. Okay, you point one, two.

328
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:39,780
And so that means the first three are occurs in case.

329
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:46,530
That's right. So this is the notation of that as I k of this.

330
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,079
What is this? This is a p i right?

331
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,410
So this is a time homogeneous Markov chain.

332
00:46:55,860 --> 00:47:01,979
So that means it's transition back to the state in a minus case.

333
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:05,340
That's right.

334
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:15,900
I just put this up on my switch.

335
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:27,490
And Vanquisher makes sense, right? Any questions?

336
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:35,890
So the second term is starting at a state.

337
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:46,340
I in the case that I'd get back in in the end stuff so it's equivalently there's this transition in minus case steps.

338
00:47:46,950 --> 00:48:10,810
So we can actually write this into summation k equal to zero and i p i a minus k but acknowledge, you know, I can zero.

339
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:20,050
So this is a I think that the question this answer is what if this one if you find this one zero, there is no first return in zero steps.

340
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:25,210
And this one is we need this form. Okay.

341
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:43,130
So so this is a wolf we finally get the importance of this saying is this is not ever return probability yet.

342
00:48:43,970 --> 00:48:50,510
But this is a connecting the random first return time and the kernel.

343
00:48:50,870 --> 00:48:59,330
The transition kernel. All right. All right. So if you see a relationship like this, this looks a lot like a convolution.

344
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:09,259
Okay. And then that also should help you to think about generating functions or using the generating function.

345
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:13,010
Should also help in this context.

346
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:22,680
So this equation gonna be fundamental or instrumental to help us to obtain the second proposition,

347
00:49:23,430 --> 00:49:29,160
which is connecting the transmission kernel to determine the.

348
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:35,000
To determine if a state is recurrent or transient.

349
00:49:35,780 --> 00:50:04,490
So the proposition to so state is recurrent if and only if the summation of and one to infinity to I diverges.

350
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:20,690
All right so we get to get here you want in a few minutes but we just want you to appreciate this statement so this may look.

351
00:50:22,230 --> 00:50:26,490
A bit weird at first glance. So this is a pie.

352
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:30,540
I'm sorry. Take the pie.

353
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:39,630
You need to add up all these possible transitions from the.

354
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:50,970
So essentially what this says is if you add up all the pie and if it's in its divergence, that means this particular state is recurrent.

355
00:50:51,550 --> 00:50:54,510
Okay. But what is the importance here?

356
00:50:54,960 --> 00:51:05,780
So remember the previous definition of recurrent state and transient the state defines is defined by a random time distribution.

357
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:13,530
If I came right here. The statement says we can determine that by the transition kernel.

358
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:21,740
It may be difficult to calculate. Nevertheless, you can calculate if you know the transition curl, right?

359
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:25,700
And then you can also use the champion for a member of the equation.

360
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:32,090
So that means if you know the transition colonel, then, you know, if a state is a transition state for.

361
00:51:34,070 --> 00:51:38,360
Well, at this point, the only recurrence, if I'm not mistaken, is recurrence.

362
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:43,700
How do we prove that? It's actually pretty simple.

363
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:52,070
Can I use the generating function?

364
00:51:54,050 --> 00:52:00,080
I never had the relationship highlighted on the top.

365
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:04,120
So we're going to define so the proof of this,

366
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:20,590
which means we're going to define a generating function as a summation and equal to zero to infinity API.

367
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:30,290
As to the end. In the end, here we have the competition.

368
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,530
The P.I. zero equals one.

369
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:39,070
So we do all of different things for zero transition.

370
00:52:39,110 --> 00:52:45,740
So if you're a start from the AI after zero transition, you ended up in the highest probability one.

371
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:51,880
But that doesn't. Well, so that therefore the PI zero is one, right?

372
00:52:52,220 --> 00:53:00,270
This is a well, we're trying to make sense all of this at the same time I just you raise that i500 because this

373
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:07,130
doesn't consider us and doesn't consider us a return because you never leave out that you return.

374
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:15,320
But this is just saying as a description of the where the Markov chain is.

375
00:53:16,850 --> 00:53:21,320
All right. Let me write this as I find it. Zero zero.

376
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:28,040
Okay. So we're going to write this in the GI as.

377
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:38,690
So the reason we use this because we can evaluate that the term and the target where we're trying to write

378
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:48,350
that particular summation by evaluating this run this this generating function and assigned to one.

379
00:53:50,450 --> 00:53:58,400
So this is the conventional services or the boundary condition feature, keep in mind.

380
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:16,730
And now we can define, I guess, this summation and you can't do zero the same thing now because if we gear up to the generating function,

381
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:28,250
it's necessary for us to consider always from via the policy or it always starts from the the constant right and equal to zero.

382
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:34,310
In this case, that constant term is zero right by this convention.

383
00:54:34,430 --> 00:54:39,319
But nevertheless, we have to generate the functions one from the GI.

384
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,740
So this is the target? Yes, I have.

385
00:54:42,980 --> 00:54:48,990
And on top and. And.

386
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:56,130
The G i s. And then you could.

387
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:00,270
Oh, yeah. Yes, you're right.

388
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:03,860
It's was.

389
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:08,080
Yes. It's actually Ms. Not on the note.

390
00:55:17,730 --> 00:55:22,560
Okay. So very good. I just for the.

391
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:37,340
Is. Actually.

392
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:46,880
All right. So now we're going to consider using this relationship on.

393
00:55:52,410 --> 00:56:00,850
Because often this relationship is true. So this is a case greater than zero.

394
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:15,280
But we can't write on. Cuba and.

395
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:23,380
Okay. I forgot the beer as well. Sorry. Sorry.

396
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:26,800
You need to correct your notes. Here is a pie here.

397
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:32,399
That's important. So you can augment some of the.

398
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,610
The the s to the end on the both side of the equation.

399
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,780
Right. So this is the usual topic we do.

400
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:53,050
So you have I k to the ask to the k multiply by the pie and minus k to the s to even minus.

401
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,230
All right. So you get this kind of a decomposition of.

402
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:15,790
This one. So the important.

403
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:20,270
Okay. The other thing I think is.

404
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:35,070
So the equation holds for an or equal to one.

405
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:43,470
Right. So this won't hold for an equal to zero because pi is zero as the convention is one.

406
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:52,820
But I zero here is zero. So this equation one hold for an equals and equal to zero.

407
00:57:52,830 --> 00:58:02,670
So everything has a way of trying to add up something that it has to add up from one and equals one if you're trying to add up the end here.

408
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:08,910
And that's exactly what we're going to do. And this is we going to do the summation.

409
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:15,590
One tweet infinity by and s and.

410
00:58:21,770 --> 00:58:27,170
And then the same thing we're going to do a one to infinity.

411
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:31,100
You. Hey, you zero.

412
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:41,610
I asked. Hey, I might ask as came.

413
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:51,420
Right. So this is for. All right.

414
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:58,870
So the right hand side is exactly the convolution. We kind of emphasize the importance of the context.

415
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:05,770
Nevertheless, if you check the notes, that's exactly what convolution is.

416
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,610
And then the convolution of the two sequences to.

417
00:59:12,350 --> 00:59:20,220
Two generating functions can be simply. Represented by the product of the two generation functions.

418
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:25,149
So the right hand side, you could start from an equal to zero to infinity.

419
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:35,050
That's, that's okay. So that because the first term gave you a zero so that essentially this guy has to multiply by.

420
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:38,649
I think that's right.

421
00:59:38,650 --> 00:59:47,380
So that's the right hand side you're going to get. There's two generating functions if we right that already the of definition and you just.

422
01:00:15,550 --> 01:00:28,780
So the left hand side is the g i as missing the first because the summation is from unequal to one to infinity.

423
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:34,320
So it's a missing the first term. The pi zero is one.

424
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:40,200
So we just subtract the the the constant term, the left hand side on the right hand side becomes the same.

425
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:54,800
And this is actually give you our equation. So you get a GI as equal to one, one minus I as right.

426
01:00:54,940 --> 01:01:02,840
Why the generating function? Because the generating function will give us if you evaluate the if I want to.

427
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:09,910
This is the summation we want. Right? So this is an equal to one or zero regardless.

428
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:21,670
I find that that is essentially the if the definition is defined, the recurrence or transient is defined through, I find.

429
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:32,070
So we're interested in so this gives you the functional relationship between the error, return probability and the probability of the transition col.

430
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:40,150
Okay, so the argument here goes from this way.

431
01:01:40,870 --> 01:01:46,930
That's from the proposition. Our proposition says if state ie is recurrent.

432
01:01:47,230 --> 01:01:54,850
So that means if i if I if this summation this if I recurrent about means equal to one at

433
01:01:54,850 --> 01:02:04,360
least to the property over this entire transition and probably the add up that were I.

434
01:02:06,310 --> 01:02:16,840
So if I is recurrent state I is recurrent.

435
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:26,750
Then I want both.

436
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:33,130
I find this one right.

437
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:46,069
So that gave you the fact on the left hand side and G.I. one must be equal to summation and equal to one to infinity pi.

438
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:51,140
And this one is a one over zero.

439
01:02:51,530 --> 01:02:55,370
So this is infinity. So that's what we want.

440
01:02:58,370 --> 01:03:07,599
So that's not that. Right. So if it's a recurrence. If the state is recurrent, then it is true.

441
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:16,900
When you add up all of these uns that transition probabilities you get infinitely the other way around.

442
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:23,430
It's the same argument, but you can't vote by contradiction, essentially.

443
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:45,630
So the other direction. So if you die, it's infinity at five less than one.

444
01:03:45,660 --> 01:03:51,190
So we get a contradiction. Well, the reason is as necessary in this illustration.

445
01:03:51,190 --> 01:03:55,760
That is because of this equation. A lot of friends that write on Sundays, it really doesn't matter.

446
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:01,610
So if if you have a situation that this the sum of the ends,

447
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:10,670
that transition kernel of that transition probability equal to infinity above this state is a transient state.

448
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:15,020
Then you cannot get a contradiction from that equation.

449
01:04:15,470 --> 01:04:25,490
This implies summation of II equals one over one minus II one.

450
01:04:27,550 --> 01:04:31,870
In this case if I was less than one.

451
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:39,840
So that means this is a positive and then this is one minus another zero plus this one has to be plus.

452
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:50,680
So there is a contradiction. If you're if you're assuming this is infinity and then you get the right contradiction from your conclusion.

453
01:04:51,370 --> 01:05:01,170
Right. So therefore, I find it has to be one.

454
01:05:01,180 --> 01:05:05,150
So. So a contradiction.

455
01:05:16,100 --> 01:05:24,090
All right. So that's essentially the whole argument.

456
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:35,030
Again, the important thing here is just saying a state is transient or recurrent is completely determined

457
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:41,030
by its by its by the Markov chains transition kernel by inspecting the transition kernel.

458
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:47,930
Theoretically, you can determine any state it is it's a is a transient or is a recurrent.

459
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:55,930
Just to make more sense, all of this.

460
01:05:57,550 --> 01:06:06,910
So sometimes we need to know how to interpret certain quantities of truth.

461
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:22,330
So that statement, so, you know, is the best way to understand it is the proposition is to make sense.

462
01:06:22,840 --> 01:06:31,660
What is this one entity and how do we interpret that?

463
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:41,740
Right. This is just basic. We add up all of these understand transition probabilities, but is there a better interpretation of this thing?

464
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:47,010
So what is that? This is a solution.

465
01:07:05,770 --> 01:07:10,360
I just added multiply by one here. So this is just a definition.

466
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:17,110
What is this thing? How do you interpret?

467
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:24,490
So usually you have something like this. You're trying to interpret the quantity as an expectation of something.

468
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:31,590
So what? So this is the hint I'm trying to give. What is the expectation here?

469
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:41,180
Are trying to calculate. So if this is the probability and then we cut one.

470
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:48,980
Right. So this is basically you were counting the number of the visits to State High.

471
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:54,160
So a visit, you know, one step. So that will be x one.

472
01:07:54,170 --> 01:08:03,320
You go to I wake up one and then if it's two, if they get back to this in two step, that's another one.

473
01:08:03,530 --> 01:08:08,780
So, so the one here is a column per every time you get back to the state.

474
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:20,780
So essentially, this is the expected value of number per visit to the state.

475
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:25,460
I was given at the zero.

476
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:47,010
So you can think about this as a or number four, which occurs because it's comes from the unusual one.

477
01:08:47,030 --> 01:08:54,380
So that's I mean, you can take your favorite notation services or returns to state.

478
01:08:55,160 --> 01:09:03,230
So that makes sense now. Right. So if you have only finite, you expect the number of finite states visits if you run this train.

479
01:09:03,860 --> 01:09:07,190
Remember, this is a new one. This is a time domain.

480
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:14,240
You run this train forever, but the only expect the finite number of returns.

481
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,120
Then they must means, you know.

482
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:26,930
So the propositions as if you're only expect the finite number of returns, then the state has to be transient.

483
01:09:27,410 --> 01:09:36,650
If it's a recurrent, you know, always a return, always return, always return, then this expected number of return visits will be infinite.

484
01:09:37,160 --> 01:09:40,760
Right? So does that make intuitive sense?

485
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:44,150
If you interpret this correctly, you don't need to.

486
01:09:45,470 --> 01:09:49,910
I'm just memorized about everything you need to have.

487
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:58,310
Intuitive interpretation. Right.

488
01:09:58,370 --> 01:10:24,340
So this is. So here we just established the fact that a state is transient or recurrent is completely determined by the transition colonel.

489
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:36,440
There is a corollary. It's essentially it's kind of trying to complement the proposition to soldiers would quarrel over you.

490
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:40,790
I would just like to try. Okay.

491
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:46,250
I was called to so state I.

492
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:55,010
So this is a bold statement. The state is transient and transient.

493
01:10:57,500 --> 01:11:08,210
If and only summation, only one 3% of the time is finite.

494
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:17,910
Or we can interpret that with the expectation the state is transient.

495
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:22,670
If they expected of a return to state, high is finite.

496
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:30,040
Right. So. All right.

497
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,849
So last thing is the importance of connected.

498
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:41,140
The first, the property of the state, the communication class, and then this transient recurrent state.

499
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:45,280
So the corollary three, it's actually an important one.

500
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:50,070
It's saying. A state is a transient or recurrent.

501
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:51,900
It's actually a class property.

502
01:11:51,910 --> 01:12:04,350
So if you know, one of the states is recurrent and then you also know that you also know the class, the states communicate with this class.

503
01:12:04,680 --> 01:12:11,910
They are all share the same property, meaning they're all transients or near or all recurrent.

504
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:20,550
So this is a corollary story.

505
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:49,640
It's a simple one to call. If I communicate with Jane and I die is recurrent, then Jane it's also recurrent.

506
01:12:55,550 --> 01:13:00,800
So how do we prove this? We can prove this using the propositions.

507
01:13:02,240 --> 01:13:07,130
We just know how to calculate. Well, we also need to connect to the.

508
01:13:07,340 --> 01:13:17,450
The communication class. All right, so we're trying to calculate.

509
01:13:17,570 --> 01:13:20,750
If I communicate with Jane.

510
01:13:21,910 --> 01:13:41,780
So if I communicate with J that there exists a K and let's say M such that he is greater than 0tji am for you there.

511
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:49,510
So this is just the definition of mutual e access of mutual accessibility.

512
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:53,780
Right. And that is basically saying I mjr communicate with each other.

513
01:13:54,500 --> 01:14:04,740
All right. So we are now trying to calculate this, the p.

514
01:14:04,770 --> 01:14:10,999
Jane, are we trying to manufacture some p so we know about the quantity of.

515
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:15,770
But it is recurrent. So we know the summation of PI and diverges.

516
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:19,669
Right. The A sequence of pi.

517
01:14:19,670 --> 01:14:25,430
The summation of the pi diverges. So we need to manufacture something about PJ.

518
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:32,900
And that simple, right? So that we can use a number of equation every time you're trying to visit.

519
01:14:33,940 --> 01:14:37,910
J You just make a detour to AI first.

520
01:14:38,420 --> 01:14:49,250
So by this condition you can calculate this the p am plus plus.

521
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:55,470
Okay. So we are thinking about visit back to J.

522
01:14:55,710 --> 01:15:02,730
So why not you first to go to Y and then get back to y and then from I get back to J.

523
01:15:02,730 --> 01:15:13,140
So therefore there's the M plus and plus k, I'm going to spend some more time on and here and then by Chapman for my overall equation, you know,

524
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:26,489
this is the only possible path this one must be greater than or equal to must be greater or equal to a specific path is we spend time we

525
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:47,340
first get tool from j y in this is a greater than zero probability and I say that that I for any steps that j sorry hi to j and sorry.

526
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:58,150
So the the left hand side is a probability that's basically sum over all possible lots.

527
01:15:58,710 --> 01:16:07,800
And on the right hand side is just so one particular involves one particular URL that is nonzero as we know here,

528
01:16:08,250 --> 01:16:15,780
a peer and it's not zero because it's recurrence state but this is a just unstuck back and so

529
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:21,600
this a probability is not zero so this thing is greater than zero and now we can do the trick.

530
01:16:21,990 --> 01:16:32,610
So the if we do the summation of for the end equals one to infinity here j j and

531
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:40,380
plus and plus k will be greater or equal to through the summation for a new one,

532
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:48,090
to only sum over all possible and the I.

533
01:16:48,090 --> 01:17:02,910
And because the summation is only respect to and then we just do it here and i j k right.

534
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:12,050
All right. So the left hand side, we get something very similar to this.

535
01:17:12,410 --> 01:17:16,610
And then because it's a transient, the right hand side has to be infinitely.

536
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:22,800
I am sorry it's a recurrent that right we said is a recurrence of the right hand side.

537
01:17:23,490 --> 01:17:29,520
So if this quality is greater than a right hand side, that means the summation of all the possible.

538
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:39,780
And so we essentially prawns p j j a saying on prime and prime.

539
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:51,390
You want you to say, well, this this quantity has to be true, right?

540
01:17:51,930 --> 01:17:59,370
If you were for some over this right hand side, a smaller quantity, you know, it's blowing up.

541
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:04,870
The bigger quantity has to also blow up to infinity.

542
01:18:04,890 --> 01:18:09,960
So therefore the state j is also recurrent.

543
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:19,340
I think we're running out of time. Probably talk a little bit more about this next time, but this established the relationship.

544
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:25,140
So if you're you have a communication class, you don't need to really investigate each individual state.

545
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:31,710
You have just focus on one state if that particular state is a recurrent, but every other state is recurrent.

546
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:38,700
Same thing if the one of the state is on transit and every other states are transiting as well.

547
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:42,810
I'll talk more about that next time. Right.

548
01:18:56,050 --> 01:19:29,690
Mr. People would normally go to the house.

549
01:19:30,470 --> 01:19:36,740
That was me. Close. Now, why would you do that?

550
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:41,290
Oh, something I needed fear about what to do.

551
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:46,770
You know, I grew up in.

552
01:19:49,420 --> 01:19:55,700
All. No problem. Was a great day, child.
