00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:09,730
Hello. Welcome to statistical models in Numerical Method and change in this course.

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:16,900
This is online lecture two. This should happen before the in-person lecture two.

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,380
And after this lecture, I encourage you to finish the treatise.

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,220
Because for lecture two, before the lecture two starts.

5
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:38,180
So we're going to start with a manhattan plot of the typical Genome Wide Association study.

6
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,570
So here Essex is representative for chromosome,

7
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:53,510
where the genomic locations and Y-axis represent a statistical significance of these associations signals in terms of negative ten P value.

8
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,470
Usually this is a genome wide significance threshold if it's over this threshold.

9
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:07,640
This is typically considered quite significant. So here there's about four different locus that is known signal previously,

10
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,220
no previously reported signals in this study and that that's what you would expect usually.

11
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,709
And when when there's a there's a signal,

12
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:27,370
you'd expect that there's many nearby variants that are correlated with the peak signal due to the phenomenon called linkage.

13
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:34,250
It is clearly what we're going to talk about that in the next lecture. And this is what we would expect.

14
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,459
But when you perform, you might also study.

15
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:45,900
If you don't have a lot of experience and you're first genome wide association study results might be more exciting than this.

16
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,720
What is it like this? So here there is a lot of.

17
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:59,770
Hits a lot of significant results here, but probably this is a little bit too good to be true.

18
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:11,830
If your sample size is not too high for you guys either, expect to see this many novel signals for the wells that is finished wells that phenotype.

19
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:19,560
And the signal you're seeing here is that there's a lot of them are kind of isolated,

20
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,970
you know, that doesn't have any other nearby variants that are also associated.

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:32,090
So this is all one signal which is suggestive usually suggests suggestive signal

22
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,430
of there is some false positive or technical issue happening with this data.

23
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:47,560
So maybe these are likely to be false positive and we need to figure out what's what happened and do some Senate checking,

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,360
you know, before before getting this to this stage.

25
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,870
We usually would be great to screen this kind of potential issue before.

26
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:02,650
So we do a lot of Senate checking on the data.

27
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:08,529
For example, I'm looking at a study designed to make sure that there's any the best effect where

28
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:15,759
confounding factors involved with to generate the false false signals for quantity traits.

29
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:21,729
We often compare this distribution with the prior studies and then look at the distribution of

30
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:28,900
phenotypes and make sure that it's an illness that could drive drive to the potential false positive.

31
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:39,040
With genetic data. We also compare the frequencies to make sure that allele frequency is consistent between the batches in prior studies and check,

32
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,760
check missing data rates, duplicate concordance and rendering inheritance.

33
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:49,730
And one of the important metric to to check is a high divine Burkinabe.

34
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,940
So when you check equilibrium,

35
00:03:52,940 --> 00:04:03,350
it's a very useful metric to check whether there is a potentially technical issue with a specific variance and some of these.

36
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,520
This potential false signals could be screened out if we checked the Hollywood clearly.

37
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:22,710
So Hathaway B clearly is a useful, juicy matrix, but also it has a good, interesting property from the genetic perspective.

38
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:28,700
So we're going to talk about this Hathaway equilibrium more deeply in this online lecture.

39
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,420
So we're going to focus on the single locus, single variant,

40
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:42,640
and there are some terminology we're going to learn about a little genotype, a little frequency and genotype frequency.

41
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:46,570
And finally, Heidi, want to be clear with in principle, so.

42
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:51,920
And the key concern is basically how do you own but how do you own?

43
00:04:52,170 --> 00:05:00,660
Librium is a property of ls in a population and is important population that that holds in most of the are the genetic status.

44
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:11,660
So what is LDL? So LDL is the alternative forms of a particular DNA sequence in that region of the single chromosome.

45
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,050
So basically, LDL is a, you know, some some type of sequence.

46
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:25,010
So, for example, you know, somehow if it is a single nucleotide polymorphisms,

47
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:33,110
some could carry nucleotide G so the other leg could carry nucleotide T,

48
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:43,459
for example, so that each of those a single, single chromosome could include could have a specific type of sequence.

49
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:50,600
Those are ls in this area has a frequency which is a proportion of the chromosomes of that type in the population.

50
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:59,770
So this is called the L in frequency. So this frequency, if, for example, if there's a two LS style, this is called diabetic variant.

51
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:03,320
This is typical in the single nucleotide polymorphisms.

52
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:11,930
Usually those frequencies are 11l frequencies labeled as P, and the other frequency could be labeled as Q, which is one minus P.

53
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,360
There are more than two ls.

54
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:25,340
This is called the multiple variants you see this typically labeled is p of with this subscript p of a pop of C and the subscript indicates how many?

55
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:34,850
And genotype is a a pair of LDL carried by individuals.

56
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:42,990
So an individual in in most of the most of the genome or so the chromosome 1 to 22.

57
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,700
Those are, you know,

58
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:56,679
one those the deployed so the the human is a is expected to have two LS in most of the cases and so if there's a and different delta

59
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:05,250
is let's say if there's let's put it in three different Del it's A and B and C and Delta and plus N times in plus one divided by two,

60
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,430
which is a in this case and is an is three.

61
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:24,120
That'll be six. Right. So because if there's a clear that the the possible combination of these LDL switches genotype is a AB AC and.

62
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,870
And the PPC and CC.

63
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,080
Right. So. So. If any country. So.

64
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:48,970
For example. If. And any so if and equal to then that we can have a, a, a, B and B, B, for example, if there's two early A and B,

65
00:07:49,300 --> 00:08:01,060
so this and the number of possible genotype and and plus one divided by two equals three if an equal three.

66
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:11,070
You know, let's say that three of these are ABC and a AB AC and.

67
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,530
Be. B, B, C and CC.

68
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:20,620
So there are six possible genotyping.

69
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,910
The other does not matter here. So, you know, genotypes are not order aware.

70
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,450
So in this case, the possible number is a six. So.

71
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:36,800
So in this case. So.

72
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,209
So if the two the these are each of them are genotypes.

73
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,760
So if a genotype has two areas that are the same.

74
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:58,050
Similarly A, B, B here or a, B, B and C, C, those are called homozygous genotype.

75
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,940
And heterozygous genotype is the case where those two alleles are carried by one individual,

76
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:10,650
a different AB or a C, and those are called heterozygous genotype.

77
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:19,720
And that frequency is the frequency of each possible phenotype.

78
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:24,850
So because aliens are called in pair, these are the useful descriptors of the genetic data.

79
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:33,370
But compared to the number of alleles, the number of genotypes is likely to be a lot more.

80
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:38,829
So just that we have a lot more frequencies to estimate.

81
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:46,570
For example, if there are three at least ABC, you have six different genetic frequencies to estimate.

82
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:59,950
So and Ellie, frequency and frequencies has a very simple and connection between between them.

83
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:07,900
So if you basically if you know that you not high frequencies, you can calculate the frequencies, but not vice versa.

84
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:20,020
So for example, for terminals, if you if you know that you know the frequencies of A and B and B, B, L will then.

85
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,350
So. Then.

86
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:33,150
Then that so that there are. So.

87
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:43,280
Here. There's cities and different individuals and each individuals are deployed.

88
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,940
Then there's a two and chromosome. Okay.

89
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:56,190
So if there's any individuals there means that, is there any different genotypes?

90
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,110
Okay. And if there's a twin chromosome,

91
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:09,780
that means there are two and different levels so that the number of males for diploid individual these are twice the number of possible genotypes.

92
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:16,390
So in this case, these are aliens, case of two aliens.

93
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:33,690
So basically the total number of alien is so number of a LDL is a two times number of aliens because the X two of those aliens plus one.

94
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:46,930
And if they they can be heterozygous VK one of these alpha so number of pills is a two times the number of people.

95
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,730
Okay. And plus one of AB.

96
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:58,760
So if you want to calculate these frequencies, you basically divide these numbers.

97
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:05,780
Okay. So P of a is an of a divided by two n.

98
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:20,220
Which is. This is two, two, two and is physically two, two times and a a plus and a B plus and up.

99
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,820
Okay. So you can calculate the pop this way.

100
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:32,640
Okay. And. If you if you if you expand this equation, basically,

101
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:47,550
this this will become this will be equivalent to p of a +11 half of P of a B if you plug this value, this value to here.

102
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,540
Okay. So that's how you can.

103
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:59,740
You know, you can derive this in this particular equation. So same for the poppy.

104
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:07,690
So basically the frequency of a and polyols can be calculated from the genetic frequencies.

105
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:14,560
Okay. So and the other reverse condition is not typically true.

106
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:18,909
Okay. But it can be possible under certain condition.

107
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:22,600
And the spoiler alert is such a condition is called the hardy one because we have.

108
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,680
So we're going to talk about that.

109
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:31,420
So if on the Heidi one kilogram, we can represent that you have that frequency shift as a function of added frequencies.

110
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:36,520
But that's not generally that's not always correct.

111
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:45,190
So before going to the highly one book, Librium. Now let's talk about the mental methods first, obviously.

112
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:49,930
So members first law is the law of segregation.

113
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:54,190
So this is very well known loss of for a given genetic character.

114
00:13:54,520 --> 00:14:00,220
They say father has a, A and B ls and mother has A and C alias.

115
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:08,620
And so for a given genetic kick that an individual that has two copies of one credit defector or a hereditary factor and the underlying

116
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:21,489
the character and the chance that the offspring carry these pairs of LDL is because actually have for each of those parents.

117
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:30,610
So I randomly chosen copies passed to each offspring of the individual, so with each copy as exactly have a chance of being chosen.

118
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:39,490
So in this case ALS, there's a half chance of being trans, being transmitted to offspring via the same, and Clinton is the same.

119
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:47,200
So each person combination has equally one fourth chance of being transmitted at a particular locus.

120
00:14:50,000 --> 00:15:00,979
So and with this and there's first law we can appeal this upon it's clear between different levels

121
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:07,340
and you probably already already know this and then it's genetics so that that's how this works.

122
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,200
So I don't think I need to explain more about this Mendel's first law.

123
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:21,720
So then so with this Mendez low in in mind.

124
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,690
Now we're going to talk about the relationship between the genetic frequencies and the frequencies.

125
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,000
But the other way around.

126
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:42,880
So this hideaway equilibrium describe the relationship that can describe the genotype frequencies based on daily based on daily frequencies.

127
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,700
We we just did the bite.

128
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:55,570
The other way that we in this in the previous slide we talked about how to derive their live frequency from the genotype frequencies,

129
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:01,660
which is always possible because genotype frequency has more information in the frequencies.

130
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:10,510
But on the highway, one bacterium allele frequencies can be can define, describe the distribution of the genotype frequencies.

131
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:22,060
So this is a very simple model. Describe Artie and Weinberg that they they came up with the same principle independently so and they

132
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:29,830
assumed or deployed the organism and ran the meeting in equal measure that female only frequencies.

133
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,209
And we're assuming two values and one gene.

134
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:39,040
So there's no additional mutations. You can also work with a three or more alleles.

135
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:44,049
But let's talk about two, at least for the simplicity for now. And the needle is favored.

136
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:52,150
And that single, infinite population were assuming and we are assuming that discrete, known, overlapping generations for simple simplicity.

137
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:01,520
So this is the how they went to law and how they were going experience the frequency of that I played.

138
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,660
Genotype is the product of the frequency. So this is Alias.

139
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:17,040
So which means that let's say P is the frequency of the L, A and Q is a frequency of B then and how they when you click William,

140
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:30,750
the frequency of AA is a P squared and frequency of AB heterozygous at 2pq and two two square is the frequency of a p homozygous.

141
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:34,110
Okay, so you may have already noticed,

142
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:47,820
but the way you can get this equation is that if you just expand this P plus Q squared is P square is the frequency of a homozygous to p q.

143
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:55,730
Is the frequency of ABA heterogeneous and to square is a frequency of PB homogeneous.

144
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:05,020
So this how equilibrium occurs when we lose an individual at random draws from the population.

145
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:14,200
So this is indeed just a simple binomial expansion of despondently variable.

146
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:24,700
And this one generation of random. The interesting fact we're going to learn here is that one generation of random mating can produce.

147
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:31,460
Heidi Weinberg It could be. So what do I mean?

148
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:36,860
So let's look at this. This particular table.

149
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:48,320
Let's say you have. These are three possible genotypes A, a, a and B.

150
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,150
Okay. And they can they can be made it in different ways.

151
00:18:54,220 --> 00:19:03,090
Okay. So a and a so is the possible combination of these these genotypes.

152
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,950
So it's so without. So the possible types of mating.

153
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:16,130
So if you if you you can order the order between the between the father or mother.

154
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:19,350
So there six possible combinations here.

155
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:22,920
Okay. So and.

156
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:38,240
And so what is the probability that the two if this is random meeting, what is the probability that two parents have bought a home which I it.

157
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
So the probability will be.

158
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,230
Will be. The the probably two of.

159
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:53,120
Probably to a a times probably top 80.

160
00:19:53,710 --> 00:20:01,690
Okay. So and and if you know the genotype frequency, you can you can have this.

161
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,540
This will be frequent centered around the meeting. The same thing here.

162
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:24,170
You're going to have a baby inside a pope eight times p of Abby and there's a so there there's a two here because the.

163
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,270
So the mother has it.

164
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:36,830
It's possible that the age, you know, a genotype is carried by Father ab each of those killed by mother or vice versa.

165
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:43,180
Those two possibilities. Okay. So you can keep writing this equation in this way.

166
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:49,760
Okay. And you're going to have. A table like this.

167
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,790
Okay. And this.

168
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:10,100
This table will add up to. Add up to one, because if you see this thing, this is actually simply the expansion of the pill.

169
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:14,000
A pill. Abby Pope.

170
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:25,730
Squared. Okay. If you take the square, you will have each of turn in this way in the summation of all possible type probability will be what?

171
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:33,650
Okay. So this will be guaranteed to be added up to one.

172
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:39,360
Okay. So.

173
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:47,610
So now let's do a little more complicated stuff.

174
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:53,219
Okay. So now we already know the frequency of under the random meeting.

175
00:21:53,220 --> 00:22:03,150
We we know the frequency of this column, but what is the probability of an offspring happening?

176
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:11,100
Okay. In this case. So. So for example.

177
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:16,230
So if the both parents have kept a.

178
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:23,830
Genotypes and the offspring must have a all the time under Mendel's segregation.

179
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:29,170
So this of this probability will be one. This probability will be zero.

180
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:41,349
This probability will be zero. Okay. If this is a a, a, B, there's a half chance of the offspring as a half chance of the offspring is.

181
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:49,720
AB But there's no chance that offspring is BP because there's no p a little kitty by one of the parent.

182
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:56,200
So we can fill in this table in a similar way and we have this table.

183
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:07,070
Okay. So this is the. The full table of the under the random meeting between between possible.

184
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:18,880
You know, possible combinations, you know, types of parents and a chance of transmission to offspring.

185
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,920
Okay, so. So under this table.

186
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:27,639
Now what? So what I try to do here.

187
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,180
So with this table, so that this table is important.

188
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:35,960
So keep. Keep it. Keep in mind and. So.

189
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,950
So, for example, as I said, the.

190
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:53,400
So in this case, this is probably this one because support for parents is AA and in this case, both parents as B, so it's a chance it's one.

191
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:59,220
But for example, if they put the parents over at AB, then all possible,

192
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:09,570
all these genotypes are possible but heterozygous have have a have chance and AA is at one point for chance and B this one for chance.

193
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:16,000
So. So with this. We it as segregation.

194
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:23,790
What we are trying to do is that we're going to calculate the probability of the offspring gene genotypes.

195
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,150
So we're going to calculate the genotype frequency of the offspring.

196
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:41,650
So what am I trying to do here? Okay, so so let's say p a prime is the genotype frequency of the offspring.

197
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:48,410
Okay, so. So. So that is here.

198
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:56,300
Okay. So the chance that. The office sphere has a genotype AA.

199
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,790
Is can be. There are three, three different possible scenarios.

200
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:08,660
One is that the two parents are both of them AA.

201
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,770
In this case, there's a 100% chance that Hope springs AA.

202
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:19,040
If they're combinations. Combination of AA. And maybe there's a half chance.

203
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,520
If the combination is A, B and AB, there's a one quarter.

204
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:25,910
Yes. So you can add those chance chances up here.

205
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:30,730
Okay. So. So if you see this is a first case.

206
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:37,300
Second case. If you if you look at the previous case, there's a there's a coefficient too.

207
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:47,760
But the question too is cancel. So you say, yes, you have this situation and in the third case you have a V squared in this quality.

208
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:56,140
Yes. Okay. So this can be written in the in the squared form like this.

209
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,630
Okay. The same for the PBB frequencies.

210
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:06,640
It's just the exact opposite. Just all A change is B and the DNA is swapped.

211
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:14,120
You have the same equations here. Plato's prime is a little more complicated.

212
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,420
So there are four possible cases here.

213
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:21,890
Okay. So you can add up all these four possible cases.

214
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:27,170
So and the four parts of the cases are written like this and.

215
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,010
But you can factory's the equation in this way. Okay.

216
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:42,070
So. So this looks a little complicated, but there's an interesting patterns you may see here.

217
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:46,450
So to see this situation and description and description.

218
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,770
So. So.

219
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:57,180
You might see that. Oh, if so, if you see this.

220
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,950
If you represent this is this is a P of a.

221
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:13,290
So these that we already looked at look in the previous slide that the this genotype frequency

222
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:20,620
can be written as a P of a so this is POB squared and these are frequencies of poppy.

223
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:25,649
So poppy squared and this one is the this one is pure poppy.

224
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:36,180
So this p of a poppy. Okay. So this is it's the same to the Heidi one, the Colombian principle.

225
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:44,270
So. So basically what we have is all.

226
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:51,639
So we didn't. So one thing one thing you need to notice is that we actually did not assume that

227
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:58,480
the parents does follow the Holy One because this can be she of AVP can be anything.

228
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:02,290
Okay. But after one generation random meeting,

229
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:15,700
the offspring get a frequency becomes follows the high value clearly of a p p squared to take you and you squared that that that principle follows.

230
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,790
And another nice property is that the offspring live frequencies.

231
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:35,340
If you calculate this way, it'll be the same as a piece of PPA and piece of the frequency of these values does not change over time under the random.

232
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:46,950
So. So putting this together so it's not a frequency is a function of hourly frequencies.

233
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:57,450
And so we show that the this Heidi Heidi one vocal album which is in one generation the list of the genetic frequencies of parents.

234
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:06,580
And this is independent of the initial genotype frequencies and the random meaning and other assumptions are required.

235
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,879
But but under that assumption, these are they are they were mutually.

236
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,000
William nicely follows. Okay.

237
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:27,490
And the principle is quite simple. So when you have a real illness, the A&E, you don't have frequencies conforms to the spine only extension.

238
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:39,430
And this principle also applies to multiply those three alias foils five else same principles can apply you know, in a similar way.

239
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:50,230
Okay. So. So that's the data all about the slice.

240
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:58,990
And we're going to do some exercise in in our notebook so you can follow this link and do the same thing with me.

241
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:10,310
So what I recommend is to open a web browser and type this URL and a complete complete is procedure with me.

242
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,810
You need to log in with the you miss your account to be able to do this.

243
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:20,350
So I need at this point, this page is only accessible with a you mean Google account.

244
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,920
Okay. With that. Let's try this.

245
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:34,590
Okay. So. So let me make it a little bit bigger.

246
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:46,080
Okay. So the way how we can run this page is you can just simply run this.

247
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:53,899
Read this page. And it will for you.

248
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,170
It'll give a warning that this is not authored by you.

249
00:30:57,170 --> 00:31:02,209
And you need to you need to type that you run anyway.

250
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:11,560
But that that is safe. You can do that. So we're going to do the exercise number one here and the rest of the exercise we can do in the class.

251
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:19,060
So. What we are going to do here is we're going to do some simulation.

252
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:35,320
So we are going to simulate 10,000 individuals and note frequencies is a 20%, 30% and a 50% of of these is between these three valleys.

253
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:39,850
So note that these are not following the high one Berkeley medium.

254
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:47,319
So because this this does not this is not scared to cross to pick you in two square.

255
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:54,850
So this heterozygous l is are smaller than the what is expected by Hathaway fluvial.

256
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,810
And. But we're going to do this. Okay.

257
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:14,640
So and. Then just to print out this is the number of samples at 10,000 and observe genotype frequencies.

258
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,610
Are these so the genotype count is this.

259
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:25,890
Okay, so let me just clear the outputs up to make sure that you can see the output going to press this button.

260
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:37,090
So. And here we're going to just show the due date based on these genotype frequencies.

261
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:42,320
So you have a 10,010 thousand samples and this genotype.

262
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:49,270
So we can calculate the live frequencies because because the frequencies can be derived directly from the genetic frequencies.

263
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:56,410
So here the number of aliens at 20,000 and the frequencies that 35% is 65%.

264
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:06,270
So that's this. Okay. And we can show what is expected on the hardware more closely.

265
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:18,010
So the hardware would be chromium. You can use a p square to p q and to square the creation and on the hardware equilibrium.

266
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:22,420
This is the expected synoptic count with this cell frequencies.

267
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:32,660
So now we're going to we're going to just just show these principles so we can

268
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,370
calculate the offspring genotype frequencies based on the equation we have.

269
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:41,150
And we want to make sure that these are actually follows how they migrate loop.

270
00:33:41,780 --> 00:33:46,429
So what you are doing here is that we can calculate offspring genotype counts based

271
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:52,190
on this equation from the slide and make sure that these are actually following.

272
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:59,630
This is the offspring genotype frequencies. We calculated this follows indeed.

273
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:10,260
The Heidelberg Williams. So these these frequencies exactly same as what we we are expecting from the how do you want it to be a peaceful.

274
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:21,090
Okay. And and the frequency also does not change, obviously.

275
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:25,590
So frequency does not change indeed in this case.

276
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:33,450
Okay. So that's what we have covered today.

277
00:34:33,870 --> 00:34:46,100
Okay. And the rest of the part, we will continue in the in-person lecture, but don't forget to finish your piece before that.

278
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,200
Okay. Thanks for watching. Bye.
