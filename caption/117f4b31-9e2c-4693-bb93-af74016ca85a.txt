1
00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:05,280
But it's just too easy.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:27,670
If you start to feel that way, you just say, okay, why don't we go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:38,400
So first of all, what's on the screen there was really not to remind you of is to remind me, I swear on some religious something or other.

4
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,840
I'm going to make sure from now on as well.

5
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,639
It can't be true for next week.

6
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:54,900
But I'm going to try to make sure that everything that I've asked to do or look at is already in place at least two weeks,

7
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:05,250
and that is when that class is going to meet. And one reason I'm doing that, I had forgotten I asked you to do this.

8
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,630
Please watch the video.

9
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:16,410
Else is as best as I can crawl from. And so I was like ten, 20 something to the end.

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,240
And frankly, I'd forgotten how long that had taken.

11
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:26,790
And then I also knew that nobody saw this because I hadn't posted it before yesterday afternoon.

12
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:31,590
So I'm apologizing for that. But I'm actually interested in knowing.

13
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:37,740
So there's no penalty for this. Please just tell the truth. One of the three categories, I didn't even look at this.

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,360
I looked at it, but I didn't finish it. I looked at the whole thing.

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,590
Let's start with the smallest boat. How many people looked at the whole thing?

16
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:53,240
Oh, it's more than I expected. Okay. And how many looked at it but didn't finish?

17
00:01:54,620 --> 00:02:00,720
Okay. It's a little bit more. And then I guess I would know in theory, but how many didn't look at it at all?

18
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:05,520
You're safe saying that because I'm blaming myself. Okay.

19
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:13,230
Depending on what goes on today, maybe we could take a look at that.

20
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:19,290
And people that got all the way through it will be happy to be a lead on some things.

21
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,580
All right. The rest of this, I think, is is all pretty straight forward.

22
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,040
Are there any problems with those days since the start of the year in terms of what I was asking for?

23
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,610
And so that was clear. Okay. Um.

24
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:48,809
So that's one of the thing I want to mention is, you know, doing using the perusal or perusal,

25
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:52,170
however you want to pronounce it, is a learning curve for me as well.

26
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:00,200
Most people most people would have gotten in full credit or will get full credit for

27
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,290
it because it was the first time I used it and the first time this class used it,

28
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:07,590
even though probably most of you in the class have seen it before.

29
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,540
I'm going to give everybody a perfect score for this.

30
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:21,110
This test is. And from here on in the book, probably based on what you actually work in.

31
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:30,899
So I'm going to do that. And I think that pretty much covers the things I really wanted to say something about.

32
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,740
By the way, I guess there's also the question about doing quiz.

33
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,070
Number one, is anybody has anybody done that yet? Got it all worked fine.

34
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:48,840
Okay, good. All right. So in that case, I think we should go right ahead.

35
00:03:52,340 --> 00:04:04,079
So. By the way, Tony Burton, not this particular presentation,

36
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:12,900
but we started the class together one year and put both their names on everything is actually a graduate of our our program.

37
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:28,350
A We used to run a residency for students who are doing an M.D. and we're looking to expand their understanding of occupational diseases, illnesses.

38
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,919
And so I he's been involved with doing that.

39
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,330
So that's where that names from each one of them. All right.

40
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,250
So I'm going to go through this not super fast, but try and keep moving along.

41
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:47,340
Feel free if I'm looking down and you really want to ask something or say something.

42
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:55,230
Feel free to speak up. Or I guess you raise your hand first, but speak up if I don't see your respond right away.

43
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,140
All right. So. We're going to start this presentation talking about pulmonary structure and function.

44
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:09,110
And of course, the main function of the lungs is gas exchange,

45
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:17,570
where the lungs are involved with taking the O2, the oxygen out of the air that's inhaled by all of us.

46
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:23,599
And seeing that that O2 ends up actually in the in the bloodstream so it can be

47
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:31,310
delivered to all cells in the body that heat it and the is a waste gas as well,

48
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:38,690
which is CO2. And so it's also important to remove CO2, CO2 from the blood.

49
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:48,770
And of course, when one X exhales levels of CO2 and what you're exhaling is much, obviously much larger than what you're inhaling.

50
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:54,200
All right. So we typically talk about the upper airways.

51
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,659
In the lower airways, there's a diagram that's coming up on a couple of slides and an upper airways.

52
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:07,430
And usually we use the cut off as being the vocal cords, you know, essentially here as as the cut off.

53
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:13,400
And so anything below which is the beginning of the trachea is what we mean by the lower airways.

54
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,410
And the other thing that's mentioned here, again,

55
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:30,560
I think are a couple of sizes in more detail is that you start with that that breaks into the left and right main stomach, right.

56
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:36,950
And as you go along, there's 24 generations of that kind of splitting taking place.

57
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:52,430
And so we'll get to at the end, you have all these alveoli, which are sacs that you see in the air and are passing gas in oxygen to the bloodstream.

58
00:06:53,180 --> 00:07:01,550
And so it really covers it. The size of it is actually large, even though it's very compact inside each of our chests.

59
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:09,400
So this is a diagram just to say here's here's where the lyric says vocal chords.

60
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:17,720
And so that that line is basically talking about upper airway versus lower airway and tissues for trachea, beginning of trachea.

61
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,829
So this is a has all kinds of information on it.

62
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:31,400
But I don't actually want you memorizing this. What I actually wanted one major thing.

63
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:39,470
So. Well, this does show here's the trachea and here here's the first split between the left and right main bronchi.

64
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,270
And you just have all these splits, 24, 24 generations of splits.

65
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:49,790
And the thing I did want to mention, rather than you don't have to memorize what's on here,

66
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:58,040
but it is important to know for for the bronchi that there is smooth muscle surrounding.

67
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:05,230
And when there are, there are people that have asthma when they're suffering an asthma attack.

68
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:15,649
If you were typically part of the problem with getting air in and out when you're having that is because you actually get that muscle contracting.

69
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:20,210
And so it tends to decrease the actual size of the airway while that's going on.

70
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,780
So it was more just to remember that or remind myself to say that.

71
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,210
All right. So going on with pulmonary structure and function,

72
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:35,540
so the alveolar region where gas exchange takes place between the air that's in

73
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:43,360
the alveoli and the bloodstream and there's a proximately in a full grown human,

74
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:53,720
there's about 300 million alveoli. And the surface of where that exchange takes place is about 70 square meters.

75
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,550
That's about the size of a tennis court.

76
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:06,500
So each of us has an inside our Chavis got that much that much revenue to get in and out of from the air to the bloodstream.

77
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:12,950
Okay. And so there's a lot of a lot of opportunity for exposure.

78
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:21,559
And even though obviously air is not as dense as the food or the water or other liquids,

79
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:29,030
where we would ingest the actual weight of the air we breathe in every day is considerably

80
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:34,130
higher than the amount of food and water put together just in terms of weight.

81
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:39,530
Okay. And so there's there's lots of potential for interactions.

82
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:48,980
Many agents that are inhaled are going to be end up in the bloodstream and can end up in various organs.

83
00:09:49,220 --> 00:10:00,740
That's one thing. And the other thing is that there are a number of adverse agents that the damage they do is only in the pulmonary space.

84
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:06,260
So there's a lot of diseases that can happen that we'll talk about more as we go on.

85
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:13,670
And this is the idea of this there being 23 or 24 splits here.

86
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:19,930
So you have the trachea, you have the bronchi, then you have what's called non respiratory bronchioles.

87
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,430
They're smaller, but there's no gas exchange taking place.

88
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:34,040
You get to the still smaller respiratory bronchioles where there is some gas exchange and ultimately they tend to end with these alveolar ducts.

89
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:42,190
This is where this takes place. So that's just trying to show that in the diagram roughly.

90
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:57,860
And what's on here is a it's a macroscopic view of a plastic cast of the airways done in yellow on this lung and the pulmonary arteries,

91
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:04,850
which are red and the veins which are blue on this one, you know, obviously deceased, you might be okay.

92
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,460
And this is just to give you a sense of how dense the alveoli are.

93
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:22,910
And also just to remind you that the one side of the heart, the right side, is going to be pumping blood to to the lungs.

94
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,840
And that's where it's going to pick up, up to and so on.

95
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:33,200
And then on the other side is showing you sort of towards the termination of these smaller.

96
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:42,110
Bronchioles. They sort of disappear into all these alveoli surrounding them and.

97
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:53,110
So that's what that looks like. But in the gas exchange region of the alliance, which is the majority of the region, again,

98
00:11:53,110 --> 00:12:01,090
and I say anything that you find confusing or disputable or something else, do feel free to speak up or raise your hand.

99
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,290
I may not always look up. All right.

100
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:09,370
And a little bit more about the structures that we that you'll want to know about.

101
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:21,550
First of all, thorough. So there's there's visceral flora, which means it's a membrane that surrounds, in this case, lungs.

102
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:28,850
One line on the side. And then there's also parietal pleura.

103
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:36,850
So parietal pleura would include a membrane that's on the top here and along the sides as well.

104
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:43,900
And they have to be able to slide past each other because, you know, you're inflating and deflating your lungs all the time.

105
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:53,620
But when we're talking about asbestos effects, will want to pay attention to, first of all, what the plural are,

106
00:12:53,620 --> 00:13:02,290
which are too, but also where some of these effects take place with respect to the what's parietal versus.

107
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,910
What's its role? Okay.

108
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:15,300
And then this is a claim film, regular X-ray of some of someone's chest without having any problems.

109
00:13:15,310 --> 00:13:20,620
It's just to point out that you have a right killer point and a left one.

110
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:31,090
The right one is a little bit further down on the left one. And that's where you have the, you know, the main bronchi coming out before they split.

111
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:41,890
It's split into all these different smaller bronchioles. And it's also where the blood vessels, they draw blood vessels will come out into the lungs.

112
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:54,430
And also where things like, you know, I remember when I was trying to say basically, you know, things like.

113
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,200
The immune system.

114
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:07,200
You know, you have you have things here that are close to the lungs that would be involved with that, those kinds of things as well.

115
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,620
So that's. All right. So now I want to focus on mechanisms of aerosol deposition.

116
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:24,390
And I guess in order to recognize a certain threat for these people in the age track, you've probably seen all this before, so bear with me.

117
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,750
But it's important to talk about this.

118
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:36,930
And part of why it's important to talk about this is you need if you're talking about agents that are potentially going to cause adverse effects,

119
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:45,810
whether or not they're going to do it often depends on what where they're going to reach in terms of how deep into the lung tissue.

120
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:50,609
And so it's important to talk about mechanisms of aerosol deposition.

121
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:57,120
So this is either very small, solid or very small liquid particles that are being inhaled.

122
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:07,120
And so there's gravitational sedimentation, which is basically if things are going slow enough and they're big enough,

123
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,180
greater than one my problems, mass, medium diameter, they are.

124
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:21,930
That's one way that you can have them cut to the side of a bronchus or whatever there and and stick there.

125
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:28,770
And there's also inertial impaction. So in that case, at Airway, we're going to have pictures of this in a minute.

126
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:39,390
But at airway breath by four occasions, larger particles are more likely to hit the side where there's a high by friction, smaller ones.

127
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:47,370
And then at the extreme other end are the smallest particles, where you have Brownian motion,

128
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:55,230
Brownian diffusion, that's things that are less than 0.5 microns in diameter.

129
00:15:55,590 --> 00:16:04,350
And what's that about? That's about the fact that there's no air molecules, nitrogen molecules, oxygen molecules, and they're banging each other.

130
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:11,879
And you'll see an example of a pathway here where because of that, it's very small particles getting too long.

131
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,380
And they typically do sooner or later hit a side and maybe it stick.

132
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:24,930
So wherever they are. All right. And yeah, I heard you mentioned particle size, density velocity.

133
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:32,879
I didn't talk about so much. And turbulence had some impact on this and less frequent an issue.

134
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,280
But sometimes electrostatic charges are important, you know, as it charges kind of tract.

135
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:45,210
And it's also particle interception with the airway walls that's mostly talking about fibers.

136
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:52,290
I talking about things like asbestos where because you have these long fibers that are very skinny,

137
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:57,960
it's easier for them to be trapped in the airway walls.

138
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:09,870
So here's some diagrams of some of those. So a up there is inertial impacts, an idea that if larger particles may not.

139
00:17:10,910 --> 00:17:19,729
Make the change, the change where it splits and so and hitting the side and they can bounce back but it's to stick to that area.

140
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,660
They have to reach the side, hit the side. This is gravitational high.

141
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:27,170
It doesn't come up quite as much, just things falling out.

142
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:33,110
This is what we're just talking about, where you have things like asbestos,

143
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,380
where you've got a long, thin thing that and therefore it's easier for them to be trapped.

144
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:42,980
And this was the example of Brownian motion.

145
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,740
I guess it's obvious that these aren't supposed to be at the same scales.

146
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,800
Those four pictures are on different scales.

147
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:57,860
So this is Brownian motion saying, you know, there's this like sort of random walk that a particle takes off.

148
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:02,930
It's smart enough to get pushed around by the oxygen and nitrogen particles.

149
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:08,210
So that's Brownian motion, Brownian diffusion.

150
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:24,100
Okay, so more about effect in aerosol deposition inhalation factors like how much was inspired and how inflated is along at the time at the lungs,

151
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:28,850
what's the flow rate and things like that. Something will change it, of course, as well.

152
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:35,150
And then there's the aerosol characteristics, particle size and density, which I sort of mentioned.

153
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,959
There's also high gross capacity.

154
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:47,210
In other words, how how much how likely is this to interact quickly with water or water environment?

155
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,049
And that's quite important. We'll talk about this later.

156
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:57,020
But just give you an example. And if.

157
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:02,130
You were somewhere and you were working on a pipe.

158
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,540
So you're a worker and it's contained something like ammonia.

159
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:13,020
And if the pipe suddenly failed or a valve failed, you would not try to stay there.

160
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:22,620
You would immediately, if you can get away from it, because you know you're going to have eyes, nose, throat and very quickly,

161
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:33,240
deeper reacting to this, because the ammonia is very irritating and it dissolves easily in the water based.

162
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,900
The water that's inside of all of these.

163
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:46,790
So so for that kind of thing, you're going to have the person try to leave in a hurry.

164
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:55,520
And you could compare that to, you know, some kind of agents have been used, like for wartime and so on.

165
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:10,999
Or or you can talk about somebody like doing shipbuilding who's doing and is trying to put medals together and is using very high energy to do that.

166
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,820
And that high energy is going to produce take the oxygen, nitrogen produced, things like oxides of nitrogen.

167
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:27,889
Those sorts of things don't dissolve very fast in water and therefore you can be exposed to them for a longer time before you even notice.

168
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:37,160
Anything is a problem. It's going on. So you'll have a very different reaction to things depending on whether or not they're easily soluble in later.

169
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,120
It's a point I just want to point that out. It's not on this page.

170
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,629
Okay. So you can read these.

171
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:52,950
You don't have to memorize these, but just point out that things like if you're taking slow,

172
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:59,820
deep breaths, you get to get more uniform deposition and rapid shower lines and so on like this.

173
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:09,120
Okay. This is a sort of interesting diagram. This is what, percent deposition going to 100% at the top.

174
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:17,430
And what you notice is the what the x axis is is on a scale.

175
00:21:17,790 --> 00:21:23,180
That's where the distance, you know, you've got a ten fold increase for each of these distances.

176
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:34,750
Right. Okay. And the dotted line is the probability of deposition, the alveolar region of the respiratory tract.

177
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:40,110
So it's sort of at the end of things. And which a notice is probably around.

178
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,940
Remember, this is this is one. And this is tens of probably around 2 to 5.

179
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:52,200
Somewhere in here is the maximum you get if you go out to things that are as big as ten microns in diameter.

180
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:58,410
You're not going to see essentially any of them ending up in the alveolar,

181
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:05,820
alveolar deposition because those particles are too big to get that far, that deep into into the lungs.

182
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:13,620
And you might be wondering about over here, what why is why is this so much lower?

183
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:22,720
Well for that, it's probably because the these particles can bounce around and don't always stay where they are.

184
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:33,550
They may be freaked out more quickly. And the line above it is a line of looking at everything that has been inhaled.

185
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:41,260
And so I make sure, yeah, throughout and it's looking at throughout the respiratory tract.

186
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:45,549
What's the probability somewhere in the respiratory tract that's from the nose

187
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:50,740
all the way down that this stuff is going to stay in the respiratory tract.

188
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:56,200
So for for things that are large enough that you can breathe in your nose,

189
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:04,300
they have a high probability of staying somewhere because of the large, I think too much momentum not to.

190
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:10,420
And you can see. So you have a big difference there and here the difference isn't so great between the two.

191
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:16,990
A lot of where things are ending up in the smaller ones are down all by themselves.

192
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,370
Okay. All right.

193
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:25,470
And then we should talk about respiratory system clearance, a defense mechanism.

194
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:35,470
So you've got progressive mechanical filtering in the upper and lower airways and coughing and sneezing,

195
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:40,270
which we obviously all experience are examples of a mechanical way of trying

196
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:43,780
to move something back up that's already in part of the respiratory tract.

197
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:57,670
And also the the those fluids that line the airways often are bacterial side side of they have ways that detoxify some agents.

198
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:04,880
And then you also mucosal air and clearance, which is about that idea that you've got cells that, you know,

199
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:15,490
have little fingers sticking up and they all together and beat things up back towards the nose and mouth is another way that things get cleared,

200
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:21,879
cleared out. And then with respect to the immune system, we're going to talk about this in a little more detail later.

201
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:34,000
But there's antibodies that can react to foreign agents and there's also cellular types of reactions that are all immune system related.

202
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:44,920
And the other thing is for agents, for things that reach the alveoli, there's a potentially lymphatic drainage to remove them,

203
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:53,890
but there's also macrophages, a type of white cell that tends to engulf agents that aren't supposed to be there.

204
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,530
And that's a way of clear.

205
00:24:56,530 --> 00:25:07,960
And then destroying them, that's a way for out of the other clearance, I'm sort of jumping around and but with the macrophages,

206
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:17,290
for those of you that read about silicosis and related issues already, I heard you looked at that.

207
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:37,720
So one of the big issues with with exposure to CO2 to silica is that the when when the particles made of CO2 are engulfed by the macrophages,

208
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:46,270
it doesn't really get rid of them. And so that actually tends to damage the macrophages and make them unable to do what they're supposed to do.

209
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:57,040
And that's that's part of why silica can produce silicosis, you know, of escaped lung tissue problems.

210
00:25:57,970 --> 00:26:03,060
Just give you an example there. Okay. So the key points we've talked about so far.

211
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,290
Oh, well, actually, these are some of these are new.

212
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:16,680
All right. So it's interesting. The reason says Lung is opposite of a sponge is that inspirations active when you breathe in, you know,

213
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:23,190
you're you're lowering your increasing the space and then and when you expire, that can be passive.

214
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,970
That doesn't require energy to do in the same way.

215
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,950
And then if you look at it,

216
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:40,919
you're interested or interested in the elasticity or compliance of the lungs or lungs are supposed to be able to change in size.

217
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,690
Alveoli can fill up with more air and so on quite quickly.

218
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,490
And so the for some of these problems we're talking about,

219
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:55,800
like actually silicosis or being an example of this, but we'll talk about those more in a little bit.

220
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:06,090
When it when you get changes to the to the lungs, you lose elasticity and compliance.

221
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:12,840
And therefore, it becomes more difficult to actually breathe, to move the air in and out, like what you're supposed to do.

222
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:23,040
And then there's so that that has to do with damage that gets in the way of compliance of the law.

223
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:29,310
And then there's also the issue of resistance, meaning how easy is it for air to pass through the airways?

224
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:35,070
And, you know, if you're in the middle of an asthma attack, for example,

225
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:40,350
you're the resistance in your airways is going to be much higher than it would be otherwise.

226
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:44,719
If you right in the middle of that. Okay.

227
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:53,360
So now I'm going to turn to diagnosis an assessment of pulmonary diseases and conditions that are caused by inhaled agents.

228
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,910
And so this is how one goes about assessing pulmonary diseases.

229
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:07,640
And it's mostly based on a combination of what's on on this page, symptoms that are actually quite important to look at and pay attention to.

230
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:11,630
So dyspnea just means difficulty breathing breathlessness.

231
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:19,250
And this is not something that you SLB here is not a cuss word.

232
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:24,350
It's it's referring to breathing.

233
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:28,670
Okay. And so you have these kinds of symptoms.

234
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:35,180
You have cough, you had certain production, you have wheezing, a wheezing sound that you can audibly here.

235
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:43,610
For example, again, going to someone who has said that if someone's having an effect,

236
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:48,410
it's closing down their airways, you can get these kinds of wheezing sound.

237
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:55,909
So this would be physical exam. You know, wearing something and listening to the chest and rattles are typically you hear

238
00:28:55,910 --> 00:29:02,920
them best towards the bottom and what they sound like is what they sound like.

239
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:06,690
As if you take some air here, at least it works for me.

240
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:12,319
It might not work for you. So if your hair's considerably longer but and you sort of go back and forth,

241
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:18,649
you hear this scratchy sound and that's what you're going to hear with a stethoscope.

242
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:26,390
If somebody has had fluid, for whatever the reason, feelings are partially filling their alveoli.

243
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:29,810
Where it's not supposed to be is supposed to be just gas. Okay.

244
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:38,480
So those are some of the things you can look at in terms of symptoms and certain in terms of physical exam.

245
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,790
And obviously, if you if you have decreased breath sounds,

246
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:53,240
then you probably are having a big problem with with flow of air in the lungs, pulmonary function testing.

247
00:29:53,420 --> 00:30:00,530
We're going to talk about this in quite a bit of detail here and we're going to talk about pulmonary function testing.

248
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:08,750
That's dynamic and pulmonary function testing that is that's different than that doesn't make sense as we go through this.

249
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:17,010
A few next few slides and we're looking for patterns abnormalities in the

250
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:24,980
pulmonary function fine what should be what's expected for a person of this age,

251
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:33,890
gender, height, actually, even ethnicity issues come in as well for some of these things.

252
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:41,370
And. And are you are they breathing in where you expect or.

253
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:49,990
Or is there a problem with obstruction of flow in the airways like you would get with an asthma attack or both,

254
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:55,750
or restriction of the ability of the lungs to expand the way they're supposed to be able to,

255
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:59,020
which you inject with something like silicosis, for example.

256
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:07,770
All right. So. So we're going to look at that more carefully because that gives you a lot of information.

257
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:15,720
And then there's chest radiographs. You can see things like acute infiltrates, like, you know, you might have,

258
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:20,100
for example, a bacterial infection that's only affecting certain parts of the lung.

259
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:28,140
And it would be that that would tend to show up because you'll have fluid in the alveoli where that's happening.

260
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:31,470
So you'll be able to see it will look more white on a regular playing field.

261
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:40,500
And you can look for opacities depending on like if we're going to talk about like asbestos and silica,

262
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:49,200
even the shapes of opacities in which which part of the lungs they get predominant in actually varies depending on what agent is causing this.

263
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:54,690
Picking up on tumors and then hyper aeration.

264
00:31:54,990 --> 00:32:01,350
So on a playing field, it's going to look too black, not white enough because there's more air in the lungs than you expect.

265
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:05,670
And well, I won't get ahead of myself too much.

266
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,740
We'll come back to that in a couple of minutes.

267
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:20,340
And then things like high resolution CAT scans and MRI's, you can also do and that can give you way more information than you can get with a plane.

268
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:24,000
So there might be things you miss in a flying film that you'll see with these.

269
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:35,340
One thing to keep in mind is that, you know, 80 is a couple of I think typically is.

270
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:41,900
You know, more than 100 times radiation you get from a plane so, so dense.

271
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:47,820
You have to keep that in mind. Um, MRI's that's not an issue for.

272
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:56,200
Okay, so, so continue your thyroid function testing.

273
00:32:56,890 --> 00:33:05,110
So spirometry. It can be done in a lab, but it can also be done in the field using portable equipment.

274
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:14,770
So most studies of what's going on with humans and exposure to agents that might be affecting their pulmonary function.

275
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,850
That's typically what the do likely to do is to because.

276
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:31,560
So this is actually I didn't bring the whole thing but this is what you're going to blow into when you're having your pulmonary function test it.

277
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:40,120
And and this thing actually fits in something where, you know, the whole device that's measuring this, there's only this big quite light.

278
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:49,809
So it's easy to carry around and so on that same as some point I'm supposed to wake you up by using this tissue.

279
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,440
I've never seen anyone do this, but I'll wait for a little bit to do that.

280
00:33:53,450 --> 00:34:01,120
I think I'm going to do it on a different page. All right. So so this is this is a dynamic test because what?

281
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,780
Well, actually, I'll just go ahead and do it in case anybody has fallen asleep.

282
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:14,800
You wake up now. So when you when you're testing pulmonary function, you need you need somebody that's well trained and careful and so on,

283
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:18,820
because you can end up with complete garbage in terms of the data you have.

284
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:26,500
If you don't have that, it actually there's a whole lot I'm not going to teach how to coach everything in here that's not appropriate for this course.

285
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:37,120
But there's there's a lot that goes into how you introduce this to someone and demonstrate to them to make sure that you get the what you want,

286
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:41,020
which is what you want, is you want the person to take the deepest breath.

287
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:48,009
They're possibly capable of like that and then fit their lips around this.

288
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:56,260
And then do something that's not normal at all is to blow out the air as hard and fast as they can possibly do it.

289
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:01,120
And not only that, even when you feel like you don't have any air left in your lungs.

290
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:06,650
You have to keep doing it until the person who's administration says, okay, you can stop now.

291
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:12,410
So it's not nothing normal about it, but this is how you can actually do these measurements.

292
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:15,440
And the measurements are very important, actually. You have to do it right.

293
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:18,800
So here you are. This is what you want somebody to do.

294
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,430
And you have to train them. You have to demonstrate probably.

295
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:39,200
Now for someone like me that presumably isn't having an obstruction to its flow, you know,

296
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:46,040
failing to let you off after about 6 to 8 seconds, depending on who's doing it.

297
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:54,650
That's the only thing that someone who's got a pulmonary illness can outmatch someone who's doesn't have one,

298
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,249
which is if you have bad obstructive lung disease,

299
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:05,330
you have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, or you're in the middle or you have asthma in middle of an asthma attack,

300
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:12,360
you can blow for 10 seconds, 12 seconds and not actually feel discomfort.

301
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:19,790
And then you sort of imagine it's not that comfortable to keep blowing out as hard as you can when there's nothing left of your device.

302
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,139
So that person, because of their disease process,

303
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:30,320
is going to actually be able to go out longer because they can't get all the air out as fast as they should be able to normally.

304
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:42,169
All right. So just remember, spirometry is we're doing dynamic testing and it's wonderful because it's easy to do in the field because you've

305
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:48,799
got things like this and attach these small things that it used to be the thing that big computer these days,

306
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:56,210
you don't need that. Yes. So what's the difference between this and like a peak flow meter this and a peak flow elevator?

307
00:36:56,330 --> 00:37:05,809
So a peak for meter. It'll be much clearer in the next couple of slides, but at the peak, five meter is saying, okay, what's the maximum speed?

308
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:13,040
At some point during that exhalation, what's the maximum speed at which it was possible to do it?

309
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:19,520
So it's only taking a single instant in time when you when you do it.

310
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:26,150
So but the way you're supposed to do it actually is what I just demonstrated.

311
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:31,820
If you're doing it correctly, when you use a peak for a meter, you still are supposed to go through the routine.

312
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:38,270
However, the one thing that's different is you don't really have to keep trying to force air out of yourself for several

313
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:44,929
seconds because you're only trying to capture the peak for as happens in the first second of exhalation.

314
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:53,660
So if that's all you're interested in at that moment, you don't need to have the person keep blowing that answer right now.

315
00:37:53,930 --> 00:38:01,040
Okay. All right. So what are the what are the measures that we're going to look at?

316
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,220
So there's for spinal capacity, efficacy.

317
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:09,590
We're going to look at a diagram of this in a minute. And so that's basically okay.

318
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,350
I took the deepest breath I could.

319
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:19,400
I blew out as hard and fast as I could tell the whoever was doing this, that, okay, stop now, because I could tell that more air was coming out.

320
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:23,450
And so that's the fourth vital capacity.

321
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:29,210
And by the way, just so you know, the word force needs to be there because if you if you do it,

322
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:35,420
if you're just trying to do what's the vital capacity, how much air, if you take a deep breath, how much air can you blow out?

323
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,540
You could actually get a little more air out if you're not blowing as hard as you possibly can.

324
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:48,680
But what you want people to actually do in a real study or are just even not a study,

325
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:53,089
just you're trying to see what kind of shape their end with their lungs is.

326
00:38:53,090 --> 00:39:01,850
You you want the maneuver. You saw me. Do you want the person to push the air out as hard as they possibly are able to and keep doing it?

327
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:08,690
So. So the person who's administrator is confident that there's no more air they have to blow out.

328
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:13,219
Okay. So that's that's important to look at.

329
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:19,640
And then it's also at the same time, very important to look at four X battery volume in the first second.

330
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:25,939
So that's how much when you did that maneuver, you me do in the very first.

331
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:33,260
Second from when you start blowing when one second has happened, how much air did you actually blow out during that time period?

332
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:42,230
So you should not be very surprised. So so the FDA wanted to have a ratio which is sometimes written as the percent FEV1.

333
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:55,040
So what is that ratio? That ratio is what fraction of doing the maneuver you saw me do, what fraction of the air that I exhale.

334
00:39:56,030 --> 00:40:02,600
I exhaled within one second of when they started, as opposed to after one second.

335
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,330
So that's what it's measuring is FDA monitoring. But as they say, you're going to see this on several slides.

336
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:13,160
But so someone who's in the middle of an asthma attack,

337
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:20,630
they're going to have a significant decrement and they're at 81 over efficacy compared to what you would expect.

338
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:27,260
I don't think I'm going to forget to say this. I say it now just because I may forget later.

339
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:34,450
So. When you do this, you are just getting a number and you're not sure what to do with it.

340
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:40,959
What is what we have, especially in high income countries like the US,

341
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:52,180
but more and more so in many other countries is we've done these studies and it's done and Heinz does.

342
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,249
This is part of one of the things they do, you know,

343
00:40:54,250 --> 00:41:05,230
are they do they check out what's going on with the US population over time in many ways, including looking at their delivery function.

344
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:16,419
So what they what is being done as you say, okay, we're going to take a group of people, we're going to pay attention to their height,

345
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:23,020
their gender, their age, their, you know, ethnicity, all this kind of thing that has some impact on it.

346
00:41:23,410 --> 00:41:33,770
But they're going to be people that. Never have had a serious lung problem and never had been cigaret smokers or tobacco smokers.

347
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:39,140
So you're basically trying to look at what's the distribution and people that

348
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:43,700
where you know that their pulmonary system is as healthy as it could possibly be.

349
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,850
And that's what you're that's what you're comparing to. Okay.

350
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:52,699
So there's all these so there's all this data that's already out there that you can that's

351
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:56,179
actually typically built into these devices because they're just little computers.

352
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:07,330
Right. And so you can see actually on the spot what fraction of what you expected the person to be able to do is say the FEV1.

353
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,050
Given all those things I already mentioned your height, etc.,

354
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:20,090
to see what percent of what would be predicted for someone who's perfectly healthy and not having any problems.

355
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:29,190
So you have that. Okay. So that was that was dynamic stuff.

356
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,299
That was the little devices you can walk around and you obviously could do it in a hospital,

357
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,770
but you can also walk out in a field like when you're doing a field study and ask people to do that.

358
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:41,800
So even even relatively young children,

359
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:51,370
then you get a little about age six and things deteriorate a bit and how how reliable the data is that you can obtain.

360
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:56,560
There's other ways to try to do it, but so you can you can do that.

361
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:04,570
Okay. So the other thing, if you're doing like a full workup on someone, you know, you're like,

362
00:43:05,530 --> 00:43:11,559
I've met a physician or other medical personnel and you're trying to figure out exactly what's going on.

363
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:15,940
And we want complete information about what's going on with the lungs of this person.

364
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:28,360
Yeah, we have the dynamic that we're also interested in knowing about how at different points in time how much air is actually in their lungs,

365
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,750
which of course, you don't get that by blowing in this. Right.

366
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:38,260
And so the two things we're most interested in, we're interested in total lung capacity,

367
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:45,970
which essentially is take the deepest breath you possibly can and hold it how much air is in your lungs.

368
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:55,180
And the residual value which is below blow out as much of the air as you can tell, you can't rule out anything else left.

369
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,320
But then the amount of air that's still in your lungs is not zero.

370
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,310
It's a positive number. And so that's the residual value.

371
00:44:03,490 --> 00:44:08,290
Okay. Everyone will. Thank you. So far you're going to see a diagram that makes it easier to remember this.

372
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:17,890
And the other thing that you can do, you can do it, but not very well that you really want to, you know, set up think.

373
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:23,829
Oh, yeah, well, the reason it says Body Box is because there's a couple of ways to do it.

374
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:28,330
But the body box is gives you better data or clearer data.

375
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:37,690
And so you you have the person sit in a glass room that's completely the same as completely sealed.

376
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:46,570
And you what you do is you monitor the pressure of the air that's around them and that allows you to calculate,

377
00:44:46,570 --> 00:44:49,840
you know, using the what is it, you know,

378
00:44:50,260 --> 00:45:00,970
TV equals in to, you know, using that using a formula, you can calculate how much air was in your lungs, those two points you're interested in.

379
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:06,190
Okay. So that's basically how it works that, that, that gives it the best results.

380
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:14,530
And if you're trying to be really complete about this and make sure you've left no stone unturned,

381
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:21,430
you know, especially in advance, you know, medical, legal stuff and you have to be sure about everything.

382
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:25,660
You're going to want to know what our main TLC was.

383
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:30,760
So you're not you know, you're not going to try to do this when you're out in the field trying to do a big study.

384
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:36,010
But for one individual and focused on that, have best understanding of what's going on with their lungs,

385
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:42,579
you're going to be interested in seeing this as well. So you'll be happy you're here at Michigan or somewhere like that that has the ability,

386
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,700
you know, the people trained to do it and the ability to do this.

387
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:49,569
Okay. And then the diffusion capacity DLC.

388
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:52,660
Oh, the quest for carbon monoxide.

389
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,110
It's a functional measure of gas exchange capacity.

390
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:10,390
And carbon monoxide moves across the membrane between the alveoli and the bloodstream and more quickly than oxygen does or that CO2 does,

391
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:14,170
and they're using tiny amounts, so they're not poisoning anyway.

392
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:19,170
I just want to let you know that that's why it's called a DNC.

393
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,670
It's because of that using carbon monoxide.

394
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:29,020
And so that's basically it's a direct functional measure of what your lungs are supposed to be doing and be good for it.

395
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:35,680
And that as well is a little hard to pull off reliably in the field.

396
00:46:35,770 --> 00:46:40,120
You really want to be, you know, in a place like this that's going to measure it.

397
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:45,490
Okay. So here's a diagram of lung volumes.

398
00:46:45,850 --> 00:46:57,100
So total lung capacity is when you take the deepest breath, you're capable of what what is how much air is in your lungs.

399
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:10,000
This is the saying here where it says this is like normal breathing, which I mean, this is probably pretty close, you know, normal breathing.

400
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:19,150
You're not using anywhere close to the total amount you could use. And then this is where you exhale as much as you possibly could.

401
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:24,250
And you and then you. The residual volume can be measured.

402
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:29,140
And so there's I'm not going to go through all these things that are sort of interesting to look at.

403
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:36,310
But in terms of it helping you with knowing what a diagnosis is and how sick is the person or not sick,

404
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:41,590
you're going to be interested in the TLC, in the RV primarily.

405
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:46,120
So I have a it may be on the next page, but I have a quick question for you.

406
00:47:49,190 --> 00:47:57,440
Most people in this room be all. All of us besides yourself tend to know somebody that has asthma.

407
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,970
So we're all tend to be pretty familiar with this as an entity. Okay.

408
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:03,940
So here's my question for you.

409
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:16,370
If someone's in the middle of an asthma attack and you wanted to and you're going to measure that, their RV compared their TLC,

410
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:24,050
so you're going to actually what you're going to be looking at is the total amount of air the person can take into his or her lungs.

411
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:28,970
And if they then blow out as much as they possibly can,

412
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:36,220
what fraction of that that they took in their lungs is still there after they blow out as much as they can?

413
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:40,090
So that would be the RV divided by the TLC, everyone with it.

414
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:44,630
Does that make sense? Okay. So here's my question for you.

415
00:48:46,850 --> 00:48:56,930
What do you think will happen to that number if, say, you got someone with, you know, intermittent, has asthma is always sick intermittently.

416
00:48:57,290 --> 00:49:05,569
So when they're having their best day, you're going to have some if they if you if they did the maneuver you're asking me to do,

417
00:49:05,570 --> 00:49:09,380
they're going to have you can measure their RV divided by their TLC.

418
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:15,020
And then if they come back on the day when they're actually not doing well at all and having a bit of an asthma attack,

419
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:19,310
my question for you is what's going to happen to that ratio?

420
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:30,000
As it has the ratio good to work during having problems with asthma as opposed to where to ask those questions that are really going on there.

421
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:40,300
Any thoughts on that? Yeah. And by the way, I realize also there's several of you that are quite trained medically.

422
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:44,760
Maybe you might know but might not be fair to do it just because you're in the new it that.

423
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:52,710
But if nobody else answers and you know the answer because it's you've run into this kind of thing because it's part of your job.

424
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,520
Feel free to jump in. Anybody willing to take a crack at that? A chance?

425
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:06,810
Okay. I scared you off. So if you're in the middle of an asthma attack, get here.

426
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:13,380
We didn't really talk about this yet, so if you didn't look at the other thing, you didn't get all this.

427
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:18,180
But I mean this. But I want you to look at it in between.

428
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,350
Okay. So we're in the middle of an asthma attack.

429
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:29,820
What's going on is the following. You can inhale and it will.

430
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,520
Your inhalation will not be quite as fast or as easy as if you weren't having an asthma attack.

431
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:42,000
And then when you want to exhale, you get that you get dynamic collapse when you're trying to exhale.

432
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:55,240
So the when you have real significant resistance to the air movement is when you're trying to exhale as compared to when you inhale.

433
00:50:55,260 --> 00:51:01,200
So that means that a person is in the middle of an asthma attack will have.

434
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:07,390
A higher residual value than they should have if they were normal.

435
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:13,420
Not having a problem. Right. So because they they can breathe the air in, but they can't get it out.

436
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:17,920
And you can see this just looking at the playing field. You don't need much.

437
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:24,569
You can look at the playing field. And if you compare it, I mean, this is I wouldn't run around doing this because even though it's low radiation,

438
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:27,660
don't give people radiation just just to make up for it.

439
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:35,400
But they're their lungs are going to look much more black because there's going to be more air and less tissue.

440
00:51:35,610 --> 00:51:39,390
You know, you guys, compared to how much air there is, at any point, though,

441
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,190
they'll look different than somebody who doesn't have something like asthma or COPD.

442
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:57,900
Okay. So so actually, the answer we're going to have is so they answer this question is, see, seeing that RV over the TLC is larger than expected,

443
00:51:58,470 --> 00:52:09,510
is consistent with something like as well as COPD, something that's interfering with your exhalation more and more than your inflammation.

444
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:14,160
All right. So now we want to look at you have to.

445
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,280
What we want to be able to look at what the results were.

446
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:26,110
So we're going to assume that these are people that were that these diagrams come from people that were very well coached.

447
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:31,840
They did everything they were supposed to do. What you saw me do up here without being coached, I didn't self coaching.

448
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:41,530
They did it the way they're supposed to do. And there's a couple of things that you always want to look at and you know, and in these days,

449
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,670
it's programed to show up on your computer screen or whatever you're using.

450
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:54,490
And so this is so now we're back to the dynamic when everyone with me, we're back to what you saw me do,

451
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:59,409
which is take the deepest breath you can and then blow it out as hard and fast as you're able to,

452
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:02,480
even if you felt like you had no air left in your lungs.

453
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:11,380
Okay. So that's what we're looking at. And so this is how many seconds the person was blowing.

454
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:15,550
And this is what's the volume that was exhaled?

455
00:53:15,910 --> 00:53:19,870
Okay. And so this is someone who is perfectly healthy.

456
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:28,469
This is a typical look to that pattern. And so that would be one is that remember how much you breathe out in the first second.

457
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:31,990
And so this is the first second. So it's where this dotted line hits.

458
00:53:32,230 --> 00:53:33,640
It's this line. Right.

459
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:44,950
And what you'll notice, like take this person, for example, it looks like this is in maybe 4.4 or 4.5 meters for the athlete they want.

460
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:54,790
And if you go out here, probably that, by the way, that's really should say if it's because you're actually having to do a forced maneuver,

461
00:53:54,790 --> 00:54:01,930
which you saw me do, but that's probably like around, you know, maybe 5.4 or 5.5.

462
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:10,630
So so basically what I'm saying is a normal person that has no problem doing the maneuver you saw me do,

463
00:54:10,870 --> 00:54:16,540
they will exhale on the 80% plus in the first second.

464
00:54:17,410 --> 00:54:27,990
All right, everybody, with me so far with that represents and then if you look at it here, if you look at you got it.

465
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:32,290
This is what's the flow in liters per second. Okay.

466
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:39,790
So it's and this is the volume of letters that the person has blown out.

467
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:45,280
And this, of course, is a typical thing of someone who has having no problems what it looks like.

468
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:49,750
So they'll have a pretty high peak exploratory flow or quite high one.

469
00:54:50,890 --> 00:55:01,930
Usually it it decays and and notice that peak experts it's a little hard to tell but it's going to be is typically what

470
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:07,480
will be in the second half of that first second but it will be in the first second will be inside the first second.

471
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:14,590
Usually by the time you get to exactly one second, you're not you're not blowing quite air quite as fast typically.

472
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:21,790
Okay. All right. So but notice and you can see it's very close to being at one second.

473
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:25,990
And then the other thing that we pay attention to is this line.

474
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:33,910
It bottoms out there, but this line drops up pretty straight when you look at it this way.

475
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:39,129
Now, I'm not going to go into this, but to just let you know, this is this is showing everything.

476
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:46,900
So this is an inhalation. So for looking for lung disease, you're really not very interested in the inhalation.

477
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:51,219
But if you were worried about obstruction at the level of the larynx,

478
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:57,129
maybe you've got a vocal cord abnormalities where they are doing what they're supposed to

479
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:01,660
do and you're breathing so that you don't have a big as big an opening as you should.

480
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:09,610
It those kinds of problems you could see here, which is during the inhalation, before the exhalation.

481
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:16,360
But having said, I just wanted to point out that it's there, but I'm not going to actually spend any time talking about it,

482
00:56:17,170 --> 00:56:25,450
even though I have a family member that is actually dealing with that issue about the vocal cords not doing quite what they should be doing.

483
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:36,040
It's not like it's not a problem. It is it is a problem. But it's it's the way it's going to be treated or dealt with.

484
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:40,000
It is going to be different than things that are directly affecting their lung function.

485
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:49,300
Okay. So that's that's what a normal one looks like. And then now we want to look at someone who has obstructive disease.

486
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:58,299
And so we're going to first do the spirometry and then and then we're going to look at the lung volumes after that.

487
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:05,020
So this is the dynamic line. So so the things that are underlined here are what you expect to see in someone

488
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:12,340
that has obstructive lung disease expected to be one over FC to be decreased.

489
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:20,810
In other words, the percent. Of the air they're going to blow out during the first second.

490
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:25,910
It will not be as high as you would expect for someone to have wasn't having any problems.

491
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:32,320
Okay. So that so that's that's sort of for obstructive disease.

492
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:33,860
That's the first thing you look at.

493
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:44,030
It's also true that FTB one will be low and efficacy might be somewhat low, although you still expect the fraction to be lower than expected.

494
00:57:44,510 --> 00:57:48,920
But it can it can potentially be normal if the person can blow back enough.

495
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:54,500
Okay. So that's what you expect to see with spirometry, with doing it dynamically.

496
00:57:54,950 --> 00:58:01,890
And if you look at lung volumes, I already said this. You expect the RV divide by the TLC.

497
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:08,720
Remember, that's how much residual value and how much air is left in your lungs after you've blown out as much as you can.

498
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:13,910
Divide it by how much air is in your lungs. When you take the deepest we.

499
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:22,550
Right. And as I said before, you expect that to be increased because for all these obstructive lung diseases,

500
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,630
you always have more obstruction on exhalation inhalation.

501
00:58:26,630 --> 00:58:30,890
So you tend to build out more air and your lungs than is normal.

502
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:38,749
Okay. So here's a similar diagram of what we just saw.

503
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:44,239
Someone who is normal. Here's somebody with relatively mild obstruction, not terrible.

504
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,130
And what are some of the things you notice?

505
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:55,280
Well, you know, first of all, let's let's assume for the moment these two individuals are the same gender and the same height,

506
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:02,960
etc., etc., because, I mean, they probably did actually choose people that way for this flight to show this.

507
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:10,730
And so, first of all, not very surprisingly, the high heat flow is way lower, right?

508
00:59:11,090 --> 00:59:14,300
It's here. It's between four and five.

509
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:20,360
Whereas, you know, here's someone who doesn't have this problem at all and they are probably around ten or 11.

510
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:25,400
Okay. And so that's that's a big thing you pay attention to.

511
00:59:25,410 --> 00:59:35,719
And the other thing that's interesting about this is the way it changes this sort of scallop look is is typical of

512
00:59:35,720 --> 00:59:42,020
what you see when someone's having obstructive lung disease as opposed to something pretty close to a straight line.

513
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:47,750
So that's another thing you can look for and say is this is this look like obstructive lung disease?

514
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:55,220
And then over here you've got severe obstruction. So, of course, your peak flow is much lower and.

515
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:04,620
And the total amount of air you're able to go out is going to be probably going to be less.

516
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:10,910
Well, actually, it depends. But, you know, you know,

517
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:16,260
what you need to be able to say is to know that you're comparing it to what it

518
01:00:16,260 --> 01:00:22,410
looks like for a normal person to someone that's having obstructive lung disease.

519
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:27,930
You want to be able to say, you know, first thing is that their teeth doesn't get as high as you would expect.

520
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:32,340
And they also have this quick drop off as well.

521
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:42,280
Right. So then right into the diffusion capacity, it could be it could be normal.

522
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,270
I mean, it's awful. If it's bad, it's going to it's going to be lower.

523
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:52,410
But the things underlined are what you expect to see if you're claiming someone's having pure obstructive lung disease.

524
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,980
All right. That will make sense, I hope.

525
01:00:57,150 --> 01:01:00,360
Okay. And then here's restrictive lung disease.

526
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,700
What I mean by restrictive lung disease. Well, things like asbestosis or silicosis where you've got.

527
01:01:08,390 --> 01:01:11,840
Either damaging to the damage to the lungs.

528
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:18,410
That makes it hard for the lungs to expand the way they're supposed to and or just loss of lung tissue.

529
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:22,160
You know, you've got alveoli that have collapsed that aren't working.

530
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:29,750
Okay. And then here's the normal again. And here you see that you get looks much, much smaller.

531
01:01:29,900 --> 01:01:35,270
Of course, they they don't get nearly as high flow either for a different reason.

532
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:39,890
But you can see the total under the curve is much smaller.

533
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:49,370
You know, they're not the total volume that they can exhale with this maneuver is is considerably lower than what you expect.

534
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:58,640
And so here you are. If they have pure restrictive lung disease, you always expect the force spinal capacity to be decreased.

535
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:04,309
Remember when I say decreased, it's not measuring against the person, him or herself.

536
01:02:04,310 --> 01:02:12,500
It is looking at those tables that I was mentioning that were collected on

537
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:17,390
people that had no history of any adverse lung disease and had never smoked.

538
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:22,430
Right. So it's like what you expect to be normal.

539
01:02:22,490 --> 01:02:25,490
If there's no problem, it's what you're comparing it to. Okay.

540
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:31,070
So that effect is going to be lower than expected. Efficacy, one should be lower as well.

541
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:35,960
But if you're doing the ratio, it's going to be normal or sometimes even increased.

542
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:47,780
So rather than this ratio for the in the other case, which wasn't restricted, that was the problem with the obstruction of airflow.

543
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:55,790
This would be decreased. So here it's not. And for the lung volumes, you're going to see the total lung capacity,

544
01:02:55,790 --> 01:03:02,750
how much air the person can take in their his or her lungs is going to maximize the maximum amount they can.

545
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:11,330
It's definitely going to be down. The RB will be down and the ratio of it is down rather than up.

546
01:03:11,330 --> 01:03:15,320
Remember, it would have been up for someone with this pure obstructive disease.

547
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,520
Then the diffusion capacity is could be than normal.

548
01:03:19,910 --> 01:03:29,420
Okay. So having shown you always pretty pictures, here's a warning to you to a typical real life.

549
01:03:29,450 --> 01:03:37,280
You're doing a study stay in a facility where there's maybe there's some agent that actually is causing asthma or aggravating asthma.

550
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:42,559
And then you start wanting to look at all these individuals.

551
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,040
And do you know this kind of TFT.

552
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:57,749
Over a function testing with and usually the people that are the sickest they're having the most problems are going to be in that kind of situation.

553
01:03:57,750 --> 01:04:05,310
If the expert didn't write the script, the exposure is something that you would normally expect restrictive lung disease from,

554
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:10,200
like asbestos, for example, if they have it.

555
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:12,830
So that's what you expect.

556
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:22,020
But the people are going to be the sickest are usually the people that have that exposure and have been long term cigaret smokers.

557
01:04:22,710 --> 01:04:29,940
So so in that situation you usually don't get as pretty as obviously restrictive lung disease.

558
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:35,969
It's got to be that nothing else or on the other hand, that's got to be obstructive organisms.

559
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,110
It can't be anything else.

560
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:44,730
Usually the people are the sickest in real life, in a real life situation are the people that not only are having the problem for what's at work,

561
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:50,550
but they've been smoking cigarets for a long time and they already had obstructive lung disease for that.

562
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:54,240
So you get you can get a mix of obstructive and restrictive.

563
01:04:54,690 --> 01:05:04,350
I would never be nasty enough to give you a mix on a flight exam, by the way, that that would be unethical even asked for such a thing.

564
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:11,760
Okay. So we're uncovering obstruction.

565
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:19,020
We cover a lot of this. It's characteristic of asthma or emphysema and probably bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD.

566
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:24,629
And it's difficulty emptying all the air out of the lungs.

567
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:32,910
We've gone through that and there's X obstruction and we said of the exhaling much more than the inhaling.

568
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:40,140
And at the end of the full, full exhalation, there is more of the air left than normal,

569
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:43,890
which is another way of saying they're rated TLC level of the air.

570
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:51,900
And in general populations, smoking is by far the most common cause of obstructive changes.

571
01:05:52,290 --> 01:05:56,609
Now, having said that, I think it's I don't think it's in this one,

572
01:05:56,610 --> 01:06:02,579
but there's clear data saying that there's there can be various situations and

573
01:06:02,580 --> 01:06:09,150
exposures at work that are causing people to have a problem with pulmonary obstruction.

574
01:06:12,150 --> 01:06:17,880
Okay. And for restriction, this arises from reasons that are intrinsic to the lung.

575
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:22,420
Correct. And this is a fancy word for tissue.

576
01:06:22,530 --> 01:06:26,940
The main tissue of the organ that you want to know, that's okay.

577
01:06:27,330 --> 01:06:34,410
And that decreased compliance makes it hard to to to stand your lungs the way you're supposed to be able to.

578
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:38,280
So the lungs are stiff and restricted and expanded.

579
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:49,170
And typical thing that causes is some sort of fibrosis scarring that you can get with something like asbestosis, for example.

580
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:53,560
Okay. And right.

581
01:06:53,670 --> 01:07:03,960
So examples of where you expect to see this would be, as Mr. tells us, silicosis consists of sometimes the well of other things mixed in with talcum,

582
01:07:05,100 --> 01:07:15,989
but that's there's hard metal disease, hormonal diseases, people that are making tooltips out of metal.

583
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:23,260
And they have to be they have to be almost as. As hard as scrape proof is a diamond.

584
01:07:23,350 --> 01:07:31,900
Not quite, but that's about as close as you can get when you do that. You're using you're typically using a mixture that includes cobalt.

585
01:07:32,170 --> 01:07:37,840
And it's it's a little complicated, but it's probably mostly due to cobalt.

586
01:07:39,970 --> 01:07:45,850
Those individuals may develop a type of restrictive lung disease and.

587
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:53,970
We've seen a lot of us here in southeast Michigan historically because of the auto industry.

588
01:07:54,030 --> 01:08:00,000
And there's a lot of small places that are making tools to be used in the auto industry.

589
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:05,300
And these tools have to be very resistant, have been scraped.

590
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:10,100
Credit is scraped basically after.

591
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:19,470
Absolutely. Okay. So and then there's also chronic forms we haven't talked about yet of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.

592
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:27,240
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is a immune related disease of the lungs.

593
01:08:27,660 --> 01:08:31,590
Well, you're having problems with deep, deep lung tissue.

594
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:38,070
Not that the same problem you're seeing with asthma, which of course, also is a problem related problem.

595
01:08:39,500 --> 01:08:46,130
For the lungs. Okay. And that's not every single thing, but that's some of them.

596
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:51,500
That's those are the main places where you would see tend to see pulmonary restriction.

597
01:08:53,660 --> 01:08:58,969
Right. And I already told you this already warned you about what's at the bottom of this,

598
01:08:58,970 --> 01:09:03,020
which is if you have people who have also been tobacco smokers for years,

599
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:09,590
they probably won't have a beautiful, you know, perfect example of pulmonary restriction.

600
01:09:09,710 --> 01:09:14,330
They're probably going to have some obstruction or mixed, you know, elements of both.

601
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:20,710
And like I said, typically in real life, if you're doing this like a one plan,

602
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:26,739
the people who are going to be the sickest of the people that had the exposure and have been cigaret smokers.

603
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:31,710
So they'll have the worst problems. Okay.

604
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:36,520
So what's going on in occupational diseases?

605
01:09:37,030 --> 01:09:44,410
We call this chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and we include both chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

606
01:09:45,220 --> 01:09:51,820
And it used to be that people would try to say, is this more more like chronic bronchitis?

607
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:54,190
And this individual is a lot more like emphysema,

608
01:09:54,610 --> 01:10:00,610
but basically no one's doing anything or they're just putting them together in kind of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

609
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:06,010
Why is that? Because chronic bronchitis, you can define you define that.

610
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:13,860
You can measure that when the person's alive. No problem. You can. I think I have a definition coming out of a few questions.

611
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:20,140
Ask a panel to decide whether someone's having chronic bronchitis, emphysema.

612
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:27,820
You either have to do a biopsy, which you really don't want to do that with lungs because you've got all kinds of other issues about air,

613
01:10:28,810 --> 01:10:32,140
then getting in around the lung and not being able to inflate.

614
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:36,370
You don't go get on biopsy lungs unless you really need to do it.

615
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:40,150
Okay. But what I was going to say is that.

616
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:51,790
That you really can only diagnose emphysema reliably after a person is deceased at autopsy.

617
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:56,790
And so that's sort of why we think that's why we don't do it anymore.

618
01:10:56,800 --> 01:11:00,280
We just say it's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and don't spend a lot of

619
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:04,240
time worrying about is it more like chronic bronchitis or more like emphysema.

620
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:13,750
And the thing that's important here, which really there's some good studies that have shown us in the last ten,

621
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:24,760
maybe 15 years is that people can be at increased risk for this based on long term exposure to, quote unquote, inert us.

622
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:29,229
What I mean by inert does I mean they're in an environment that's dusty,

623
01:11:29,230 --> 01:11:37,570
but there's there's not supposed to be an agent in that dust that's known to cause or easily cause lung disease.

624
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,900
And this is based on a lot of studies that were done.

625
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:47,410
The argument made here is that if you just measure and you probably want to do measurements like, you know,

626
01:11:47,470 --> 01:11:52,959
PM 2.5 some, you're talking about the smaller things that are going to get deep as well as PM10.

627
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:59,680
But anyway, if you do, there's several studies now saying, hey, this dust is not supposed to be doing anything special.

628
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:03,700
It's got like iron and it doesn't have any other metals, etc., etc.

629
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:14,780
Is that supposed to do this? Okay, that. These days, people are actually at increased risk for developing COPD.

630
01:12:15,230 --> 01:12:21,020
And you know, if there are cigaret smokers to have aggregated and already exist.

631
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:28,640
Okay. And then there is in the allergic lung diseases where we've been talking about asthma and I already

632
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:34,550
mentioned hypersensitivity pneumonitis is the illogic that infecting the deep tissue of the lung.

633
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:39,860
And then there's cancers which we'll get we'll cover more as well.

634
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:47,360
Lung cancer, but also cancers, you know, throat, mouth, etc.

635
01:12:48,380 --> 01:12:59,060
And and then pneumoconiosis is just a big word for dust related diseases, which we if you remember.

636
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:04,490
So does related diseases is going to include things like silicosis and so on.

637
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:13,250
Okay. So that's some of the main. Things you may see with occupational pulmonary diseases.

638
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:17,120
This is probably not worth going into a lot.

639
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:22,010
This is a definition from the American Thoracic Society of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.

640
01:13:22,610 --> 01:13:26,930
It's not. I'm trying to read all this. You certainly don't have to memorize it.

641
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:31,970
You say this last phrase may be partially reversible.

642
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:45,300
So. They're saying, okay, you could have COPD and and it can it can reverse a fair amount, but that still doesn't make it asthma.

643
01:13:46,270 --> 01:13:49,580
That's that's you don't need to know this and that.

644
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:54,150
It's worth just knowing there is this long definition from their thoracic society.

645
01:13:55,050 --> 01:14:05,090
And I already mentioned this that emphysema said, you know something, you do a diagnosis and it's like autopsy and that.

646
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:09,270
And therefore we use COPD more generally and.

647
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:15,850
Okay. If this is this is saying that there's a lot of, you know,

648
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:23,010
COPD in patients with some reversible airways obstruction and many of their features look like asthma.

649
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:27,570
But they have even when they're at their best, they have some problems of obstruction.

650
01:14:29,910 --> 01:14:35,720
Okay. And then you should also be aware of the difference between chronic versus acute bronchitis.

651
01:14:35,730 --> 01:14:39,600
You know, acute bronchitis, probably many of us have experienced this.

652
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,690
Typically, it doesn't have to be a.

653
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:51,140
Usually it's bacterial, you know, and you have inflammation of some of the larger bronchi.

654
01:14:51,650 --> 01:14:57,620
And so it's acute, you know, passes versus chronic,

655
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:06,469
which is saying that you have this it may vary by what season you're in, but that you're having this all the time.

656
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:09,470
It's not being caused by necessarily by an infection.

657
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:13,630
And so what's the definition?

658
01:15:13,640 --> 01:15:16,880
So this is the definition that everybody uses all over the world now.

659
01:15:17,690 --> 01:15:25,700
So that there's consistency across different studies. So it's hyper secretion of mucus, phlegm and chronic productive cough.

660
01:15:26,390 --> 01:15:32,690
And both of those happening over these three months of the year for at least two consecutive years.

661
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:41,990
If somebody were to ask them these questions, if they if they had both the mucus and the cough,

662
01:15:42,530 --> 01:15:46,130
and that happens for three months out of a year or more.

663
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:53,120
You know, this in our in our case, typically being this time of year, people are most likely to have it, but not necessarily.

664
01:15:53,630 --> 01:16:03,350
And that it has been two consecutive years. So it wasn't just, you know, like maybe one outlying bacterial thing that wasn't recognized.

665
01:16:04,070 --> 01:16:06,680
And cigaret smoking, of course,

666
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:15,050
is a very common exposure that can also cause chronic bronchitis itself and obviously make it make other causes of it worse.

667
01:16:17,430 --> 01:16:20,729
Okay. So here's a definition emphysema. Memorize this.

668
01:16:20,730 --> 01:16:26,330
Either enlargement of gas exchange airways and destruction of alveolar walls and.

669
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:34,050
Well, and you also have loss of elasticity. So all these things interfere with what your lungs are supposed to be able to do,

670
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:40,440
and you lose you destroying alveoli so you have less gas exchange units,

671
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:47,820
meaning there is less ability to move oxygen out of the alveoli into the bloodstream.

672
01:16:48,390 --> 01:16:54,210
And so very frequently a person has emphysema while alive.

673
01:16:54,390 --> 01:17:02,730
It's going to have a proxy, a low arterial blood oxygen content lower than you would want or expect otherwise.

674
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:08,520
And you're short of breath because of that loss of gas exchange, surface and obstruction to airflow.

675
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:18,630
This is photos of slices through first the top and then blown up.

676
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:23,969
So this is somebody that had normal lungs. Obviously, this is that autopsy.

677
01:17:23,970 --> 01:17:27,990
Someone's died of something and had normal lungs. No problems like this.

678
01:17:27,990 --> 01:17:31,500
And this is somebody that had serious emphysema.

679
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,870
And you can just look, you know,

680
01:17:33,870 --> 01:17:42,180
all these little things are all those different alveoli that are supposed to be able to search for oxygen in the bloodstream.

681
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:47,370
And here you've got I think you can appreciate you've got a lot of destruction of the walls of alveoli.

682
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:51,360
So there just isn't as much surface area. To to push.

683
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:56,730
Push from that oxygen from the lungs into the blood.

684
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:07,070
Okay. And this is sort of a worthwhile it's it's about smoking, but it's.

685
01:18:08,870 --> 01:18:11,890
And obviously, smoking isn't caused by work.

686
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:16,910
But I think it's important to talk about for a minute. So this is the affected one in liters.

687
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:21,860
So remember, it's about usually people who have just had problems with smoking.

688
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:25,730
They usually have been obstructive pattern. Right.

689
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:29,930
So that's what you say you expect everything going to be down.

690
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:37,460
Okay. And so first of all, they show a non smoker here and you'll notice this isn't like a straight line.

691
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:44,360
Somebody my age is supposed to be losing their FEV1 faster than people your age.

692
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:58,099
But age I used to be. And and then and here is your most smokers say smoking 30 cigarets a day they have their lines lower but it's sort of,

693
01:18:58,100 --> 01:19:08,390
you know, in keeping with what's above it. But about roughly 10 to 15% of people that are smokers are much more susceptible to these effects.

694
01:19:08,750 --> 01:19:13,850
And for people like that, you can see that if they continue smoking,

695
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:22,970
they're likely to end up just in this case, just before age 65, dyspnea on activities of daily living.

696
01:19:22,970 --> 01:19:29,570
What does that mean? That's me having difficulty breathing for doing things like leaning over to tie your shoes or,

697
01:19:29,870 --> 01:19:35,389
I don't know, taking, taking up so a carton of milk and walking in the next room with it.

698
01:19:35,390 --> 01:19:40,040
So you're talking about things that really interfere with your normal life.

699
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:45,740
Right. And so what the other thing this is trying to show is that even if you're in

700
01:19:45,740 --> 01:19:49,310
this group that's been losing this function and you've been a heavy smoker,

701
01:19:49,700 --> 01:20:00,148
if you actually stop, if you're capable of doing it, you may suddenly have, you know, an extra 15 years of when you don't have that level of.
