1
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:14,890
One of the really exciting parts about our course is the opportunity to apply the different

2
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:19,480
competencies and ideas that you're going to be learning about to a real world example.

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:28,480
So to help us with that, throughout the rest of our time, we're going to be connecting with Chaz Community Health and Social Services,

4
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,620
a federally qualified health center here in southwest Detroit.

5
00:00:32,860 --> 00:00:36,909
And what's really exciting about this partnership is that we're going to be able

6
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,460
to explore some of the different concepts related to the health care system,

7
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:52,210
budgeting and finance negotiation and human resources and advocacy directly to the work and the operations of Chaz.

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,010
And to help us do that.

9
00:00:54,040 --> 00:01:03,520
I've invited Dr. Felix Volpe Wehner, the chief executive officer of Chaz, to really help us dig in and think more about some of these different areas,

10
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,250
how Chaz is interfacing in the community and all of the different services that Chaz offers,

11
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:16,390
including taking us on a behind the scenes tour of everything that Chaz has to offer here in southwest Detroit.

12
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,580
So with that, I want to turn it over to Dr. Bob when I first of all, thank you.

13
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:26,799
Dr. Vogt. Thank you so much for being here today. It's a great, great honor to have you here.

14
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,000
And we're looking forward to learning more. Right.

15
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:36,460
So the first question I have for you really is if you think about Chaz and what it offers here at the highest level,

16
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:39,640
it's a federally qualified health center, but it does so much more.

17
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:44,050
Maybe you can share with us a little bit more about what Chaz is offering and how it's structured.

18
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:48,340
Okay. So the Chaz is now going to be celebrating 50 years of existence next year.

19
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:51,730
And as you mentioned, it's and I've seen a federally qualified health center,

20
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,500
and that means that we're providing services to anybody that comes through the door.

21
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,110
It's a very comprehensive set of services. So not just medical services.

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,880
Centers such as Chaz are located in high need areas, whether they're urban or rural.

23
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:12,790
And the most important factor is that the board of directors has to have a membership of at least 51% of users of the center.

24
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,129
That's how you get enough UHC to really provide the services that the community needs because you

25
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:22,000
have community members on the board of directors helping make decisions about what's offered.

26
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,929
There are centers like Chaz across the country.

27
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:30,070
There's about 1200 institutions with 12,000 delivery sites.

28
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:37,540
So we're taking care nationally of about 29 million people in the state of Michigan, about 700,000 and a Chaz.

29
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:45,670
Last year, we took care of 10,000 on duplicated users. So we're providing services that have been the pillar of health care for the community.

30
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:52,270
And the goal is to improve the overall wellness of individuals so they have a good quality of life that they can they can work,

31
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:56,320
they can go to school and meet their goals in life.

32
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:08,500
So if you think about then what Chaz is really offering in terms of what distinguishes it from other health care organizations or or facilities.

33
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:13,870
Chaz is not just about medical care. As you're as you're explaining, it's so much more correct.

34
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:17,110
And what what what would you say is sort of the defining characteristic?

35
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:22,299
The fact that we're we provide comprehensive health and wellness services doesn't include just the medical services.

36
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,180
It includes dental. So we have to dentist and dental hygienist.

37
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:32,050
We have an in-house pharmacy that we get special pricing on medications so that patients have access to the drug.

38
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,590
If we prescribe something that they don't have access to, it's not going to work.

39
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:43,600
We have the Wik program, the Women and Infant Children Program that provides assistance to pregnant women, food related as well as children.

40
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:52,450
Up to the age of five, we have integrated behavioral health because of the focus on behavioral and mental health, including the opioid epidemic.

41
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:59,980
We have integrated the services that we provide from that standpoint right into the medical area.

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,110
So we have licensed clinical social workers that are available right there in the medical area

43
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:10,570
to receive what we call a warm handoff and be able to interact with patients immediately.

44
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:18,610
So somebody who an example of a patient who's diabetic, who's not really well controlled and they keep coming back and still not well-controlled.

45
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:26,080
We have the ability to have behavioral health workers see them and maybe diagnose that hidden depression that,

46
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:29,650
you know, is really impacting their ability to care for themselves.

47
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:37,569
The medication assisted treatment program for the opioid epidemic, we're now providing Suboxone prescriptions and the whole process,

48
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:46,210
not just the drug, but the whole process that's involved in helping individuals with the opioid addiction or abuse.

49
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,840
And we have a domestic violence project called La Vida.

50
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:56,260
So domestic violence or intimate partner violence is affecting every community in the country.

51
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:02,590
And we have a system program within Chaz that's connected with the police department, with the courts.

52
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:08,530
We have a lawyer on staff, the shelters to provide families that are that are, you know, going through that difficult time with the.

53
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,640
Resources that they need to get through that.

54
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,370
We have a cooking demonstration kitchen where providing nutrition, education, chronic illness, education.

55
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:22,340
We have Zumba classes. We're working on integrating physical therapy here at the center.

56
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:26,090
Um, massage, yoga.

57
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,430
We have a fresh fruit and vegetable market that is here on Thursdays during

58
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,880
the warm months and in the winter because it's right up front in the plaza.

59
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:43,460
So always looking at how can we add services and expand services that are going to impact the wellness of the community.

60
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,680
Wow. What a wide range of services. That's that's pretty exciting, I would imagine.

61
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,970
Has Chaz grown over the years? I mean, is it expanded its portfolio?

62
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:01,630
Most definitely. Chaz started in 1970 working out of a mobile home trailer as well, baby visit center.

63
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:13,250
And grew from that into providing primary care and became an advocate see actually in 1993 and moved into a used car dealership

64
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:19,640
that was right next door to this building and continued to expand all the different services to add what we're doing today,

65
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:27,050
including that I forgot to mention our community health worker program. So community health workers serve in many different capacities,

66
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:32,510
and that would include here outreach and enrollment workers that are helping uninsured

67
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:37,850
patients navigate the very complicated insurance system to see what they qualify for,

68
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:44,240
get them on a program, as well as community health workers that are engaging with patients that have a chronic illness.

69
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:54,020
In between their visits with us, they do home visits, they do nutrition education classes, and they're reaching out to them weekly if needed,

70
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,130
to make sure that the care plan that we've set when they were in to see the

71
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:05,179
medical provider is being met and really impacts the improvement in overall

72
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,290
health because studies are showing that in the exam room and it's sometimes a

73
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,170
little depressing for me after so many years of school to become a doctor,

74
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:21,470
a family doctor, that if I do my best work on any given day, the most that I will impact the overall health and wellness of a patient is 20%.

75
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:31,100
The other 80% are those social determinants or social drivers of health that that have a much larger impact on the overall health and wellness.

76
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,839
And that's why we focus on all of those different services that are working to

77
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,330
help minimize and deal with those social determinants or drivers of health.

78
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,980
Well, that to me is a good way of really framing how Chaz is at the at the at the real intersection

79
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:55,579
between the health care system or the medical care delivery system and the public health system.

80
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:01,069
And really the the union between the two and how they go hand in hand,

81
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:07,610
because I think a lot of the time we think about the health care system as just being its own umbrella.

82
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:11,990
But really, all of these different drivers are a big, big factor.

83
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:19,280
A huge factor. It's it's it's very much, I think, an important part of understanding this is, is that intersection.

84
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:28,010
So that's helpful. And I think the the the real piece that for me that that we want to make sure that we're understanding is,

85
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:34,580
is how Chaz is really interfacing with the health care system.

86
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,700
So you're mentioning different services that are being provided.

87
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,430
But when we think about the health care system as a whole, what beyond just being a federally qualified health center,

88
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,300
and maybe you can expand a little bit about what that means in terms of how you fit in.

89
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:52,790
Sure. But what aspects of the health care system does Chaz directly interface with related

90
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:59,089
to maybe insurance or payment or providers perhaps expand on some insurance?

91
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:07,489
So a few unique things. Because of the fact that we're a federally qualified health center, we receive something called prospective payments.

92
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:17,120
The PIPS, we call it that is a reimbursement for visits with Medicaid patients that allows us that nobody else

93
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,280
gets in the primary care space to receive extra funding for the patients we're taking care of.

94
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:31,819
And that allows us to spend in that social drivers or determinants space that

95
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:36,470
insurance companies aren't reimbursing us for solo transportation interpretation.

96
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,650
A lot of that outreach to all the community health workers,

97
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:44,990
the significant positive impact that they're having is still not reimbursed by the insurance companies.

98
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:51,860
So an equity gets a prospective payment to help offset the investment that we make and all of

99
00:09:51,860 --> 00:10:00,080
these services that the insurances do not reimburse because we're a family medicine medical unit,

100
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:07,160
we provide comprehensive services. We see children from two days old to adults that are over a hundred years old.

101
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,230
Everything between. We have about 700 pregnant moms that come through here every year.

102
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:17,140
And then for services that are out of our scope of practice, we partner primarily with the Henry Ford health system.

103
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:25,330
So they have all of the specialty care services, cardiology, endocrinology, gastroenterology, all everything that's out of our scope.

104
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:31,180
They provide radiology services for us as well as some of the lab.

105
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:37,330
So we do some point of care lab testing, but labs that we don't do onsite get drawn and go to Henry Ford.

106
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:43,180
So with Henry Ford, we're able to provide from a medical standpoint,

107
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:49,780
all of the comprehensive care that is required for patients and then all the other support,

108
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:55,329
you know, we're able to fund through our reimbursement, through the different insurances.

109
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:58,390
There's eight qualified Medicaid health plans in the state.

110
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,450
We're currently contracted with seven. We're working on the eighth.

111
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:10,810
And so that allows us to see if patients qualify through our outreach and enrollment department, get them into the Medicaid space,

112
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:18,820
and are able to provide the the medical care under that Medicaid umbrella for those that don't qualify.

113
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:29,410
We have almost 50% of our patients are uninsured is why we received the 330 funding from her son, which is about 30% of our $11 million budget.

114
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:35,860
And just to clarify, is the Health Resources Services Administration and just to just to explain to those

115
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,309
who are listening here what what where do they fit into the health care system?

116
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:46,360
So her site provides the care that the federal government funds.

117
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,130
So everything in the health care space under the Department of Health and Human Services,

118
00:11:51,910 --> 00:12:00,580
Herzog manages the budget that is used for all the different health care initiatives going on in the country.

119
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,360
And under her size, the Bureau of Primary Health Care, which is another unit.

120
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:07,570
And that is how the funding actually gets to us.

121
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:12,850
Through that, the Public Service Act 330 is the number, and so we call it our 330 grant.

122
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:22,570
We receive the UHC dollars for RFQ, which is currently if you add all of the funding, it's over $5 billion nationally.

123
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,670
So it's a significant program.

124
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:35,460
It is a program that is making a difference from a primary care standpoint and actually serves for a model for primary care for the nation.

125
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:46,050
You know, 29 million people are receiving care through which approximately 24% of Medicare dollars being saved by going to an affiliate,

126
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:50,290
see for care for Medicaid patients as opposed to going to a private physician.

127
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:59,620
So in terms of the medical care system, then interfacing with the public health principles or the public health domains,

128
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:04,780
where do you see charts fitting into public health versus maybe delivery of care?

129
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:13,569
So chance and ethics are, I think, at the forefront of the public health system because of the fact that we want to care for 29 million people.

130
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:20,830
And too, because we are looking at a population as a whole.

131
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:24,700
We're not we're looking at an individual when they're here, you know, in the exam room.

132
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:31,930
But we are being graded, we're being reimbursed, and we're being incentivized on population health measures.

133
00:13:31,930 --> 00:13:35,919
So how are we doing with all the diabetic patients? How are we doing with all the hypertensive patients?

134
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,450
How are we doing in making sure that kids are getting all the required immunizations to keep them healthy?

135
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:44,950
The federal government is actually grading us on 13 different measures that are clinical.

136
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:50,050
And that's over and above what the insurance companies are looking at from what they call the highest measures.

137
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,850
I don't remember that acronym offhand,

138
00:13:52,110 --> 00:14:00,670
but they're basically benchmarks that they're setting for them to know that we are taking the best care that we can of their patients.

139
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:10,840
The public health system relies and interacts with us at many different levels, including what I've mentioned.

140
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:14,079
We also have relationships with the CDC, the Center for Disease Control,

141
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:21,070
that are providing a lot of programs that are helping us improve the quality of all the care that we provide.

142
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:25,809
I think that's a really good way of framing it because at at the end of the day,

143
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:33,549
really what we're trying to do in terms of reform inside of the health care system is move from this model of fee for service over to this

144
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:43,540
newer model of value based payment and really looking at how to how to drive a higher quality delivery through an evaluation of value.

145
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:52,030
Right. And so I think what it sounds like Chaz is really doing here is acting in terms of its ability to deliver care,

146
00:14:52,240 --> 00:15:02,730
but also being sensitive to the population health impacts and how things work track, which to me speaks very much to Jazz's unique offering.

147
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:07,960
Right. And I can tell you now that you're talking about value based payment at the state level 29.

148
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,210
Of the 38 earthquakes have gotten together.

149
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:19,580
We are part of an entity called the Michigan Community Health Network, and we have started value based contracting.

150
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:26,450
So one of two. Currently two of our qualified health plans through Medicaid have contracts with us as a whole,

151
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:36,290
and we've already started receiving incentive payments based on keeping their members that are diabetic,

152
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:47,359
healthy, that are controlled, that they're hypertensive, controlled, and a few other key focus measures that they they are grading side.

153
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,720
And so we've we've started that move. It's a long haul.

154
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,110
We've been doing things a fee for service for many, many years.

155
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,209
But we have some examples across the country and Michigan is at the forefront of that in that period.

156
00:15:59,210 --> 00:15:59,690
C space.
