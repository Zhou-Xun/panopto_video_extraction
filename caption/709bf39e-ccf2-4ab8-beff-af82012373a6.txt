00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:21,490
The greatest increases in human health in all of history have occurred over the past 150 years.

2
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:25,570
Even though human beings have been in existence for thousands of years.

3
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,430
Life expectancy remained the same until the beginning of the 20th century.

4
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:37,210
Public health has played a key role in improving the health and well-being of people around the world.

5
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,250
Let's take a look at some of the important historical moments in public health.

6
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,060
Public health is not a new idea.

7
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:56,540
Prehistoric humans learned how to avoid disease even before there was a concern for public health in some of the earliest human history.

8
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:05,990
There's evidence that people learn to defecate downstream from communal areas and similarly buried the deceased away from where people were living.

9
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:12,890
For many centuries, the notion of personal responsibility for ill health was a pervasive concept.

10
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:19,580
Disease was often considered something that a person contracted because they were somehow deserving.

11
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:26,630
But during the Renaissance and the Age of Enlightenment, a new theory of understanding disease was evolving.

12
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:34,970
This was the first time in history when there was an emphasis on scientific explanations and not just mystical beliefs.

13
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:44,680
Malaria or bad air in Italian was one of the first diseases whose cause was viewed

14
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,450
to be something related to the environment as opposed to a punishment for sin.

15
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:57,190
Lepers were considered unclean and therefore were excluded from society in leprosy colonies.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:04,960
But while there was an understanding that disease was communicable, there was still no explanation for how disease spread.

17
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:15,030
The 14th century plague known as the Black Death, brought humanity to the brink of extinction,

18
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:20,490
reducing the world's population by a fifth, spreading through trade routes.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,080
The plague killed nearly one half of Europe's population, and it took over 100 years to recover.

20
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,280
The spread of disease was not just limited to the European continent.

21
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,770
Travelers along inter-continental trade routes carried disease across the ocean.

22
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,830
Early European explorers coming to North America brought smallpox with them.

23
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:57,110
Little known is the fact that smallpox killed many more Native Americans than did conflict with the European settlers.
