1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,470
Ananda Sen: Not to be.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:07,440
Joshua Bosman: Sorry yeah.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,269
Ananda Sen: So.

4
00:00:09,269 --> 00:00:16,109
Ananda Sen: Look at the p value, so this will be the first.

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:35,100
Ananda Sen: First, set where where the p values are given there and the estimates are given there, so the next one, I did was Prague gen mode now again for proper gen mind the estimator entirely different so the intercept is minus 2.2432 it's minus 1.48 to nine here.

6
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:53,190
Ananda Sen: The small one, is minus 0.47750 minus 0.2387 prior frack is point 4461 for logistic but point 89224 gen mode so it's it's a it's really all different, but if you look at the p values.

7
00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:04,050
Ananda Sen: they're the same point 2964 smoke that's exactly the same as the logistic one pride frak is point or one, and so on and so forth.

8
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:13,500
Ananda Sen: So yes, numerically the parameter estimates become different but it's it's the same P values the same significance essentially all it's saying is that the.

9
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:24,480
Ananda Sen: Or what what is the p value be better basically says, whether that variable is significant or not, whether the variable should be the model or not and that's what it's testing.

10
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:31,200
Ananda Sen: Now, if you added for an equal to glm.

11
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:40,950
Ananda Sen: Improper logistic that's it then you'll get back the original estimates and so now in proper logistical said, this is running properly stick.

12
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:57,570
Ananda Sen: And i'm using that that option from equal to glm and the moment they use that, then you get back all those estimates from Jen model got minus 0.47754 smoke minus point 47754 smoke.

13
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:03,510
Ananda Sen: than 0.89224 0.9224 songs.

14
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,780
Ananda Sen: So that's the trick, this is the trick.

15
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:19,950
Ananda Sen: In proper logistic you can you can do pyramidal the glm and then it will match now you could do another thing you could do potentially.

16
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:29,400
Ananda Sen: Here it's probably just stick, if you want it to match the gentleman to match this match this is these estimates.

17
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,680
Ananda Sen: Then all you have to do is in Prague Jim Marty would separate comical to effect.

18
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:50,340
Ananda Sen: And then, then it will it will match up but I well, as I said, I would, I would suggest, using the the glm formulation just because it's much easier to interpret.

19
00:02:50,340 --> 00:03:12,390
Ananda Sen: The don't make sense any question about it.

20
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:16,950
Ananda Sen: Let me.

21
00:03:16,950 --> 00:04:24,510
Ananda Sen: Go to.

22
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:28,710
Ananda Sen: Okay, so let's this left three and.

23
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,430
Ananda Sen: Make sure that I have the data.

24
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:43,710
Read.

25
00:04:43,710 --> 00:05:03,510
So this is what I was doing the core.

26
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,080
Ananda Sen: These are all wrong, so let me.

27
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:14,310
Get rid of those.

28
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:36,420
Ananda Sen: Let me read on this vehicle to one.

29
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,970
Ananda Sen: legit.

30
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,850
And then.

31
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,360
I go to.

32
00:05:45,360 --> 00:06:06,150
Ananda Sen: Class variable.

33
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:22,470
Ananda Sen: should be good.

34
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:27,870
Ananda Sen: So one thing I want to point out is that you should be looking at the entire.

35
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:35,190
Ananda Sen: And their output and and a couple of things to note for is for example.

36
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:47,250
Ananda Sen: It gives you some information, for example, it says that how many actually in your data set has fractures as hundred and 25 03 75.

37
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,490
Ananda Sen: and

38
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,590
Ananda Sen: It does also.

39
00:06:52,590 --> 00:07:07,980
Ananda Sen: Sure, what are the values the very variable steak and it also says problem gentleman is modeling the property that tracks equal to one if we did not use that that statement event equal to one.

40
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,610
Ananda Sen: Wait a minute I didn't share the screen.

41
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,790
Ananda Sen: should have saved that.

42
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:16,830
right there you go.

43
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:19,170
Ananda Sen: Can you see it now.

44
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,550
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: yeah yes.

45
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:33,000
Ananda Sen: Alright, so sorry about that, so what I did was I ran this code prop Jim Monday gonna blow and so it's basically what you see on the.

46
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:43,920
Ananda Sen: On the lab the same same one so definitely the first model of fractal identical to one so i'm actually modeling one and then.

47
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:48,240
Ananda Sen: For results I, this is what I get so.

48
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:59,430
Ananda Sen: So it does show you the class level information and the response profile is not something you pay much attention to, but you will.

49
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:10,410
Ananda Sen: You will see something like you know.

50
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:17,910
Ananda Sen: The values are one and 02 hundred and 25 have fractures 375 but not out of factors, and then a whole bunch of.

51
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:32,340
Ananda Sen: Ai CBC but if you're not competing with anything else, then you should not be looking it does, by the way, provide the log likelihood also so a lot of things come a lot of things are part of the.

52
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,830
Ananda Sen: output now.

53
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,510
Ananda Sen: So this is, this is what it is so so let's.

54
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:52,830
Ananda Sen: Try to interpret here.

55
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,460
Ananda Sen: let's try to interpret here.

56
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:00,090
Ananda Sen: The smoking variable for example.

57
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:26,580
Ananda Sen: What does that mean actually you know what let's do let's do the logistic one, because by doing the logistic I do get the odds ratios, which is, which is a nice feature, I can to get the odds ratios here, I have to work extra hard, so I will copy this based this make it logistic.

58
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,200
Ananda Sen: And I will also say.

59
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,220
Ananda Sen: From equal to glm.

60
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,650
So.

61
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:45,000
Ananda Sen: And I don't need any of these.

62
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,890
So.

63
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,250
Ananda Sen: This will give you the odds ratio that's why it's.

64
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:56,340
Ananda Sen: Useful the same model but we'll keep the dots.

65
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:01,650
Ananda Sen: Okay that's much better all right.

66
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,130
Ananda Sen: So.

67
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:09,930
Ananda Sen: 0.633 is the odds ratio for smoking.

68
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,150
Ananda Sen: Can somebody.

69
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:17,490
Ananda Sen: tell me what that means.

70
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:29,940
Ananda Sen: A full interpretation of that.

71
00:10:29,940 --> 00:11:14,880
Ananda Sen: Remember the outcome here is fracture future fracture in the next one year.

72
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:48,000
Ananda Sen: What does the point estimate point 633 being.

73
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:54,120
Ananda Sen: Nobody.

74
00:11:54,120 --> 00:12:00,600
Ananda Sen: talked about this multiple Times yesterday so.

75
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:09,150
Ananda Sen: Today, we will do something which will have slightly different meaning.

76
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:29,010
Ananda Sen: But this is logistic regression still.

77
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,090
Marcelo Galafassi: I might be confusing with my morning class too.

78
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:37,770
Marcelo Galafassi: But isn't a below one a protective or.

79
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,020
Marcelo Galafassi: yeah okay.

80
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,670
Ananda Sen: Well it's below one.

81
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:45,360
Ananda Sen: Is a protective you look at the confidence look at the content Center.

82
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,400
know.

83
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:47,820
Marcelo Galafassi: above.

84
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,600
Marcelo Galafassi: yeah right.

85
00:12:48,600 --> 00:13:08,190
Ananda Sen: yeah it's it's a peep the p value is point 3062 so it's not significant you would never says predictive because it's it's it's it's very, very insignificant but i'm asking you to interpret the numerical meaning of point 633 in this case, what does it mean.

86
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:25,050
Ananda Sen: Anybody.

87
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:38,340
Ananda Sen: If you are reporting this to your group, your colleague, and you ran a logistic regression and you found this odds ratio estimate what would you say.

88
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:46,500
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: would never be something like and I don't know what all these variables are but it's like when everything else is.

89
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:55,890
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: has not occurred so like if they haven't got a prior fracture if they didn't have mom frack don't know what that is pharmacist.

90
00:13:55,890 --> 00:14:13,680
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: If they didn't have those things they were all zero, then the odds of getting a fracture if they were a smoker are whatever 63 and you were just talking about the positive or negative, but it's not significant so you can't interpret it like that.

91
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,730
Ananda Sen: Right right um.

92
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:22,020
Ananda Sen: What what What if.

93
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,180
Ananda Sen: What if.

94
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:32,490
Ananda Sen: you compare or you want to say something about somebody who had a pride fracture somebody who had.

95
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:37,560
Ananda Sen: mom mom mom frank was actually one of them, whether there's a family history of fractured.

96
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,400
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Oh got it got it.

97
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,640
Ananda Sen: Okay, and arm assistance if I were getting up from the Chair Do I need my arms to.

98
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,040
Oh.

99
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,530
Ananda Sen: Yes, So yes, yes, yes.

100
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:55,380
Ananda Sen: So these are all little one zero variables.

101
00:14:55,380 --> 00:15:00,390
Ananda Sen: But is it only valid for.

102
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:14,490
Ananda Sen: The zeros What about the ones.

103
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:24,420
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Would you compare it to the one and say, this is the value for the zero compared to the value of if they were doing it or.

104
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:38,970
Ananda Sen: So multiple regression means you can only interpret that particular coefficient one coefficient when everything else else is held, constant, what is it held constant.

105
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,570
Ananda Sen: That means.

106
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:48,570
Ananda Sen: If you have somebody who needs our assistance.

107
00:15:48,570 --> 00:16:00,780
Ananda Sen: And didn't have a mother who had fractured history, but he or she had a proud fracture history so practical to one mom for equal to zero.

108
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:04,110
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Are mystical the one.

109
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:17,490
Ananda Sen: That person, if you are going to talk about smoking only that person can only be compared to another person who had a perfect equal to one mantra equal to zero, and our mystical the one, in other words.

110
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:31,290
Ananda Sen: Smoking one vs zero is comparing to people who are smoker versus non smoker, but you can only compare them if all the other variables are kept constant it doesn't have to be zero.

111
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:46,950
Ananda Sen: But get constant that means what that means, if you and I are compared, we have to match on prior month pregnant pharmacist, that is only when you can you can compare to people.

112
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,850
Ananda Sen: Based on their smoking status.

113
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,920
Ananda Sen: That makes sense.

114
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:08,220
Ananda Sen: If you do not ask me questions I I think i'm going to assume that your understanding it fully but i'm not hearing.

115
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:25,410
Ananda Sen: We are response to it so i'm I have a feeling that there are things which are still confusing and I don't necessarily have to I can actually completely skipped tomorrow's lecture sets and and talk about all of these things again and again and make sure that you understand so.

116
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:31,380
Ananda Sen: If that is that is needed, I don't know if there's that is needed, but it's i'm just seeing that as possible.

117
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:46,590
Christie Flanagan: i'll be i'll speak up and say that i'm doing the homework assignments are having them, so I can play around with these things prior to lecture is actually really helpful for me, because then I can come with questions and now i'm just trying to absorb the information.

118
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,670
Christie Flanagan: When you're.

119
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:54,810
Christie Flanagan: So it's more so when i'm doing the hands on stuff myself that I come up with questions and then I have lots of questions for you.

120
00:17:54,810 --> 00:18:01,560
Ananda Sen: After class yeah I understand that and I think that's why I was trying to encourage people to do the homework.

121
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:08,430
Ananda Sen: I can grade them, I told you, I can grab them there's there is no issues with that you're not going to be graded for the course for that, but.

122
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:15,990
Ananda Sen: But I will tell you i'll tell everybody, I mean I there are there are six people in the class seven people in the class all should do the homework.

123
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:26,160
Ananda Sen: Because without doing the homework, you have no idea of what i'm going to talk, I can tell you I can I can go through the entire course in in today in half an hour.

124
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:38,610
Ananda Sen: But that doesn't help so, especially if you're going to use this for your work, I mean if you think that you're going to use some bias mystical thing, especially logistic regression or.

125
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,260
Ananda Sen: or linear regression or counter aggression, for that matter.

126
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:49,620
Ananda Sen: So I think what Christie says this is absolutely right, you should be doing the homework.

127
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,800
Ananda Sen: If you want me to great I can read.

128
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,060
Ananda Sen: that's i'll be.

129
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,620
Ananda Sen: willing to help you and make you understand, five days is not enough.

130
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,460
Ananda Sen: And you were doing probably other things anyway.

131
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,960
So.

132
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:21,780
Ananda Sen: Because this is very basic This is something which almost could be a prerequisite for this course that interpreting a multiple regression coefficient multiple regression coefficients that always like.

133
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:24,420
Ananda Sen: You.

134
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:30,150
Ananda Sen: interpret that as a difference holding everything else is as constant.

135
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:32,370
Ananda Sen: So.

136
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:44,520
Ananda Sen: So in this case bride frank one versus zero mom for one versus the other arm, this is one way to do it whatever they are whatever those competitions, they are.

137
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:52,440
Ananda Sen: You would say that holding the status for prior fragment reckon armistice to be constant.

138
00:19:52,440 --> 00:20:05,820
Ananda Sen: The smoking person has a 37 points are 36.7% lower odds than a non smoking person.

139
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,920
Ananda Sen: To have.

140
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,230
Ananda Sen: A future fracture.

141
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:17,910
Ananda Sen: I mean strange but, but in this data set that's how it is.

142
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:20,130
Ananda Sen: Again it's.

143
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:26,580
Ananda Sen: keeping track mom fracking armistice constant.

144
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:39,330
Ananda Sen: A smoking person has a 37 point 36.7% less fewer odds or lower odds and a nonsmoker.

145
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:46,620
Ananda Sen: To have a future fracture does that make sense that's a full statement.

146
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:51,840
Yoonhee Ryder: Would you say 37% lower law God, since this is a.

147
00:20:51,840 --> 00:21:01,380
Ananda Sen: No it's 37% 37% lower or see this is odds ratio estimates, this is law god's this is oh OK.

148
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:03,960
Yoonhee Ryder: OK.

149
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:13,440
Ananda Sen: So I did logistic because this is this gives me the odds ratio right.

150
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,930
Ananda Sen: Okay now.

151
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:21,600
Ananda Sen: See the ones which are less than one are.

152
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,570
Ananda Sen: slightly.

153
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:38,580
Ananda Sen: Slightly harder to explain, because you have to in your head, you will have to do this hundred percent minus point 60 or one minus point 63 the ones which are more than one are easier to explain so, for example.

154
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:47,010
Ananda Sen: If you're trying to interpret that coefficient pride frack 2.635, how will you.

155
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:53,430
Ananda Sen: How will.

156
00:21:53,430 --> 00:22:01,980
Marcelo Galafassi: You say Costa, the first two and a half 2.6 times more likely to to have the result.

157
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:09,990
Ananda Sen: Right and that's that's an accepted accepted way of saying this, except I don't.

158
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:13,260
Ananda Sen: I think, seeing likely is wrong.

159
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,790
Ananda Sen: When i'm i'm a reviewer for for a paper I usually.

160
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:31,320
Ananda Sen: indicate that you should not be saying likely for odds odds are not the same as likely, so I would say, higher outs to point 65 hires or you could also say it's what.

161
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,760
Ananda Sen: hundred and 63.5% higher.

162
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,220
Ananda Sen: Because you're subtracting that subtracting one from that.

163
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:54,630
Ananda Sen: But when the status of everything else is kept constant it doesn't matter whether it's one or zero but seek one vs zero means you're comparing two people.

164
00:22:54,630 --> 00:23:12,510
Ananda Sen: Those two people have to have something common and have to have something different, they all have the smoking they both have the smoking status mom fracking arm assist the same the pride frack has to be different okay.

165
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:16,680
All right.

166
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:20,340
Ananda Sen: So it understood.

167
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:29,610
Ananda Sen: I want to do one additional thing before before we finish this off and move to the next.

168
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:51,450
word to go.

169
00:23:51,450 --> 00:24:08,880
Ananda Sen: Alright, I want to do something here, and this is something I want to do this because, even if you don't fully understand what's going on, I want to show you the gym on actually does something which is interesting Okay, so this is the prop gentleman.

170
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:13,080
Ananda Sen: For.

171
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:36,000
Ananda Sen: The same same model, and one thing i'm going to do is to change, you see it had link equal the logic so i'll send you the link equal to law.

172
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:47,640
Ananda Sen: Then running.

173
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,040
Ananda Sen: The numbers changed.

174
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,480
Ananda Sen: Okay.

175
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,180
Ananda Sen: The smoke number is minus point 2778 now.

176
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,830
Ananda Sen: I.

177
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,780
Ananda Sen: I cannot do.

178
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:18,000
Ananda Sen: I cannot do this in logistic regression that's why I couldn't do it there, but what does it mean to have link equal to log what How does it change things so.

179
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:29,700
Ananda Sen: let's first start to understand these numbers so let's do let's look at the prior frank 1.6411.

180
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:41,640
Ananda Sen: Can somebody give me the exponential rated version of that what is the exponential of point 6411.

181
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,380
Ananda Sen: Can somebody tell me that.

182
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,980
Ananda Sen: By the way, did you know that Google is a calculator.

183
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:57,780
Ananda Sen: If you just go to Google and just do exponential point 6411, you will get the answer.

184
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:16,170
Ananda Sen: The most of you know that product.

185
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:18,450
Ananda Sen: it's 1.9 1.9.

186
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,220
fantastic.

187
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,440
Ananda Sen: Okay.

188
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:40,680
Ananda Sen: So it's 1.9 here and in the previous one, we got what is a problem with this one is it doesn't give you the whole thing at the same time, it just hides the previous one, so here I when I ran it before.

189
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:53,370
Ananda Sen: I got in proper logistic a God and odds ratio of.

190
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:59,310
Ananda Sen: 2.635, so this is 1.9 and I got 2.635 so let's.

191
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:12,960
Ananda Sen: let's go back to that quote again.

192
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:26,460
Ananda Sen: So this is love odds are log of something and it's a point 6411 and if you exponentially get 1.9 what is that 1.9 what does it, how do you interpret that.

193
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:43,830
Ananda Sen: And this is where link equal to log plays a role so marcella you just mentioned about the fact that the two point 65 you're going to explain that as it's two point 65 more likely no it's actually 1.9 times more likely.

194
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:57,690
Ananda Sen: That 1.9 is because of change, the link the whole thing now becomes what is called not law gods or odds ratio it's actually called.

195
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:05,220
Ananda Sen: risk ratio.

196
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,770
Ananda Sen: risk ratio.

197
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:18,480
Ananda Sen: So if you change the link from link equal the logic to link equal to log, then you get risk ratio and if you do risk ratio.

198
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:56,160
Ananda Sen: Then 1.9 can be interpreted as 90% so let's see, so I think I can actually stop sharing this one and go back to.

199
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,950
Ananda Sen: Okay, so.

200
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:02,760
Ananda Sen: I was doing this i'm.

201
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:13,110
Ananda Sen: here.

202
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:19,140
Ananda Sen: So what I just said is this if we use.

203
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,870
Ananda Sen: In Brock Jen MOD.

204
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:29,190
Ananda Sen: Link equal to log.

205
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,350
Ananda Sen: Then.

206
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:38,910
Ananda Sen: The X one n shaded.

207
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:42,120
Ananda Sen: coefficients.

208
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,760
Ananda Sen: represent.

209
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,070
Ananda Sen: risk ratio.

210
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,020
Ananda Sen: So.

211
00:29:52,020 --> 00:30:03,570
Ananda Sen: For example.

212
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:05,700
Ananda Sen: With.

213
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:13,710
Ananda Sen: Link equal to log.

214
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,650
Ananda Sen: exponential.

215
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:20,490
Ananda Sen: beta.

216
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:24,330
Ananda Sen: Prior frack.

217
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:31,560
Ananda Sen: Is 1.9 so.

218
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,620
Ananda Sen: Keeping.

219
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,380
Ananda Sen: All variables.

220
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,760
Ananda Sen: Constant.

221
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,610
Ananda Sen: subjects.

222
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:47,190
Ananda Sen: With.

223
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:54,120
Ananda Sen: Prior fracture.

224
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,910
Ananda Sen: or 90%.

225
00:30:56,910 --> 00:31:01,590
Ananda Sen: more likely.

226
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,240
Ananda Sen: than.

227
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:07,440
Ananda Sen: Once without.

228
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:13,590
Ananda Sen: Prior fracture.

229
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:29,430
To.

230
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:39,090
Ananda Sen: Much nicer interpretation, so that is one of the reasons lot of people actually like to use link equal to log it's not default.

231
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:46,980
Ananda Sen: But you can change it to link it to the log in Denmark, you cannot do that in logistics logistics is only for logistic regression legit link.

232
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:59,610
Ananda Sen: So here is one advantage of using general one additional capabilities engine.

233
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:05,640
Ananda Sen: Does that make sense okay.

234
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,070
Ananda Sen: The.

235
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:23,580
Ananda Sen: I think, eventually, when you use it depends on on the on what you do and most of the time what you do dictates, how you would represent the data or how would represent their results so, so in that case.

236
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:41,880
Ananda Sen: So that's that's all I wanted to talk about in terms of logistic regression the the this these These were the main things are there, a lot of other things which we have not covered, but I think this is this should give you a really good start on doing any application to logistic regression.

237
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:49,650
Ananda Sen: Do you have any questions before we move to counter English.

238
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:57,000
Ananda Sen: Again, I have about five questions which I have posted as homework.

239
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:08,520
Ananda Sen: Please go ahead, take a look, take a stab at it, these are all using the same data sets we have been using here and really what I, what I want to do to do is to go over.

240
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:16,260
Ananda Sen: Many of these things and essentially cut and paste and copy and paste the programs, which we have used.

241
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:24,150
Ananda Sen: For yourself, but I have changed things a little bit so that you have to sort of a go through the interpretation little bit yourself and that.

242
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:42,660
Ananda Sen: That will like Christie said that that will help you understand what is what is happening in working so that's when I was a graduate student day that's that's, the only way I learned so homework, with the ones which was the most helpful so i'm.

243
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,590
Yoonhee Ryder: actress.

244
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:54,570
Yoonhee Ryder: Yes, did you upload the new homework assignment because I only saw the one from last time it's up there Oh, maybe i'm looking at the wrong.

245
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:58,140
Ananda Sen: Because you know you should not be looking should not be looking at assignments i'm sure.

246
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,880
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: You have to go to the files.

247
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,010
Ananda Sen: files, everything is in fact.

248
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,900
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: I just got the same thing.

249
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:10,560
Ananda Sen: Yesterday, yesterday I decided to put everything in files, because there was this problem with links before so.

250
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,650
Ananda Sen: All are in files in files they're all folders.

251
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:16,560
Ananda Sen: Including a homework folder.

252
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,010
Yoonhee Ryder: folder.

253
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:19,650
Ananda Sen: homework folder should thank you.

254
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,640
Ananda Sen: Okay yeah.

255
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:25,770
Good.

256
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:30,180
Ananda Sen: questions.

257
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,620
Ananda Sen: All right.

258
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,450
Ananda Sen: Now.

259
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:39,240
Ananda Sen: Let us go.

260
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:51,390
Ananda Sen: too deep for.

261
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:55,170
Ananda Sen: So count data, so what is count.

262
00:34:55,170 --> 00:35:10,020
Ananda Sen: So count data is you know it's number one could be number of visits number of hospital visits, in fact, if you if you do.

263
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:18,120
Ananda Sen: Health services project, then a lot of a lot of the projects actually involve the way.

264
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:30,360
Ananda Sen: Hospitals operate and the patient base so if you're looking at patients in a certain certain cohort and you want to look at their sort of like.

265
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,700
Ananda Sen: study, the number of visits, they have made to their primary care provider.

266
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:49,110
Ananda Sen: That that's a possibility, this one particularly I have used an example in history in a stroke self care interventions study number of diagnostic tests during during the year in the healthcare utilization steady.

267
00:35:49,110 --> 00:36:02,130
Ananda Sen: Number of emergency room visits in an asthma asthma study this is this is, these are all all real all real some of them are actually my own projects.

268
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:15,870
Ananda Sen: I look at I do studies, with the disability and er visits for disability is one of the things which will study in a project with.

269
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,210
Ananda Sen: different type of visibility.

270
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:21,330
Ananda Sen: Hearing disability and so on and so.

271
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:29,580
Ananda Sen: A number of recommend infections experienced by subjects so that's definitely one of the things.

272
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:49,320
Ananda Sen: Which people look at all the time number of epileptic seizures that's another one, so I mean there are a whole bunch of examples where count is of importance now whenever you count that is longitudinal lunch way say Why do I say luxury because.

273
00:36:49,320 --> 00:37:00,510
Ananda Sen: to observe an event multiple times you need to see the subject for a period of time, so that is it as long as you know, in that sense.

274
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:13,770
Ananda Sen: But that period of observation may not be the same for each patient like you might see some patient for days and some patients, we could observe them for six months, and so on and so forth.

275
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:17,160
Ananda Sen: Now Now this is.

276
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:35,010
Ananda Sen: This has the same flavor of a continuous data, and it could could also call it categorical data because oftentimes accounts do not go beyond a small number, I mean probably if you look at number of visits for patients.

277
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,630
Ananda Sen: In a year.

278
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:51,750
Ananda Sen: And you might find most people are constrained to maybe zero to three visits and there are some patients so many only a few patients probably will have visits beyond.

279
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:58,050
Ananda Sen: four, five and some patient may have 10 visits, probably the secret patients.

280
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:04,950
Ananda Sen: Nonetheless, it is, it is a different type of model it's not categorical neither continuous fully because.

281
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:13,140
Ananda Sen: count is a discrete number is not when i'm looking at 1.2 counts or 1.3 counts.

282
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:17,010
Ananda Sen: So it's it's different.

283
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:26,700
Ananda Sen: than a two models which are used in despair in this context, one is a person, the other one is negative binomial.

284
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:38,670
Ananda Sen: what's on looks like this outcome is on a non negative count the average is the same as the very end that's the restriction of course on, and this is something.

285
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:56,400
Ananda Sen: which have always been criticized, although this is a very well known model and well accepted model per person i've given some pictures here, which essentially our pictures with varying average and variability and then.

286
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:08,730
Ananda Sen: Then there is a regression model, how does the regression model coming so regression model for personas the month is a model for law of the average of the average action.

287
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:21,120
Ananda Sen: So in this sense, it is the same as linear regression model with integration model is is is the same tool for continuous data we looked at the outcome and and try to model, the average.

288
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:24,180
Ananda Sen: Here also, we do the same thing.

289
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:36,990
Ananda Sen: Except it's not a linear model for the for the average is actually a log linear model for that which, if you take the log natural logarithm of the average then it's better not plus beta one X.

290
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:59,010
Ananda Sen: And the noise is is Lambda and and the variance is variance is the same as the average which depends on it okay so it's different from usual normal progression that sense.

291
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:08,790
Ananda Sen: Remember, we did a picture like this for normal distribution where things were moving up and we were we were trying to look at the average there.

292
00:40:08,790 --> 00:40:28,170
Ananda Sen: and on each average we had we had some distribution some a normal distribution here around each average, you have a persona distribution and I haven't ages are because it's skewed too long right tail it's the average is actually somewhat.

293
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:36,600
Ananda Sen: On the on the on the left side of the histogram it's a long right.

294
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,370
Ananda Sen: Now.

295
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:43,530
Ananda Sen: There is a competing model to pass on and we will talk about that in detail.

296
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:55,950
Ananda Sen: that's a negative binomial distribution what is negative binomial distribution says it's also count model and and there is a probability that it now now here is.

297
00:40:55,950 --> 00:41:16,860
Ananda Sen: A model where we can look at say I want to sample healthy people until I found find the 10th person with a disease so suppose my framework is like that it's called sometimes inverse.

298
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:26,910
Ananda Sen: sampling because I want to wait before or until I get a certain number of people with the condition.

299
00:41:26,910 --> 00:41:30,990
Ananda Sen: That sort of a model is negative binomial it's still count.

300
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:41,010
Ananda Sen: But it's it's a little more restrictive than person, but actually the model itself is not restricted because model itself does not care about.

301
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:51,480
Ananda Sen: Other actually does not model that mean to be equal to variance in this case negative binomial regression the variance is larger than the mean.

302
00:41:51,480 --> 00:42:07,350
Ananda Sen: person has a single parameter, because the meaning the variance the same negative binomial has two parameters is more flexible than one person now, I said that but it's also not fully flexible because.

303
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,770
Ananda Sen: The variance is always going to be.

304
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:19,860
Ananda Sen: larger than the average look at the various variances average divided by a probability.

305
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:37,770
Ananda Sen: That means it's more than the more than the average so, so it is flexible, more flexible than person, no doubt, but it's not fully flexible, it can only do what i've called over dispersion over dispersion means.

306
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:48,120
Ananda Sen: More variability than than me.

307
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:51,030
Ananda Sen: Negative binomial models.

308
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:53,310
Ananda Sen: Over.

309
00:42:53,310 --> 00:43:00,960
dispersed.

310
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:14,370
Ananda Sen: So again, some pictures of various parameter ization and the histograms, these are the histograms you see the prominence the schooners is more prominent when.

311
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:20,640
Ananda Sen: When he have larger larger are larger be and so on and so forth.

312
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,240
So.

313
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,510
Ananda Sen: So these are some mathematical properties i'm just going to skip over that.

314
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:34,950
Ananda Sen: It but sort of negative binomial I really.

315
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:42,690
Ananda Sen: I mean by that is is a is a larger case then person person is a special case of negative binomial.

316
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:55,890
Ananda Sen: There are two parameters, if one of the parameters is equal to zero that are parameter is equal to zero, then you get per song, so they are both called special cases of generalizing Mr.

317
00:43:55,890 --> 00:44:14,070
Ananda Sen: So again, a picture similar to persona that's the that's the model that that those stars are the means, so if you if you are connecting those means through a straight line or the log of those means through a straight line, maybe get a regression model.

318
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:17,520
Ananda Sen: Some examples.

319
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,080
Ananda Sen: So one example would be um.

320
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:31,050
Ananda Sen: This is, this is an old example it's it's somewhat artificial because it's don't think it's actually a real example it's it's has been used in.

321
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:48,960
Ananda Sen: Many books several times so i'm interested we're interested in the predictors of the number of published articles in past three years of PhD so essentially the last three years of PhD it's account data with the same follow up time because last three years it's a three year window.

322
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,790
Ananda Sen: So.

323
00:44:50,790 --> 00:45:02,880
Ananda Sen: So there's several variables are female mattered good five PhD mentor and they're those have specific meanings i'm actually not going to be using this data set.

324
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:12,510
Ananda Sen: Here, but I have prepared an assignment that third assignment, which will actually use this particular data set so we will.

325
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:14,490
Ananda Sen: We will see.

326
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:22,680
Ananda Sen: How to use things on the data so but but for our example in class will be using other datasets okay.

327
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:41,460
Ananda Sen: But let's explain quickly what these are so so some of the variable some of the subjects I have, I have printed there so art is just number of articles that's the outcome basically female is just a male female it's one equal to female male.

328
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:45,990
Ananda Sen: methodism enters the marital status and Scott intimated are not.

329
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:56,280
Ananda Sen: Good five is number of children less than six years old in the family PhD is actually a score it's a score of the institution.

330
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:19,470
Ananda Sen: PhDs pursued at some kind of ranking of the institution and mentor is the number of articles by mentor in last three years, so those are all felt to be connected to how many articles, the PhD candidate has has published in the last three years of his or her PhD.

331
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:24,480
Ananda Sen: So the example we are going to actually work with in this.

332
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,610
Ananda Sen: class or today.

333
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:29,580
Ananda Sen: Is.

334
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:37,860
Ananda Sen: An example when incidence rate of non melanoma skin cancer in the minneapolis and and Dallas.

335
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:41,730
Ananda Sen: To have got very few variables.

336
00:46:41,730 --> 00:47:03,600
Ananda Sen: There is the age group age group is ages categorical here 123456788 categories sample is a city indicator it's one or zero number of cases is the number of cases of.

337
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:09,750
Ananda Sen: A number of cases of of.

338
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:19,830
Ananda Sen: The cases of melanoma skin cancer and population size is the number of number of people in that in that age group in that particular city.

339
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:37,530
Ananda Sen: Okay, you will notice one thing, if you look at the left hand side there are eight age categories which are repeated, of course, because both cities are represented here, St Paul is one and Dallas zero okay.

340
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:45,780
Ananda Sen: let's talk a little bit about person what this person time I just mentioned that.

341
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:54,420
Ananda Sen: Everybody is art, not everybody, but but it's possible that people have been observed on different.

342
00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:04,950
Ananda Sen: periods of time different durations duration makes a difference, because if you're looking at records of some events or even visits.

343
00:48:04,950 --> 00:48:18,150
Ananda Sen: visits and they look at a patient for a year and look at another patient for three years, well, the number of visits for the three year patient the one who you're looking at for three years it's definitely going to be more.

344
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:27,390
Ananda Sen: But it's more because because you have observed that person for a longer period of time, so, then what should you do well, the obvious thing you should do is do you should.

345
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:51,630
Ananda Sen: You should standardize it for a unit observation time patient time or person time, so to speak, so so that's what we talked about here, so why is still going to the event count for the sale and DTI is the person time of follow up all right, and what we are interested in is the rate.

346
00:48:51,630 --> 00:49:01,050
Ananda Sen: rate or the count bar person time whether it's a year or months or days that's different but i'm.

347
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:04,140
Ananda Sen: Really doesn't matter too much.

348
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:13,830
Ananda Sen: Whether you measure them in different units it's, the only thing that matters is the intercept are changes interested the rest of them are the same.

349
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:24,150
Ananda Sen: So the estimate for the event rate is simply just the count divided by the follow up tonight that's it.

350
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:26,430
alright.

351
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:48,450
Ananda Sen: So what is the what is the first time here now notice I call it person time here, but the population size, is what I am using as the normal laser I would call it a normalized and normalized there because that's what makes things comparable.

352
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:52,170
Ananda Sen: See, if I had 10 visits.

353
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:59,490
Ananda Sen: In three years versus another person who had.

354
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:03,810
Ananda Sen: Four visits in six months.

355
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:12,660
Ananda Sen: Although I have got more visits the person who got four visits and six months that person probably.

356
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:17,160
Ananda Sen: has more challenges.

357
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,760
Ananda Sen: If you think of this visitor doctor.

358
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:41,790
Ananda Sen: i'm, the only way to make them make us compatible is to standardize it by dividing by the person time, so in this case we don't have a time person, but we do have is where we're comparing the rates and to compare the rates, you have to divide the population.

359
00:50:41,790 --> 00:50:50,280
Ananda Sen: And so, in this case, we will call PT or the person time as the population size.

360
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:59,400
Ananda Sen: age group is the other covariance that could be an issue and then send ball and Dallas are the two cities.

361
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:07,260
Ananda Sen: Right stop me if you have any question at any of these.

362
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:08,670
Ananda Sen: Now.

363
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:14,580
Ananda Sen: This is just a just a little bit of a convention here.

364
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:28,320
Ananda Sen: Because the events are not that high compared to the population size, if you divide by the population, the numbers, the rates become pretty small and then.

365
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,340
Ananda Sen: One thing you could do is to.

366
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:50,820
Ananda Sen: inflate the population unit by multiplying by 100% hundred thousand and then it becomes buying 579 per hundred thousand person years or something like that that's that those are those are just conventions.

367
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:53,820
Ananda Sen: So what are the.

368
00:51:53,820 --> 00:52:01,470
Ananda Sen: What are the time is it.

369
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:04,680
Ananda Sen: All right, let me, let me just.

370
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,350
Ananda Sen: Do this would be a good time to start.

371
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:10,260
Ananda Sen: So why don't we just.

372
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:22,050
Ananda Sen: Stop here briefly and come back.

373
00:52:22,050 --> 01:01:20,430
Ananda Sen: To 45 let's go to 45 yeah.

374
01:01:20,430 --> 01:01:26,100
Ananda Sen: The bad.

375
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:29,970
Ananda Sen: guys.

376
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:33,570
Ananda Sen: josh sent a couple of.

377
01:01:33,570 --> 01:01:38,610
Ananda Sen: Links those links are.

378
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:45,810
Ananda Sen: about how to set up the end was notification preferences and a student i'm.

379
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:49,980
Ananda Sen: Take a look at that i'll still.

380
01:01:49,980 --> 01:01:54,060
Ananda Sen: See, that is, can be done automatically because.

381
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:58,770
Ananda Sen: As far as I remember, during the regular classes.

382
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:08,940
Ananda Sen: One somebody registered for the course they automatically get that notification and that's already set up for them, I think I think the default here is a little different vendor.

383
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:23,160
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: yeah I am getting the notifications, so I don't know it just says your name and then in parentheses, the class just sent you a message in canvas I don't know if that's a notification or a specific message, but I get those.

384
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:24,000
Ananda Sen: Okay, so.

385
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:28,140
Christie Flanagan: premise canvas ones, but that's different, I think.

386
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:31,470
Ananda Sen: Oh that's different i'm talking about to whenever I.

387
01:02:31,470 --> 01:02:33,930
Ananda Sen: I I bought some files new files.

388
01:02:33,930 --> 01:02:35,490
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Say like oh yeah.

389
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,300
Ananda Sen: No okay.

390
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:38,040
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: No you're not getting that so.

391
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,950
Ananda Sen: I think yeah.

392
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:45,300
Geehan Suleyman: I have my my inbox is that what you're talking about.

393
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:46,320
Ananda Sen: No.

394
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:46,680
Ananda Sen: It was.

395
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:54,180
Ananda Sen: It was the inbox messages are more like emails and I send that I said that anyway i'm.

396
01:02:54,180 --> 01:03:01,110
Ananda Sen: Do all the students all the time, but when I post save.

397
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:08,520
Ananda Sen: A new lecture on auto and i'm did a lecture on.

398
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:17,610
Ananda Sen: me me me me, I have to set something up from my end just to make sure that everybody's getting the notification, although that.

399
01:03:17,610 --> 01:03:19,680
Geehan Suleyman: Normally.

400
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:25,560
Geehan Suleyman: This lab three and four, as well as software codes for day three are updated on campus.

401
01:03:25,560 --> 01:03:29,280
Ananda Sen: That is, that is my message I just sent an email to all of you.

402
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:29,940
Geehan Suleyman: yeah okay.

403
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,600
Ananda Sen: Well that's fine.

404
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,710
Ananda Sen: that's fine that he will.

405
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:51,900
Ananda Sen: Get I mean I will still continue doing that, but but i'm saying something like you know people are looking for the homework if, when I when I posted the homework last night, it should have gotten to gotten you should have gotten a message saying that homework is posted on this folder.

406
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:56,880
Ananda Sen: That you did not get that's the one i'm done.

407
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,500
yeah.

408
01:03:58,500 --> 01:04:03,630
Ananda Sen: Okay i'll take a look at that.

409
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:06,120
Ananda Sen: All right.

410
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:09,150
Ananda Sen: So.

411
01:04:09,150 --> 01:04:14,400
Ananda Sen: Continuing for their on on this counter aggression.

412
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:32,820
Ananda Sen: If I have to estimate the rate parameter Lambda the way to estimate that and it's it's it's a very natural estimate you you found the total number of events divided by the total number of opposite total time under observation, the person time so.

413
01:04:32,820 --> 01:04:33,660
Ananda Sen: Over.

414
01:04:33,660 --> 01:04:45,330
Ananda Sen: There are 50 subjects each each one had a number of events, if you just add all of them up and divided by the total time under observation for each of those persons 50 persons.

415
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:58,260
Ananda Sen: Then what you get is an overall estimate for Lambda so that's that's a pretty straightforward interpretation um now that, in the in the previous one, I.

416
01:04:58,260 --> 01:05:02,880
Ananda Sen: We didn't bring in directly.

417
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:10,110
Ananda Sen: The the the response so So what we want to do is to model that rate.

418
01:05:10,110 --> 01:05:20,700
Ananda Sen: So there is no still not any covariance here we haven't brought in any regression type of setting yet, but.

419
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:26,850
Ananda Sen: To understand how we do that, we have to figure out, what are the, what are the.

420
01:05:26,850 --> 01:05:33,150
Ananda Sen: things we are actually looking at, so there are three things we're looking at one is the event count.

421
01:05:33,150 --> 01:05:45,750
Ananda Sen: let's count one is a person time How long have you observed this person and one is then rate that's that's kind of like their rate per person per unit person time So these are three things.

422
01:05:45,750 --> 01:05:59,550
Ananda Sen: Now rate is not really a proportion in the case of the melanoma thing we we talked about dividing by the population size but it's still not proportion in the sense, because a time was the same for each each.

423
01:05:59,550 --> 01:06:02,250
Ananda Sen: that's why we didn't really divide by time.

424
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:05,280
Geehan Suleyman: Otherwise we showed her.

425
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:26,820
Ananda Sen: The range of possible values for the rate is going to be non negative so anywhere between zero and infinity, although in practical cases it really goes beyond a certain finite number for most of the cases stays below four or five some cases it might go a little higher.

426
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:30,870
Ananda Sen: Observation time is different for different people.

427
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:41,250
Ananda Sen: So in overall, if you look at the expected value the average average number of cases.

428
01:06:41,250 --> 01:07:02,520
Ananda Sen: Is is is that rate Lambda multiplied by How long have you observed this person and that's really natural if the rate is like five per unit time and then you have observed this person 400 days it's a.

429
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:10,050
Ananda Sen: Point five buddy and hundred days so so it becomes 50 or something like that.

430
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:32,880
Ananda Sen: So so that's a very easy interpretation but that still doesn't take care of any covariance does it vary across age, does it vary across gender that sort of thing and that's where the modeling comes in, so the model is now about the rate the.

431
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:48,060
Ananda Sen: The Lambda so the Lambda is is a regression model remember what we what we model for logistic regression is is legit or log on log of bi over one minus bi.

432
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:51,450
That was.

433
01:07:51,450 --> 01:08:01,170
Ananda Sen: Here it's the meteor Lambda I is the rate actually not the full mean, but the rate, other than the.

434
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:04,560
Ananda Sen: person time the observation time.

435
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:09,900
Ananda Sen: And the way it is done is.

436
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:23,520
Ananda Sen: log of Lambda is is better not plus beta one X one plus beta cakes cakes and the reason it's done it that way is that Lambda or negative so make it non negative.

437
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:36,210
Ananda Sen: But you have to you can't you cannot just say Lambda equal to beta not plus beta one X, Y X one plus beta click scale, because we are not beta one beta K, they all can be negative.

438
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:49,740
Ananda Sen: So the only way of handling this would be to make the log log of Lambda is is that linear model so it's a log linear model.

439
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:57,960
Ananda Sen: Now, really, what you're doing is that Lambda is nothing but the average divided by PT guy.

440
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:04,050
Ananda Sen: So it's log of E y divided by PT is the is the regression model.

441
01:09:04,050 --> 01:09:15,360
Ananda Sen: If you separate it if you write it out more fully what you have in the box is the model, you have now one thing we have used here, and this is something.

442
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:28,980
Ananda Sen: From a school algebra is we have used this fact log of the ratio is the difference of love.

443
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:36,690
Ananda Sen: Okay, so that's that's how you get this this expression.

444
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:38,580
Now.

445
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:42,060
Ananda Sen: Take a look at this carefully.

446
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:48,030
Ananda Sen: There are two things here one is that aggression, we are not plus beta one X one plus beta kicks.

447
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:50,340
Ananda Sen: But then there is another another.

448
01:09:50,340 --> 01:09:57,630
Ananda Sen: Part of this, the log BT that looks like a cool very good, but that is a special period.

449
01:09:57,630 --> 01:10:07,110
Ananda Sen: It doesn't have any coefficient attached to it, or you could also say that the coefficient is forced to be equal to one.

450
01:10:07,110 --> 01:10:14,760
Ananda Sen: So the whole thing could be written as a regression model, except one of these quantities is is one with.

451
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:18,840
Ananda Sen: A coefficient of one that's lot PT.

452
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:22,860
Ananda Sen: that's what is called an offset.

453
01:10:22,860 --> 01:10:30,900
Ananda Sen: Now, why do you have to write it that way, because you're modeling log of my way by PT.

454
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:36,330
Ananda Sen: And you're just rewriting the same model this.

455
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:44,790
Ananda Sen: These two models are exactly the same.

456
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:48,030
Ananda Sen: Exactly.

457
01:10:48,030 --> 01:10:50,040
Ananda Sen: So so that's what.

458
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,780
that's what.

459
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:55,200
Ananda Sen: The offset is so the offset is.

460
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:59,580
Ananda Sen: It looks like a covert it but it's not like not not recovery it's actually.

461
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:02,370
Part of the out.

462
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:03,960
Ananda Sen: The way you were you.

463
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:14,790
Ananda Sen: Do, that is if every time you see an offset it will basically subtracting back from the outcome and then fitting a model.

464
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:20,340
Ananda Sen: So.

465
01:11:20,340 --> 01:11:29,790
Ananda Sen: How do you interpret it the way you integrated all the parameters you're interpreting is rate or longer.

466
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:31,530
Ananda Sen: So.

467
01:11:31,530 --> 01:11:42,960
Ananda Sen: For example, beta not is the law grade when all covariance equal to zero, whether that that strange expression exponentially, better known as expected rate for women.

468
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,240
Ananda Sen: aged zero in this particular model at a.

469
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:54,390
Ananda Sen: particular example because mainly is a good one, female equal to zero and that's the baseline female is equal to zero.

470
01:11:54,390 --> 01:12:01,110
Ananda Sen: And then age at 800 for women that's the expected rate.

471
01:12:01,110 --> 01:12:10,890
Ananda Sen: So there is no zero so one way to handle this would be to Center page, but we have seen that before so i'm not going to go in there now.

472
01:12:10,890 --> 01:12:12,870
Ananda Sen: Now.

473
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:23,310
Ananda Sen: adjusted So what about the other beta geez they are like beta male and beta age they're adjusted change in laundry.

474
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:28,920
Ananda Sen: bar unit in Greece, next year, so let's let's look at it carefully.

475
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:35,760
Ananda Sen: If I.

476
01:12:35,760 --> 01:12:40,260
OK.

477
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,460
see if I can do this.

478
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,690
Ananda Sen: yeah so let's do this in the next season.

479
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:55,530
Ananda Sen: So, again log rate is beta not plus beta male times mail plus beta age times age.

480
01:12:55,530 --> 01:13:15,030
Ananda Sen: let's compare age X plus one versus Ajax when you have late age X plus one that's the first equation is that is the equation when eight is equal to X, the second equation, the equation Okay, so if you take the difference, then what you get is beta age.

481
01:13:15,030 --> 01:13:30,870
Ananda Sen: So what is the age thing beta ages log of Lambda at age X plus one divided by a genetics or log of the average ratio of the averages.

482
01:13:30,870 --> 01:13:44,700
Ananda Sen: So either you can think of this as the difference in the log at those two ages log of the Lambda or you can think of this as the ratio log of the ratio of the averages.

483
01:13:44,700 --> 01:14:01,770
Ananda Sen: So another way of saying, that is, this is the rate ratio associated with one increment exponential beta age is the ratio associated with one increment in age adjusting for gender.

484
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:17,790
Ananda Sen: or multiplicative changing average right for an individual with a to express one compared to an individual agents and just for six, how is it different from logistic regression logistic regression, we would have said odds ratio here, we say it's Rachel issue.

485
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:21,780
Ananda Sen: linear regression is just a difference.

486
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:24,510
Ananda Sen: In the outcome average outcome.

487
01:14:24,510 --> 01:14:29,190
Ananda Sen: There is no its financial situation there.

488
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:31,860
yeah.

489
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:38,760
Ananda Sen: So it's return rate ratio associated with one year incremental aged justin for gender.

490
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:56,640
Ananda Sen: So if beta age, for example, is negative 0.02 then for each one year increase in age, the expected lock count of the number of er visits of er visits is the outcome number of er visits average number of ever is locked on the er visits decreases by 0.0.

491
01:14:56,640 --> 01:15:08,520
Ananda Sen: Why because exponential minus 010 0.98 so it's a big decrease of point or two.

492
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:17,400
Ananda Sen: Each one year increase in age, the expected lock count the number of er visits decreases by 0.0.

493
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:30,030
Ananda Sen: Now you could do it for 10 years increment very ratio of er visit rates associated with tenure increases in ages 0.8 tool so it's an 18% decrease.

494
01:15:30,030 --> 01:15:32,820
Ananda Sen: For every 10 year increase.

495
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:37,470
Ananda Sen: Does that interpretation bother you.

496
01:15:37,470 --> 01:15:49,830
Ananda Sen: So now let's talk a little bit about practical you see this, you see this on your on your output and they say hmm.

497
01:15:49,830 --> 01:15:54,600
Geehan Suleyman: Because usually the older, you are you're more likely to have.

498
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:57,120
Geehan Suleyman: doctor's visit higher number of doctor visits.

499
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,360
Ananda Sen: Right right, so why would you think that this.

500
01:16:00,360 --> 01:16:01,920
Is.

501
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,810
Ananda Sen: This would be the case it's it's it's a little counterintuitive right.

502
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:13,980
Ananda Sen: But is it.

503
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:23,820
Ananda Sen: I obviously have not shared the data with doing this, I cannot remember whether this was from a real data or something but but it's good it happens.

504
01:16:23,820 --> 01:16:40,740
Ananda Sen: Often, but.

505
01:16:40,740 --> 01:16:52,620
Ananda Sen: What could be what could be a possible explanation.

506
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:56,670
Ananda Sen: Anybody.

507
01:16:56,670 --> 01:17:01,050
Geehan Suleyman: older person may choose not to go to the doctor.

508
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:06,000
Geehan Suleyman: as well, especially males tend to neglect.

509
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:18,960
Geehan Suleyman: Their health compared to females and wait until things get complicated and worse before they see care well that's another.

510
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,340
Good.

511
01:17:20,340 --> 01:17:20,910
Geehan Suleyman: question.

512
01:17:20,910 --> 01:17:24,690
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: And I was going to say this is also er visits so maybe.

513
01:17:24,690 --> 01:17:29,670
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: As you get older you get I don't know less i'm thinking er is risk.

514
01:17:29,670 --> 01:17:47,730
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: I don't know you go to the er when something happens out of the blue, maybe younger people 14 to 15 isn't that big of a jump but maybe as you get older, you have a regular physician that you're seeing or year you tend to go to someone you familiar with versus the er.

515
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,410
Ananda Sen: Right.

516
01:17:49,410 --> 01:17:51,540
Ananda Sen: One thing I want to point out is that.

517
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:54,480
Ananda Sen: The 5240 to 50.

518
01:17:54,480 --> 01:18:01,320
Ananda Sen: is an example, this could could easily be 70 to 80.

519
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:10,380
Ananda Sen: So it's an overall estimate right 18% lower for every Kenyan increase.

520
01:18:10,380 --> 01:18:17,520
Ananda Sen: Do you think older people are in the database.

521
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:20,580
Geehan Suleyman: Have a smaller sample size.

522
01:18:20,580 --> 01:18:24,360
Ananda Sen: that's right and also.

523
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:29,250
Ananda Sen: There is a this is there is it what is sometimes called in.

524
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:36,660
Ananda Sen: medical data a survival bias or survivors bias.

525
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:41,790
Ananda Sen: All the people may not be human here, they may not, they may not.

526
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:46,950
Ananda Sen: Be there enough to.

527
01:18:46,950 --> 01:19:00,360
Ananda Sen: change things, all of the things you suggested, could be plausible reasons, also, I think one plausible reason could be that they're not in the database, partly because there they didn't know they're not living.

528
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:12,480
Ananda Sen: So, so you don't really have the once you have our younger folks relatively younger folks not not young young but relatively younger folks and.

529
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:16,500
Ananda Sen: it's possible that in that group.

530
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:21,390
Ananda Sen: You have a fewer visits for really older people.

531
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,400
Ananda Sen: So yeah.

532
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:29,580
Ananda Sen: that's so what i'm what i'm trying to impress upon you is that.

533
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:38,040
Ananda Sen: When you see and output, I mean it is once you are familiar with the with the.

534
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:44,970
Ananda Sen: Statistical procedure you you definitely put it.

535
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:48,480
Ananda Sen: If you run it it's easy to run.

536
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:59,730
Ananda Sen: A few lines of code and you'll be able to 90 but then you get the output and try to understand what that output means means sometimes it's very easy sometimes it's quite.

537
01:19:59,730 --> 01:20:06,960
Ananda Sen: easy to understand and easy to explain, but other times, you have to think a little bit about why this is the case.

538
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:17,610
Ananda Sen: As a statistician as a bisexual an epidemiologist I would what I would do is, I would just go back to the data and check to make sure that.

539
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:26,430
Ananda Sen: What i'm thinking is whether it's a neat happening, I mean what are the, what are the age ranges in the database and what sort of things and getting so.

540
01:20:26,430 --> 01:20:43,980
Ananda Sen: So I think that's that's part of data mining, you would you would mind the data and try to figure out what's going on, and the result is result that's that's just a just a model based and but but.

541
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:53,550
Ananda Sen: Data sleuthing is is very important to understand why you're getting a result you're gay okay.

542
01:20:53,550 --> 01:21:01,830
Ananda Sen: Any questions.

543
01:21:01,830 --> 01:21:08,010
Ananda Sen: Okay, so what a dichotomous response suppose.

544
01:21:08,010 --> 01:21:09,600
Ananda Sen: I get.

545
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:19,140
Ananda Sen: beta equal to 0.6 if I if I if I exponential that I get and and.

546
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:36,330
Ananda Sen: an exponential rate of version of exponential value of 1.8 So what is, what does 1.8 mean 1.8 means that males on an average we visit a are 80% more than females, as long as they are the same age.

547
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:52,500
Ananda Sen: So, so the service integration is closer to the linear model interpretation but, to be able to say this in the in the in terms of the actual outcome, you have to first exponential.

548
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:58,050
Ananda Sen: So it is it in that sense, it has got the flavor of both and odds ratio.

549
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:06,240
Ananda Sen: Which is the exponential of beta but also the linear models, because the integration is Samsung average.

550
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:08,340
Ananda Sen: Okay.

551
01:22:08,340 --> 01:22:10,770
Ananda Sen: Alright, so this is also.

552
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:29,790
Ananda Sen: The whole thing which we did for logistic regression if the positive means the risk ratio should be bigger than one equal to zero means risk ratio is one and less than zero means restoration, less than one once again if the confidence interval is on one side of one that means insignificant.

553
01:22:29,790 --> 01:22:37,230
Ananda Sen: But it covers one means it's not significant that's that's the way to interpret there.

554
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:39,660
Ananda Sen: That says a mathematical.

555
01:22:39,660 --> 01:22:41,730
thing.

556
01:22:41,730 --> 01:22:59,430
Ananda Sen: Now, one thing I, we did not really touch upon, but what quickly we can mention that there are three other ways of doing this right, we could do this it looks I mean it's not entirely wrong.

557
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:08,190
Ananda Sen: Using a linear regression on this well, the problem with this is that again variance.

558
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:20,580
Ananda Sen: If because the variance is dependent on their expectation on the average if you model expectation as a function of covariance variance is also going to be modeled as function of covariance.

559
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:34,800
Ananda Sen: And that is a violation of normal assumption for for normal distribution regression all subjects should have the same variance so that cannot happen here if you model.

560
01:23:34,800 --> 01:23:40,980
Ananda Sen: The average why as a function of the covariance.

561
01:23:40,980 --> 01:23:48,870
Ananda Sen: So so linear regression should be avoided, can we use the person time as a co Marriott.

562
01:23:48,870 --> 01:24:01,290
Ananda Sen: And again, I think person time if you use person as a cove area, then you completely lose the the integration of rate so so you should not be doing that.

563
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:14,010
Ananda Sen: How about modeling the rate itself as a linear regression again the problem there is why you do that rate is to standardize things so that you can compare one with the other.

564
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:23,070
Ananda Sen: But if you if you're trying to use the same linear regression then suddenly the rate of 0.1 based on hundred percent time is the same.

565
01:24:23,070 --> 01:24:35,130
Ananda Sen: As the rate of 0.1 based on 10,000 person time so so so it forces you to use the same wait for different observation times and that's also not a.

566
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:50,790
Ananda Sen: good thing to do so, so that's why you cannot use the linear regression, which we did before for either the account or the rate we have to use a different model, which is what we are using for some model.

567
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:58,500
Ananda Sen: So the negative binomial model, by the way, negative binomial regression model is.

568
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:14,370
Ananda Sen: is another model it's a person i'm not going to go too much into negative binomial equation is it's basically the same thing again you model, the average it has got two parameters and when we go through some of the.

569
01:25:14,370 --> 01:25:19,200
Ananda Sen: Some of the calculations, will we will see that so.

570
01:25:19,200 --> 01:25:37,140
Ananda Sen: The extra parameter actually models, the dispersion and and that dispersion with something to take a look Okay, so let me pull up the lab.

571
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:40,710
Ananda Sen: For the first biggest.

572
01:25:40,710 --> 01:25:48,540
Ananda Sen: skin cancer data, this is the data we just talked about that can be, for example, to.

573
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:55,320
Ananda Sen: This is, this is a nice example because it's a very small example where.

574
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:58,710
Ananda Sen: You actually type in the data.

575
01:25:58,710 --> 01:26:02,850
Ananda Sen: On in the in the code itself.

576
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:29,760
Ananda Sen: So so i'm creating a data set called skin can, and I am saying that these are my variable so called age group simple cases and population sykes now notice that after age group I put $1 sign that means that has a meeting so that dollar sign basically tells me that age group is a.

577
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:35,490
Ananda Sen: categorical variable.

578
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:57,990
Ananda Sen: or a character actually I should say not categorical.

579
01:26:57,990 --> 01:27:00,030
Ananda Sen: So.

580
01:27:00,030 --> 01:27:08,100
Ananda Sen: Any variable followed by $1 sign is a character variable everything else is numeric.

581
01:27:08,100 --> 01:27:19,710
Ananda Sen: Now I did a couple of things which you can that's the nice thing about SAS is that you can do them in the data step, so this is a I created two variables, one of them is called.

582
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:39,330
Ananda Sen: lock box, which is the log of the population size and the next one is called Dallas so I had this indicator variable which is one for sample and zero for Dallas I also created another indicator variable which is one for Dallas and zero for simple.

583
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:45,090
Ananda Sen: Okay, so this is, this is the other indicated variable.

584
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:54,540
Ananda Sen: I said cards that basically says that i'm starting to input my data.

585
01:27:54,540 --> 01:28:00,270
Ananda Sen: So I did input my data each row has those four things.

586
01:28:00,270 --> 01:28:06,120
Ananda Sen: age group sample cases and population size.

587
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:25,110
Ananda Sen: And then, once I finished this I ended with a semi colon that look every every line is free of any other notation so unless I finished the data finish typing in debate I should not put semi colon and then it said run.

588
01:28:25,110 --> 01:28:37,680
Ananda Sen: Any question on this one.

589
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:40,170
Ananda Sen: Okay.

590
01:28:40,170 --> 01:28:43,470
Ananda Sen: So what's the statement.

591
01:28:43,470 --> 01:29:20,820
Ananda Sen: The statement says it's again it's in Denmark see Jen MOD has this nice way of changing things by specifying the distribution, so now I this I specify the distribution equal to person here.

592
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:23,370
Ananda Sen: That basically says it's the first.

593
01:29:23,370 --> 01:29:34,620
Ananda Sen: link is law that is actually default for person, but we can be still it's a good idea to just remind ourselves what link functionally us and that's basically saying that the law of.

594
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:46,020
Ananda Sen: Law of averages is a regression model, and then I use this term called offset that's an option offset is equal to lock box now remember.

595
01:29:46,020 --> 01:29:59,640
Ananda Sen: log population is the offset not population size, why is that because no it's not here, but if you go back to the previous slide, which is the.

596
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:09,150
Ananda Sen: Which is the lecture slide you'll see that that the offset is log of PT not PT.

597
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:21,300
Ananda Sen: Then I also want to estimate the ratio it's i'm putting an irr because sometimes in some not some.

598
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:41,610
Ananda Sen: papers or journals you'll find our books, you will find the label incidence rates ratio, so I R stands for incidents related issue so either you can call it ratio, or you can call it incidence rates instead incidence rate.

599
01:30:41,610 --> 01:30:44,220
ratio.

600
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:52,830
Ananda Sen: that's also an accepted.

601
01:30:52,830 --> 01:30:56,520
Ananda Sen: So.

602
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:03,360
Ananda Sen: If I asked for exponential, then it will exponential and that's where the contrast statement comes in.

603
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,970
Ananda Sen: So.

604
01:31:05,970 --> 01:31:13,650
Ananda Sen: it's point 4756 is the estimate, so that basically means.

605
01:31:13,650 --> 01:31:24,030
Ananda Sen: that the incidence rate in St Paul is about 47.56% of that in Dallas.

606
01:31:24,030 --> 01:31:26,580
Okay.

607
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:40,170
Ananda Sen: See the integration is now in terms of incidence rate.

608
01:31:40,170 --> 01:31:57,690
Ananda Sen: there's 47.56% of that in Dallas you could I could say turn around and say this is 52.4% less than that in Dallas that's also fine, but this is also fun.

609
01:31:57,690 --> 01:32:09,900
Ananda Sen: Okay, any question.

610
01:32:09,900 --> 01:32:26,370
Ananda Sen: What I did not do before is to use class they use age, so I have age group here not age not continuous age, but categorical age so, so I will use class age group.

611
01:32:26,370 --> 01:32:38,790
Ananda Sen: And just for the heck of it just changed the indicator to Dallas doesn't matter I could have done it using the other indicator which was.

612
01:32:38,790 --> 01:32:41,220
Ananda Sen: sinful.

613
01:32:41,220 --> 01:32:48,930
Ananda Sen: Otherwise distribution color posts on linkedin equal the log offset equal to Ellen pop.

614
01:32:48,930 --> 01:32:50,280
yeah.

615
01:32:50,280 --> 01:32:52,230
Ananda Sen: So it's it's.

616
01:32:52,230 --> 01:33:07,980
Ananda Sen: The reference category here is the last age group, which is 85 plus and without exception of 75 to 84 everything else is is.

617
01:33:07,980 --> 01:33:33,240
Ananda Sen: Continuous i'm sorry significant and notice one more thing, if you look at the estimates, there is a nice trend coming down so very obvious very clear trend so so as age group increases, then the rate of skin cancer.

618
01:33:33,240 --> 01:33:57,480
Ananda Sen: In this case is the is decreasing.

619
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:02,910
Ananda Sen: Can you test for a significant age if.

620
01:34:02,910 --> 01:34:17,760
Ananda Sen: You can carry out both Walden likelihood ratio test well let's see.

621
01:34:17,760 --> 01:34:56,040
Ananda Sen: Let me go back to my.

622
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:59,760
Ananda Sen: alright.

623
01:34:59,760 --> 01:35:15,720
Ananda Sen: So far I didn't have.

624
01:35:15,720 --> 01:35:26,640
Ananda Sen: Okay, so.

625
01:35:26,640 --> 01:36:00,480
No.

626
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:03,060
Ananda Sen: So here.

627
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:11,220
Ananda Sen: i'm not reading anything just.

628
01:36:11,220 --> 01:36:14,580
Okay, good so.

629
01:36:14,580 --> 01:36:19,200
Ananda Sen: that's the code.

630
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:30,720
Ananda Sen: And then.

631
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,820
Sure i've got.

632
01:36:32,820 --> 01:36:38,370
Ananda Sen: The two and now i've got all these age variables.

633
01:36:38,370 --> 01:36:41,940
Ananda Sen: So, again.

634
01:36:41,940 --> 01:36:49,830
Ananda Sen: If I, if I have to interpret let's say the the 25 to 30 for.

635
01:36:49,830 --> 01:36:51,480
Ananda Sen: Each group.

636
01:36:51,480 --> 01:36:58,920
Ananda Sen: Then under the cockpits again corresponding 25 or 30 for each group, then I would.

637
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:01,470
Ananda Sen: interpret that as.

638
01:37:01,470 --> 01:37:14,100
Ananda Sen: Well what's the ratio once it wouldn't, be it wouldn't be.

639
01:37:14,100 --> 01:37:39,510
Ananda Sen: This is the code.

640
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:52,260
Ananda Sen: estimate age group.

641
01:37:52,260 --> 01:38:01,530
Ananda Sen: Oh, they call it age group two verses eight how many age groups are there other age groups.

642
01:38:01,530 --> 01:38:48,000
123 456-784-5678.

643
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:54,900
Ananda Sen: That should work.

644
01:38:54,900 --> 01:38:58,260
Ananda Sen: Let me see if this works.

645
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:00,180
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: you're missing an A an estimate.

646
01:39:00,180 --> 01:39:01,830
Ananda Sen: Oh, am I.

647
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:05,370
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Unless it's supposed to like be like that.

648
01:39:05,370 --> 01:39:08,010
Ananda Sen: missing a what an estimate.

649
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:13,350
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: isn't a or it because it's not blue it's great it's supposed to be great.

650
01:39:13,350 --> 01:39:18,300
Ananda Sen: Oh, oh that's oh yeah Thank you.

651
01:39:18,300 --> 01:39:23,880
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Thank you.

652
01:39:23,880 --> 01:39:32,310
Ananda Sen: Alright, so let's see if it did something, yes, it did so um.

653
01:39:32,310 --> 01:39:43,560
Ananda Sen: I just wanted to explain shaded version, which is why I did that so minus 3.5480 is what you see on that.

654
01:39:43,560 --> 01:40:14,700
Ananda Sen: The table, and I want to interpret interpret that, with the corresponding to 85 Plus, which is the reference category, and so I exponential that and came out to be 0.0288 so 0.0288 is is the risk of another risk that rate ratio, the average return, so it is, it is only like 2.8%.

655
01:40:14,700 --> 01:40:18,330
Ananda Sen: off of the rate in the.

656
01:40:18,330 --> 01:40:32,130
Ananda Sen: In the 85 plus group so that basically means is 98% less than what you get in the 8585 plus group.

657
01:40:32,130 --> 01:40:34,380
Ananda Sen: Given.

658
01:40:34,380 --> 01:40:38,430
Ananda Sen: Given that.

659
01:40:38,430 --> 01:40:46,590
Ananda Sen: The intercept is that, given the cities, the same, so it is either in Dallas or in St Paul.

660
01:40:46,590 --> 01:40:49,200
Ananda Sen: But the age group is.

661
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:59,250
Ananda Sen: Is is the rate ratio in the second age group, which is 25 and 34 is nice that then the ratio.

662
01:40:59,250 --> 01:41:06,090
Ananda Sen: But the rate incidence rate is 98% less so.

663
01:41:06,090 --> 01:41:18,060
Ananda Sen: that's how you interpret so does that make sense, first of all, these are all negative, if you look at the.

664
01:41:18,060 --> 01:41:31,050
Ananda Sen: log rate they're all negative that we and they're the numbers actually decrease, which means the first age group is more negative, which means the less incidence rate.

665
01:41:31,050 --> 01:41:45,870
Ananda Sen: Second age group is less negative than the first one, so, so it is a little it still less incidence rate but but more than the first age group they're always compared with 85 plus.

666
01:41:45,870 --> 01:41:51,660
Ananda Sen: Right.

667
01:41:51,660 --> 01:42:03,360
Ananda Sen: Are you clear about that.

668
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,970
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: With the 85 plus being the reference category.

669
01:42:05,970 --> 01:42:07,350
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Yes, yes.

670
01:42:07,350 --> 01:42:20,280
Ananda Sen: And, and the fact that minus six and minus three, these are all going, this is actually I said that wrong, this is not going down it's actually going up.

671
01:42:20,280 --> 01:42:37,290
Ananda Sen: minus six is lower than minus three minus is lower than minus two minus two is lower than minus one so so the incidence rate is actually going up across each.

672
01:42:37,290 --> 01:42:42,540
Ananda Sen: Are you clear about that.

673
01:42:42,540 --> 01:43:03,630
Ananda Sen: More negative means Lord number.

674
01:43:03,630 --> 01:43:05,130
Ananda Sen: let's.

675
01:43:05,130 --> 01:43:07,800
Ananda Sen: verify that ourselves.

676
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:15,840
Ananda Sen: let's do one more.

677
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:28,020
Ananda Sen: let's do another.

678
01:43:28,020 --> 01:43:37,170
Ananda Sen: First, one is 15 to 3040 so or 15 to.

679
01:43:37,170 --> 01:43:59,220
24.

680
01:43:59,220 --> 01:44:17,040
Ananda Sen: So why in 0288 and point 0021 So if I go 1524 85 plus there is a much higher reduction 1002 is what 99.8%.

681
01:44:17,040 --> 01:44:41,790
Ananda Sen: So it's 99.8% lower incidence rate is 99.8% lower in the 15 to 24 group compared to 85 plus Group, on the other hand, on the incidence rate is about 2.8% 3% 97% lower in the 25 to 34 age group.

682
01:44:41,790 --> 01:44:52,560
Ananda Sen: All compared to 85 plus.

683
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:55,710
Ananda Sen: Is that point clear.

684
01:44:55,710 --> 01:45:16,650
Ananda Sen: Does anybody want me to explain that one more time.

685
01:45:16,650 --> 01:45:22,170
hey.

686
01:45:22,170 --> 01:45:24,060
Ananda Sen: Then.

687
01:45:24,060 --> 01:45:28,110
Ananda Sen: The next thing is.

688
01:45:28,110 --> 01:45:45,960
Ananda Sen: To do this, overall, is there an overall age effect, and the answer is, if you can guess then So the answer is always going to be yes, because everything is much more significant compared to 85 plus with with a bit, with the exception of the law.

689
01:45:45,960 --> 01:45:47,730
Ananda Sen: So.

690
01:45:47,730 --> 01:46:05,580
Ananda Sen: If I want to do all of these at the same time I would use a contrast statement and the contrast statement would actually express all the age groups, at the same time now there's only a couple of things, I wanted to point out here.

691
01:46:05,580 --> 01:46:08,520
Ananda Sen: If you look at.

692
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:14,070
Ananda Sen: This statement I am now using effect.

693
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:36,510
Ananda Sen: modify and this is what you want, for gentleman, to be able to produce the right results and i'm using a contrast statement and the contrast statement actually allows me to put everything together estimate does it, one by one contrast as an overall thing is just a just a matter of.

694
01:46:36,510 --> 01:46:45,330
Ananda Sen: Its Convention and notice one more thing for age group I do need.

695
01:46:45,330 --> 01:46:58,560
Ananda Sen: seven of them mentioned, not all eight of them, the last last one does not play any role at five plus is not linear or it still doesn't overall thing but there's not playing it all.

696
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:14,550
Ananda Sen: The first one, the first semi colon actually gives you likelihood ratio, the second one gives you a wall test, and let me just quickly.

697
01:47:14,550 --> 01:47:18,060
Ananda Sen: So those are the two things at the end.

698
01:47:18,060 --> 01:47:22,050
Ananda Sen: The two Chi square values are quite different.

699
01:47:22,050 --> 01:47:31,470
Ananda Sen: Because they are derived differently, but they are they're both of them are huge, so it basically says there is an overall edge effect.

700
01:47:31,470 --> 01:47:41,370
Ananda Sen: All seven parameters tested the same time.

701
01:47:41,370 --> 01:47:43,620
Okay.

702
01:47:43,620 --> 01:47:49,650
Ananda Sen: So I just wanted to throw that in so that you get a get some idea of.

703
01:47:49,650 --> 01:48:00,030
Ananda Sen: What is going on.

704
01:48:00,030 --> 01:48:31,860
Ananda Sen: And then, I have a different example, so let me stop this one go back.

705
01:48:31,860 --> 01:48:36,390
Ananda Sen: Alright, so.

706
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:48,210
Ananda Sen: The second example it's it's it has got a few more variables it's a it's a study of a school or two schools actually at.

707
01:48:48,210 --> 01:48:52,170
Ananda Sen: school and one school.

708
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:58,650
Ananda Sen: And are two schools and there are three three different.

709
01:48:58,650 --> 01:49:14,130
Ananda Sen: programs, in which the student is enrolled in a standardized testing mat so so it's a data on schools and the variables that are used here are number of days absent.

710
01:49:14,130 --> 01:49:32,340
Ananda Sen: as a function of gender i'm the individual ID and I think the ids the school ID basically and then math is math program or the math is the.

711
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:44,880
Ananda Sen: it's a percentile rank some standardized rank and math score and the program is, of course, the three programs okay so.

712
01:49:44,880 --> 01:50:02,010
Ananda Sen: So if I just use that data and come up with, and just try to see what the meantime so number of days Apps and the 314 observations on an average, the average is about six six days Apps and on average.

713
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:04,650
Ananda Sen: This is.

714
01:50:04,650 --> 01:50:20,310
Ananda Sen: The whole entire year and then in math the math scores are basically performance of the student there's a madman percent that rank so the students status in math now.

715
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:33,060
Ananda Sen: You can do all these different things with descriptive things with with any of the variables and proximity varied in SAS is one of the procedures which does that.

716
01:50:33,060 --> 01:50:47,730
Ananda Sen: So i've included this here, basically, the idea is that to see that the number of these Apps and is, which is the outcome is a very different type of histogram than.

717
01:50:47,730 --> 01:51:09,090
Ananda Sen: What you're used to seeing there's a whole there's a nice spike at zero and then after that things taper off, and so it is a very highly skewed distribution, which has has a spike at seal so remember that that's that's a that's a typical count data type of scenario.

718
01:51:09,090 --> 01:51:11,070
Ananda Sen: So.

719
01:51:11,070 --> 01:51:20,670
Ananda Sen: So if I ran up with some regression model which I ran run by that project, and then I get this output.

720
01:51:20,670 --> 01:51:32,130
Ananda Sen: We notice first of the both MAC and the program and, by the way, I didn't put in gender here is just our the school year is just a school ID here it's just a mapping program so it's easier to interpret.

721
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:35,190
Ananda Sen: Both physically significant first of all.

722
01:51:35,190 --> 01:51:45,840
Ananda Sen: What are the, what are the values so minus 0.0068 is the estimate, corresponding to math if I exponential that and and subtract.

723
01:51:45,840 --> 01:52:09,510
Ananda Sen: One from it, then our want fun and subtract that from one, then I get about 68% of the blame where hundreds so essentially the interpretation is that, for one percentile rank increase in math score the expected.

724
01:52:09,510 --> 01:52:13,290
Ananda Sen: expected decrease.

725
01:52:13,290 --> 01:52:28,770
Ananda Sen: or site it's expected decrease in number of days absent is about 68% for 1% increase in my math school, but the program has to be fixed so it's it's all within a given Program.

726
01:52:28,770 --> 01:52:42,270
Ananda Sen: So you see, the idea is the same, the idea of interpreting is the same it's just how you are interpreting the outcome, so now it's average number of days.

727
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:58,410
Ananda Sen: But it's a percentage increase it a percentage decrease, that was not the case for linear regression and linear regression you're just talking about more or less here it's what percentage higher and what percentage lower.

728
01:52:58,410 --> 01:53:19,260
Ananda Sen: So if you went to the program so, for example, program one that will be on an average hundred 260% more days absent than a student in program three, given that they have the same percentile ranking math.

729
01:53:19,260 --> 01:53:31,380
Ananda Sen: So.

730
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:42,660
Ananda Sen: Okay, these I have not talked about the goodness of fit and stuff like that, but I just wanted to make sure you understand the the interpretation of the data.

731
01:53:42,660 --> 01:53:46,800
Ananda Sen: So I will go back to.

732
01:53:46,800 --> 01:54:11,160
My lab now absurd D for yeah.

733
01:54:11,160 --> 01:54:22,800
Ananda Sen: Okay, so those are the those are the interpretations come on not too much different from what we did before, except it, the average changes are the outcome changes.

734
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:43,620
Ananda Sen: Can we do residuals like we did for logistic regression, we can we can talk about residuals we can talk about deviance residuals the way we did before you know that covariance pattern and stuff like that Pearson residuals is similar so it's very similar to the logistic regression residuals.

735
01:54:43,620 --> 01:54:52,800
Ananda Sen: There are also a few things standardized residuals and so on and so what what are they used for they are used to check outliers.

736
01:54:52,800 --> 01:55:07,680
Ananda Sen: standardized residuals should be bigger than three four for something to be an outlier and then it can also be used to look at goodness of fit if the residuals versus predicted values are the.

737
01:55:07,680 --> 01:55:17,010
Ananda Sen: True, do not show any pattern then very much like normal linear regression, you would save it is nothing going on now.

738
01:55:17,010 --> 01:55:28,350
Ananda Sen: Talking about predictive value in the in the case of arm counter aggression, the predictive value is X beta.

739
01:55:28,350 --> 01:55:36,330
Ananda Sen: So what is xp xp days just the entire regression equation.

740
01:55:36,330 --> 01:55:45,270
Ananda Sen: For normal distribution average is X beta for positive and negative binomial logarithm of the average is exploited.

741
01:55:45,270 --> 01:55:52,710
Ananda Sen: So you can actually get that out of out of the.

742
01:55:52,710 --> 01:55:55,320
Ananda Sen: From the software.

743
01:55:55,320 --> 01:56:01,290
Ananda Sen: So what, how do you use the residuals for graphical assessment of fit.

744
01:56:01,290 --> 01:56:16,140
Ananda Sen: For persona negative binomial which we're talking about now the residual the SDR s ch I versus predicted value, whether it's predicted or expedia check for outliers and check for residuals versus each covariance.

745
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:23,640
Ananda Sen: Again check for out there, so linear it, these are the two main uses of of residual.

746
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:27,990
Ananda Sen: So.

747
01:56:27,990 --> 01:56:36,900
Ananda Sen: So residual plot is very simple, straightforward and standards so before.

748
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:43,980
Ananda Sen: We will do some exercise together, but before that, let me just go back to the lab one more time.

749
01:56:43,980 --> 01:56:45,630
Ananda Sen: So.

750
01:56:45,630 --> 01:56:56,100
Ananda Sen: So I said that we just ran I ran a gentleman right So if I look at.

751
01:56:56,100 --> 01:57:01,470
Ananda Sen: The goodness of fit statistic and how do I get the goodness of fit system will will will see that.

752
01:57:01,470 --> 01:57:03,840
Ananda Sen: This is the person model.

753
01:57:03,840 --> 01:57:12,540
Ananda Sen: Remember, yesterday we were we were saying that the value over def should be less than one and close to one.

754
01:57:12,540 --> 01:57:17,520
Ananda Sen: Look at the value of would be if.

755
01:57:17,520 --> 01:57:21,480
Ananda Sen: that's a bad fit.

756
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:26,430
Ananda Sen: that's an indicator indicator of a bad fit so.

757
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:33,060
Ananda Sen: I went ahead and ran a negative binomial regression model here.

758
01:57:33,060 --> 01:57:43,680
Ananda Sen: And now see suddenly the value over def it still didn't go below one but get got pretty close to one much better fit.

759
01:57:43,680 --> 01:57:55,740
Ananda Sen: What is the EIC the AC is 174 1.5 4.26 and previously the sc was 266 5.41.

760
01:57:55,740 --> 01:58:04,860
Ananda Sen: or 266 5.28285 sorry.

761
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:11,100
Ananda Sen: Be icy similar order so negative binomial model is a better model that the first song.

762
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:15,570
Ananda Sen: All right, so if I do negative binomial what we get.

763
01:58:15,570 --> 01:58:17,880
Ananda Sen: very similar.

764
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:42,540
Ananda Sen: Except now I have an additional parameter what is that dispersion the dispersion is point 9683 So how do I, how do I do this but, before explaining dispersion let me ask this for you just again for.

765
01:58:42,540 --> 01:58:45,300
Ananda Sen: Your.

766
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:52,020
Ananda Sen: Quick recap or understanding suppose they want you to interpret.

767
01:58:52,020 --> 01:59:35,160
Ananda Sen: 1.2787 that coefficient How would you interpret.

768
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:39,660
Christie Flanagan: Can you remind me what the variable prop is it program one.

769
01:59:39,660 --> 01:59:41,160
Christie Flanagan: Time just Program.

770
01:59:41,160 --> 01:59:43,860
Ananda Sen: You mean the volume and the outcome.

771
01:59:43,860 --> 01:59:44,970
Christie Flanagan: well.

772
01:59:44,970 --> 01:59:56,820
Ananda Sen: program variable program is there are three programs, there are three programs in the in the in the school and they have enrolled students in the programs and it's almost like I was like a treatment in randomized control trial.

773
01:59:56,820 --> 02:00:08,460
Ananda Sen: Okay, oh so, so there are three paper three programs, and they want to see when the weather in any of the programs actually encourage students to have less absentees, so to speak.

774
02:00:08,460 --> 02:00:21,450
Christie Flanagan: So, then, to interpret 1.2787 would it, this is a likelihood test so would it be that students in program one where 1.3 times more likely to attend class.

775
02:00:21,450 --> 02:00:25,680
Actually.

776
02:00:25,680 --> 02:00:29,880
Ananda Sen: do things quickly do something.

777
02:00:29,880 --> 02:00:31,800
here.

778
02:00:31,800 --> 02:00:32,400
Ananda Sen: alright.

779
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:34,170
So.

780
02:00:34,170 --> 02:00:36,840
Ananda Sen: Two things first of all.

781
02:00:36,840 --> 02:00:52,890
Ananda Sen: This is, this is a song right or this is negative binomial whatever it's a country count regression means that the interpretation is in terms of average count, so in this case count is of absentees.

782
02:00:52,890 --> 02:01:07,920
Ananda Sen: So, so it is not likely it is, it is basic little first of all exponential 1.2787 that's the one you would want to interpret so so really.

783
02:01:07,920 --> 02:01:13,980
Ananda Sen: What do you want is this.

784
02:01:13,980 --> 02:01:27,630
Ananda Sen: 3.5.

785
02:01:27,630 --> 02:01:29,370
Ananda Sen: Okay.

786
02:01:29,370 --> 02:01:36,150
Ananda Sen: Tell me now.

787
02:01:36,150 --> 02:01:56,340
Ananda Sen: So 3.59 is the number which probably you should basically.

788
02:01:56,340 --> 02:02:07,980
Ananda Sen: To the we would think about saying, this would be something like.

789
02:02:07,980 --> 02:02:17,820
Ananda Sen: 3.59 minutes, one is 2.5 259% so so either you could say that.

790
02:02:17,820 --> 02:02:25,470
Ananda Sen: The average number of Apps and days.

791
02:02:25,470 --> 02:02:30,360
Ananda Sen: For somebody in program one.

792
02:02:30,360 --> 02:02:41,670
Ananda Sen: Is 3.59 or 3.6 times than the average number of Apps in these in some of somebody in program three.

793
02:02:41,670 --> 02:02:53,130
Ananda Sen: So you're right it's it's times, but the times in terms of average not likely not the probability.

794
02:02:53,130 --> 02:02:58,320
Ananda Sen: Does that make sense.

795
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:01,860
Christie Flanagan: yeah it does, can you see the interpretation statement, one more time yeah.

796
02:03:01,860 --> 02:03:12,600
Ananda Sen: i'm already down here so average number of Apps and days.

797
02:03:12,600 --> 02:03:15,780
Ananda Sen: For a child.

798
02:03:15,780 --> 02:03:20,790
Ananda Sen: In program one.

799
02:03:20,790 --> 02:03:25,920
Ananda Sen: Is a 3.59 times.

800
02:03:25,920 --> 02:03:31,560
Ananda Sen: Higher or not not higher higher than.

801
02:03:31,560 --> 02:03:43,830
Ananda Sen: 3.5 3.59 times.

802
02:03:43,830 --> 02:03:53,520
Ananda Sen: off of them 3.5 times of that for a child.

803
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:59,040
Ananda Sen: In program three when.

804
02:03:59,040 --> 02:04:02,310
They have.

805
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:08,010
The same.

806
02:04:08,010 --> 02:04:16,200
school.

807
02:04:16,200 --> 02:04:21,840
Ananda Sen: fixing the math score compare somebody in program one versus Program.

808
02:04:21,840 --> 02:04:28,620
Ananda Sen: Three 3.59 is what the ratio of the average.

809
02:04:28,620 --> 02:04:36,660
Ananda Sen: epson days is.

810
02:04:36,660 --> 02:04:56,850
Ananda Sen: Okay.

811
02:04:56,850 --> 02:05:05,520
Ananda Sen: Any question.

812
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:12,570
Ananda Sen: What is the alpha what is the dispersion the dispersion is the extra parameter in negative binomial.

813
02:05:12,570 --> 02:05:18,840
Ananda Sen: If the dispersion is more than zero.

814
02:05:18,840 --> 02:05:35,580
Ananda Sen: Then it suggests over dispersion that means very integral than me and, in this case it is more than zero it is point 9683 and the contents limit is also more than zero so, so we will actually.

815
02:05:35,580 --> 02:05:48,180
Ananda Sen: The negative binomial regression model is a more justified model than what's on model, even with regards to dispersion but if dispersion value is is something which.

816
02:05:48,180 --> 02:05:57,210
Ananda Sen: will only come for a negative binomial free not for a person.

817
02:05:57,210 --> 02:06:02,370
Ananda Sen: Okay, we have an exercise which we could do.

818
02:06:02,370 --> 02:06:15,510
Ananda Sen: We could take a break now 659 50 why don't we come back at four take a look at this, we will discuss this when we are back.

819
02:06:15,510 --> 02:15:01,050
Ananda Sen: This is the exercise will do together.

820
02:15:01,050 --> 02:15:03,390
Ananda Sen: Okay.

821
02:15:03,390 --> 02:15:07,290
Ananda Sen: So.

822
02:15:07,290 --> 02:15:56,190
Ananda Sen: Let me.

823
02:15:56,190 --> 02:16:04,290
Christie Flanagan: hey Dr son, I was asked, is it possible to some or to.

824
02:16:04,290 --> 02:16:19,980
Christie Flanagan: provide us with the homework three earlier because I was just thinking that as we go through the power points in the lecture and stuff it would be helpful to see those the questions in advance, I think, because it would help me think more critically about them.

825
02:16:19,980 --> 02:16:21,870
Christie Flanagan: I didn't know if that was possible or not.

826
02:16:21,870 --> 02:16:23,460
Ananda Sen: I can do that today.

827
02:16:23,460 --> 02:16:27,120
Christie Flanagan: Okay wonder if you if you if you don't see it by midnight.

828
02:16:27,120 --> 02:16:29,640
Ananda Sen: Which is midnight my time.

829
02:16:29,640 --> 02:16:34,260
Ananda Sen: Eastern time just whatever time is secure place.

830
02:16:34,260 --> 02:16:37,470
Christie Flanagan: So it'll i'm in Alaska so i'm actually four hours ahead of you.

831
02:16:37,470 --> 02:16:39,120
Ananda Sen: For hours four hours.

832
02:16:39,120 --> 02:16:42,780
Ananda Sen: yeah well I hate me no, no, you are four hours behind no.

833
02:16:42,780 --> 02:16:45,510
Christie Flanagan: or So where are your in its.

834
02:16:45,510 --> 02:16:49,500
Christie Flanagan: Eastern Eastern yeah yeah it's 12:12pm here.

835
02:16:49,500 --> 02:16:52,680
that's right that's right yeah.

836
02:16:52,680 --> 02:16:58,650
Ananda Sen: yeah so so you buy your eight o'clock if you if you don't see just remind me once.

837
02:16:58,650 --> 02:17:02,970
Okay.

838
02:17:02,970 --> 02:17:03,990
Ananda Sen: Okay.

839
02:17:03,990 --> 02:17:08,520
So.

840
02:17:08,520 --> 02:17:12,120
Ananda Sen: So what we're doing we're doing.

841
02:17:12,120 --> 02:17:18,750
Ananda Sen: A plus son regression.

842
02:17:18,750 --> 02:17:26,190
Ananda Sen: So this one, you will tell me what to do so i'm just going to put.

843
02:17:26,190 --> 02:17:41,340
Ananda Sen: program down here.

844
02:17:41,340 --> 02:17:48,540
Ananda Sen: So let me run this.

845
02:17:48,540 --> 02:17:53,190
Ananda Sen: Oh, I don't think I actually ran this before so.

846
02:17:53,190 --> 02:18:35,070
Ananda Sen: Are you will need to.

847
02:18:35,070 --> 02:18:41,130
Ananda Sen: Already.

848
02:18:41,130 --> 02:18:44,370
Ananda Sen: Now.

849
02:18:44,370 --> 02:19:08,160
Ananda Sen: Here is what I run.

850
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:12,180
Ananda Sen: Okay, so.

851
02:19:12,180 --> 02:19:15,240
Ananda Sen: Here are the estimates.

852
02:19:15,240 --> 02:19:21,120
Ananda Sen: So I want to interpret the oh, I should also probably.

853
02:19:21,120 --> 02:19:24,870
Ananda Sen: Do the risk reward ratio because it's.

854
02:19:24,870 --> 02:19:29,880
Ananda Sen: Otherwise it's all that's one of the problems with.

855
02:19:29,880 --> 02:19:38,580
All of these.

856
02:19:38,580 --> 02:19:42,120
Ananda Sen: i've been leave.

857
02:19:42,120 --> 02:20:15,390
Ananda Sen: Now one second let's make sure.

858
02:20:15,390 --> 02:20:20,310
Ananda Sen: So, which one is which.

859
02:20:20,310 --> 02:20:29,400
Ananda Sen: I think it's female equal to one and male equivalent zero minutes.

860
02:20:29,400 --> 02:20:50,670
Ananda Sen: yeah.

861
02:20:50,670 --> 02:20:54,150
Ananda Sen: yeah for some reason.

862
02:20:54,150 --> 02:20:58,050
Ananda Sen: I didn't.

863
02:20:58,050 --> 02:21:21,450
Ananda Sen: I didn't clarify whether it's mainly equal to one.

864
02:21:21,450 --> 02:21:23,670
hmm.

865
02:21:23,670 --> 02:21:28,920
Ananda Sen: yeah i'm assuming that it's a.

866
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:33,750
Ananda Sen: miracle it's a miracle okay.

867
02:21:33,750 --> 02:21:51,000
Ananda Sen: So.

868
02:21:51,000 --> 02:22:03,810
Ananda Sen: So I want to make sure that we have all the numbers.

869
02:22:03,810 --> 02:22:07,440
Ananda Sen: All right, so.

870
02:22:07,440 --> 02:22:16,380
Ananda Sen: i've got the the ratio that's point 7847 So how do you explain that.

871
02:22:16,380 --> 02:22:57,210
Ananda Sen: that's, the first thing.

872
02:22:57,210 --> 02:23:00,450
Ananda Sen: So if I get a rate ratio of.

873
02:23:00,450 --> 02:23:05,550
Ananda Sen: Point 7847 males versus females.

874
02:23:05,550 --> 02:23:54,720
Ananda Sen: How would they indifferent there.

875
02:23:54,720 --> 02:24:06,930
Ananda Sen: see what you think it's it's it's accepting the fact that it could be wrong and unless it's wrong, you would never know what the truth, but the correct one is so.

876
02:24:06,930 --> 02:24:10,080
Ananda Sen: Go ahead.

877
02:24:10,080 --> 02:24:19,290
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: So i'm thinking it's the meals are 21.6%.

878
02:24:19,290 --> 02:24:21,330
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Something.

879
02:24:21,330 --> 02:24:23,880
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: I am trying to.

880
02:24:23,880 --> 02:24:27,420
Ananda Sen: Do I want six person is correct that's that's The first step is correct.

881
02:24:27,420 --> 02:24:32,880
Ananda Sen: Yes, by, why is that oh.

882
02:24:32,880 --> 02:24:35,580
Ananda Sen: it's a ratio right so rate ratio.

883
02:24:35,580 --> 02:24:50,010
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: yeah compared to women are female but then i'm getting stuck thinking about this because there's something with math but then there's three programs, I guess, this program three is the the one you're comparing it to.

884
02:24:50,010 --> 02:24:50,730
Ananda Sen: No, no.

885
02:24:50,730 --> 02:24:57,990
Ananda Sen: No, no, no, no, no program has to be fixed all the other variables in the model will have to be fixed.

886
02:24:57,990 --> 02:25:04,380
Ananda Sen: So you could compare a man a male to female student only in the same Program.

887
02:25:04,380 --> 02:25:07,230
Ananda Sen: And, with the same math score.

888
02:25:07,230 --> 02:25:09,510
Okay.

889
02:25:09,510 --> 02:25:26,370
Ananda Sen: let's say, those are fixed now now, how do you how do you interpret this is 21.6% of what again what the outcome remember the outcome, the.

890
02:25:26,370 --> 02:25:28,080
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: outcome is de de.

891
02:25:28,080 --> 02:25:29,160
Ananda Sen: These absent yeah.

892
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:33,420
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: yeah so uh the.

893
02:25:33,420 --> 02:25:39,150
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: males are 21.6%.

894
02:25:39,150 --> 02:25:43,020
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: In the same program more absent, then.

895
02:25:43,020 --> 02:25:45,090
Ananda Sen: Yes, let's let's out.

896
02:25:45,090 --> 02:25:45,450
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Okay.

897
02:25:45,450 --> 02:25:46,530
Ananda Sen: Because it's less sense.

898
02:25:46,530 --> 02:25:48,000
Ananda Sen: Okay, because we.

899
02:25:48,000 --> 02:25:48,330
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: got it.

900
02:25:48,330 --> 02:25:49,830
Ananda Sen: Because it's less than one yeah.

901
02:25:49,830 --> 02:25:50,850
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Yes, yes, yes, yes.

902
02:25:50,850 --> 02:25:52,170
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: yeah yeah okay.

903
02:25:52,170 --> 02:25:56,970
Ananda Sen: All right, yeah.

904
02:25:56,970 --> 02:25:59,610
Ananda Sen: But you know you're getting there so it's it's good it's good.

905
02:25:59,610 --> 02:26:01,110
Ananda Sen: Yes, um.

906
02:26:01,110 --> 02:26:02,910
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: guys a question here.

907
02:26:02,910 --> 02:26:04,770
um.

908
02:26:04,770 --> 02:26:16,800
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: you give us the equation to calculate the 21.6% from the actual value the estimate so that's what I did, but then you ran this other one that you know you just subtract from one.

909
02:26:16,800 --> 02:26:26,250
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Do you just add that in a separate one because it's easier and quicker or like can you just you know what I mean because you said, the one.

910
02:26:26,250 --> 02:26:35,670
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: One minus the exponential of the value of that estimate, you can actually just calculate it yourself, but you just calculate it in here because it's just as easy right.

911
02:26:35,670 --> 02:26:39,630
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: yeah yeah.

912
02:26:39,630 --> 02:26:42,630
Your.

913
02:26:42,630 --> 02:26:52,140
Ananda Sen: Questions comments.

914
02:26:52,140 --> 02:26:58,770
Christie Flanagan: So i'm actually looking at the the lab for data are the codes in on my end.

915
02:26:58,770 --> 02:27:03,060
Christie Flanagan: yeah and in their.

916
02:27:03,060 --> 02:27:15,420
Christie Flanagan: Online 134 it says percent Inc and then it has the users and the username Do I need to put my username there too, as well, because it wasn't up at the top, there was no place to change it at the top.

917
02:27:15,420 --> 02:27:23,490
Ananda Sen: yeah so, so I think that one is it is, it is, including something like one what was what was it.

918
02:27:23,490 --> 02:27:24,450
Christie Flanagan: yeah it is.

919
02:27:24,450 --> 02:27:25,410
Christie Flanagan: Doing.

920
02:27:25,410 --> 02:27:26,400
Ananda Sen: Is that.

921
02:27:26,400 --> 02:27:39,000
Ananda Sen: We need to you right so vaughn says, I actually haven't come to that, yet, but wrong that says is another another sass file, which needs to be.

922
02:27:39,000 --> 02:27:42,930
Ananda Sen: Put in in the in the in the home.

923
02:27:42,930 --> 02:27:49,350
Ananda Sen: On your SAS folder or fast on demand and then.

924
02:27:49,350 --> 02:27:53,280
Ananda Sen: You need to that include the whole include thing.

925
02:27:53,280 --> 02:27:55,470
Ananda Sen: The path needs to be changed to your path.

926
02:27:55,470 --> 02:28:00,000
Christie Flanagan: Yes, okay thanks for the clarification yeah yeah yeah.

927
02:28:00,000 --> 02:28:09,300
Ananda Sen: And i'll come to that, I haven't done that yet, but any other questions about this.

928
02:28:09,300 --> 02:28:22,440
Ananda Sen: All right, that takes care of the first question and then and and the p value is less than but usually significant Plaza point 010001 so so that.

929
02:28:22,440 --> 02:28:29,910
Ananda Sen: That is significantly less than the previous so now.

930
02:28:29,910 --> 02:28:35,820
Ananda Sen: asked two questions about testing, so one of them is.

931
02:28:35,820 --> 02:28:41,760
Ananda Sen: destiny equality between program one and two, so, if you look at this, you would find that.

932
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:52,680
Ananda Sen: program one and program three you can already compute or only calculate because, because the the estimated 1.27 or seven the p value is less than point or one.

933
02:28:52,680 --> 02:29:08,040
Ananda Sen: So that that comparison has already been made program to versus program three comparison is also been made because it's the point 9447 is the is the estimate and then less than point 0.0001 is to be better.

934
02:29:08,040 --> 02:29:13,320
Ananda Sen: What about program one program to that's not here.

935
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:20,400
Ananda Sen: Can you calculate that can you can you do that different and how do you do that.

936
02:29:20,400 --> 02:29:29,100
Ananda Sen: And again, this is not new to you it's a We have done this, at least in the context of logistic regression and.

937
02:29:29,100 --> 02:29:33,540
Ananda Sen: And even today so.

938
02:29:33,540 --> 02:29:59,520
Ananda Sen: So tell me.

939
02:29:59,520 --> 02:30:05,820
Ananda Sen: program one versus program to that's what we want first of all, what is the statement we should use in.

940
02:30:05,820 --> 02:30:17,250
in general.

941
02:30:17,250 --> 02:30:22,680
Ananda Sen: I can add that here actually.

942
02:30:22,680 --> 02:30:31,680
Ananda Sen: Is the same.

943
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:34,530
Ananda Sen: What statement is is it.

944
02:30:34,530 --> 02:30:41,430
Ananda Sen: Is it estimate.

945
02:30:41,430 --> 02:30:52,560
Ananda Sen: I want to do a comparison of program one and program to program remember is.

946
02:30:52,560 --> 02:31:07,170
Ananda Sen: The three category variables.

947
02:31:07,170 --> 02:31:13,410
Ananda Sen: We have done a similar thing when we looked at.

948
02:31:13,410 --> 02:31:16,680
Ananda Sen: For.

949
02:31:16,680 --> 02:31:31,020
Ananda Sen: The linear regression example we were looking at differences in grace, we were doing black versus white black versus other white versus other we were doing a very, very similar thing except we were using from glm at that point.

950
02:31:31,020 --> 02:31:33,690
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: yeah Is it the the one negative one.

951
02:31:33,690 --> 02:31:36,990
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: yeah that's right yeah I was trying to look for us, I was.

952
02:31:36,990 --> 02:31:39,660
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Looking cheating and going back to your old things and I was Sir.

953
02:31:39,660 --> 02:31:41,820
Ananda Sen: Oh no that's not.

954
02:31:41,820 --> 02:31:44,070
Ananda Sen: that's that's what you should.

955
02:31:44,070 --> 02:31:48,330
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Not searching for me sounds like Okay, I know it was about race so estimate.

956
02:31:48,330 --> 02:31:51,180
Yes, yes.

957
02:31:51,180 --> 02:32:05,400
Ananda Sen: And then you have to label it something so so we can label it maybe program one versus two something like that, and then the variable name, what is the variable name.

958
02:32:05,400 --> 02:32:07,980
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Is it Prague is that.

959
02:32:07,980 --> 02:32:12,210
Ananda Sen: yeah and then what what should be the labels here.

960
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:19,620
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: I wanted to so one negative one zero that's right oh my.

961
02:32:19,620 --> 02:32:20,700
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: God.

962
02:32:20,700 --> 02:32:25,770
Ananda Sen: And then the semicolon that's it you don't need anything else.

963
02:32:25,770 --> 02:32:39,270
Ananda Sen: So that should do my program one versus two let's see.

964
02:32:39,270 --> 02:32:52,530
There you go.

965
02:32:52,530 --> 02:32:59,160
Ananda Sen: Okay.

966
02:32:59,160 --> 02:33:09,780
Ananda Sen: 1.5312 and then.

967
02:33:09,780 --> 02:33:12,690
Ananda Sen: Okay, so.

968
02:33:12,690 --> 02:33:22,080
Ananda Sen: One check for you to see if this is actually doing the right thing, look at this number point four two.

969
02:33:22,080 --> 02:33:43,650
Ananda Sen: can see that it's point four to 6060814260 what is that point four to six look at program one program to estimate 1.2 7.8447 if you subtract program from program one you would get exactly point four to 60.

970
02:33:43,650 --> 02:33:46,290
Ananda Sen: So it is doing the right thing.

971
02:33:46,290 --> 02:33:56,490
Ananda Sen: It is doing the right thing that's a quick check to make sure that you're getting the right thing.

972
02:33:56,490 --> 02:34:05,160
Ananda Sen: Now, if you can you can also exponential that the same way that for male and try to get the ratio, but this is good enough.

973
02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:20,340
Ananda Sen: And if you're looking at the p value you'll notice that the p value again is pretty high so so program one is the number of days absent in program one is higher than program to is higher than program three.

974
02:34:20,340 --> 02:34:34,230
Ananda Sen: That is kind of food and so so so we don't know what the programs are, but it seems like that that program threes probably some incentive some incentive for not.

975
02:34:34,230 --> 02:34:36,510
Ananda Sen: being absent.

976
02:34:36,510 --> 02:34:48,930
Ananda Sen: program to is probably less intensive a lab or not so much interventional and problem one maybe just the state the usual.

977
02:34:48,930 --> 02:34:55,560
Ananda Sen: way standard of care, or whatever you call it in this context okay.

978
02:34:55,560 --> 02:35:03,780
Ananda Sen: We don't know what the problems are so if we didn't know them that it would have made more sense but i'm read this point i'm just looking at.

979
02:35:03,780 --> 02:35:10,170
Ananda Sen: The interpretation that that makes sense.

980
02:35:10,170 --> 02:35:14,280
Ananda Sen: So again, the estimated statement is the one which you need to use.

981
02:35:14,280 --> 02:35:24,630
Ananda Sen: Now, telling me i've also asked this desk for overall program effect when I say overall program effect, I just mean just.

982
02:35:24,630 --> 02:35:36,210
Ananda Sen: Is there a difference between the progress, well, we already know their differences, but overall, if I had to do it, overall, then how can I do this.

983
02:35:36,210 --> 02:35:39,360
Ananda Sen: And the hint is.

984
02:35:39,360 --> 02:35:56,520
Ananda Sen: You just need to add as an option to the model statement just a single word what is that word.

985
02:35:56,520 --> 02:35:59,580
Ananda Sen: So, right after the slash you need to.

986
02:35:59,580 --> 02:36:09,120
Ananda Sen: add a word.

987
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:15,840
Ananda Sen: I didn't tell you what test, you want to do, I mean you can do likelihood ratio, or you could do walled.

988
02:36:15,840 --> 02:36:32,220
Ananda Sen: Now, if you add a word here, it will let you do the likelihood ratio test overall what is that.

989
02:36:32,220 --> 02:36:41,790
Ananda Sen: By the way, if you if you hover around this, then it will give you the things you can put in as options so.

990
02:36:41,790 --> 02:36:43,740
Ananda Sen: But.

991
02:36:43,740 --> 02:36:46,110
Ananda Sen: don't have to.

992
02:36:46,110 --> 02:36:52,680
Ananda Sen: Do you remember this.

993
02:36:52,680 --> 02:36:54,960
Ananda Sen: Take three.

994
02:36:54,960 --> 02:37:11,550
Ananda Sen: By three gives you the likelihood ratio test of overall so let's see how that works here.

995
02:37:11,550 --> 02:37:15,090
Ananda Sen: There you go.

996
02:37:15,090 --> 02:37:25,320
Ananda Sen: So you see what you see here is an overall test program has two degrees of freedom because there are three programs.

997
02:37:25,320 --> 02:37:34,320
Ananda Sen: And the Chi square value is 295 and be valid so oh no.

998
02:37:34,320 --> 02:37:47,760
Ananda Sen: So that gives you the overall test, if you want to do pairwise test, then you have to specify the estimate and.

999
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:52,920
Ananda Sen: Okay.

1000
02:37:52,920 --> 02:38:06,030
alright.

1001
02:38:06,030 --> 02:38:20,760
Ananda Sen: Any questions.

1002
02:38:20,760 --> 02:38:23,520
Ananda Sen: I am.

1003
02:38:23,520 --> 02:38:26,760
Ananda Sen: actually going to update.

1004
02:38:26,760 --> 02:38:41,100
Ananda Sen: The the lab codes which will include these steps so so they will be annotated as exercise, so you know what we are referring to, so.

1005
02:38:41,100 --> 02:38:45,390
Ananda Sen: still have all of those.

1006
02:38:45,390 --> 02:38:54,870
Ananda Sen: Okay.

1007
02:38:54,870 --> 02:39:15,540
Ananda Sen: So um What about the predictive value so let's quickly go through this, this is the way to do predictive values so again i'm using a negative binomial regression just to there's, no, no reason I do so, I so i'll just do a negative right now with aggression and then.

1008
02:39:15,540 --> 02:39:23,340
Ananda Sen: Using the ABS, as it is absent, as.

1009
02:39:23,340 --> 02:39:38,280
Ananda Sen: outcome math and program at the to gender, I have taken out distribution is negative binomial and link is long, then i've got a bunch of output and predicted command, so the output is out.

1010
02:39:38,280 --> 02:39:43,950
Ananda Sen: predicted is spread one red one is where i'm storing the predictive values.

1011
02:39:43,950 --> 02:40:23,910
Ananda Sen: out output data set is and be underscored pred and then there is a whole bunch of residuals so 123456 types of residuals I don't have to do all of them and i'm just showing you this and then i'm printing the nb pred data Okay, so this is how it looks like.

1012
02:40:23,910 --> 02:40:30,300
Ananda Sen: In the moment you asked for these it just brings you a whole lot of stuff.

1013
02:40:30,300 --> 02:40:40,620
Ananda Sen: Before you even asking the bed, there are some things like cooks the and leverage, those are to identify influential observations and are.

1014
02:40:40,620 --> 02:40:43,650
Ananda Sen: going to look at that.

1015
02:40:43,650 --> 02:40:47,850
Ananda Sen: For each program and each.

1016
02:40:47,850 --> 02:40:52,650
Ananda Sen: And the math scores it prints.

1017
02:40:52,650 --> 02:40:59,400
Ananda Sen: At a time series type of plot don't worry about all of those the one which.

1018
02:40:59,400 --> 02:41:02,160
Ananda Sen: I usually.

1019
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:16,350
Ananda Sen: Look at are these these things, the diagnostic statistics for days and so these are the residual plot the residual plots don't show much of a pattern it's it's it's a little bit especially.

1020
02:41:16,350 --> 02:41:31,320
Ananda Sen: These plots they are there, there is no pattern, you see, and that's all you really need linear predicted versus residuals should not showing any pattern, and you could ask for.

1021
02:41:31,320 --> 02:41:33,270
Ananda Sen: For this.

1022
02:41:33,270 --> 02:41:38,910
Ananda Sen: even farther than if you wanted to.

1023
02:41:38,910 --> 02:41:43,740
Ananda Sen: yeah I think I think that's that's basically all I needed.

1024
02:41:43,740 --> 02:41:56,940
Ananda Sen: One sometimes does other plots I mean there is, there is no reason to just do residual plots and this is very common when people do presentations or or.

1025
02:41:56,940 --> 02:42:05,880
Ananda Sen: or write papers, there is one thing I did I predicted for each.

1026
02:42:05,880 --> 02:42:17,670
Ananda Sen: program our plot of math score versus days attendance and that looks something like this.

1027
02:42:17,670 --> 02:42:28,740
Ananda Sen: So these are these three are the three programs program three program to program one and, as you can see, for program on.

1028
02:42:28,740 --> 02:42:37,500
Ananda Sen: The predictive value for.

1029
02:42:37,500 --> 02:42:45,030
Ananda Sen: The predictive value is this and and for program to which is.

1030
02:42:45,030 --> 02:42:57,090
Ananda Sen: Which is the red one the bridge value with that and then for this as a function of matt score, this is the function matt score the Program.

1031
02:42:57,090 --> 02:43:04,740
Ananda Sen: The present value looks like there's no greater value of what this is the predictive value of number of days absent.

1032
02:43:04,740 --> 02:43:06,060
Okay.

1033
02:43:06,060 --> 02:43:09,270
Ananda Sen: But this is stratified by matt score.

1034
02:43:09,270 --> 02:43:14,340
Ananda Sen: Is a favorite program is the function with matt score they look similar.

1035
02:43:14,340 --> 02:43:19,350
Ananda Sen: They look similar, but as a function of math score, this is the.

1036
02:43:19,350 --> 02:43:22,770
Ananda Sen: This is, these are for each of the programs.

1037
02:43:22,770 --> 02:43:31,230
The predicted them.

1038
02:43:31,230 --> 02:43:34,770
Ananda Sen: All right.

1039
02:43:34,770 --> 02:43:37,950
Ananda Sen: So almost like an interaction blob.

1040
02:43:37,950 --> 02:43:40,380
Ananda Sen: So.

1041
02:43:40,380 --> 02:43:53,910
Ananda Sen: Let me stop this one and go to.

1042
02:43:53,910 --> 02:44:01,320
Ananda Sen: So I wrote, can you repeat the exercise of creating residuals and prediction values, because unless there's something there's something you can do.

1043
02:44:01,320 --> 02:44:05,010
Ananda Sen: As a practice.

1044
02:44:05,010 --> 02:44:12,300
Ananda Sen: I did it for negative binomial just repeat that for posts on distribution see how things are.

1045
02:44:12,300 --> 02:44:26,760
Ananda Sen: Very little change in the programs, but you have all the program just to see for yourself how that looks and how it is different from the negative binomial.

1046
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:30,210
Ananda Sen: Alright, so.

1047
02:44:30,210 --> 02:44:36,120
Ananda Sen: One of the other ones.

1048
02:44:36,120 --> 02:44:41,730
Ananda Sen: And this is actually.

1049
02:44:41,730 --> 02:44:48,900
No, not lab lab look at the date for yeah.

1050
02:44:48,900 --> 02:44:58,350
Ananda Sen: So the last topic encounter regression, is what is called zero inflated model, so what is the zero inflated model so let's understand that.

1051
02:44:58,350 --> 02:45:14,820
Ananda Sen: So I think it's best understood through an example so again the school administrator Oh, I see there is, there is the yeah we right so so it was quoted as male equal to one.

1052
02:45:14,820 --> 02:45:27,060
Ananda Sen: So predictors of number of days of absence include gender and student and standardized discourse in math and language arts so that's a full data set I was only using a part of the dataset.

1053
02:45:27,060 --> 02:45:29,040
Are you sharing.

1054
02:45:29,040 --> 02:45:35,550
Ananda Sen: Well i'm not sharing my screen Of course not.

1055
02:45:35,550 --> 02:45:48,240
Ananda Sen: array.

1056
02:45:48,240 --> 02:45:51,750
Okay.

1057
02:45:51,750 --> 02:46:09,090
Ananda Sen: So, as I was saying, this is the one we're going to talk about doing fitted models and for that i'm starting off with an example, the example is the same example i'm i'm just using one additional.

1058
02:46:09,090 --> 02:46:16,140
Ananda Sen: digging out program and then adding a language arts score that's another standardized score.

1059
02:46:16,140 --> 02:46:21,030
Ananda Sen: And this is a description means tentative vision minimum maximum.

1060
02:46:21,030 --> 02:46:32,400
Ananda Sen: Okay, this is how it is absolutely looks it's a it's a again a typical count data type of histogram on the left on the.

1061
02:46:32,400 --> 02:46:34,710
Ananda Sen: Zero you have a spike.

1062
02:46:34,710 --> 02:46:41,790
Ananda Sen: And everything else looks like a right skewed histogram.

1063
02:46:41,790 --> 02:46:44,280
Ananda Sen: For.

1064
02:46:44,280 --> 02:46:51,990
Ananda Sen: If I ran the persona regression, by the way this this one looks a little different this output, because this was a State out what I was using.

1065
02:46:51,990 --> 02:47:00,720
Ananda Sen: And I do not remember why was he was in state output, but, but you can obviously do this Hilton in.

1066
02:47:00,720 --> 02:47:13,530
Ananda Sen: SAS so that the real question is not the not the not the software, but, but what output really means again predictors are of language arts and male where each.

1067
02:47:13,530 --> 02:47:16,110
Ananda Sen: Statistically significant.

1068
02:47:16,110 --> 02:47:17,580
Ananda Sen: and

1069
02:47:17,580 --> 02:47:20,670
Ananda Sen: matt was borderline.

1070
02:47:20,670 --> 02:47:29,460
Ananda Sen: Perhaps because language arts now is taking up eating up most of the variability.

1071
02:47:29,460 --> 02:47:31,770
Ananda Sen: again.

1072
02:47:31,770 --> 02:47:34,200
Ananda Sen: If we.

1073
02:47:34,200 --> 02:47:47,010
Ananda Sen: Looked at expected lock count for one unit increase in its language arts is was negative 0.01 to one and.

1074
02:47:47,010 --> 02:48:03,060
Ananda Sen: This translates to a decrease in average number of days Apps and have about 100 minus hundred times one minus exponential minus 0.01 to one.

1075
02:48:03,060 --> 02:49:00,660
Ananda Sen: And if I do that it's it's 20% the 20% decrease that that's actually a little strange, let me just make sure that I got the right number.

1076
02:49:00,660 --> 02:49:14,490
Ananda Sen: So.

1077
02:49:14,490 --> 02:49:23,310
Ananda Sen: So minus point 0121 actually does not.

1078
02:49:23,310 --> 02:49:30,030
Ananda Sen: translate to this, so if I did, one minus exponential.

1079
02:49:30,030 --> 02:49:33,930
Ananda Sen: 0.0121.

1080
02:49:33,930 --> 02:49:37,050
Ananda Sen: Then I get about.

1081
02:49:37,050 --> 02:49:46,440
1.2% so.

1082
02:49:46,440 --> 02:49:53,640
Ananda Sen: there's not a 20% decrease, I will I will change this.

1083
02:49:53,640 --> 02:49:56,340
Ananda Sen: and

1084
02:49:56,340 --> 02:50:13,260
Ananda Sen: and update this so so so that's that's that's a mistake it's a mistake date and a word that 20% came from, so it is 1.2% so the transfer the decrease in average number of days Apps and is about 1.2% now.

1085
02:50:13,260 --> 02:50:18,450
Ananda Sen: Remember the language our score is a standardized score.

1086
02:50:18,450 --> 02:50:30,060
Ananda Sen: Which means it's a one standard deviation increase in language arts score for a fixed gender and that's what it's it's a clunky interpretation in the sense that you have to.

1087
02:50:30,060 --> 02:50:42,660
Ananda Sen: do everything in terms of standard deviation but but it's a standardized score so that's that's why it's unit free is no unit so so you have to interpret it that way.

1088
02:50:42,660 --> 02:50:55,530
Ananda Sen: Gender has to be fixed math score has to be fixed once you do that when you compare two people one has.

1089
02:50:55,530 --> 02:51:00,900
Ananda Sen: it's a one standard deviation increase in language arts which correspond to.

1090
02:51:00,900 --> 02:51:05,730
Ananda Sen: 1.2% less fewer days at.

1091
02:51:05,730 --> 02:51:07,170
Good.

1092
02:51:07,170 --> 02:51:19,620
Ananda Sen: Similarly, if you go with the main students main students as an expected log kind of negative point for now that changes to about translates to about 33% fewer days absent.

1093
02:51:19,620 --> 02:51:25,200
Ananda Sen: On average.

1094
02:51:25,200 --> 02:51:28,140
Ananda Sen: So same interpretation as before.

1095
02:51:28,140 --> 02:51:31,110
Ananda Sen: So let's do a zero inflated mama.

1096
02:51:31,110 --> 02:51:41,310
Ananda Sen: What is the 00 infinite model is that see Boston has a zero on the left.

1097
02:51:41,310 --> 02:51:45,630
Ananda Sen: Sometimes they added zeros in the model.

1098
02:51:45,630 --> 02:51:52,020
Ananda Sen: What do we mean by added deals well added zeros could be something like this.

1099
02:51:52,020 --> 02:51:59,310
Ananda Sen: let's its best interpreted in terms of.

1100
02:51:59,310 --> 02:52:08,250
Ananda Sen: An example and this example, this is typically used there is a resort where people have gone and catching fish.

1101
02:52:08,250 --> 02:52:17,100
Ananda Sen: Some zeros result from fishing and not being able to catch any fish some zeros resolved for not fishing at all, not everybody will fish there so.

1102
02:52:17,100 --> 02:52:32,070
Ananda Sen: But the ones who did not finish they had no chance of catching any fish so they're zeros are different than the others zeros but nonetheless in the model it's a zero.

1103
02:52:32,070 --> 02:52:36,480
Ananda Sen: To the model will not be able to distinguish that.

1104
02:52:36,480 --> 02:52:49,620
Ananda Sen: So zito infant and model actually allows you to model, the two things separately so So what is the likelihood of somebody not fishing.

1105
02:52:49,620 --> 02:53:01,710
Ananda Sen: that's one and then what is the, what are the chances of fishing and not our average number of fishes you caught when you when you finished.

1106
02:53:01,710 --> 02:53:07,740
Ananda Sen: If these two these two amount of models can be can be modeled separately, but if you want to.

1107
02:53:07,740 --> 02:53:15,750
Ananda Sen: catch them together or or tie them together, then what then you get what is called a zero inflated model.

1108
02:53:15,750 --> 02:53:34,950
Ananda Sen: there's some technicalities here and i'm going to skip that but but zero in front of modern really is the observed count really is a product of two things, and one of them is a binary variable and the other is account variable the binary variable 01.

1109
02:53:34,950 --> 02:53:52,380
Ananda Sen: finished not finished and and the count is, if you finished, how many physical see so there's two different things, but when you multiply them then it's, then what you get is this the count.

1110
02:53:52,380 --> 02:53:56,070
Okay.

1111
02:53:56,070 --> 02:53:57,750
Ananda Sen: So.

1112
02:53:57,750 --> 02:54:09,810
Ananda Sen: It is a combination of account model and the logistic on Anna and a binary model so logistic regression and account regression do things together.

1113
02:54:09,810 --> 02:54:23,370
Ananda Sen: Both can be modeled as covariance model as a function of poverty rates and and then they can be tied together and presented that way.

1114
02:54:23,370 --> 02:54:26,940
Ananda Sen: Now, one question is.

1115
02:54:26,940 --> 02:54:42,270
Ananda Sen: He Do you really need a zero in fitted model zip, by the way, is the acronym for zero infrared posts on Z I n B is an acronym for zero inflated negative by know.

1116
02:54:42,270 --> 02:54:57,180
Ananda Sen: So, so the question is, do you do need a zero infected model, and you can check it formally it's a very simple test actually you can create this test statistic.

1117
02:54:57,180 --> 02:55:08,580
Ananda Sen: Which is a function of the variance mean and of the count of the account and then also the sample size.

1118
02:55:08,580 --> 02:55:28,890
Ananda Sen: And if you put them together, it is just stick, which should be close to zero close to normal one normal normal 01 and in for the fishing example, it is hundred and 70 huge huge huge significant so so that is that is definitely.

1119
02:55:28,890 --> 02:55:35,610
Ananda Sen: An indication that there is something that's happening zip dispersion happening over this question.

1120
02:55:35,610 --> 02:55:51,540
Ananda Sen: So the school example again if we did the school example and ran the zero infinite model i'll tell you how to run the delivery model in SAS but let's say we ran the zoom for that model, and then they see in stayed at his data.

1121
02:55:51,540 --> 02:56:03,780
Ananda Sen: It does say that the inflation model is legit and and, and this is, this is the model we ran, so there are two parts to the model output now.

1122
02:56:03,780 --> 02:56:11,010
Ananda Sen: two parts of the model output, so one part is giving you the account.

1123
02:56:11,010 --> 02:56:15,390
Ananda Sen: number of days Apps are average number of days Apps.

1124
02:56:15,390 --> 02:56:29,880
Ananda Sen: matt language arts male female there and the other one is that inflate model inflate is the zero and fitted model that's the 01.

1125
02:56:29,880 --> 02:56:35,220
Ananda Sen: number of days absent, is there an additional extra set of zero.

1126
02:56:35,220 --> 02:56:48,060
Ananda Sen: The two things we have contributed here at the school and the main, so there is a school variable here, there are two schools involved so is one school in a different from the other.

1127
02:56:48,060 --> 02:56:56,520
Ananda Sen: So the question now is how do we interpret this.

1128
02:56:56,520 --> 02:56:58,920
Ananda Sen: First of all.

1129
02:56:58,920 --> 02:57:13,140
Ananda Sen: Is the zero infected person regression model predicting days Apps and from language or some gender was historically significant, the answer is yes, because that's that's something which.

1130
02:57:13,140 --> 02:57:16,170
Ananda Sen: is shown here the p value is.

1131
02:57:16,170 --> 02:57:30,900
Ananda Sen: Less than point one and, like a great statistic is 69 so that's that's basically saying the model is needed Okay, and then.

1132
02:57:30,900 --> 02:57:39,090
Ananda Sen: The predictors of count language arts and me, David each district is significant.

1133
02:57:39,090 --> 02:57:53,340
Ananda Sen: So mail is less than point or one or one and language arts who lives in point or one matt, on the other hand, has now become really non signature okay so that's fine.

1134
02:57:53,340 --> 02:58:04,740
Ananda Sen: And here I have corrected so they expected locked on for a one unit increase in language arts was minus 0.01.

1135
02:58:04,740 --> 02:58:16,950
Ananda Sen: This translates to a decrease of about 1% on an average for a one standard deviation increase and language arts when gender maps for the health conscious and not change from the description before.

1136
02:58:16,950 --> 02:58:35,760
Ananda Sen: And, and the same same thing is true here male students had a log expected Count of minus 0.25 less than the female students, which amounts to about 22% fewer days Apps and then females, on average, while holding language arts and math course constant very similar to what we did before.

1137
02:58:35,760 --> 02:59:00,540
Ananda Sen: So there is no change in in India petition for the count model, where does the change come the change comes, because there is also an inflation model, so what is inflation model well there, there is the second part of the model which says inflate and let's try to look at the.

1138
02:59:00,540 --> 02:59:20,280
Ananda Sen: The things here to the predictors of success zeros which is school and meal or both physically significant all right, this means that one school has exponential 1.15 that's 3.16.

1139
02:59:20,280 --> 02:59:23,130
Ananda Sen: times higher.

1140
02:59:23,130 --> 02:59:25,620
Ananda Sen: odds.

1141
02:59:25,620 --> 02:59:28,770
Ananda Sen: This is on.

1142
02:59:28,770 --> 02:59:40,770
Ananda Sen: The previous one, is count the inflate model is odds because it's basically basically modeling the likelihood of zero.

1143
02:59:40,770 --> 02:59:45,390
Ananda Sen: Access zero.

1144
02:59:45,390 --> 02:59:49,800
Ananda Sen: So I would say something like this means that one school has.

1145
02:59:49,800 --> 02:59:55,140
Ananda Sen: 3.16 times higher.

1146
02:59:55,140 --> 03:00:11,940
Ananda Sen: than the other in producing excess zeros Father melter at 2.4 times higher odds than females to contribute to access zeros the number of days Apps.

1147
03:00:11,940 --> 03:00:21,750
Ananda Sen: So basically, there are two models one model is a logistic regression model, the other one is account regression model you interpret them separately.

1148
03:00:21,750 --> 03:00:35,160
Ananda Sen: Like you do for a logistic regression and for account rubbish that's all you do only thing to remember is that the logistic regression model is the model for access zero.

1149
03:00:35,160 --> 03:00:43,380
Ananda Sen: not something which is already modeled by counter aggression, because counted Russian model, the person regression model also incorporate zero.

1150
03:00:43,380 --> 03:00:56,580
Ananda Sen: The inflation model is is really what is what cannot be modeled by person basis, there are some extra zeros a regular person will not have so many zeros that's it.

1151
03:00:56,580 --> 03:01:10,920
Ananda Sen: So that's why it's called zero inflated because because inflating the zero part of the model.

1152
03:01:10,920 --> 03:01:13,050
said.

1153
03:01:13,050 --> 03:01:15,690
Ananda Sen: It make sense.

1154
03:01:15,690 --> 03:01:28,170
Ananda Sen: Or at least that's the idea makes sense it's not.

1155
03:01:28,170 --> 03:01:31,620
Ananda Sen: I mean the the.

1156
03:01:31,620 --> 03:01:34,680
Ananda Sen: weird way to do this in SAS or.

1157
03:01:34,680 --> 03:01:38,190
Ananda Sen: status is very specific.

1158
03:01:38,190 --> 03:01:45,330
Ananda Sen: But as long as you understand what the model is and how to interpret the results they'll be good.

1159
03:01:45,330 --> 03:01:56,430
Ananda Sen: Okay, one last thing about this, there is a test called long test which basically test the hypothesis, whether using a zero infinity model is warranted.

1160
03:01:56,430 --> 03:02:06,600
Ananda Sen: And there is a test statistic which is based on the likelihood ratio of the non inflated and the inflated model and the two models, they were always comparing two models.

1161
03:02:06,600 --> 03:02:24,510
Ananda Sen: And, and then large positive values of the test statistic is indicated that the zero inflated model is indeed needed if you look at negative models for see a lot of negative models that means the non infected one.

1162
03:02:24,510 --> 03:02:32,700
Ananda Sen: Is the one you should use so so that's that's basically long test and some quick notes here.

1163
03:02:32,700 --> 03:02:39,960
Ananda Sen: Zero and fitted negative binomial and post on are both possible the clustering adjustments can be made and.

1164
03:02:39,960 --> 03:02:54,090
Ananda Sen: One thing we have to remember is zero and film models are yet to account for over dispersion if you if, which means the very end, what is over dispersion variance is more than them.

1165
03:02:54,090 --> 03:03:02,850
Ananda Sen: A variance is less than the mean, then, this model is not going to work and new media different devil.

1166
03:03:02,850 --> 03:03:10,470
Ananda Sen: let's quickly look at the lab.

1167
03:03:10,470 --> 03:03:14,790
Ananda Sen: So this is a different example fishing exam.

1168
03:03:14,790 --> 03:03:27,480
Ananda Sen: So I gave you the example of fishing, so this is, this is the one the state wildlife biologist wants to model, how many fish are being caught by fishermen at a State park.

1169
03:03:27,480 --> 03:03:33,090
Ananda Sen: visitors are asked whether or not they have a camper.

1170
03:03:33,090 --> 03:03:40,950
Ananda Sen: How many people were in the group, how many children within the group and how many fish were caught.

1171
03:03:40,950 --> 03:03:52,140
Ananda Sen: Some visitors do not fish, but there is no data on whether a person fished or not see see if you knew who finished our who didn't then.

1172
03:03:52,140 --> 03:04:06,750
Ananda Sen: Then you're fine, then you don't have to do all these types of models, the fact that you do not know that that is actually in statistical storms epidemiologic terms you call this.

1173
03:04:06,750 --> 03:04:17,520
Ananda Sen: latent latent because you do not see them, you do not see who finished or not, but you try to incorporate that fact into the model.

1174
03:04:17,520 --> 03:04:20,700
Ananda Sen: That somebody might not have fished.

1175
03:04:20,700 --> 03:04:24,540
Ananda Sen: So the total sample size is 250.

1176
03:04:24,540 --> 03:04:26,970
Ananda Sen: And the data.

1177
03:04:26,970 --> 03:04:33,030
Ananda Sen: Is that five fish that says seven that and.

1178
03:04:33,030 --> 03:04:36,540
Ananda Sen: here is how you would.

1179
03:04:36,540 --> 03:04:39,390
Ananda Sen: Access that data.

1180
03:04:39,390 --> 03:04:42,030
Ananda Sen: So.

1181
03:04:42,030 --> 03:04:49,230
Ananda Sen: How does the data look I was doing approximately varied, there is a very large zero.

1182
03:04:49,230 --> 03:04:55,350
Ananda Sen: Very large spike after that things are a lot more manageable.

1183
03:04:55,350 --> 03:05:08,970
Ananda Sen: But a spike at zero is huge Okay, so another place where i've seen a lot of zero and federal data I will i'll tell you.

1184
03:05:08,970 --> 03:05:15,090
Ananda Sen: An example where I have worked up one it's the medical claims data.

1185
03:05:15,090 --> 03:05:22,950
Ananda Sen: suppose you have a claims data, where you're looking at medical claims over a very short period of time it's a one year or so.

1186
03:05:22,950 --> 03:05:42,450
Ananda Sen: The claims themselves and continuous, they are not like count model, but the idea is the same, there is a spike at zero, and then there is the continued to hear the spike is at zero and after that the contribution starts.

1187
03:05:42,450 --> 03:05:47,250
Ananda Sen: So prop means and then broccoli you know various.

1188
03:05:47,250 --> 03:06:00,150
Ananda Sen: histogram That gives you the histogram and then the means of this so count is roughly about 3.3 3.3 per person.

1189
03:06:00,150 --> 03:06:03,660
Ananda Sen: little less than.

1190
03:06:03,660 --> 03:06:10,440
Ananda Sen: Point seven child per family and.

1191
03:06:10,440 --> 03:06:17,190
Ananda Sen: On an average that at about two and a half people in every group so.

1192
03:06:17,190 --> 03:06:27,570
Ananda Sen: And they were also hundred and 47 campers, which is about 59% so the size of cameras.

1193
03:06:27,570 --> 03:06:32,370
Ananda Sen: Okay, I ran for models to this.

1194
03:06:32,370 --> 03:06:50,100
Ananda Sen: The first one is a gen mode with person distribution again looking at the value over def those are huge numbers nine 924 and so on and so forth that's a serious lack of it.

1195
03:06:50,100 --> 03:06:55,380
Ananda Sen: If I did a negative binomial.

1196
03:06:55,380 --> 03:06:57,090
Ananda Sen: Then.

1197
03:06:57,090 --> 03:07:11,790
Ananda Sen: Things actually came down quite a bit, but the Pearson guys can scale Pearson guys square we're both a level above one so so it's significantly better than the person, but.

1198
03:07:11,790 --> 03:07:18,060
Ananda Sen: But there is still some residual thing left.

1199
03:07:18,060 --> 03:07:26,370
Ananda Sen: and

1200
03:07:26,370 --> 03:07:31,980
Ananda Sen: So he ICB I see all of those criteria does much better than person.

1201
03:07:31,980 --> 03:07:43,440
Ananda Sen: So they ran something called zero infected person and how did they run that in in general, and this is just a gym minded way of doing it Jen my data fish.

1202
03:07:43,440 --> 03:07:48,060
Ananda Sen: Class camper model count.

1203
03:07:48,060 --> 03:07:52,710
Ananda Sen: Shay equals child and camper.

1204
03:07:52,710 --> 03:07:57,120
Ananda Sen: and distribution.

1205
03:07:57,120 --> 03:08:00,540
Ananda Sen: Is Z I p.

1206
03:08:00,540 --> 03:08:06,240
Ananda Sen: Zero infinite per song is the one.

1207
03:08:06,240 --> 03:08:08,670
Ananda Sen: I ran there.

1208
03:08:08,670 --> 03:08:11,850
Ananda Sen: And then, I have a.

1209
03:08:11,850 --> 03:08:18,570
Ananda Sen: Zero infinite model which is zero mob the zero model.

1210
03:08:18,570 --> 03:08:35,700
Ananda Sen: The zero model statement actually fits that what we saw in the data statements inflate, so there are two regression models, one of the counter regression models that has got covariance childhood camper and the other one is.

1211
03:08:35,700 --> 03:08:42,000
Ananda Sen: Zero infinity model that has got persons number of persons in the group, as only Kobe.

1212
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:54,720
Ananda Sen: So, not a good model that still has some residual effects 6.29 and 600 deviations and scale events are not printed for zoom chat anymore.

1213
03:08:54,720 --> 03:08:58,680
Ananda Sen: I did a zero for the.

1214
03:08:58,680 --> 03:09:07,890
Ananda Sen: Negative binomial model again the value of a def is slightly still slightly above one.

1215
03:09:07,890 --> 03:09:19,650
Ananda Sen: Not close to one and but it's still slightly better than either the person model or the negative binomial.

1216
03:09:19,650 --> 03:09:30,630
Ananda Sen: So for this model what's the parameter estimates so again, I have got two tables, the first table is.

1217
03:09:30,630 --> 03:09:39,300
Ananda Sen: The first table has got child camper and also a dispersion parameter.

1218
03:09:39,300 --> 03:09:51,900
Ananda Sen: OK, so the dispersion parameter of course is positive, which means that we need the dispersion parameter and that's a pretty heavy dispersion and then we have got this.

1219
03:09:51,900 --> 03:10:01,650
Ananda Sen: The the the count part and the count part is essentially the the to count those two.

1220
03:10:01,650 --> 03:10:12,570
Ananda Sen: covariance are both significant and one of them is saying that, as the number of for each increase in the number of children.

1221
03:10:12,570 --> 03:10:17,460
Ananda Sen: Number of fishes count actually goes down.

1222
03:10:17,460 --> 03:10:32,070
Ananda Sen: that's not unexpected basically you do other things in the resort, if you have more children in the in the group if the number of campers increased then also the number of fishes Scott goes down.

1223
03:10:32,070 --> 03:10:35,670
Ananda Sen: Again, maybe you're doing other things at that point.

1224
03:10:35,670 --> 03:10:48,960
Ananda Sen: And here we have a mildly significant persons for zero and fit in model so basically it is saying is that the if you increase the number of.

1225
03:10:48,960 --> 03:10:53,880
Ananda Sen: For each additional person in the group.

1226
03:10:53,880 --> 03:11:01,200
Ananda Sen: There is an ad reduced on of.

1227
03:11:01,200 --> 03:11:06,060
Ananda Sen: Today, I do have it here so maybe I should.

1228
03:11:06,060 --> 03:11:17,340
Ananda Sen: explain that so that sounds delicious camper child or each mystical significant campers and unexpected log on the 0.8791, which is about 2.41 times higher.

1229
03:11:17,340 --> 03:11:32,040
Ananda Sen: Average count with holding the number of children constant for children at 78% decrease in average number of sorry for for here 78% decrease in average number of fishes court.

1230
03:11:32,040 --> 03:11:35,730
Ananda Sen: For each additional child in the family.

1231
03:11:35,730 --> 03:11:57,510
Ananda Sen: They access zero is is the other one which is now logistic regression so persons was significantly different, which means each additional person in the group decrease the odds of producing excess zeros by at 1.2% remember this is interpreted as decreasing odds of producing excess zeros.

1232
03:11:57,510 --> 03:12:02,670
Ananda Sen: This is not representing the odds of not catching a fish.

1233
03:12:02,670 --> 03:12:07,890
Okay.

1234
03:12:07,890 --> 03:12:12,030
Ananda Sen: So so that's zero infinitive model.

1235
03:12:12,030 --> 03:12:25,950
Ananda Sen: What happens to the test the test is not available in Prague, Denmark, not yet maybe sometime soon, but there is a SAS macro.

1236
03:12:25,950 --> 03:12:40,740
Ananda Sen: And how do we run the SAS macro today it's we are almost on time I time so i'm not going to do it today, but tomorrow i'll show you how to use a macro not so much for the warm desk but more for.

1237
03:12:40,740 --> 03:12:47,580
Ananda Sen: How to run the macro I have got this printed out here, but tomorrow we'll do it.

1238
03:12:47,580 --> 03:12:49,890
Ananda Sen: On the.

1239
03:12:49,890 --> 03:12:57,510
Ananda Sen: On SAS on demand, so we can we can see this, there is a little bit here, I need to explain so.

1240
03:12:57,510 --> 03:12:59,640
yeah.

1241
03:12:59,640 --> 03:13:04,260
Ananda Sen: Let me stop this year.

1242
03:13:04,260 --> 03:13:16,770
Ananda Sen: and see any questions or comments.

1243
03:13:16,770 --> 03:13:21,270
Ananda Sen: So, tomorrow we're going to do some.

1244
03:13:21,270 --> 03:13:32,100
Ananda Sen: Additional stuff so things like propensity matching some some some other things which we can do, using what we have.

1245
03:13:32,100 --> 03:13:47,280
Ananda Sen: My original plan was to also do multi normal regression, so instead of two categories, we had more than two categories, but I think that would be too much for this course so so i'll stick to what we have and.

1246
03:13:47,280 --> 03:13:51,930
Ananda Sen: And the hope is to just do more discussions.

1247
03:13:51,930 --> 03:14:06,510
Ananda Sen: But, but we have covered linear logistic and counter aggression, which we're supposed to cover in this course so.

1248
03:14:06,510 --> 03:14:09,810
Ananda Sen: i'm.

1249
03:14:09,810 --> 03:14:24,450
Ananda Sen: Any questions comments.

1250
03:14:24,450 --> 03:14:27,240
Ananda Sen: everybody's tired.

1251
03:14:27,240 --> 03:14:31,620
Ananda Sen: Zero sleepy very sleepy.

1252
03:14:31,620 --> 03:14:33,690
zahraa: yeah it's 12 midnight here.

1253
03:14:33,690 --> 03:14:36,900
Ananda Sen: I know I don't.

1254
03:14:36,900 --> 03:14:40,350
Ananda Sen: Know case it's very dark.

1255
03:14:40,350 --> 03:14:44,670
yeah.

1256
03:14:44,670 --> 03:14:48,150
Ananda Sen: All right, okay so.

1257
03:14:48,150 --> 03:14:49,530
Ananda Sen: A lot of things to absorb.

1258
03:14:49,530 --> 03:14:51,660
Ananda Sen: A lot of things to.

1259
03:14:51,660 --> 03:15:10,320
Ananda Sen: deck inside and just look over things again, I have the third assignment also there, so the so the same is there for everybody, if you have a chance can take a look, I have also thrown in a few things here on the lab part which.

1260
03:15:10,320 --> 03:15:24,420
Ananda Sen: You can take a look and try to do some some of those suggested exercise i'm going to change everything all the things we have done and annotate the rest of it and put it back.

1261
03:15:24,420 --> 03:15:25,980
On.

1262
03:15:25,980 --> 03:15:28,110
Ananda Sen: canvas now let's.

1263
03:15:28,110 --> 03:15:29,370
Ananda Sen: Try to see if.

1264
03:15:29,370 --> 03:15:30,630
Yoonhee Ryder: I can.

1265
03:15:30,630 --> 03:15:37,530
Ananda Sen: Do an automatic thing if I can then i'll just send you an email saying that i've done this so.

1266
03:15:37,530 --> 03:15:41,730
Yoonhee Ryder: In our next assignment is due, tomorrow is that correct.

1267
03:15:41,730 --> 03:15:47,640
Ananda Sen: Next assignment, yes, so the second assignment is due tomorrow afternoon one o'clock but.

1268
03:15:47,640 --> 03:15:50,670
Ananda Sen: The third one will be.

1269
03:15:50,670 --> 03:15:57,510
Ananda Sen: Do sometime in the weekend, or on the weekend so.

1270
03:15:57,510 --> 03:16:01,860
Ananda Sen: Okay sounds good let's see you tomorrow.

1271
03:16:01,860 --> 03:16:05,340
Theresa Marie Kowalski-Dobson: Thank you.

1272
03:16:05,340 --> 03:16:10,800
Marcelo Galafassi: Thank you.

1273
03:16:10,800 --> 03:16:14,010
Ananda Sen: So yeah I think.

1274
03:16:14,010 --> 03:16:32,220
Ananda Sen: A technical aspects are relatively smooth doubt, the only thing which i'm not sure why have what's happening is that and and the fact that they're not getting the.

1275
03:16:32,220 --> 03:16:41,580
Ananda Sen: The message, or the other note is is is something I have noticed, too, because normally it comes to meals.

1276
03:16:41,580 --> 03:16:42,330
Ananda Sen: On a.

1277
03:16:42,330 --> 03:16:47,520
Ananda Sen: When a post when I post something so they're not sure what's happening.

1278
03:16:47,520 --> 03:16:54,930
Ananda Sen: So I just taught a course last semester, and every time I posted something it's the students already knew.

1279
03:16:54,930 --> 03:17:02,250
Joshua Bosman: yeah, so this is separate from the messages right, because when I get it okay.

1280
03:17:02,250 --> 03:17:03,930
Joshua Bosman: yeah I guess I haven't been given those either.

1281
03:17:03,930 --> 03:17:14,100
Ananda Sen: yeah it's basically say say I have lab three and I wanted to make some changes to lab three and just update a new one.

1282
03:17:14,100 --> 03:17:21,150
Ananda Sen: The students that supposed to get a message that lab three is now updated on canvas or something like that.

1283
03:17:21,150 --> 03:17:21,840
Joshua Bosman: Right.

1284
03:17:21,840 --> 03:17:27,810
Ananda Sen: And I don't know why it's not happening.

1285
03:17:27,810 --> 03:17:32,670
Ananda Sen: Baby we are 80% of the way through, we have only 20% left so.

1286
03:17:32,670 --> 03:17:38,820
Ananda Sen: yeah tomorrow will be the last day and yeah so.

1287
03:17:38,820 --> 03:17:42,210
Ananda Sen: Thank you again for your help, oh see you tomorrow.

1288
03:17:42,210 --> 03:17:43,980
Joshua Bosman: No problem have a good one.

1289
03:17:43,980 --> 03:17:44,800
bye.
