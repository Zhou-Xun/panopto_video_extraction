1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:09,949
So I'd like to take a few moments now
to note some of the key takeaways from

2
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:12,087
the interview with Dr. Lupia.

3
00:00:12,087 --> 00:00:17,035
First, note that he really emphasizes
one overarching question that policy

4
00:00:17,035 --> 00:00:20,040
makers are always gonna ask.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,010
Why should I care?

6
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,960
Why should I care about whatever
it is you're talking about?

7
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,460
Or writing about?

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,680
So if a message to a policy maker doesn't
convince them that they should care,

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,040
it goes nowhere, right.

10
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,060
Policy makers, or frankly any
audience that is time constrained,

11
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:45,610
that is busy, that isn't necessarily
already interested in what you have to

12
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:50,580
say, needs to be convinced right up
front that they need to care about

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:56,280
something in order for them to even engage
with whatever you're talking about.

14
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,260
This is not just for policy makers.

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,950
Anyone you want to motivate to
act is in the same situation.

16
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:05,390
So for example,
if you're writing an email,

17
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,400
a request email, let's say to a professor.

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:16,140
You want to encourage them to know,
why should I care about this request?

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,230
Why should I engage with you?

20
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,790
If you're going to ask somebody to do
a favor for you, if you're gonna announce

21
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,440
new procedures that need to
followed in your organization.

22
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,370
Why should somebody care
about this announcement?

23
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:34,840
So how does he suggest
that we make people care?

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,470
Notice that there's a couple
key ideas that he brought up.

25
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:45,294
The first is, messages should be urgent,
simple, and direct.

26
00:01:45,294 --> 00:01:47,800
So notice the critical components.

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:48,770
And these work together, right?

28
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:51,960
If something isn't urgent,
then it can be put off.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,700
And I don't need to think about it now,
so I'm not gonna engage with it.

30
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,980
That's a problem.

31
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,500
If it isn't simple, if it's too hard for

32
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,480
me to understand,
then I have to work too hard and

33
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:10,640
I don't necessarily do that because I'm
not convinced that I should care about it.

34
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,880
And if it isn't direct,
you're wasting my time.

35
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:19,410
And if I'm a busy person,
if I have mental or physical or

36
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,560
other time constraints,
I don't wanna waste my time.

37
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,360
So you need to be urgent,
simple, and direct.

38
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,570
The other point I wanna bring up that Dr.
Lupia brought up is,

39
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:36,380
what are the things that the audience
is worrying about right now, right?

40
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:39,700
Sometimes we forget the people
we're speaking to or

41
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,400
writing to already care about things,
they already have their own agendas.

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,160
The more that we can align our messages
to their pre-existing concerns or

43
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,680
agendas, the more likely
we are to be convincing.

44
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,140
This idea of alignment is critical.

45
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,650
And the idea here, and he brought this up,
is co-producing a narrative.

46
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,820
So what do I mean by that?

47
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,980
This last point is subtle and
it's really important.

48
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:16,310
Advocacy, speaking or writing to someone
with the goal of encouraging them to

49
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:22,230
change their beliefs, or to change their
actions, is not a one directional thing.

50
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,720
It's not like you're bombarding
a fortress with arguments over and

51
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,710
over again until it breaks.

52
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,450
Quite the contrary.

53
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:34,630
Advocacy involves finding common ground,
it's a two way conversation.

54
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:37,700
The audience figures out how,

55
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:42,090
what it is that you care about,
is what they already care about.

56
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,418
And when you find that common ground,

57
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:48,361
a good advocacy communication
hence involves co-producing.

58
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,368
Co-producing a narrative so

59
00:03:50,368 --> 00:03:55,102
that somebody figures out why they
want to work with you, or to work for

60
00:03:55,102 --> 00:04:00,670
you, or to do the behavior that
you're advocating for them to do.

61
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:05,838
The point here is that when you do that,
when you have that two way conversation,

62
00:04:05,838 --> 00:04:09,850
when you co-produce that narrative,
everyone wins.

63
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:14,855
You get your goal and,
lo and behold, so do they.
