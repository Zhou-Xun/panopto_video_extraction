1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,950
I think we can go ahead and get started. Just a couple announcements to begin the class.

2
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:23,930
We will not have class on Monday. We're going to give you that time to prepare or to, if you want to, to take the first exam.

3
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,650
So the first exam will open on Monday morning.

4
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,230
You'll have a week to do that, but once you open it, you'll have 20.

5
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,740
It'll be 24 hours, so you'll have 24 hours to complete it.

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,400
So it's available for a week. So it's of that week.

7
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:47,120
Pick your favorite 24 hour time period that you think will be the best for you to complete the exam.

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,960
So again, it'll be open book, open note.

9
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,700
Just do not work with each other. It should be all your own individual work.

10
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:01,970
It'll be everything we've covered. It won't be up until this point is fair game.

11
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:09,920
Nothing that we haven't covered, though. So, for example, Dr. Perera was not able to give her developmental toxicology lecture.

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,780
So we're not going to include any questions related to developmental toxicology or that material.

13
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:26,390
The problem that we're working on, getting those graded, the we're going to release the problem set solutions on October 4th.

14
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:32,599
So I'm not sure how you felt about doing those problems, but just a tip.

15
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,709
You may want to wait until we release those solutions so you can check them against your

16
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:41,780
assignment to take the exam if you're feeling a little bit iffy on some of that kinetic stuff.

17
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:46,160
But if you feel like that was a breeze, then maybe you want to take it on October 3rd.

18
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:56,390
I leave it up to you all to decide what your best 24 hour time period is to take the exam within that week, starting on October 3rd, next Monday.

19
00:01:57,410 --> 00:02:02,870
Does that make sense? Any questions about that should be pretty straightforward.

20
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:05,870
It's going to be a mix of multiple choice.

21
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:12,409
I think there's a problem in there where you select like a few of the best fit from a selection, you know,

22
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:16,700
like the best two or three answers that pass through a lot of questions,

23
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,610
a little bit of fill in the, you know, the like short answer type of questions.

24
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,629
I think that about covers it. It's going to be through canvas, right?

25
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:32,030
So if you have any questions about how to access it, let me know or come to office hours.

26
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,140
But it'll just be available at that time. I think it's I think it's set to open at 945 Monday morning.

27
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,930
So that is. All I had to say about that.

28
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:49,900
If you have any questions or concerns about the process of taking the exam, please let me know either by email,

29
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,970
office hours or messages on canvas, or however your favorite way of getting a hold of me.

30
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:59,590
Go for it. So everyone feeling okay with that?

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,760
That's great. Okay, uh, let's see here.

32
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:12,399
Speaking of Dr. Pereira's developmental talks lecture, I word she, I think, is going to be willing to just give the lecture as a Zoom meeting,

33
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,700
record it, and it'll be very similar to watching the, you know, the lectures as you do via the Panopto recordings.

34
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,530
So it'll just be we'll just have to wait for her.

35
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,080
I think she's still feeling like a little bit ill, so we just need to wait for her to, like, feel okay and be ready to do that lecture.

36
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:38,500
So I'll put that up on the website to figure out how to upload stuff to the campus website and that those types of files to the campus website.

37
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,520
So that should be coming. Um, so again, that's another thing where, you know, in your own time you can just choose to watch that lecture.

38
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,690
We do want to include that material because that's important for toxicology to understand developmental toxicology.

39
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,430
So when that goes up, I'll let you know, make an announcement, all of that.

40
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,830
Okay. Any one more time?

41
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,790
Any questions on any of the logistics so far? Seems like everyone's on board.

42
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,950
Okay, cool. So today we're going to finish up the material.

43
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,079
And again, so this section of material is also fair game for the exam, right?

44
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:24,600
So everything we've covered up until Monday is fair game as far as that material W.

45
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:33,909
So yeah. So we're going to finish up the attorneys material today.

46
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:39,309
So we kind of put a pause on Adbe so that we can have some of our guest lecturers come in.

47
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:44,950
But we're going to return to Abby, meaning absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion.

48
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,120
So where we left off last time, we were kind of in the middle of talking about distribution.

49
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:58,780
And I mentioned a couple of things about like that. There are major storage sites for some types of chemicals within the body.

50
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:07,240
So what I mean by that is toxicants can be concentrated in certain tissues for which they might have a chemical affinity.

51
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,800
And probably the most sort of intuitive version of that that we've talked about so far is like chemicals that are lipophilic,

52
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,370
as their name implies, are going to be have an affinity for fat.

53
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:25,810
Right. So we have we know that certain types of chemicals, like, for instance, polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs,

54
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:34,510
can accumulate in the fat because they have this affinity for fatty tissue due to like the chemical, the physicochemical properties.

55
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,020
So toxicants that end up in these like storage sites are in equilibrium with the free circulating fraction.

56
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:49,690
And what I mean by that is that if we excrete some of that free fraction in our urine or our feces or something,

57
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:54,129
we'll often see like a release of of more chemical from that storage site.

58
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,530
So you'll see more release of this chemical from the fat.

59
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:07,340
Another really important concept to think about in terms of storage sites is this idea of plasma proteins.

60
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:15,740
So we have these proteins circulating in our blood and in our plasma, and there are multiple plasma proteins that bind xeno biotics.

61
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,560
Right. So chemicals in the blood will bind to certain proteins in the blood.

62
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:25,700
The big one for this class that we're going to be talking about is called albumin.

63
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:38,560
And so it turns out so an important thing to consider in terms of is this plasma binding chemicals binding to albumin or any plasma protein is that

64
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:46,959
plasma proteins have a relatively high molecular weight and are able to cross like the capillary walls to distribute into other tissues in the body.

65
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,480
So they're kind of in some sense blocked from getting into, say, the fat or the liver or,

66
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,260
you know, other places in the body outside of these like capillaries.

67
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:04,380
And so, again, we have this equilibrium of bound and unbound versions of chemicals in the blood.

68
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,250
Typically, we're thinking about toxicity being due to the unbound toxicants.

69
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:16,320
So the chemical that's bound to these plasma proteins is often not the one that we're thinking is causing a lot of the toxicity.

70
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:24,089
So, for example, you know, if a chemical is damaging the liver, you know, it's not really if it's bound up in the blood,

71
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,440
it's not really getting into like the hepatocytes in the liver and causing damage in the liver.

72
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:36,120
So it's that free form that's able to easily cross the capillaries capillaries and get into the cells of an organ, for example.

73
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,649
And so this is just like a I wouldn't think. Don't get too hung up on this crap.

74
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:54,180
But this is just a way of showing that albumin binds like a lot of different stuff, including like vitamins, amino acids, etc.

75
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,560
So this is just a graph showing the binding affinity for certain chemicals to albumin.

76
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,770
So when a chemical binds to a protein, we call that an addict.

77
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:11,930
So there's different types of addicts. But the one we're talking about here is, for example, an addict formed by a chemical binding to albumin.

78
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:26,140
And there's this whole field of addict omics, which is essentially using these finding properties to understand exposures to environmental toxicants.

79
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:31,390
So for example, we know that several types of chemicals we've talked about aflatoxin.

80
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:39,280
We talked maybe a little bit about benzene. Certain drugs and pesticides will form these attacks or bind to these albumin molecules.

81
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:48,180
And what you could do is basically take a sample of blood plasma and use some of our like certain techniques, like mass spectrometry,

82
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:58,190
for example, to essentially measure the amount of, say, benzene bound to these to this albumin in an individual's blood.

83
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,939
And so we can get a picture into what types of chemicals they were exposed to using these

84
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,429
types of approaches and making it seem like pretty simple probably here through this graph,

85
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:14,190
what it's like a highly involved area that involves like a lot of intense like chemistry and things like that.

86
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:21,180
So, you know, really like involved approaches like mass spectrometry and what have you.

87
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,520
So I don't want to oversimplify it, but you know, in essence,

88
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:34,500
this is like a really important way that we can understand people's like history of exposures to chemicals looking at all the you know,

89
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:41,400
it's a it's a nice sample that we could use to understand the individual's exposure, if you will.

90
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,480
This added to the mix is a really cool area of research.

91
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:58,680
So if we're talking about distribution into organs or tissues in the body, of course, the liver and kidney are going to be a really big player here.

92
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,150
So the liver and kidneys are exposed to high levels of antibiotics, as you may have guessed.

93
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:09,680
And because of that, they have these important roles in metabolism and excretion of toxicants.

94
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,530
In fact, they concentrate more chemicals than the rest of the organs combined.

95
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,960
So these are really like, again, really big players in this process of distribution and metabolism,

96
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,979
you know, and there's a lot of chemicals that are concentrated at these sites.

97
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:33,400
You know, for example, a lot of metals like cadmium and mercury. Cadmium can be concentrated in the kidneys for many years.

98
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:38,110
Lipophilic compounds, of course, can also end up in this tissue as well.

99
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:48,480
And again, we go back to this idea. So again, moving on from the liver, kidneys, we'll have full lectures on the liver and kidneys later.

100
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:54,840
And we'll talk a little bit about the biology related to those in this lecture, but we'll have a more involved lecture related to liver and kidneys.

101
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,120
So we'll move on to another site right now, which is fat, as I mentioned.

102
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,779
So again, we talked about this a little bit. So you remember that optimal water coefficient that we talked about in one of

103
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,160
the previous lectures where if a chemical has a high optimal water coefficient,

104
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,799
it is thought to be non-polar and more lipophilic, right?

105
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,290
And so these types of chemicals of these high water acting on water coefficients will distribute

106
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:27,840
and concentrate into the body fat again due to just like the chemistry of these chemicals.

107
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,120
In relation to these lipophilic sites in the body.

108
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:39,069
So this actually tends to decrease the free circulating fractions.

109
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:42,600
So the fraction that we think of that can cause toxic effects in the body.

110
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:46,169
And so we see like individuals, like obese individuals, for example,

111
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,820
sometimes are less susceptible to certain types of toxicity due to this type of phenomenon.

112
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:59,010
However, there is a high potential if you're in sort of like a Biggest Loser situation where you're losing a lot of body fat sort of rapidly.

113
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:03,839
There is a concern for like mobilization of these chemicals into back out of the fat,

114
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:08,550
into the bloodstream and potentially potentially causing toxic effects.

115
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:20,180
So again, we have multiple chemicals that are stored in the fat, like these persistent organic pollutants dioxins,

116
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,830
PCBs, polychlorinated biphenyls, some organochlorine pesticides like DDT.

117
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:29,120
These really like to accumulate in the fat, be stored in the fat.

118
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:35,750
And this is also related to the phenomenon of bioaccumulation that we may talk about in eco toxicology.

119
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:41,010
Does it, as anyone heard of bioaccumulation before? You want to explain it a little bit?

120
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,180
So, like thinking about the food chain, like mercury comes to mind.

121
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,730
One animal eats another animal. And so it kind of like accumulates as it goes up the food chain.

122
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:03,319
Right? Exactly. Yeah. So it's this concept where chemicals can accumulate in the food chain because they're stored in like the fat, for example.

123
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,810
Like a good example would be polar bears eating like really fatty seals that have been exposed to a lot of contaminants.

124
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,440
They're just eating a lot of the stuff that is stored in the fat of the seals.

125
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:17,149
And then it gets into the bodies of the polar bears that are eating like a lot of it.

126
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:24,260
So do you just see this like increasing accumulation of like exposure to chemicals as you go up the food chain?

127
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:29,510
I think food lab is the more technically correct term, but you know what I mean?

128
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:36,709
So when we think about like trophic levels, so this is something we might get into more in the eco tox lecture if we have time.

129
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:44,390
But it's one to kind of mention that small point that we're more focused for these lectures on human health for the most part.

130
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:54,650
Bone is another area that of certain toxicants can accumulate that what is actually a fairly like

131
00:13:54,700 --> 00:14:00,609
I think a lot of us tend to not think about as like a dynamic sort of structure but there is

132
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,860
like a lot of interesting like chemistry and things that and dynamics too like bone growth and

133
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:10,479
sort of degradation and things over time are there is a lot of like change that occurs there,

134
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,930
even though it might might not be obvious from like day to day.

135
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,970
So like just a really brief primer. Primer like bone biology.

136
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,459
You have this like mineralized outer hard outer work portion of the bone,

137
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:34,540
which is like highly calcified with this like softer interior, um, within the bone and so with the marrow and what have you.

138
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:42,190
So this bone deposition and resorption of chemicals, again, like the biology of like the bone is sort of dynamic.

139
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:45,400
You could see chemicals stored there for a while and then released.

140
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,060
And you said you see this kind of this dynamic going on.

141
00:14:50,950 --> 00:14:57,970
So toxicants like lead can be stored within the bone but may not necessarily be toxic to the bone itself.

142
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:03,450
So again, it's like a really good example. It's stored in the bone, but we're generally thinking about that.

143
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:07,840
It has multiple health effects, but one of the big ones is like neurotoxicity, right?

144
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:13,270
So it's not really related to the bone in and of itself. It's a storage site for this chemical.

145
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,829
Other chemicals that can be stored in bone can be toxic to the bone.

146
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:25,040
And we're thinking about things like high levels of fluoride and radioactive substances like radioactive strontium.

147
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,810
These could be pretty toxic to the bone.

148
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:35,450
And another thing to consider, what we're talking about, as we mentioned, was the fatty breakdown releasing chemicals back into the body.

149
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:43,340
Individuals with osteoporosis who are undergoing, you know, their bones are kind of breaking down at a greater rate.

150
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,530
You'll see you can see release of chemicals in those cases that might be stored up in the bone.

151
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:56,490
And then the release as the bone starts to break down. Does that make sense so far?

152
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:04,790
Any questions? So understanding what is taking it all together,

153
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:11,300
we can kind of walk through the process and think about the different storage sites and things that we've talked about up till now.

154
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:18,470
Right. So if we imagine that we inject someone with a with a drug or it'd be a drug in this case.

155
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,710
Or they're exposed to a chemical that ends up in their bloodstream that will toxicant.

156
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:30,360
That chemical is going to be in the blood in a free form. And then we're also going to get this bound form in the blood.

157
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,550
And there's going to be some kind of equilibrium there.

158
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:41,679
And we can think about the you know, for those of us that are interested in like kinetics and the chemistry of these things, of how these things move,

159
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,180
we can talk about the key values, like the constants that describe the this chemical,

160
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:51,430
the free form, moving from the blood into another compartment like, say, the interstitial fluid.

161
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:55,990
So the fluid that's not the blood and not the intracellular fluid, but like other fluids within the body.

162
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:00,490
And that's going to be in a free form as well as a bound form as well.

163
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:07,610
And then we keep going and, you know, think about a chemical that may have a certain degree of preference for fat and

164
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:13,190
there may be some binding that goes on in proteins near the in the fat compartment.

165
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:20,030
Or it may it may also have some degree of affinity for the bones or the teeth is other storage depots.

166
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:30,969
And we can have, you know, k values that describe the rates of uptake for those compartments for this chemical and on to the

167
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:36,100
actually into the entrance of the chemical into individual cells like hepatocytes in the liver,

168
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,050
or that it also totally cells in the testes, for example.

169
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:46,720
And there's going to be some kind of consent or some type of kinetics that describes that process as well.

170
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:50,950
And, you know, you can get, you know, leaking that you can these cells go both ways.

171
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:56,019
So the chemical could, you know, during the process of, you know,

172
00:17:56,020 --> 00:18:02,559
distribution kind of depending on metabolism or excretion kind of due to the gradient formed,

173
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:08,140
maybe be pulled back out of a compartment at some rate that you can describe mathematically.

174
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:14,140
And so a chemical within the cell could also be bound up or unbound to proteins within the cell.

175
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:21,999
So you can see how this if you're trying to form like a fully the full kinetic picture of how chemicals are moving throughout the body,

176
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,400
you can see how it gets pretty complicated, at least to someone like me in terms of the mathematics involved.

177
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:30,040
There's a lot of like rate constants to consider.

178
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:38,230
Chemicals typically don't just stay in one compartment, they distribute to multiple compartments within the body,

179
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:43,089
and each of those is going to have their own sort of unique biological dynamics

180
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:47,229
that explains how that chemical is going to interact within that compartment,

181
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:51,280
whether it be bone or fat or the blood in the blood proteins.

182
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,880
So we have these special areas within the body a few different like special areas within the body that.

183
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:12,700
Kind of have special protection mechanisms that can essentially act as a barrier to keep toxicants out from doing more damage.

184
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,050
For instance, our brain has what's called the blood brain barrier.

185
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:23,320
So, you know, we do not want a lot of damage from existing chemicals within our brain.

186
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,520
So it makes sense that the brain would kind of be a privileged site in some ways, right,

187
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,900
because of how fundamentally important the brain is to so many things in the body.

188
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,170
So this is limited by this blood, but this access of chemicals is limited by the blood brain barrier.

189
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,860
And so this is a picture of a normal capillary.

190
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,320
So the blood would be flowing through here.

191
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:53,950
And the capillary kind of giving it structure are these endothelial cells that sort of surround or like around the capillary.

192
00:19:54,220 --> 00:20:00,600
And you'll have these like fenestration of openings, these like small openings for the capillaries.

193
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:06,220
Remember, as I said, some of the unbound chemical can kind of leak out of the capillaries into other regions of the body.

194
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:13,359
However, in the brain it's a different story. So you have the same basic structure.

195
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,080
You have these individual cells and this opening where the blood is flowing through in the lumen.

196
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:23,770
But you also have tighter junctions between these endothelial cells, so things aren't as likely to leak out.

197
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,420
And you also have things like these astrocyte cells that have these foot processes that kind of

198
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:35,500
clamp down on the capillary and kind of keep it sort of like a tighter grip on the capillary.

199
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:40,510
We also have like cells called parasites that kind of essentially do the same thing.

200
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,820
So you have this like clamping sort of structure around the capillary that makes

201
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:50,200
it harder for things to leak out of that capillary and get into the brain.

202
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:58,530
And you can imagine that this is really important both for understanding how toxicants move throughout the body as well as in terms of like,

203
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,320
say, drugs.

204
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:06,669
What's it going to is it going to be able to bypass the blood brain barrier or do you want it to get into these other regions of the brain,

205
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:11,139
for example, for some types of drugs, is it not going to be able to do that?

206
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:17,680
So you might have to design your drug in a certain way such that it's able to bypass this blood brain barrier.

207
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:25,250
And things that are able to pass. You know, we're going to think about, again, lipid solubility is such a huge one.

208
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:34,610
Highly lipophilic chemicals could potentially you know, move be get past these defenses or ion ionization, state, etc.

209
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:43,640
One thing to note is as we age, our blood brain barrier tends to sort of weaken and it's not as in place as it is,

210
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:50,450
you know, to the extent it is when we're younger. So that's another thing to think about in say like drug development.

211
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,790
If elderly individuals are going to be taking the drug,

212
00:21:53,090 --> 00:22:00,620
we may want to think about what the actual kinetics are for that drug in those individuals related to the blood brain barrier.

213
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:06,200
So but we do have these we in addition have these like transporters, right.

214
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:12,049
So this is the blood and a chemical leaks does manage to like leak into an endothelial cell.

215
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:16,090
We can then pump certain chemicals back out. Right.

216
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,420
And then we have certain transporters that will actually take things into the brain side of the barrier.

217
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,729
So we have these like specialized structures that allow dynamics in terms of which

218
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,600
chemicals can make it past the blood brain barrier and which which will not.

219
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,890
So. So to make sure I've hit everything here.

220
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,340
So you have these transporters, these biotic transporters, and then here's the tight junction.

221
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,990
So we have these tighter junctions between the endothelial cells in the brain capillaries.

222
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:57,720
So the blood brain barrier is one of these special structures that sort of has a specialized situation in terms of toxicant distribution.

223
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:07,120
Another one that that's worth talking about and thinking about is my area of research, the placenta.

224
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,290
And so the placenta is is kind of a unique case.

225
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,050
This is a basically a cross section. This is a cross section of a placenta.

226
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:25,270
And so just to, like, orient you to this this picture, you have the umbilical cord here obviously attached to the fetus during pregnancy.

227
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:32,380
And you have these blood vessels that essentially lead to the fetus and then out into the placenta.

228
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:38,410
And these blood vessels will essentially branch out into these structures that are called villous

229
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:45,480
trees that branch off of the placenta and are essentially hanging out in the maternal blood.

230
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:49,540
Right. And so these blood vessels are maternal blood vessels.

231
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,530
These are what are called uterine spiral arteries.

232
00:23:53,680 --> 00:24:00,460
And during pregnancy, they widen to allow greater volume of blood to reach this area of the body.

233
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,920
And so these villous trees are essentially bathed in the maternal blood that's being delivered by the spiral arteries.

234
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:11,410
And this allows for the exchange of nutrients, vitamins, hormones,

235
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:19,210
a whole host of things that can be uptake in by the VILLOUS tissue and delivered to the fetus and then waste products can be brought the other way.

236
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:30,760
So let's see here. However, toxicants Zino Biotics can also make their way into the placenta.

237
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:38,049
And, you know, as we've seen when there's many studies that look at chemical level levels of different chemicals in the cord blood,

238
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,590
for instance, the biblical cord blood in the placenta itself.

239
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,350
And we see, you know, levels of cannabis studies looking at the levels of chemicals in the amniotic fluid.

240
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:51,309
So we know that chemicals are able to, you know, not all chemicals,

241
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:59,230
but certain chemicals are able to essentially cross this barrier and get to the fetus and enter this compartment.

242
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,460
However, we do have sort of these specialized transporters, again,

243
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:10,870
similar to what we saw in the blood brain barrier where we can kick things back out or uptake certain things that we want for the developing fetus.

244
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:17,620
So this is sort of another one of these dynamic sites where it's a little bit different than in other places in the body.

245
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,980
Um, the main, uh,

246
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:31,900
so lining these villous trees are these pig cells called transitional truffle parts that form by an underlying layer of cells called.

247
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:38,190
So the truffle blasts, a bunch of them fuzed together to make these like really big cells called sensitive truffle blasts.

248
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:41,740
And those line the top layer of these trees.

249
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:47,770
So they're in a direct site of exchange between maternal circulation and fetal circulation.

250
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:53,980
They're pretty cool. They have like a bunch of nuclei. It's like a completely different biology than a lot of cells.

251
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:59,890
So. Yeah, thanks. I was just wanting to nerd out on the placenta for a minute.

252
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:04,660
Yeah. Oh, is this going on with the placenta during each trimester?

253
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:11,660
Because I know in a lot of studies they specifically look at the second trimester as being like the most vulnerable part,

254
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:17,070
like especially with the patients. Yeah, I mean, there's probably different things going on there.

255
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:25,720
There's definitely like changes that occur across the trimesters at one time, like different individual aspects of that.

256
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,410
Usually, like in my research,

257
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:37,090
we look at it like we consider a lot early presentation where the placenta is like you're getting a lot of like tissue remodeling during pregnancy.

258
00:26:37,090 --> 00:26:43,030
Like these spiral arteries are helped by certain cells are actually associated with the placenta to remodel the arteries.

259
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:51,270
Um, that kind of happens earlier on. But yeah, certainly there is like a shift of like a whole host of things across the three different trimesters.

260
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,829
So yeah, it's not like a static state at all, you know, it's like you it's really fascinating.

261
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:02,430
You grow a new organ within, you know, and then expel it within like nine months.

262
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,799
So it's like a pretty, pretty wild situation.

263
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:14,890
So. But yeah, you're right, it's there. A The timing of pregnancy and different stages of pregnancy have different sort of considerations.

264
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:19,030
One has to think about about what might go wrong or what might be, you know,

265
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,830
at what stage the placenta might be more sensitive to certain toxicant exposures, for example.

266
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:34,830
So yeah. Okay. That was maybe more about the placenta than another lecturer would have talked about, but I think it's a really cool organ.

267
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:43,110
So moving on. Well, actually, go to my earlier field of study, which is male reproductive toxicology.

268
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:51,090
We also have something called a blood testes barrier. So and I'll talk a little bit more in the reproductive lecture about testes biology,

269
00:27:51,810 --> 00:28:00,060
but the testes are contain a lot of the structures called some of the first tubules, which is where sperm develop.

270
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:08,820
Right. And so if we were to magnify one section of the cemetery for its tubule, it would look something like this.

271
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,889
And what you see here are what are called spermatozoa sites, these like early sperm cells,

272
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:20,280
that the stem cells are called sporadic ionia and they develop into these spermatozoa in the seminal first tubule.

273
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,419
And as they develop, they sort of migrate towards the middle of the seven infants.

274
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:33,260
TUBULE Right. Now helping them along the way are cells called certainly cells which provide like growth factors

275
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:40,370
and hormones and things to help these cells as they develop in from its formative sites into sperm.

276
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:48,590
So again, this is kind of a privileged site, like an important site for like reproduction, similar to like during the, you know, during pregnancy.

277
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,540
That's obviously like a sensitive situation. You have a developing fetus or the blood testes barrier.

278
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:57,770
You also, you know, the brain is such a privileged sort of area of the body.

279
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:05,930
We've developed these ways of sort of keeping certain things out and from easily gaining access into these compartments.

280
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:13,610
Similarly with the testes, you know, we have this like reproductive function that is, you know,

281
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:18,200
that we're sort of wanting to have an extra layer of defense, if you will, against exogenous chemicals.

282
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:24,139
And so these are totally cells that help the sperm out of sight during its process, during its development.

283
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:28,720
Also have what are called. This is another picture of it.

284
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:35,410
What are called certainly cells are totally cell junctions. So they're basically I've heard it described as they're holding hands really tight.

285
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,770
So that is a way of forming another barrier that all things can just pass through that barrier

286
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:48,520
and get into this the section of the 71st tubule and cause damage to the developing sperm.

287
00:29:51,280 --> 00:30:01,179
So but it's you know, all of none of these are, as I said, with both like the blood test, the the blood brain barrier and the placenta toxicants.

288
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:09,190
A lot of toxicants can actually make their way into the brain and into the placenta, into the testes to cause damage to these cells.

289
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:18,090
So that's the end of we're going to move somewhere that we've done absorption distribution.

290
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:24,160
Now we're moving into metabolism. I'll just pause there and see if anyone has any questions before I move on to metabolism.

291
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:30,610
He's like, We're good to go. Another word.

292
00:30:30,850 --> 00:30:36,700
So after absorption and distribution, another word for metabolism is bio transformation.

293
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:43,360
So we're transforming chemicals that are exposed to in a variety of ways, which we'll talk about over the next few slides.

294
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:55,820
So we could think about either, you know, bio transforming or metabolizing a toxicant or, you know, we metabolize drugs the same way.

295
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:02,720
So we can think about like a chemical, a toxic chemical like benzene.

296
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:10,160
And just a quick note, like for, you know, we may have different levels of background in chemistry here.

297
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:14,390
So these are three different ways of showing the same chemical structure.

298
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:25,370
So like we have these carbon atoms in a ring with these attached hydrogens and then these are double bonds between these these carbons here.

299
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:32,480
This is just showing the same thing in different like northern culture. So we're exposed to one.

300
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:37,430
So imagine being exposed to one chemical like benzene, which is toxic.

301
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:43,970
And we know it has certain toxic effects that can increase risk for developing like leukemia for exposed individuals.

302
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:53,220
The question then is we know that after exposed to benzene, we have a number of different metabolites that arise from that.

303
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,600
The body metabolizes benzene through a number of different pathways.

304
00:31:56,930 --> 00:32:04,040
We see a number of different metabolites in the blood or other parts of the body in the urine after exposure to benzene.

305
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:09,200
And so the question is, is there and is there one toxic metabolite?

306
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,170
Like if you had all of these and you know that all of these could potentially play a role, like which one of these is the toxic metabolite?

307
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:23,000
It's oftentimes in toxicology, not what we call the parent compound or the compound that we're initially exposed to that is the most toxic,

308
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:31,850
but some downstream metabolite. So you can understand why that gets kind of challenging to understand the toxicology

309
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:36,260
of a chemical when we have all these different metabolic pathways to consider.

310
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:45,829
And this is just, you know, going back to that notion that I'm not going to expect you to like I'm going to be talking in the next few slides.

311
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:52,370
There's going to be a lot of these, like, structures of different different structures of molecules and things.

312
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:58,370
So I'm not going to expect you to like, do like really detailed, like chemistry, annotations or anything in this class.

313
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:05,510
But I do want you to be sort of understanding the basics of the chemical structures and the metabolic pathways that we discussed.

314
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:11,930
So depending on your background, if any of this is like just like a black box for you're not making sense at all,

315
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:18,740
please let me know and we can talk it over in office hours or something and go over whatever you're not understanding.

316
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,910
So I just didn't want to throw all these structures at you without that caveat.

317
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,200
So if something is just, like, totally not making sense, please let me know.

318
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:33,460
But again, not expecting you to like do like in a chemistry class where you're like understanding all this bond.

319
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,780
We'll go here and do that. Just kind of the basics of what I'm talking about.

320
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,120
I think you'll understand as I talk through these next few slides.

321
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:48,519
So. So bio transformation, as the name implies,

322
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,530
it's our body sort of transforming these chemicals and we alter chemicals that are

323
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:59,169
exposed to we also alter like exogenous chemicals through like normal metabolism.

324
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:05,740
So this can include things like antibiotics, amino acids, nutrients, waste products, hormones, drugs.

325
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:14,049
All of these are bio transformed in the body. Essentially what you're trying to do with bio transformation is to convert something

326
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,250
that's lipophilic or non-polar to something that's water soluble or polar.

327
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:26,380
And so what this does is makes it more easy for the body to excrete that chemical or that metabolite into the urine or the feces.

328
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:34,260
So we've developed a variety or evolved a variety of specialized enzymes that that are pretty dynamic.

329
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:42,330
And it's like lots of different families and different flavors of enzymes that do different types of reactions in this sort of space.

330
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:47,420
Right. An important thing to remember is that these are like can be like dynamically induced.

331
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,790
So, you know, we can get upregulation or more production of certain enzymes after like an initial exposure to a chemical.

332
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:00,939
And that is something that we need to take into account. They're not all like expressed at the same level all the time.

333
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:06,160
We have these like this dynamic, dynamic processes. They can change over the course of a lifetime.

334
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:13,000
An infant does not necessarily have the same enzymatic metabolic enzyme profile as an adult.

335
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,260
So it's a highly dynamic sort of space to think about.

336
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:24,070
And even something like taking one type of drug on Monday could cause an increase

337
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,219
where if you take something else or maybe you go out drinking on Tuesday,

338
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,930
that could change how your body responds.

339
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:37,230
Because if upregulate it a certain family of enzymes that maybe play a role in like metabolizing alcohol, for example.

340
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:44,560
So this is where we have to think about things like drug drug combinations or chemical chemical combinations and what that might entail,

341
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:53,980
you know, in terms of like up regulating or down regulating a particular enzyme in terms of, you know, other chemical exposures.

342
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:01,160
Josh Right. So it's bio transformation includes three steps.

343
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,820
So one is called Functionalization. The first one.

344
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:09,770
So this is we can think of it. I think of it as like priming the molecule.

345
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,120
We'll talk about that in a minute, but. Okay. Yeah.

346
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:23,120
So that's going to involve basically either adding a functional group or exposing a functional group like an O age group, oxygen, hydrogen, you know,

347
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:26,090
an age group or something on that molecule,

348
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:32,380
which makes the next step biosynthesis a little bit easier and more favorable, like energetically to happen.

349
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:40,700
Right? And so biosynthesis is where we essentially take a usually oftentimes like a bigger molecule,

350
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,330
like a really big molecule and attach it to that metabolite.

351
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,300
And that makes when that happens, it makes the molecule more water soluble and easier to excrete.

352
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:56,730
And then finally, the third step is excretion, either through urine or feces or exhalation.

353
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,760
There's a couple other versions that we'll talk about later on.

354
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:09,340
So we often call Functionalization Phase one bio transformation, sort of like getting this molecule ready for the next step.

355
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:14,770
And so what you're doing is modifying the chemical structure in order to expose or add a functional group.

356
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:19,940
And so these could look like different things like weights groups, S-H groups, you know,

357
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:27,400
different types of these molecular groups that are like you'll see like hanging off the structure of a molecule.

358
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:36,960
And this is usually done via oxidation reduction or hydrolysis reactions, and I'll talk about examples of those going forward here.

359
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:50,050
By far like the biggest phase one enzyme family that we're going to talk about and that's like most relevant for toxicology are the cytochrome p450.

360
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:55,660
These are like huge. They metabolize a huge variety of chemicals and drugs.

361
00:37:56,470 --> 00:38:07,000
There's many different families. They'll often have a normal culture like CYP one, a one or CYP one, a two, cyp3a4 sip one, B one, etc.

362
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,330
So those are the cytochrome p450.

363
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:17,280
They catalyze these oxidation reactions and so oxidation for the person you may remember from your chemistry classes.

364
00:38:17,290 --> 00:38:27,340
Oxidation means the loss of an electron in this class that's usually going to be paired with an oxygen either being exposed or added to the molecule.

365
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:33,399
And so you can see different types of that reaction here that can be catalyzed by a p450.

366
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:43,270
So you have like this, oh, age group added to this part of the molecule here this like a Parkside added here with this oxygen here.

367
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:49,390
Yeah. This double bonded oxygen. So the p450 is are catalyzing these types of reactions.

368
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:55,430
They also an important part for like my world in reproductive and endocrine

369
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:59,330
disruption toxicology is they play a role actually in like hormone metabolism.

370
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:09,020
And so chemicals that are endocrine disruptors you'll often see inhibit cytochrome p450 activity the

371
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:16,040
cytochrome cytochrome p450 that are responsible for like the synthesis of important hormones for biology,

372
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,080
but they're also important for metabolizing exogenous chemicals.

373
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,339
Other types of families of these enzymes.

374
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:35,610
There are some those are flavored mono oxygen cases of you have your alcohol or aldehyde oxidase is a mean oxidase is peroxide cases etc.

375
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:43,540
so but really these guys are like it's kind of hard to over to stress too much how important these are to like toxicology in pharmacology.

376
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:55,570
Not to give the other guys short shrift, but. So an example of an oxidation metabolism reaction is the metabolism of ethanol.

377
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,560
So ethanol has this chemical structure.

378
00:40:00,430 --> 00:40:07,630
It's converted into a chemical called Acetaldehyde by an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase.

379
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:11,250
And so you see this change in the structure here.

380
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:20,110
You get this oxygen with a double bond here that's further metabolized to acetate by an enzyme called aldehyde dehydrogenase.

381
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:23,950
So again, you get another change in the molecular structure.

382
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:31,610
If you've ever had the experience of being hung over a lot of that, that feeling of sickness, headache, nausea,

383
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:39,250
you know, all the things that go along with that acetaldehyde is probably the most responsible molecule for that.

384
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,310
It's it's an aldehyde aldehydes. Think of like formaldehyde.

385
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:48,590
These things are like generally not good for us. They're toxic metabolites.

386
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:58,010
And so yeah. So that's a ah but what we're trying to do is convert this ethanol all the way to this acetate in terms of metabolizing this chemical.

387
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,290
And if you remember in an earlier lecture,

388
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:12,640
I talked about how this ethanol process has this like zero order kinetics where you can only metabolize so much before you basically hit a limit.

389
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:17,950
And so what happens when we get hung over is our bodies basically are our enzyme systems are overwhelmed,

390
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:22,000
not able to metabolize all of that ethanol into the acetate.

391
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:27,430
And so you get a buildup of this acetaldehyde molecule and that causes these ill health effects.

392
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:33,950
We've actually sort of like utilized this phenomenon in terms of treating

393
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:39,829
alcoholism where there's this drug and abuse that when an individual takes it,

394
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:43,640
it suppresses this alcohol, aldehyde, dehydrogenase enzymes.

395
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:48,230
So what ends up happening is if that individual then drinks alcohol,

396
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,919
they get a build up of this acetaldehyde because this reaction is not happening

397
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:55,760
and they have essentially a bad reaction to the alcohol and they get really ill.

398
00:41:56,060 --> 00:42:05,270
And it's a way of, you know, essentially causing people to not want to crave alcohol at all because they have this bad reaction when they drink it.

399
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:14,350
So we also have reduction. This is gain of electrons.

400
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:20,620
So we have a this is a class of enzymes called reductase or reductive de halogen ACS.

401
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,150
So they'll be catalyzing these types of reaction.

402
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,800
We see this a lot in like gut microbes are able to do this or have enzymes that can catalyze these reactions.

403
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:39,610
A while back, I was talking to a professor that was doing some pretty cool research in remediation of toxic sites.

404
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:48,250
So he was specializing when I had talked to him in cleaning up these areas where there had been like military,

405
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,969
a lot of like military testing of like military grade equipment and things.

406
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:59,470
And these sites end up getting like contaminated with all of these, like, wild chemicals that are used in military weapons.

407
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:03,970
Right. And so in a lot of them, I think I believe I'm not like an expert in this area,

408
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:06,820
but I think a lot of them are like these, like nitro type of compounds.

409
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:14,340
So what he was looking at was if you plant certain types of grasses on these sites,

410
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,110
they'll uptake some of these toxic chemicals that are associated with these weapons.

411
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:27,479
And he actually found that like ruminants, like sheep who specialize in sheep when they eat the grass that is uptake in these toxic chemicals.

412
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,680
They have like these like all variety of like microbes like that.

413
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:39,090
We haven't even like fully characterized yet that have these enzymes that are actually able to like convert these chemicals into like inert,

414
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:48,060
inert compounds or like relatively inert compounds. So it's like a way of remediating these toxic, toxic sites using the sheep.

415
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,059
And he was doing a lot of research trying to understand, like,

416
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:56,820
what enzymes and what microbes live in the guts of these animals that allow for these types of reactions,

417
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:00,840
because there's a lot of microbes that we still haven't even, like cultured in a lab yet.

418
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:09,010
So it's it's a pretty fascinating area of research. I thought so that these production enzymes make me think of that.

419
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:12,840
So I think there's probably a lot of reductase involved in those microbes.

420
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:21,890
So another one is hydrolysis. And this one, the name is maybe a little intuitive here.

421
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:27,170
So hydro meaning water and lysis in this case, meaning to like split apart or break apart.

422
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:36,620
So essentially what you're doing here is adding a water molecule into like a a water molecule into another molecule and basically splitting it apart.

423
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:46,130
So you see this like ether group here, you can add a water molecule via one of these enzymes and it like splits it apart or you're adding this,

424
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:53,060
these two H's and this O and T here and causing like two, two separate molecules split by this water.

425
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:57,350
There's another example here. Those are hydro.

426
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:10,749
That's hydrolysis. And so another way that we that people have cleverly taken taken advantage of these like enzyme

427
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:15,830
systems for like therapeutic purposes is in the development of what are called pro drugs.

428
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:24,040
So this is a case where the parent compound is not the compound that's going to be doing the action or the therapeutic effect in the tissue.

429
00:45:24,370 --> 00:45:32,650
But you basically set it up where the body will metabolize the chemical to the active compound that you want.

430
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:43,010
Right. So there's this drug dip as aspirin that is used in glaucoma treatment and this chemical.

431
00:45:43,030 --> 00:45:46,120
And so the active chemical, this case you want is epinephrine.

432
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:51,790
But compared to epinephrine, GIP is that friend is more lipophilic.

433
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,760
And so it's like more likely to get to the target site where it will then be hydrolyzed or undergo hydrolysis.

434
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:03,600
And so you're going to get like a longer lasting, more efficient use of this drug than if you were to just dose of epinephrine.

435
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:07,450
It's not going to make it to the part of the body that you want it to get to.

436
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:12,600
So you can be, you know, people who are developing these drugs in these therapeutics,

437
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:20,740
like are very clever and can manipulate the chemistry in this way to take advantage of what our body is going to do to the chemical anyway.

438
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:24,040
Right. As part of its normal processing of the drug.

439
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:31,600
So that's phase one. Any questions?

440
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:37,260
That makes sense, right? So that's kind of like you're priming stuff in a lot of ways.

441
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:41,220
Like you're phase two is what we're going to do.

442
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:46,920
We're going to do what's called conjugation of these bigger functional groups.

443
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,879
And these require cofactors, which I'll talk about in a minute.

444
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,190
So these are like extra factors that we need to make to make the reaction work.

445
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,850
And the goal here is to increase water solubility again, which will facilitate excretion of the chemical.

446
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:06,810
These are generally occurring in the cytosol or inside the cell.

447
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:24,550
One good example is the reaction called Kluger here on Edition, where we add this glue guaranteed conjugate to this molecule.

448
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,270
Right? So we start with our parent compound.

449
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:32,810
They undergo the initial phase one reaction and you see the exposure of this age group here, this adding of this age group here.

450
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:39,769
And then what you what you end up doing is attaching this big, bulky molecule essentially to this to this larger one.

451
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:46,370
And so you formed this like conjugate this group here on a conjugate, and this guy is going to be much more water soluble than this guy.

452
00:47:49,930 --> 00:47:56,170
And the cofactor necessary for that is called UDP glucose, chronic acid or UDP PGA.

453
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:01,600
So this is the cofactor and you can see this functional group that gets added to this molecule.

454
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:09,100
And yes, so but this is the entire molecule and this part is the part that gets attached essentially to form the conjugate.

455
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:15,370
So you add the scoop you're on. Yeah. This is the cofactor that's required.

456
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:21,900
It's catalyzed by a group of enzymes called UDP, Glucose Radziwill Transfer, ACS or Eugene TS.

457
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:29,320
So the enzyme is what causes basically takes this and this and combines it to make this.

458
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:38,150
So this is a case where this cofactor is in limited supply in the cell.

459
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,710
So you have a cellular concentration of about 350 micro molar.

460
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:46,720
And so if you use up all of that concentration, you know,

461
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:53,530
you may end up with the phase one metabolites sort of kicking around and not able to go to the next phase to reaction.

462
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:57,549
And so if this, for example, were like highly toxic,

463
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:06,610
then you have a concerning situation where you have this active toxic metabolite that's not able to be fully metabolized and excreted from the body.

464
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:14,410
And so we want to pay attention to things like the limited availability of certain cofactors that are necessary for these reactions to take place.

465
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,049
And that's across a few different enzyme systems we want to be when we're thinking about this,

466
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:23,830
you ought to be thinking about, okay, what, what cofactors are necessary for this to happen.

467
00:49:26,170 --> 00:49:30,550
Anything else there? I don't think so.

468
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:35,620
We also have sulfur nation, and this is not such a bulky molecule that we're adding this time.

469
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:38,650
It's just an excellent sulfur oxide group here.

470
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:46,150
In this case, the cofactor is called adenosine three phosphate, five possible sulfur name.

471
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:53,080
So this is the cofactor. You basically take this part and add it to add it to the molecule.

472
00:49:53,090 --> 00:50:04,330
So you start out with this, these enzymes are called sulfur transferase this so pops so it's this plus this yields this molecule.

473
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:11,170
So again, catalyze the sulfur transfer races are also new Altis.

474
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:16,899
And there's an even lower concentration of this cofactor on the cells.

475
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:21,320
So the earlier one was 350 microbial or this is 75 microbial.

476
00:50:21,370 --> 00:50:25,450
Ah, so again limited supply of these cofactors.

477
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:29,260
Let's see if there's anything else there. Yeah.

478
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,850
So this is also this is a pretty common zero abiotic metabolic pathways.

479
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:36,610
A lot of chemicals are metabolized using this process.

480
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:52,570
EPA is a big one. So just to take a just to talk about a real world example for a second, this is all this from a paper published in 2016.

481
00:50:52,570 --> 00:50:57,340
And so this is the composition of urinary total BPA in pregnant women.

482
00:50:57,670 --> 00:51:07,690
And you see different sort of proportions of the forms of BPA in the urine of these pregnant women.

483
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:13,600
Right. And so, for example, most of the BPA is gluconate data.

484
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:19,220
So you'll see this BPA attached to this gluconate molecule, and that's the bulk of what they're picking up there.

485
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,860
They looked at several different exposure levels of BPA. So that's what these different columns are.

486
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,590
And then they're broken out by the forms of BPA.

487
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:33,159
So bisphenol A conjugated to this good rounded molecule that appears to be the main metabolic pathway.

488
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:38,500
Right. Because that's where we're picking up that conjugate the most in the urine of these pregnant women.

489
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:44,649
There's this sulfur dated form, however, that is also a minor pathway.

490
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:50,830
So BPA appears to be conjugated by the school gravitation pathway and the sulfide pathway both.

491
00:51:51,940 --> 00:51:55,360
And then finally, you also have an conjugated BPA.

492
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,700
So what's going on there? There might be microbes in the gut, for example, that are actually.

493
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:04,940
Undoing the reaction or essentially like cutting off that conjugate.

494
00:52:04,970 --> 00:52:11,390
So you see this happened as well sometimes, or maybe for some reason the VP's making it all the way through the system,

495
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:16,460
not being conjugate into anything due to maybe the fact that there weren't enough cofactors.

496
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:22,430
There's a number of different ways that might a number of different reasons that we might see that type of effect.

497
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:28,729
But long story short, when you are thinking about exposure to a chemical,

498
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:35,480
you have to sort of account for these different forms of the chemical you might be seeing based on how the body metabolizes that chemical.

499
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:41,120
So if it's both good, outdated and sulfonate, it, um, you may want to,

500
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:47,330
you're going to need to account for both of those in order to understand the full level of exposures that that person has faced up to that point.

501
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:54,949
And there's some considerations talked about in this paper that I thought were interesting.

502
00:52:54,950 --> 00:53:09,219
So. For example, certain enzymes like beta glucan on a base that are highly active in the placenta and fetal liver can de conjugate.

503
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,250
So basically undo the work of these phase two metabolites.

504
00:53:12,520 --> 00:53:18,009
And so you could you could potentially get in a situation where the body within these parts of the body,

505
00:53:18,010 --> 00:53:22,059
like the placenta or in the fetus, the chemical is conjugated or metabolized.

506
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:29,930
But there are other enzymes that are basically undoing that work within the same compartment or the same like in the fetal liver or the placenta.

507
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:38,230
So there's a lot of dynamics that go on here in terms of the conjugation of chemicals and then potentially conjugation of chemicals.

508
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:45,009
In addition, they note that there are studies that show that even the BPA could carotid dated form,

509
00:53:45,010 --> 00:53:50,830
even though it's been metabolized and is ready for excretion, that could also potentially be biologically active.

510
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,720
There's some data to indicate that.

511
00:53:53,140 --> 00:54:02,200
So we may need to account for even the greater dated form of BPA in terms of, uh, impacts, you know, in terms of toxic impacts.

512
00:54:02,650 --> 00:54:10,540
So these are just some kind of interesting little notes to complicate the situation in terms of the body's ability to metabolize chemical.

513
00:54:12,430 --> 00:54:15,910
A conjugated molecule isn't necessarily an inactive molecule.

514
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:20,500
It's just going to be excreted easier from the body.

515
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:26,060
Everything they sense said so far. Questions.

516
00:54:28,450 --> 00:54:41,580
Okay. Cool. So another more minor pathway is methylation which the cofactor in that case is adenosine on the thiamin or Sam.

517
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,900
It looks like this. This is kind of an odd one.

518
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:52,950
In some cases this can actually this conjugated to this or methylated using this

519
00:54:53,310 --> 00:54:59,250
cofactor can actually decrease water solubility and make chemicals more toxic.

520
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:01,670
So this is kind of an odd one out a little bit.

521
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:10,140
This cofactor also plays a role in like we've talked about DNA methylation and other parts of the other earlier lectures.

522
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:17,460
So it plays a role in like DNA methylation in terms of like normal epigenetic regulation of gene expression.

523
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:24,569
Another major one is glutathione on conjugation.

524
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:33,300
So this is a glue to file molecules. An important cofactor of the flame is gamma glutamate sustained l glycine.

525
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:42,510
They as opposed to the other chemical cofactors we talked about that were found at micro microbial levels.

526
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:47,360
This guy's found at billable levels. So 5 to 10 million molar in the liver.

527
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:54,940
So like the liver like has like a really powerful glue to find on conjugation systems that work.

528
00:55:56,080 --> 00:55:56,590
In fact,

529
00:55:56,590 --> 00:56:04,600
this is the enzymes that catalyze the conjugation to clarify known make up of can make up to like 10% of the total cellular protein in the liver.

530
00:56:05,110 --> 00:56:09,010
This is like a really major pathway for metabolism.

531
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:14,910
The school to find conjugation. Let's see.

532
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:17,310
Yeah, this is kind of just and this is the pathway.

533
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:26,640
If you want to dove into some more of the details here, it's actually we're actually showing our salvation food renovation and goodness.

534
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:30,300
I am conjugation here. But, um. Yeah.

535
00:56:33,610 --> 00:56:41,920
It's just repeating some of the stuff I said. So those are some of the major metabolic pathways and enzymes and cofactors involved.

536
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:48,940
There is for all of the enzyme systems I just talked about, there's like a lot of different subfamilies, like a set of cytochrome p450.

537
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:54,550
There's different flavors and different families of like sulfur transfer cases are grouped around the bases, etc.

538
00:56:55,990 --> 00:57:01,180
So at this point we're now at phase three excretion.

539
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:06,400
So this is getting rid of the chemical. So kind of bringing us up to where we are.

540
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:12,459
Hopefully you can. We can we've reasonably addressed like all of the processes of, for instance,

541
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:23,290
a drug being taken by a transporter into a cell undergoing phase one metabolite metabolism via one of these processes forming one type of metabolite.

542
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:30,790
And then we undergo phase two, which is this conjugation with a another molecule forming a conjugate.

543
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:38,920
And typically the cell has like transporters that can recognize this conjugate and basically just excrete it from the cell for excretion in the urine,

544
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:46,420
her feces. So urinary excretion, we're really going to be thinking about the kidneys here.

545
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:55,749
And with kidney with kidney excretion, we're talking about about what's called glomerular filtration.

546
00:57:55,750 --> 00:58:00,700
And we're going to talk in more detail about kidney biology in a later lecture.

547
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:13,260
But for now, basically what I want you to know is so we have the blood here and both other byproducts of like endogenous metabolism and like

548
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:20,950
toxicants that need to be excreted can be uptake in into the kidney cell and then basically sent into this glomerular filtration.

549
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:28,120
However, we don't necessarily want to get rid of all of that stuff that ends up here in via the urine.

550
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,570
You might want to re uptake some of this so some kidney cells can also reabsorb

551
00:58:31,570 --> 00:58:36,160
chemicals back in so that they're not lost and kind of reabsorbed back into the blood.

552
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:42,130
But the stuff we don't want is going to be lost to urine or in the urine.

553
00:58:42,430 --> 00:58:49,300
So basically you're getting rid of the bad stuff with this excretion function and wanting to keep the good stuff with this reabsorption function.

554
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:58,940
And then again, our friend that we've talked about many times, the acting all water coefficient or KUOW,

555
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:04,249
things that have a high KW are going to be tended to be more favorable in terms of rate absorption.

556
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:10,490
If they're non ionized molecules non-polar, they're going to be favored in terms of reabsorption or absorption.

557
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:17,240
One thing to remember, again, I always like to bring up these differences of life stages.

558
00:59:17,570 --> 00:59:20,990
Newborns have different kidney function than fully developed adults,

559
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:25,970
so you get a slower secretion of some toxicants in a newborn as the kidneys are still developing.

560
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:34,520
And then another important group to think about our individuals with kidney diseases that may have impacted

561
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:40,010
kidney function so they may not be able to secrete toxicants as efficiently as those with healthy kidneys.

562
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:47,640
So when we think about susceptible populations of individuals, we need to think about things like newborns or,

563
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:53,120
you know, individuals with, you know, impacted kidney function due to some kind of kidney disease.

564
00:59:57,020 --> 01:00:03,740
So fecal excretion in some ways can be considered a best case scenario for toxicology.

565
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,939
And what I mean by that is if you think back to one of the earlier lectures,

566
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:14,690
I talked about how the GI tract inside of the GI tract is kind of is technically outside of the body, so it hasn't been absorbed.

567
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:21,620
And so if a chemical is in the in the feces, it's actually external to the body.

568
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:28,550
If it's made it all the way to that point and is being excreted. It's considered like not absorbed, just and not really.

569
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:32,059
You know, there's not a lot of potential for any kind of toxic effect to happen in that case,

570
01:00:32,060 --> 01:00:38,960
because the chemical has not really been absorbed into the body. So it passes through the GI tract and absorbed like great.

571
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:46,130
It hasn't you know, there's not going to really be much toxicology to speak of in that case within the GI tract.

572
01:00:46,670 --> 01:00:51,500
We do have these microbes. We have the word where we're thinking about like the microbiology of our guts.

573
01:00:51,890 --> 01:01:01,520
They can actually bio transform chemicals and make them more more efficiently absorbed or maybe easier to excrete.

574
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:11,360
Now, it could go either way. So we need to think about this extra sort of factor of the microbiome that we each have in our bodies and in our guts.

575
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:20,090
We can also think about biliary excretion, which is a way that the body helps to digest fats.

576
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,500
So phase one and phase two metabolites can be pumped into the bile.

577
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:33,410
This is in the liver, in a liver cell and then delivered to the gallbladder, deliver to the small intestine and then excreted in the feces.

578
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:38,000
Right. So you have like transporters that can facilitate this type of reaction.

579
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:45,890
Important thing to consider is that this can lead to what's called enteral hepatic cycling,

580
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:55,640
where in this case a toxicant or exposed to a toxicant, it's ends up in our GI tract that that's then delivered by the blood into the liver.

581
01:01:56,030 --> 01:02:03,649
And then if it's put into the bile, the bile that goes into the GI, into the GI tract to be excreted by feces.

582
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:10,950
Right. If that happens, then that chemical may be conjugated to like, say, a good Drano.

583
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:16,850
You know what? That good chronic conjugation. So it's got its target, this really big rawhide molecule.

584
01:02:16,850 --> 01:02:19,860
So it's like on its way to be excreted, like really efficiently.

585
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:25,429
However, there might be microbes within the gut that basically undo that reaction,

586
01:02:25,430 --> 01:02:30,229
take the controlled molecule off and the chemical then might go back to being more

587
01:02:30,230 --> 01:02:35,810
lipophilic and then reabsorbed into the gastrointestinal tract and then sent to the liver.

588
01:02:36,050 --> 01:02:45,620
And then the whole process starts again. So if a chemical is prone to this type of intrahepatic cycling, if it's like a drug,

589
01:02:45,620 --> 01:02:50,840
you got to think about like how much more how's that going to affect the area under the curve, if you will?

590
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:55,940
You know, you're going to get a much bigger than you initially predicted time that this chemical is

591
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:02,000
residing in the body compared to if this like if this was not a phenomenon that was happening.

592
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:07,370
Right. So this is all stuff that we've got to be thinking about when we're like designing drugs or trying to,

593
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:10,760
like, bottle how chemicals move throughout the body.

594
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:24,240
Yeah. This is just what I just said. Intestinal microbiota, hydrolyzed gluconate and sulfide conjugates.

595
01:03:24,290 --> 01:03:27,460
Right. Yeah.

596
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:31,990
So these compounds can now be lipophilic again, so they can be reabsorbed anyway.

597
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:37,040
So the whole process over again. So. Right.

598
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:41,650
It's good when I covered it all from memory and it just passes through.

599
01:03:44,710 --> 01:03:53,200
A little bit. So now we're kind of moving on to the more minor areas that aren't as much at play across as many chemicals,

600
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:59,690
exhalations, chemicals that are in the gas phase of body temperature or volatile chemicals.

601
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:01,630
These can be eliminated through exhalation.

602
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:09,670
And probably the best example that we can think of for that is that that's why we could do the breathalyzer test for alcohol body burden.

603
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:14,260
You can basically breathe out ethanol.

604
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:23,390
In this case, there aren't as many of these, like fancy light transport systems we've been talking about as far as we know.

605
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:27,710
A lot of this, we think, is just due to like diffusion across like different parts,

606
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:34,040
across like different compartments of the body leading to the chemical coming out in exhalation.

607
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:40,490
So there's not like we haven't so far, as far as we know, like characterize any really specific transport mechanisms.

608
01:04:40,490 --> 01:04:46,340
This is just kind of like chemistry at work. It's like chemicals moving by it through the process of diffusion.

609
01:04:49,670 --> 01:04:55,220
Other rates of elimination. Cerebrospinal fluid and then breastmilk.

610
01:04:56,180 --> 01:05:01,370
I hesitate almost to even call that a more minor one, although it's maybe not as much at play.

611
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:06,850
But breast milk is a way that we excrete certain chemicals.

612
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:09,110
We know that certain chemicals, like, again,

613
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:17,970
lipophilic chemicals can end up in the breast milk and that nursing infants can be exposed to chemicals via that mouth, thinking about like PCBs.

614
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:29,600
And so this is like a pretty active area of research, of really understanding of the transfer of toxicants to infants.

615
01:05:30,770 --> 01:05:34,490
But the breast milk is like super healthy.

616
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:44,030
I'm sure, you know, many of you have heard this. Like, it's still a recommendation in terms of the preference of breastfeeding versus formula feeding.

617
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:50,210
Breastfeeding is like still considered, you know, the the healthier way to go like across the board,

618
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:59,210
even with this added burden of like toxic chemicals that basically everyone is facing in modern society.

619
01:06:01,130 --> 01:06:07,160
But, you know, there could be conceptually a situation where a pregnant or someone that was pregnant,

620
01:06:07,160 --> 01:06:14,660
a new a new mother maybe have been in a highly exposed area where that a doctor may,

621
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:17,930
in that individual case, say, like, we don't think it's a good idea.

622
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:21,350
We think formula might be the way to go in that case.

623
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:23,660
But that's very, very rare.

624
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:34,270
Most individuals, it's going to be breastfeeding is still the the number one preferred method of feeding an infant, but we're still looking into it.

625
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:38,030
You know, there's still things that we don't understand about all of that biology.

626
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:42,720
And you know what? All chemicals are ending up in the breast milk. So it's still an active area of research.

627
01:06:43,640 --> 01:06:51,110
So if you're interested in fetal maternal health or maternal infant health, it's a it's it's pretty interesting to read those studies.

628
01:06:52,340 --> 01:06:56,750
And then you have sweat and saliva, you know, kind of relatively minor areas of elimination.

629
01:06:58,730 --> 01:07:03,930
So hopefully at this point. What I'd like you to be able to do.

630
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:10,500
You know, if I you know, and if any of this doesn't make sense, what I'd like you to be able to like,

631
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:17,820
basically look at the different types of exposures via the different routes of exposure like ingestion,

632
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:26,190
inhalation or dermal exposure, and be able to basically look through this chart and this graphic and understand,

633
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:34,200
you know, at least, you know, to some degree how these chemicals would be moving through these different compartments, like through the skin,

634
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:42,810
into the blood and how this certain chemical might be distributing then into the kidney and then excreted into the urine.

635
01:07:43,110 --> 01:07:52,560
So hopefully nothing on here seems too much of a black box at this point because I think we've touched on everything in this figure.

636
01:07:53,010 --> 01:07:58,860
If there's something that still doesn't make a lot of sense, please again, come and talk to me.

637
01:07:58,860 --> 01:08:06,570
But I think we've had it all and I think that will be the end of this lecture unless anyone has any final questions.

638
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:13,230
But just look this over and see if there's anything that, like, seems unfamiliar and let me know if that's the case.

639
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:20,550
Any questions? Thank you.

640
01:08:20,790 --> 01:08:28,980
So no class on Monday, remember? Exam will open on Monday, 945, I believe the Monday morning.

641
01:08:29,550 --> 01:08:36,930
It'll be available for a week, but once you open it, you have to finish it in 24 hours and do not work together.

642
01:08:37,230 --> 01:08:43,290
It's open book, open note, and it's depending on how you felt about the problems.

643
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:48,240
The solutions to that will be available on October four.

644
01:08:48,720 --> 01:08:54,090
So factor that in to when you want to take your 24 hours to do the exam.

645
01:08:55,650 --> 01:08:59,639
If you feel like you were able to do the problem with no problems at all and you feel

646
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:03,990
really confident that we can go ahead and take it on October 30 a lot and then we don't.

647
01:09:03,990 --> 01:09:09,809
And, you know, you could use what would have been class time to take it or prepare yourself

648
01:09:09,810 --> 01:09:14,700
and look over your material for taking it from October 3rd to October ten.

649
01:09:16,470 --> 01:09:19,920
Sorry, 37 states opens in 24 hours once we open it.

650
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:24,780
But do you have an estimate of how long it would actually take out of range?

651
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:35,060
Oh, that's a yeah. I think generally you want to think like a class period or maybe maybe give yourself a little bit longer, you know,

652
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:46,830
just to like if you think maybe it's 3 hours on, you just generally wouldn't be shooting for like giving you like a six hour exam, you know?

653
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:54,210
Thank you. Okay, thanks, everybody. See you Monday.

654
01:09:54,390 --> 01:09:55,260
Next Wednesday.
