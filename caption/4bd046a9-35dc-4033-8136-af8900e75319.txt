1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,030
Okay. So I think we we left off talking about.

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,940
Gastric versus small bowel feedings.

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,720
In what situations would we prefer to feed to feed into the stomach versus when might we want to advance and feed into the small ball?

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:26,670
So we'll talk about small bowel or often will be referred to as post pyloric feed.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:32,100
So really extending the to pass that pylori into either the duodenum or there

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,790
are some situations where we purposely try and get it well into the vagina,

7
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,670
which we'll talk about a little bit later in the semester. So the most.

8
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:46,519
Now recall from last week or if you weren't here make sure you watch the recordings are kind of piecemeal

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,179
because this the Panopto doesn't let me pause like for our break to like stop and do a whole new recording.

10
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,809
So I'm going to see if we have a work around that and try and combine them.

11
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:02,140
But. In general, we're going to feed into the stomach, right?

12
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:07,850
That's going to be our preference. Usually, if there's a reason that we can't the patient can't eat orally,

13
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:15,470
maybe there's really bad dysphagia or just a lot of side effects in the oral parents that we can't see that.

14
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,070
Usually we always try and feed into the stomach when possible.

15
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:23,570
But there are some situations where we do need to feed postpaid correctly.

16
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:28,729
So the most common include previous gastric feeding intolerance.

17
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:34,730
So sometimes we'll do a trial of two feedings into the stomach and maybe the patient doesn't tolerate it.

18
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,350
So we'll kind of define what that means.

19
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:46,940
If somebody is tolerating there, there are two feeds and we may then advance the tube into the small mobile if there's a high risk for aspiration.

20
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,920
We touched on this that that this is a little bit controversial.

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,980
But our next slide, we'll get into this a little bit more.

22
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:03,690
Previous history of aspiration, or if we know that there's poor competence of that lower esophageal sphincter,

23
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:10,440
that might make them at risk for aspiration. Those patients may benefit from advancing the tube into this mobile.

24
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:17,850
If there's repeated high gastric residual volumes, has anybody heard of that term gastric residual volume?

25
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,770
I wouldn't expect you to. We'll talk about it a little bit.

26
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,780
This is another controversial topic in terms of should we be checking these?

27
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,150
What are they? They're kind of subjective in terms of how they're measured.

28
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:38,760
So the literature is really interesting to look at guidance on these grooves.

29
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,280
But we'll we'll get into that a little bit further. If there is a gastric outlet obstruction.

30
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,169
So what this is this is a. A clinical syndrome that we may see.

31
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,410
And this is. Usually where the pie laws is.

32
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:04,360
Unable to relax. So it almost like creates an obstruction so that we can't get the contents from

33
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,620
the stomach to go into the small bowel because that high loris is not relaxing.

34
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:17,529
So it kind of creates this this outlet obstruction. A proximal fistula.

35
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:25,559
So. We talked about it in situations where there's a picture that's more dishonest

36
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,219
mobile we might not that might actually be a contraindication defeating it all.

37
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:37,770
But if it's more proximal and we can go below where the fistula is, that often would be into this model that we might have to do.

38
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,060
So need for multiple operations procedures and or test so.

39
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:55,160
More recently, we have started continuing to feed our patients while they're sent away for a procedure.

40
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,739
Whereas before, like when I was working in the hospital, it was always hold the two feedings the night before a procedure.

41
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:11,219
And you can imagine how if we're holding two feedings at midnight, maybe their procedure is at noon the next day, and then maybe there's a delay.

42
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:19,220
They get back at like 4:00 to their room. Like it starts to add up in terms of many hours where patients go without their feeding.

43
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:26,309
So there's been new initiatives to try and feed safely during more low risk procedures.

44
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:33,719
And we're really only able to do that with small bowel access just because of the risk of potential aspiration or complications.

45
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,930
If if a patient is under anesthesia in there, we're delivering formula into the stomach.

46
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:47,810
So that really only works for for small bowel feedings if a patient needs to be in a prone position.

47
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:53,640
Can you think of a reason why somebody might have to be, like, completely flat?

48
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:03,010
Yeah. Maybe like a spinal surgery. Yeah, like if there's a a spinal injury patient, so they might.

49
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,930
They might not. You know, we always kind of elevate the head of the bed for any of our two feeding patients,

50
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,150
but if they have to be completely flat, if you think about just gravity,

51
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,990
they're laying completely flat and we're delivering formula into the stomach that's going to put them at a greater risk to aspirate those content.

52
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:28,060
So the further down we can feed into the small bowel is more helpful if somebody has to be in a problem position.

53
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:34,819
All right. And I want to talk about pancreatitis. We'll do a whole day on pancreatitis.

54
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,209
So pancreatitis.

55
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:50,360
So a patient that has having pancreatitis, which is usually if it's a more moderate to severe case of pancreatitis, these patients are hospitalized.

56
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:56,809
They're in a lot of pain. There's a lot of usually vomiting, inability to keep anything down.

57
00:05:56,810 --> 00:06:01,610
So pancreatitis can be quite severe. So a lot of times these patients are in the hospital.

58
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Now. It used to be thought that this just having pancreatitis would be an indication to feed into the small ball.

59
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:18,980
Well, we'll talk about this more. So it's not an absolute indication for small molecule feedings, but it can improve tolerance.

60
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:29,450
So sometimes if we're able to advance the tube beyond the point that the feedings would stimulate the pancreas because it is already overactive,

61
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,490
it's really inflamed. It's releasing a lot of enzymes. That's part of why patients are in a lot of pain.

62
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:42,049
If we can feed further enough down into the small ball, sometimes that will help with tolerance.

63
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:47,000
So a lot of times the ideal location is 60 centimeters beyond the ligament.

64
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:54,570
Does anybody know where the ligament of traits is? For Thinking's Mobile Anatomy.

65
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,400
It's about where the duodenum meets the jejune them.

66
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,610
So we are going well into the jejune.

67
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:12,920
It's in certain situations where we're trying to get to a certain point where we don't think we would stimulate the pancreas.

68
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:19,780
So potentially, are patients with severe pancreatitis might require small battlefields.

69
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,430
All right. Let's talk about that high risk respiration and why that's a consideration.

70
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:30,810
So what does it mean to be high risk?

71
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:37,590
So if a patient is at risk for one or more of the following, that might be an indication to place the tube into the small bowel.

72
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,940
So usually the postpaid lower goal is going to be the second portion of the duodenum or lower.

73
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,450
So rarely are we just going to go a little bit, pass the spyglass into the duodenum.

74
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,980
Usually we like to advance it at least into that second portion of the duodenum.

75
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:58,780
So a high risk of aspiration may be someone that is had is family.

76
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:05,290
If they have a history of gastroparesis with high gastric output, sometimes this is measured.

77
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:15,460
They'll have a tube in place. It's not a feeding tube, but they're it's kind of a tube that is set to suction to get rid of.

78
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:23,540
Excessive gastric secretions that sometimes has gastroparesis that makes the situation worse.

79
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,339
So you'll see them with this clear tube through their nose, into their stomach,

80
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:35,030
and then there's going to be like a cancer on the side of their bed that's getting rid of the gastric output.

81
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,290
That's usually like a green color. You'll know, like, okay, that's what's happening there.

82
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,969
Maybe they have gastroparesis or really bad vomiting or potentially a bottle obstruction.

83
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:50,930
So these situations might make us want to consider a small bowel fitting due to aspiration risk.

84
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:58,340
They have a history of aspiration or if they previously aspirated on gastric feedings, that's probably an indication as well.

85
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:09,950
Certain medications we talked about, especially narcotic medications, just slow down the GI tract or really make things move very slowly.

86
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:17,240
So if if that on top of high gastric output, maybe in addition to gastroparesis, that could be an indication as well.

87
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:22,860
So. We don't evaluate gastric output.

88
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,310
So this is something the nursing staff would look at.

89
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,410
So usually this is going to be measured if they have a tube in place that is collecting their gastric output.

90
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:38,370
There are some situations if they have enteral access where they may be withdrawing some of the gastric output to measure it.

91
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:48,029
But usually this is something that that is measured through, again, a tube that's in place that is actually suctioning out their gastric output.

92
00:09:48,030 --> 00:10:00,150
So just to give you some context, more than a liter of a day of this output may be an indication for small bowel feeding tube placement.

93
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:10,590
You guys don't have to know those details. So it's just giving you some context as to why we may may want to push for first mobile feedings.

94
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:18,990
And that's really to prevent the the aspiration of gastric contents if they're having a lot of gastric.

95
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:27,050
Juices flow, that type of thing, and then we feed into that.

96
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:33,090
It can just kind of make matters worse. All right, so what about the benefits?

97
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:39,120
So it can it does have the potential to decrease the risk of micro aspiration.

98
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:47,640
So like low level aspiration that may be happening, as well as the risk of aspiration pneumonia in those that are high risk for pneumonia.

99
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:55,220
Aspiration pneumonia. So this, again, is in high risk individuals when compared to gastric feedings.

100
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:04,129
What are these benefits? It may allow patients to achieve their goal rate of infusion that may not have been attained with gastric feedings.

101
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:13,040
So it can be a way to provide adequate nutrition for able they're able to tolerate their feedings more consistently.

102
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:21,019
So we're able to get into our goal, nutrition into them, and it may lead to decrease use of parental nutrition.

103
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:27,050
So if a patients is really not doing well with their two feedings, their nutritional status continues to decline.

104
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,379
Kind of the next step is, is parental nutrition, which we would like to avoid, if at all possible.

105
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,780
So this may be a bridge to that. So like we just heard a bridge to avoid that.

106
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,110
If we can, we can get them on small bottle fits that are tolerated.

107
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:48,120
There are theoretical advantages in our critically ill patients.

108
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:56,460
So again, post pylori feedings are now often continued during clinical interventions that require anesthesia.

109
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,370
So this could be at the bedside or in the operating room.

110
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:09,239
Also, the delivery of continuous feed into the jejuni may prevent gastric distention, thus potentially allowing for better respiratory function.

111
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:14,010
So these are patients on a ventilator that maybe we're trying to wean.

112
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,630
There is a potential advantage, mostly theoretical.

113
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:24,269
This is difficult to test, but there's some some kind of clinical basis where we might do that.

114
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:30,660
And then there can be benefits in acute pancreatitis, which we'll go into in more detail later on to at least.

115
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:35,460
Okay. Disadvantages through any of the very many.

116
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:42,150
We're. Okay. It is.

117
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,020
It does cost more when we talk about delivery methods.

118
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,769
In a few minutes, you'll understand why.

119
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:56,040
Just because of the type of equipment needed to infuse this mobile feeling is is going to be more costly.

120
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:06,820
There is a difficulty with placement. You know, it's it's just it's requires a little bit more skill with advancing into the small ball.

121
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:14,620
Usually requires interventional radiology to to help guide and then ensure that it is where we want it to be.

122
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,620
It can. You can't become displaced.

123
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,379
In my experience, gastric feedings can easily come out, you know, with the small bowel feeding.

124
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:30,820
At least it has to travel longer to be to become really displaced.

125
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:34,780
But there there is displacement that can happen.

126
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:37,419
These tubes are more prone to clogging.

127
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:45,310
We'll talk about what happens when a feeding tube clogs so they're smaller bore, meaning like the internal diameter is a lot smaller.

128
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,090
In the maintenance of their proper positions can be difficult. So.

129
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:56,110
We'll have like I remember seeing patients where we thought we were feeding at a certain

130
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,120
point in the small and we get like two and they're not tolerating their two feedings

131
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,290
and we get like a recheck of the position of the tube and it's like migrate it all the

132
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:11,709
way up to the stomach so that can happen and then there can be feeding intolerance.

133
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:17,830
So the formula choice matters more when we talk about small bowel feedings.

134
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:25,340
And we're going to we're going to get into formula composition today. Okay.

135
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:32,360
In terms of feeding, intolerance, concern. So. The small intestine tends to be more sensitive to volume.

136
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:38,080
So how quickly we infuse our unsure nutrition and the osmotic loads.

137
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:47,090
We'll talk about this. What what is considered a hyper as molar or hypertonic formula versus an isotonic or hypertonic formula?

138
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:57,420
So if we find something that has a high osmotic load quickly into the small bowel, if you recall last semester, do you remember dumping syndrome?

139
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:04,409
Our patients that have that, you know, they drink maybe something really high in sugar after gastric surgery.

140
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:13,920
It empties from the stomach too quickly into the small bowel that's not prepared to have a, you know, work with those hyper osmotic particles.

141
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:20,100
That can happen with enteral nutrition. If we we don't choose the right formula, we infuse it too fast.

142
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:26,790
So often when this happens, of course, we're going to slow down the rate of infusion and we might change our formula.

143
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,110
So it is more restrictive in administration methods, which we'll talk about.

144
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:38,249
We can't do a large volume, we can't do intermittent feedings, we can't do bolus feedings, which we haven't yet defined.

145
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:43,170
But we we will in a few minutes. Yeah.

146
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:51,230
Okay. So this is this is posted, I think on week one because this was intended for us to get through last week.

147
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,210
But this is kind of a enteral feeding tube algorithm that you could just have as a resource for you.

148
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:04,860
And you can see how the decision tree might happen in terms of what type of tube to place.

149
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,079
So as you're working through case scenarios,

150
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,280
you could have this pulled up and just look at some of the considerations as to

151
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:21,849
why we might do a nasogastric versus a cheetah versus juvenile versus a a j tube.

152
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:27,370
So you can see the different kind of things that might go into consideration here.

153
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,660
So kind of have this on hand as you guys work through different case scenarios.

154
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,000
And this is just another kind of more detailed algorithm here.

155
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:45,770
This is also posted. This has some more information on these gastric residual volumes,

156
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:51,590
which we will we'll discuss if there's more tolerance at what point we advance the tube.

157
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,379
Should there be other medications involved? So this is a little bit more detailed.

158
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,430
I don't expect you guys to have a grip on any of this.

159
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:07,140
This is just kind of a resource for you. Okay.

160
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,600
Does anybody have questions on gastric versus mobile feedings?

161
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:20,640
Okay. So let's do a little exercise.

162
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:29,009
The question we're going to try to answer with the scenario is what type of long term tube so into the stomach for the

163
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:37,050
small bowel long term should patients receive if they have the preexisting condition of gastroesophageal reflux disease.

164
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:44,610
Okay. So think about if they have reflux. And then does this answer change if the patient is in the ICU,

165
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:49,030
which we haven't talked to a whole lot about, but we kind of touched on a couple of scenarios there.

166
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:55,770
So here's our case. We have a 35 year old man sustained a close head injury in a car crash.

167
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:03,840
He's expected to have oral dysphagia for many weeks in the intensivist asked which type of feeding tube would be the best option.

168
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:09,390
Okay. So this is his previous history has he has a longstanding history of GERD.

169
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,230
It was taking over-the-counter acid suppression medication.

170
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:20,390
So otherwise pretty healthy. Got in this car crash. He has this close head injury.

171
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:26,360
He's going to have quite a process of rehab. So expected to have this oral dysplasia.

172
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:34,280
We are thinking a long term tube so you don't have to decide on nasal or or percutaneous placement.

173
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:38,450
But what type of access do you think would make most sense?

174
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,540
So let's take like 5 minutes and think about this.

175
00:18:49,730 --> 00:19:04,300
The. Know.

176
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:49,580
And they want to.

177
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:07,900
The. What do you guys think?

178
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:15,650
We have a strong site and we place like a G2 or a G2 patient like this.

179
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,220
I think this one is tricky. Yeah.

180
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:31,860
It's a data source not to aggregate their content at all.

181
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:38,380
Okay. Who else thinks J Tube? Anybody think gee to.

182
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:44,670
We have. So I thought this one was hard.

183
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,930
This comes from a clinical reference, which is really great.

184
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:59,820
So. I think they're trying to trick us with the word history because it can make people maybe more susceptible to to be an aspiration risk.

185
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:08,460
But think of all the people that have good that wouldn't necessarily be on its own, an indication for small bowel feedings.

186
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:16,580
Now, if he's in the ICU and there's going to be procedures, maybe, but he will see.

187
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,299
So this patient receives a peg to which is gastric acid access.

188
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:28,860
So the rationale being the patient can benefit from a tube that most closely mimics the physiological state of the body.

189
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,110
Right? Of whenever we can feed into the stomach, we should.

190
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:41,160
He will likely be undergoing extensive rehab and different therapy sessions, which that will make more sense when we talk about delivery methods.

191
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:45,690
So we have more options with a with gastric access,

192
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:54,040
especially if someone is is doing a lot of rehab and that we need to like not have them there to feeds running while they're doing Petey.

193
00:21:55,650 --> 00:22:00,809
So he may also be confused for a period of time. This is a closed head injury.

194
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,280
So they're saying the fewer tubes in lines that are visible for the patient to grab, the safer [INAUDIBLE] be.

195
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:10,380
Sometimes with AJ data, there is multiple ports potentially.

196
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,200
It also will be the least expensive option to bolus feed, which we'll discuss.

197
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,489
So but I think there is an argument for AJ to here.

198
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:27,719
Yes. So if he had to have surgery after his car accident, you want to go to school,

199
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:37,080
but not necessarily if it was if it was a situation where he was going to be in the ICU, which we don't really have that.

200
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:45,569
It's just saying, would your decision change if you if he was in the ICU and we thought there was going to be multiple procedures,

201
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:54,300
whether they're at the bedside or whatnot, then usually we can continue feeding more consistently with mobile access in that situation.

202
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:01,140
So that might make that might change our mind from like a G to a J.

203
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:09,330
But just the history of GERD would not be an indication for mobile of access, even though that can be a risk factor for aspiration.

204
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:15,480
But we have to usually have like at least two risk factors before we would really push for for small bowel feedings.

205
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,709
Okay. And just some rationale.

206
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:29,100
And again, this is taken directly from this aspect of core curriculum, which is really great, but I'm not able to post the whole thing.

207
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,360
It's it's a huge document.

208
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:37,170
But so they're saying the question of opt in rises, whether are to place in the stomach leads to increased risk for aspiration pneumonia,

209
00:23:37,530 --> 00:23:40,710
especially in the setting of GERD, ICU or dementia.

210
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:47,700
To minimize this risk, many hospital physicians will order a gastrostomy change in asked me tube.

211
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:54,090
So that's the GJ tube. So you have access potentially to feed into the stomach or the small bowel.

212
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,820
So you can safely, if you need to, you can feed below the virus.

213
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:06,250
Numerous studies have been done comparing the risk for aspiration pneumonia with feeding in the stomach versus the small,

214
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,960
and the results are conflicting.

215
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:17,170
So Asman isn't a huge proponent of automatically doing small bowel feedings for the risk of aspiration just because the evidence really isn't there?

216
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,199
So the Aspin guidelines, which again, is the American Society for Parenteral Nutrition,

217
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:30,939
kind of like our governing body for for nutrition support, continue to recommend feeding into the stomach as a first line option.

218
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,379
So just keep that in mind.

219
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:39,730
As you guys are going through different exercises, there are definitely going to be situations where small bowel feedings are indicated,

220
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,440
but whenever possible, usually we want to try and feed into the stomach.

221
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,990
Okay. So whenever possible, we should feed our patients into the stomach.

222
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,470
This route is the most physiologically normal for the body, ensuring appropriate mixing of nutrients with gastric acid.

223
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:01,500
It also allows for flexibility of schedules is the safest with regards to formula contamination

224
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:08,280
secondary to no formula hang time we'll get into that allows for blender is tired so

225
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:14,609
people that want to do their own two feedings which we really don't use a lot but we're starting

226
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:19,710
to see more and more requests for that from patients and it is the most cost effective.

227
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:25,380
The patient does not tolerate gastric feedings or has an aspiration event.

228
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:34,840
Then the feeding that we can feed into that G port so often, like a patient like this, it might be best to do like agg2.

229
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,740
So we do have both options available. All right.

230
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:44,010
Does anybody have any questions? Yes. Would they still.

231
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,760
Well, looks like that last. If they aren't tolerating,

232
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:57,210
they wouldn't still take like the medication or use the medication that they've been using to like minimize GERD in that instance.

233
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,420
Oh, is that just like most?

234
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:06,420
Yes. So when the patients are in the hospital. Maybe you guys will see this during your internship.

235
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:16,860
In my experience, they almost always put like anybody on a PTI, whether you had half guard or treated for it like so many hospitalized patients.

236
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,030
If they're on TV, they also get started on a P.I., whether that's appropriate or not.

237
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,660
But this patient would probably still be on a proton pump inhibitors.

238
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:29,910
Yes. And they might be on other medications, too, to help with that.

239
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:38,790
Any other questions? Yeah. Are we're not worried about the germs because we control the acidity of the what we're killing.

240
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:46,770
Well, we control a lot of things within in terms of how quickly we're delivering something.

241
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,200
What type of formula we give. And then they're on medication management.

242
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:57,090
Sometimes it's like an I.V. that that can help with that.

243
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,930
But GERD is common.

244
00:27:00,930 --> 00:27:07,900
So a lot of people have it. Not that we understand the the potential.

245
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:14,970
Like with GERD, it can be serious. But that alone would not preclude us from doing gastric feedings.

246
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:21,079
And usually we can we can manage it. Okay. Okay.

247
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:24,559
So let's talk about these formula delivery methods.

248
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,510
So when determining the site and route of enteral nutrition,

249
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:37,610
we need to consider again an individual's anticipated length of feeding time, their medical condition or disease state.

250
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:43,370
So this would include any anatomical barriers within the gastrointestinal tract and the

251
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:49,280
surgical options for that patient if if that's something that's kind of awaiting them.

252
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,630
So there are several ways of delivering formula to make sure the patient is receiving adequate nutrition.

253
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:04,050
So we'll talk about we'll use terms like continuous intermittent or bolus feedings,

254
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,790
sometimes a nocturnal feeding, which we kind of consider in that continuous realm.

255
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,640
But it really is the choice is going to depend on the location of the feeding tube,

256
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:22,620
the patient's GI function, history of tolerance and other lifestyle considerations which we'll get into.

257
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,670
Okay. So formula can be delivered to a patient through two systems.

258
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:37,360
Just one slide on this. This will be different depending on the institution you're working at.

259
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:46,389
But essentially a closed feeding tube system is ready to use canned container or bag of formula that is connected to the patient's feeding access.

260
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:50,590
So it's like never opened. You can see that's at the bottom there.

261
00:28:52,130 --> 00:29:00,420
So potentially this allows for a longer hang time because it's we're not opening and exposing the formula to, you know, just the environment.

262
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:04,309
So. This is also more expensive.

263
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:10,299
Like when I was at Michigan Medicine, we did not have that. We use a what we call an open feeding tube system.

264
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:18,390
So what this is, is a formula from a can or package is poured into a separate container, then attached to the patient's feeding access point.

265
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:25,750
So like if a patient if we order and nutrition for a patient, the formula is going to be delivered to the patient's room.

266
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:33,219
The number of patients that they'll need for a given amount of time, we'll have these bags that kind of look like an I.V. bag.

267
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:37,000
But those the nurse will pour the formula into the bag.

268
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:46,120
Then the bag is connected to their feeding tube, whether their nasal nasal enteric tube or their more permanent feeding tube.

269
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:53,829
And then it's kind of hung on an I.V. hole. And whether it's being infused through a pump or just through gravity, that's kind of how it works.

270
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:58,059
And so when it runs out, they'll add more formula and so on and so forth.

271
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:02,410
So this has hang time considerations, meaning.

272
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:10,639
What that means is so like a closed feeding tube system can be safely at room temperature for 24 to 48 hours.

273
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,070
So that's kind of a benefit there.

274
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:21,260
Whereas an open system, the product should be at room temperature for 4 to 8 hours, depending on the formula, the timing.

275
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:27,170
So then that has to we have to consider there may be potential for more waste,

276
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:35,840
like if we're doing a really slow infusion for our patient and maybe the nurse overloads the bag and then the hang time.

277
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:43,190
Now the formula has been in that bag for 12 hours. We might have to discard it because we just didn't the timing didn't work out.

278
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:53,620
Okay. So clinicians may also wish to limit hang time for certain high risk populations, such as who might we want to do shorter hang times for?

279
00:30:53,900 --> 00:31:02,510
Yes, I wanted to clarify, is the dietician advising the clinician which one to do and who's actually acquiring one?

280
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:12,230
Usually, yes. So we don't have any committees that determine that the hospital decides like what system is going to be.

281
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:18,979
We are responsible usually for putting in the order like what formula, the rate,

282
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,490
the volume, so that'll automatically calculate how much needs to be delivered.

283
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:27,980
But like the nursing staff will be doing this, actually opening it and pouring it into their bag.

284
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:37,010
So we don't I mean, there was a couple of times I did this for patients when I was educating them on how to do it themselves when they're going home,

285
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:42,190
like this is what you'll do and we'll, we'll do it together. But not this.

286
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:43,730
This will not be the dietician.

287
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:51,290
The dietician come in and check on them or that like the nurses role to kind of check in on like why the food is going.

288
00:31:51,860 --> 00:32:00,830
We didn't both. So the nursing staff like the maze or the actual nurse will be in and out of that patient through multiple times a day.

289
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:09,770
Where is the dietician? We are probably checking on them every few days, like maybe even four days, so maybe once a week.

290
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,940
But what we are doing is monitoring their flow sheets every morning.

291
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:19,270
Usually we'll see like how much was infused. All this is online in their medical records.

292
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:25,100
And so the nursing, you might see that it was held for 3 hours overnight.

293
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:30,910
And usually there is a note as to why. Or you could go talk to the nurse and see like what happened overnight.

294
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,270
Why did this get held?

295
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:42,560
So we're not as like in the immediate loop, but you should be kind of aware of what's going on and of any of your patients that are on to feedings.

296
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:51,370
Okay. So can you think of what type of high risk populations of patients might.

297
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:55,160
We want to be extra careful with our hang time. Yeah.

298
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:03,700
Crazy immunocompromised patients. Yeah. So, like, guess, you know, these are safe for a certain amount of time in kind of like, open air.

299
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:11,110
But if we have immunocompromised patients or maybe those with burns that potentially are at risk for infection,

300
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,870
we might be extra careful that we don't let that formula sit too long at room temperature.

301
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:25,499
And again, you guys. Don't really need to know the hang time,

302
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,860
stuff like that's going to be on the actual nursing staff that's delivering the formula while they're hospitalized.

303
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:40,410
Okay. Formula delivery methods. There's three main methods of continuous within continuous.

304
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,150
There's what we call like a cycle feed that we'll talk about that intermittent and bolus.

305
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:53,040
So a continuous feed is the most common delivery that we'll use for our hospitalized patients.

306
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:58,650
So it's going to generally be used whenever enteral nutrition is like a new start when we're initiating until nutrition.

307
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,860
We almost always start with a continuous regimen.

308
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:08,580
So what this means is it provides a slow infusion of feedings into the stomach or small intestine on an hourly basis.

309
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:12,640
So it's going to be infused over a 24 hours a day. Okay.

310
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:20,980
So next week, when we do calculation practice, we're going to start by determining what value should be infused per hour,

311
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:24,820
over 24 hours to meet our patients, nutritional needs and goals.

312
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:32,830
So the advantage is this slow infusion. Like sometimes the goal is 50 miles an hour.

313
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:40,330
Hey, if any of you like look at a syringe or measure 50 millimeters, it's really small.

314
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:46,270
Okay. And sometimes that's helpful, too, to let patients know,

315
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:54,640
like when we have patients that maybe think we they see their the rate of their pump being turned up because we're getting to the goal.

316
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,280
They'll tell me I don't tolerate that when it went to 60.

317
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,070
And so sometimes and that may be true, but it's unlikely if we measure out, like we'll take a syringe.

318
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:14,260
And I've done this many times and showed them what 60 CMS looks like and let them know this is being infused in drips over an hour.

319
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:21,260
If you think of like 120 miles, that's a half a cup of liquid over an hour.

320
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,290
So that's still pretty slow.

321
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:34,300
Sometimes that helps patients get some context about how like when they see that rate going up, it's still a very small amount being infused.

322
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:38,829
So it's slow and it decreases the risk of aspiration.

323
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:43,540
Gastric distension. It is the most easily tolerated because of it.

324
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:51,840
It's a very gradual delivery of feeling. It allows for greater nutrient uptake in patients who may have marginal absorptive capacity.

325
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:56,980
So if we're working with somebody that maybe does have extensive small bowel surgery,

326
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:01,360
gastric surgery, we'll definitely always start with the continuous method.

327
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,720
But that might be where where they're at.

328
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,780
Like that's that's the the infusion that helps them really optimize their absorption as opposed to like a bolus feeding,

329
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:18,239
which is a lot delivered in a very short amount of time. It can be used with any route of administration.

330
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,970
So any type of two, whether they have gastric access, mobile access,

331
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:29,610
whether it's a nasogastric tube or a permanent feeding tube, we can always deliver continuous feeds.

332
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,600
And it is preferred for patients with gastrointestinal complications.

333
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:41,360
So it really is shown to reach nutrition goals more often because patients are more likely to tolerate that very slow infusion.

334
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:53,470
Okay. So the gastrointestinal complications, so things like a continuous feeding infusion has less risk for for diarrhea potentially.

335
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:59,560
And again, patients do usually meet their nutrition goals.

336
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:05,020
We'll talk about the disadvantages, though. It can be cumbersome, right?

337
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:08,829
The feedings are imposed continuously. So this is 24 hours a day.

338
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:16,150
So they're always attached to the feeding pump. So if you you'll see when you go into your internship again, when you're actually in the hospital,

339
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:24,670
you'll see patients doing like their whole walks with their eyes full and they might have the tube feedings running while they're walking around.

340
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,100
And that's just it. It's 24 hours a day, right?

341
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:35,800
The rate in infusion time, of course, can be adjusted, which will practice to maybe give them a little bit of a break.

342
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:43,750
It does require a feeding pump to infuse. So that's kind of how it looks like it's on an I.V. pole.

343
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:49,510
And then the the tubing before it gets connected to the patient's actual internal access,

344
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:55,000
goes through a pump that will determine how quickly the formula's infused.

345
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:03,210
So although we said they're more likely to reach nutritional goals, especially our patients with like GI intolerance issues,

346
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:07,580
it can be difficult to achieve the goal intake if there's frequent interruptions.

347
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:17,220
So if you imagine a patient on like our physical medication, physical medicine and rehabilitation course, that's like our PR wing.

348
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:27,540
These are patients that are getting a lot of pity. Maybe they were in a car crash and they're like rehabbing a broken leg or whatever it may be.

349
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:33,700
So if they have pity. Two times a day, three times a week.

350
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:39,639
A lot of times they're pausing the feeding tubes, every feeding to the feedings every time.

351
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:46,600
So if they know that there's going to be frequent interruptions or a lot of physical therapy, things like that, that will then.

352
00:38:47,870 --> 00:38:50,870
Be a disadvantage because we're always parsing those feeds.

353
00:38:53,140 --> 00:39:03,250
Okay. Nocturnal or cyclic feeds. So these are also considered like a continuous infusion, although we we will infuse it less than 24 hours per day.

354
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,930
So we do use this quite a bit in the hospital when we maybe were transitioning,

355
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,190
a patient is been cleared to start eating, but they're not able to eat a whole lot.

356
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:21,130
So we'll still run their two feedings overnight, allow them some time off during the day to hopefully maybe be hungry and able to eat at meals.

357
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,880
So often the cycle will run overnight while they're sleeping.

358
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,200
So it does allow the patient to be disconnected from the pump for hours throughout the day.

359
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:38,659
We can infuse formula up to 120 miles an hour when we're feeding into the small bowel.

360
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:45,590
So that is the threshold. We don't usually go much higher of an infusion rate when we're when we have small bowel feedings.

361
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:53,829
It will practice this. Like when you do a you'll give a recommendation for a regimen and I might ask you to do okay,

362
00:39:53,830 --> 00:40:01,120
now tell me a nocturnal regimen for this and you'll have to take in some of those limitations into consideration.

363
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:06,100
Okay. So this is often used when patients are consuming foods orally,

364
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:10,780
but they require supplemental nutrition until we can ensure that they're able to meet

365
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:15,940
their needs or at least a certain percentage of their needs from from their oral intake.

366
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:24,760
So you can see just some examples of continuous around the clock, a cyclic or nocturnal.

367
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:31,930
We usually like to give for several hours off and then we'll talk about intermittent bolus.

368
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:40,430
When I do a nocturnal feed, I'd like to at least give 8 hours to the pump so that there is some, you know, a good chunk of time.

369
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:48,900
Yeah. So you have a special, like maybe a higher fiber diet or they need like a zero fiber diet.

370
00:40:49,280 --> 00:41:01,120
The the formula that they're putting in there is it's like specific to that kind of stuff or does that not even matter in the formula composition?

371
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,130
And the type of formula will matter.

372
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:14,380
Most patients can be on a what we call just a standard formula regardless of what we're going to order for them to consume orally.

373
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:22,150
There are situations where we might want a fiber containing formula. We'll talk about that today, like formula, selection and composition.

374
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:30,840
But it doesn't always like. Match their oral diet because usually the the formulas are, for the most part, pretty well tolerated.

375
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:39,240
Okay. So intermittent feeds.

376
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:49,550
This is. Sometimes called gravity's feelings but it really the the term would be the most appropriate term would be intermittent feedings.

377
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:58,640
I know dietitians will often say gravity feeding so they'll they're kind of interchangeable, but I'll try and use intermittent feedings consistently.

378
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,640
So this is a feeding that's delivered over a 20 to 60 minute interval several times a day.

379
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:12,799
So it might be 4 to 6 times per day. And so the duration and the timing of the intervals depends on the patient's formula need in order

380
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:19,370
to obtain adequate nutrition so intermittent feeds can be administered using an infusion pump,

381
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:24,080
or it can just be done by gravity. So they'll have a roller clamp on there.

382
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:29,600
They're formula tubing that can control how fast it goes in.

383
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:34,010
Is anybody seen like a roller clamp on an I.V. I.V. tubing?

384
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:39,559
And sometimes they'll roll it up and it kind of clamps it off or you open it up and it flows more freely.

385
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:42,799
So same idea with like a gravity feeding.

386
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,290
But these can also be infused through through a pump.

387
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:56,260
So the advantages it allows again time are feeding and there is this advantage of more of like a.

388
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:04,559
Cyclic elevation and insulin levels. So promotion of protein synthesis, we'll get into this a little bit more when we talk about diabetes.

389
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,330
But the rise in insulin in response to a feeding creates an anabolic environment

390
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:13,620
that promotes protein synthesis and improved protein nutritional status.

391
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:23,090
So it's more likely to mimic. Our bodies normal responds to like meal times as opposed to just a constant infusion of nutrition.

392
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:30,670
So there is some potential metabolic and finches disadvantages to gravity feeding.

393
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:37,459
Generally, this will require gastric access because the formula is going in a lot faster.

394
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:41,800
If we think we're we're delivering a volume over 20 minutes, maybe up to an hour.

395
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:48,730
It's usually going in faster than that, 120 miles an hour that we tend to limit in the small bowel.

396
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:59,230
Okay. So then there's bullets feeding. So these are a little bit different than the intermittent but similar idea.

397
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,240
This is where a specific volume of feeding is delivered over a short period of time.

398
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,330
A certain number of times a day.

399
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:17,500
So this is essentially this is often in our patients, like a long term enteral nutrition, like they essentially drop their formula in a syringe,

400
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:26,350
connect it to their tube and just push it in so really fast they can get like if they have to do two cans of formula three times a day,

401
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:31,330
they'll just kind of syringe it in at the rate that that makes sense for them, but it can be pretty quick.

402
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:35,860
So advantages this does mimic normal eating.

403
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:44,260
So this will be more like mealtimes, like breakfast, lunch, dinner, maybe one, one other small feeding as well.

404
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:49,990
So it is preferable for stable patients because it's not going to rely on pumps or any devices.

405
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,360
It's really easier for them in terms of lifestyle advantages.

406
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:04,690
This does require gastric access. If we think we're plunging a certain volume of liquid, that has to go into the stomach.

407
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:11,629
It would be way too fast for the small bottle. There's a presumed risk of aspiration or poor GI tolerance.

408
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:17,060
But usually the patients that are doing these bolus or syringe feedings,

409
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:24,570
they've they're pretty stable on their internal nutrition and in and they do well with this method.

410
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:33,320
We're not going to be doing this in the kind of compromised populations that we think might have a risk for for poor tolerance or aspiration.

411
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:41,860
Does anybody have questions on? Those different methods.

412
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:51,870
Or when we might use which one. So like last semester we talked about our cystic fibrosis population.

413
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:57,630
A lot of times those patients, they're eating right, but they're also on supplemental animal nutrition to get in the calories they need.

414
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:03,269
They often have a long term feeding tube so into the stomach.

415
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:12,030
And it's kind of a mixed bag with CF patients. So sometimes they'll go run their feeds overnight so they can just be free to eat during the day.

416
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:15,210
Or I had quite a few patients that would do.

417
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:22,320
They would eat their meal and then quickly bolus a can of high calorie formula after their meal, and they do that three times a day.

418
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:29,819
So that's like a kind of a situation where it's like a stable patient for the most part from from that perspective,

419
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:39,629
that may either do them overnight or do like a postprandial bolus feeding just to get their nutrition in.

420
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:47,970
Yeah, but a bolus food also be considered like if they're trying to transition like I know in the kids in like the children camp,

421
00:46:48,110 --> 00:46:55,799
they're trying to like get them to eat their meals and then if they don't eat like a certain number or amount of the tray or whatever,

422
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,830
then they get a can of the formula.

423
00:46:58,830 --> 00:47:03,120
Would that be still considered like a awesome or it could be, yeah.

424
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:04,739
If they had a feeding tube.

425
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:12,510
Like sometimes we will do that like depending on what they eat that will determine how much that is, is kind of syringe in after the meal.

426
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:19,620
And of course we do it after so that, you know, they're hungry, they're eating their their solid meal first,

427
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:23,790
but then we'll kind of make up for it with the the syringe feeding after.

428
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:30,400
Yeah. Well the only option for AJ or.

429
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:35,919
Yes. So AJ two we can do intermittent or no we can do cyclic feedings,

430
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:44,230
but j tube access or general access, they will have to use a feeding pump for their infusion.

431
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:51,540
So whether it's around the clock or maybe. 12 hours a day, whatever that may look like, but we can't do.

432
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:58,020
I've had some patients do like a very slow gravity drip into their small bowel.

433
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,860
But really, we use a pump for that.

434
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:08,130
And so, like, if a patient had a date here, would they have to be in the hospital?

435
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:12,809
No. So they they would get to.

436
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:17,070
Good question. No. There's like home care companies that would provide their medical supplies,

437
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:22,920
meaning their to feeding bags, oftentimes their formula, their syringes and also their their pump.

438
00:48:23,730 --> 00:48:30,600
And there's like technology. So there's backpacks now where they can have their pump in their backpack.

439
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:36,120
And it's pretty discreet there. You know, it's running and they're going about their business.

440
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:41,520
That's true for peon to but yeah they'll have all that supplies to do it at home.

441
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:49,400
Okay. We're not going to go into we're going to do the exercise that you work on.

442
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:55,850
Hopefully we'll have some time at the end of class today, but you'll have that exercise that I posted.

443
00:48:57,500 --> 00:49:02,569
This will be due next week, so you should have all the information to it to work on that.

444
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:06,650
But we'll we we're going to let's how about we take our break now?

445
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:11,139
We'll take a ten minute break. So come back at like ten, ten,

446
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,920
oh one and then we're going to move on to our next set of slides which are posted

447
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:20,409
in canvas where we're going to talk about the application of vegetable nutrition.

448
00:49:20,410 --> 00:49:23,920
So let's let's take 10 minutes here.

449
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:37,259
Yeah, yeah. This is a fun one.

450
00:49:42,159 --> 00:49:49,418
Okay. So learning objectives for for this week, even though we're a little bit behind us.

451
00:49:49,419 --> 00:49:55,449
Okay. So we're going to describe the standard composition of formulas, analyze and appraise evidence,

452
00:49:55,449 --> 00:50:00,669
associate with the selection of products that are marketed for specific diseases and conditions.

453
00:50:01,449 --> 00:50:06,849
Next week, we'll get to the calculations. Well, it will be nice because we'll have a lot of time to spend on that,

454
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:12,819
will recognize the complications associated with enteral nutrition and identify strategies to manage them.

455
00:50:12,819 --> 00:50:17,709
So probably we'll try and get through some of that. We might not get through all of that content today.

456
00:50:19,689 --> 00:50:26,009
All right. So enteral nutrition formulas, what are these or what are they according to the FDA?

457
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:29,689
So these are considered medical foods by the FDA.

458
00:50:29,709 --> 00:50:39,359
So how is that defined? So that's a food which is formulated to be consumed or administered and truly under the supervision of a physician,

459
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:47,739
and which is intended for the specific dietary management of a disease or condition for which distinctive nutrition requirements.

460
00:50:48,099 --> 00:50:52,779
Based on recognized scientific principles are established by medical evaluation.

461
00:50:53,469 --> 00:50:58,449
So kind of kind of lengthy. They're administered and truly.

462
00:50:59,439 --> 00:51:03,999
Patients like these can they can consume these two like they could drink.

463
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:08,769
Certain formulas like some we'll look at that formulary are flavored.

464
00:51:08,949 --> 00:51:14,189
That means that they try to make them palatable so they can also drink them.

465
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:18,789
But for today's talk, we're talking about those that we deliver therapy to.

466
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:29,039
Okay. So enteral nutrition provides complete nutrition, both macro and micronutrients,

467
00:51:29,699 --> 00:51:33,119
but also supports the integrity, structural integrity of the GI tract.

468
00:51:34,429 --> 00:51:38,689
So clinicians must make many decisions when initiating into nutrition.

469
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:41,688
So that means like all of you, you as dietitians,

470
00:51:41,689 --> 00:51:51,019
most often we are the ones that are going to be selecting the formula and how it's administered in terms of how much and how quickly.

471
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:57,649
So we need to identify appropriate formulation that will meet the patient's needs.

472
00:51:57,889 --> 00:52:04,519
There are a lot of formulas on the market, so currently there's more than 100 enteral formulas available in the United States

473
00:52:04,999 --> 00:52:09,349
and they may vary significantly with respect to their concentration and composition.

474
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:19,609
Therefore, their labels can make structure and function claims without approval of the FDA because these are labeled as medical foods.

475
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:28,479
There are certain things that can be on the label that really are not really regulated by the FDA.

476
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:29,779
So there can be claims.

477
00:52:31,069 --> 00:52:37,698
A structure and function claim is a claim that a specific nutrient is intended to affect the normal structure or function in humans.

478
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:41,659
So the mere quantity of enteral formula options,

479
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:46,249
the lack of clinical research to support a lot of the structure and function claims

480
00:52:46,579 --> 00:52:51,419
do pose challenges for clinicians when selecting an optimal enteral formula.

481
00:52:51,439 --> 00:52:56,299
So we'll look at some of the language on there that supports immune function.

482
00:52:56,809 --> 00:52:58,859
What does that mean? You know, what does that mean?

483
00:52:58,879 --> 00:53:05,329
It's not clearly defined and in regulated some of the language they can use on these formula labels.

484
00:53:07,909 --> 00:53:13,548
All right. Let's talk about formula composition. Some definitions to keep in mind.

485
00:53:13,549 --> 00:53:17,899
So we'll refer to osmolarity. Sometimes we'll say osmolarity.

486
00:53:18,139 --> 00:53:25,039
It's just kind of different in terms of the. The denominator.

487
00:53:25,049 --> 00:53:34,969
We'll talk about that. But osmolarity of an enteral formula is the concentration of free particles, molecules or ions in a given solution.

488
00:53:35,509 --> 00:53:40,519
So this will be expressed as Miller's moles per kilogram of water.

489
00:53:40,849 --> 00:53:50,839
And we'll look at our formulary sheet. You'll see this. There's different numbers in terms of the concentration or the osmolarity of the formula.

490
00:53:51,529 --> 00:53:54,829
Sometimes we'll use the term osmolarity. It's very similar.

491
00:53:54,829 --> 00:53:59,029
It's just going to be the solute particles per liter. Okay.

492
00:53:59,349 --> 00:54:03,309
As opposed to per kilogram of water, it's per liter of water.

493
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:13,149
So the osmolarity of annual formulations ranges from 280 milligrams per kilogram of water to 875.

494
00:54:13,179 --> 00:54:17,499
Just to give some reference in general, we'll look at some examples of formula.

495
00:54:17,509 --> 00:54:21,689
So this picture is a little bit I think it's helpful.

496
00:54:21,699 --> 00:54:25,719
So when we talk about something that's like isotonic, it's like really balanced.

497
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:32,199
This would be like this example over here. This will be.

498
00:54:33,499 --> 00:54:37,099
We're kind of the solutes within the formula.

499
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:41,979
Well, we'll kind of use a cellular example. So like let's say this is the cell.

500
00:54:42,399 --> 00:54:48,989
So the number of particles within the cell are the same as the number of particles in the external environment here.

501
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:55,549
So can you see that depicted there? So it's like isotonic, it's balanced or more hypertonic.

502
00:54:55,569 --> 00:55:03,699
So there's going to be a larger amount of particles and the external environment as opposed to the internal cellular environment.

503
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:11,079
And hypertonic would be that the there's less particles essentially in the external environment.

504
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:17,579
If you're just thinking like. What type of formula?

505
00:55:18,829 --> 00:55:24,198
Maybe the most gentle. Like if we're just going to do like a really slow infusion,

506
00:55:24,199 --> 00:55:29,689
we want to really assess tolerance in a patient that maybe has a really vulnerable GI tract situation.

507
00:55:30,139 --> 00:55:33,649
What type of formula might be the most, quote unquote, gentle?

508
00:55:37,649 --> 00:55:41,498
Yeah. Isotonic. Could be isotonic.

509
00:55:41,499 --> 00:55:45,219
Or like a hypertonic. So there's going to be more like water.

510
00:55:45,219 --> 00:55:53,889
Essentially, it's more like diluted. Whereas if hypertonic, which we do have good use for these, it's going to have a lot of a lot of stuff in it.

511
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:59,229
So these are usually going to be pretty high calorie formulas to a large amount of calories in a small volume.

512
00:56:00,669 --> 00:56:07,209
This is the type of formula we generally infuse into the gastric environment as opposed to the small bottle environment,

513
00:56:07,569 --> 00:56:16,028
something that was hypertonic. Okay.

514
00:56:16,029 --> 00:56:19,719
So I have a couple of tables and some of the terms are.

515
00:56:20,739 --> 00:56:23,048
Two are different and they're used interchangeably.

516
00:56:23,049 --> 00:56:30,819
But these are like a classification of enteral formulas, so you'll hear the term standard or polymeric.

517
00:56:31,029 --> 00:56:37,419
That's the same thing. This is like the most common enteral formula that we'll use is just a standard formula.

518
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:42,609
So when we say polymeric, what that means is that contains whole proteins,

519
00:56:43,209 --> 00:56:50,559
complex carbohydrates and long chain triglycerides, meaning the nutrients are intact, they have not been broken down.

520
00:56:50,979 --> 00:56:59,199
So this is going to be the most standard kind of normal type of formula we would use for the majority of our patients.

521
00:57:00,299 --> 00:57:03,509
So it will require additional work by the digestive system.

522
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:13,919
So for individuals who have full digestive function, usually there's no issue with these kind of standard slash polymeric formulas.

523
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:23,309
Yes. And for that, you can see that into the stomach or this can so just be a standard eat just because they're intact.

524
00:57:23,669 --> 00:57:27,059
But does that mean that would preclude us from feeding into the mobile?

525
00:57:29,359 --> 00:57:34,009
Has anybody heard of elemental formulas or amino acid based formulas?

526
00:57:35,879 --> 00:57:45,449
Yeah. Yeah. Can you describe maybe what those are? They're just like basically everything is broken down into its components.

527
00:57:45,569 --> 00:57:50,059
Yes. Amino acids. So it's not. Yeah.

528
00:57:50,389 --> 00:57:57,149
Yeah. It's it's broken down. So a truly elemental formula will be completely hydrolyzed.

529
00:57:57,509 --> 00:58:03,119
Nutrients. And usually when we refer to the hydrolyzed portion, we're talking about the proteins.

530
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:07,489
So we have elemental and some elemental formula.

531
00:58:07,519 --> 00:58:11,849
So it might contain partially or completely hydrolyzed nutrients,

532
00:58:12,329 --> 00:58:16,939
usually referring to the proteins, and there may be altered fats to maximize absorption.

533
00:58:16,949 --> 00:58:23,399
So what type of fat do you think might be used in some proportion in these types of formulas?

534
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:30,509
It's clear we're trying to maximize absorption. Yeah.

535
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:35,728
Screams like medium chain. Yeah. You'll see it when we look at some examples.

536
00:58:35,729 --> 00:58:41,128
You'll see they'll have, um, oil is part of the fat, so those, remember, are directly absorbed.

537
00:58:41,129 --> 00:58:50,069
They don't require transport through the impact system. So if our patients have absorption issues, this, this,

538
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:55,348
these might be the type of formulas we may need to use because they're more easily absorbed

539
00:58:55,349 --> 00:58:59,789
because they are broken down or they're completely like they're just the free amino acid.

540
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:09,179
Let's see, what else do I want to say about that? Do you think we which do you think is more expensive?

541
00:59:11,929 --> 00:59:19,579
These fees are very expensive. So we're not just going to like order these just oh, we're going to we're going to do an amino acid formula.

542
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:22,759
No, we really we have to have the indication to use this.

543
00:59:25,999 --> 00:59:34,159
Let's see, also blender formulas. We don't use these a whole lot, but we're seeing more and more patients want to use like real foods,

544
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:37,459
like if they're going to be on top nutrition, let's say, for a prolonged period of time.

545
00:59:38,419 --> 00:59:43,979
When we look at like an ingredient label of a formula, people do not like it like this.

546
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:52,519
But my parents, when I have babies or small kids on an amino acid based formula, the first ingredient is corn sirup solids.

547
00:59:52,519 --> 00:59:58,758
They hate that. And it's just that's what it is to try and get the macronutrients correct.

548
00:59:58,759 --> 01:00:04,489
So we're seeing a bigger push for people wanting all tenderized feeding.

549
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:13,729
So that's that's something to consider. So what this would be would be blend rice, whole foods with or without the addition of a standard formula.

550
01:00:13,909 --> 01:00:21,888
So this might be best suited for patients with a healed feeding side or for those who adhere to, say, food practices and to maintenance.

551
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:27,049
So they have to these are definitely more prone to like clogging.

552
01:00:27,319 --> 01:00:32,659
So they have to be really good about maintenance of their their feeding tube if they're going to go that route.

553
01:00:34,749 --> 01:00:38,559
So there's disease specific formulas. We'll talk about the utility of these.

554
01:00:38,649 --> 01:00:43,589
And this a lot of this is marketing like this is for diabetic patients.

555
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:47,588
While a lot of our patients with diabetes can be on a standard formula.

556
01:00:47,589 --> 01:00:51,929
So we'll we'll get into that. And then there are modular.

557
01:00:51,929 --> 01:01:01,069
So these are not going to be complete nutrition. Usually this is used in supplement to their formula, so usually they'll use protein modular.

558
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:09,329
So say our our patient has really high protein needs. We can't meet them alone with their annual regimen without like totally overfeeding calories.

559
01:01:09,329 --> 01:01:14,729
So we'll, we'll add on a protein module or a couple of times a day to get their their protein needs met.

560
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:21,489
And and we'll practice all of this. This is another table just looking at.

561
01:01:23,359 --> 01:01:28,249
Other examples. So we have our standard formula. Sometimes our standard formulas contain fiber.

562
01:01:28,639 --> 01:01:37,969
Sometimes they're more nutrient dense. Sometimes you'll hear the elemental or semi elemental referred to as peptide based.

563
01:01:37,999 --> 01:01:42,679
It's just that the peptide proteins that are partially hydrolyzed.

564
01:01:43,999 --> 01:01:47,829
And then some disease specific one. All right.

565
01:01:47,829 --> 01:01:54,069
So let's take a peek at our internal formulary. That's kind of clear.

566
01:01:54,579 --> 01:02:06,169
Okay, so can anybody. Pick out which one might be a semi elemental formula.

567
01:02:17,319 --> 01:02:33,649
And. So semi elemental would mean that they've partially broken down the protein component.

568
01:02:34,749 --> 01:02:38,329
Yeah. Yeah. At one point they were once inside.

569
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:44,838
Yes. So these kept them in 1.0 or 1.5 you'll see up here labeled as chemically defined.

570
01:02:44,839 --> 01:02:52,549
So now we have like three names. We have elemental. Now we have elemental, semi elemental, chemically defined, peptide based.

571
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:57,708
But what we're looking for here is you see that it's hydrolyzed whey protein.

572
01:02:57,709 --> 01:03:00,678
So it is a milk protein that has been hydrolyzed.

573
01:03:00,679 --> 01:03:06,589
So it's been broken down so that there's less work that the patient's going to have to do to utilize that protein.

574
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:12,088
You can see. Okay.

575
01:03:12,089 --> 01:03:16,209
So which one do you think is the most hyper tonic?

576
01:03:16,919 --> 01:03:20,459
And I know it's really small, but we're looking for.

577
01:03:21,529 --> 01:03:25,609
This millions more per kilogram of water. So based on that.

578
01:03:26,779 --> 01:03:43,009
Which is our most hypertonic formula here. Yeah.

579
01:03:43,229 --> 01:03:46,379
The yeah. It's this no resource.

580
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:53,309
Reena So it's $800 million more per kilogram of water.

581
01:03:55,149 --> 01:04:05,199
So if we look at this, know what source I want to draw your attention up to this people per ml so calories per ML we're going to use this line a lot.

582
01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:13,059
You can see. So this is the most hypertonic formula and it's the most one of the more calorically dense.

583
01:04:13,209 --> 01:04:18,459
So this is two calories per amount. So this is what we call like a £2 formula.

584
01:04:20,019 --> 01:04:24,789
So compared to let's say if we look at one of the more hypertonic.

585
01:04:26,459 --> 01:04:30,719
Let's look at. Let's look at this.

586
01:04:31,009 --> 01:04:36,239
Newton 1.0. This is a one cow per MLA formula.

587
01:04:38,509 --> 01:04:43,159
Usually most of our patients are probably on a 1.2 to 1.5 cal.

588
01:04:44,209 --> 01:04:50,359
If they have a fluid restriction or really high calorie needs that we need to get a lot of nutrition, a small volume.

589
01:04:50,749 --> 01:04:55,009
We'll do like a two cal formula and we'll practice all of this.

590
01:04:55,009 --> 01:05:04,189
But you can just see here, like it's the carbohydrate sources, a lot of corn sirup, the fat sources can be a mix.

591
01:05:04,189 --> 01:05:10,518
You can see the ones that maybe have more m seed oil, the protein source, a lot of cows, milk protein.

592
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:22,459
Right. So if somebody has a cow milk allergy that's going to wipe out a lot of these options do have a soy formula, but it also has casein.

593
01:05:22,459 --> 01:05:26,329
So some some have a mix there, but majority are going to be a milk protein.

594
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:35,928
Okay. This is the second page of that formulary reference.

595
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:42,589
So these are things that are oral supplements. So patients can drink things like between meals if they're trying to get.

596
01:05:44,979 --> 01:05:49,259
Extra calories, but these can also be used as enteral formula.

597
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:59,499
So like a lot of our patients that have to go on and self-pay, like it's not covered by insurance, we'll have them by insurer plus at the store.

598
01:05:59,619 --> 01:06:02,829
That's what they're going to deliver as they're through their feeding tube.

599
01:06:03,779 --> 01:06:10,469
Does that make sense? So even though these are marketed as oral supplements, we can use these through a feeding tube as well.

600
01:06:13,189 --> 01:06:19,489
Over here are some modular so talked about most often we'll use like a protein modular.

601
01:06:20,899 --> 01:06:32,779
Let's see that have the name there and everything like that doesn't have all the information.

602
01:06:34,749 --> 01:06:40,509
Oh then a protein. Let's look I was thinking this was our been a fiber so all the way to the end there there's been a protein.

603
01:06:40,509 --> 01:06:51,668
So this is like a protein modular. So it's a little packet and you can see here it has six grams of protein and 25 calories per packet.

604
01:06:51,669 --> 01:06:57,399
So somebody might be on one packet of that a protein three times a day in addition to

605
01:06:57,399 --> 01:07:02,649
their enteral nutrition to give them just more protein if they have higher protein needs.

606
01:07:04,089 --> 01:07:07,859
So that's an example of a modular. Okay.

607
01:07:10,219 --> 01:07:18,409
Okay. Briefly on a formula composition, carbohydrates, could they be the primary source of energy and enteral nutrition formulas,

608
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:25,139
which kind of mimics our macronutrient breakdown for most standard oral diets?

609
01:07:25,159 --> 01:07:30,468
Of course, there are certain situations where this the carbohydrate might not be the primary source,

610
01:07:30,469 --> 01:07:33,708
but usually it's going to be 40 to 70% of energy in the formula.

611
01:07:33,709 --> 01:07:35,269
This will come from carbohydrate.

612
01:07:36,349 --> 01:07:45,049
The sources most often include monosaccharides, so it's going to be glucose or fructose, but also disaccharides like sucrose and maltose.

613
01:07:46,699 --> 01:07:52,129
Something that is often not in our internal formulas is lactose.

614
01:07:52,139 --> 01:07:58,939
So the vast majority are going to be lactose free. Just to kind of remove that as even a barrier, I.

615
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:06,239
Other types of carbohydrates incorporated will include alkalosis, oligosaccharides, polysaccharides.

616
01:08:08,129 --> 01:08:11,278
The most common oligosaccharides is going to be maltodextrin.

617
01:08:11,279 --> 01:08:16,319
So you'll see that that's a little bit more soluble than other starches.

618
01:08:16,679 --> 01:08:24,679
It contributes less to the osmolarity. So there's different reasons why different carbohydrate sources are used.

619
01:08:26,349 --> 01:08:29,439
He asked.

620
01:08:30,009 --> 01:08:35,499
All right. We'll talk about fat next. But what we talked a little bit about, an advantage of MCT oil.

621
01:08:36,009 --> 01:08:42,009
So advantages of adding oil into nutrition formulas include all of the following except one.

622
01:08:42,279 --> 01:08:49,649
So they are absorbed directly into the portal circulation and do not require Kayle Omicron formation for absorption.

623
01:08:49,659 --> 01:08:56,069
Is that true? Yes, that's true.

624
01:08:56,089 --> 01:09:00,889
So that's an advantage. Entities provide essential fatty acids.

625
01:09:00,889 --> 01:09:07,939
Therefore, a mixture of long chain triglycerides and medium chain triglycerides is not necessary in actual formulas.

626
01:09:08,209 --> 01:09:15,579
Is that true? No.

627
01:09:15,669 --> 01:09:20,229
Right. So medium chain triglycerides do not contain essential fatty acids.

628
01:09:20,229 --> 01:09:24,099
Therefore, we can't just have an oil as our only fat source.

629
01:09:24,759 --> 01:09:31,449
So a mixture of electricity is necessary in our internal formulas.

630
01:09:31,449 --> 01:09:32,199
For the most part,

631
01:09:33,489 --> 01:09:39,999
there are some that are very low fat concentration that we have to monitor our patients to make sure that they're not on it too long.

632
01:09:41,409 --> 01:09:42,998
And then these other two are true.

633
01:09:42,999 --> 01:09:49,029
So empties are cleared from the bloodstream rapidly across the mitochondrial membrane without the need for carnitine,

634
01:09:49,509 --> 01:09:52,209
or they're oxidized to carbon dioxide and water.

635
01:09:52,269 --> 01:09:59,109
So therefore they're not stored in they do not require pancreatic enzymes or bile salts for digestion and absorption.

636
01:09:59,109 --> 01:10:06,459
So. There is there's advantages of some formulas for certain populations that have seed oil.

637
01:10:08,979 --> 01:10:12,628
Okay. All right.

638
01:10:12,629 --> 01:10:22,979
So fat in the formula it serves as a concentrated energy source provides essential fatty acids and in general a mixture of long chain triglycerides,

639
01:10:23,189 --> 01:10:25,889
which mostly is going to be from corn and soybean oil.

640
01:10:26,069 --> 01:10:36,689
And medium chain triglycerides are used and you'll see a combination of maybe some safflower oil, canola oil, coconut oil, fish oils as well in some.

641
01:10:38,299 --> 01:10:43,369
So for patients with impaired digestion, absorption and transport of fats, again,

642
01:10:43,729 --> 01:10:49,759
oftentimes medium chain triglycerides might be added to a formula that would be helpful for those patients.

643
01:10:52,669 --> 01:10:57,498
Okay. Proteins, so enteral formulations may have intact proteins.

644
01:10:57,499 --> 01:11:01,939
So again, that refers to whole protein or protein isolate.

645
01:11:02,539 --> 01:11:06,789
Most often these are going to be casein and or soy protein isolate.

646
01:11:06,799 --> 01:11:10,699
Those are the most commonly used intact proteins.

647
01:11:11,609 --> 01:11:14,939
He could also have hydrolyzed proteins.

648
01:11:15,819 --> 01:11:24,059
So for patients with gastrointestinal dysfunction or malabsorption issues, some elemental or elemental formulas may be used.

649
01:11:24,069 --> 01:11:30,638
These include hydrolyzed protein such as DI peptide tried peptides or potentially the free amino acid,

650
01:11:30,639 --> 01:11:35,949
which would be an elemental formula, not the semi elemental formula.

651
01:11:37,689 --> 01:11:47,019
So are standard or polymeric formulas that contain the intact proteins do require normal levels of pancreatic enzymes for digestion and absorption.

652
01:11:47,109 --> 01:11:54,399
Now that doesn't mean. They themselves have to have that normal function.

653
01:11:54,399 --> 01:12:00,099
Like our CF patients who we know are on pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy can

654
01:12:00,129 --> 01:12:04,719
be on a standard formula as long as they're taking their enzymes appropriately.

655
01:12:10,969 --> 01:12:19,729
Okay then are some elemental or elemental formulas. These proteins are enzymatic, broken down into smaller particles by doing that.

656
01:12:19,729 --> 01:12:25,999
So the hydrolyzed formulas, you will see that there is an increase in osmolarity of the formula.

657
01:12:26,149 --> 01:12:31,129
So by breaking down those proteins, that will increase the osmolarity.

658
01:12:32,969 --> 01:12:39,149
And the intestine can digest both smaller peptides and free amino acids because they use separate transport systems.

659
01:12:39,149 --> 01:12:45,959
So that's that's why they may be preferred for our patients with some malabsorption or digestive issues.

660
01:12:46,889 --> 01:12:50,219
But we'll be careful on who we we order those formulas for.

661
01:12:52,009 --> 01:12:57,719
Okay. Other things to to look at on that.

662
01:12:57,869 --> 01:13:04,469
When you're when we're doing our annual nutrition regimens next weeks, we do have like the vitamin the minerals.

663
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:10,739
So you'll see on the formulary reference what volume of that formula how much does a

664
01:13:10,739 --> 01:13:16,529
patient have to receive in order to meet 100% of the RBI for vitamins and minerals?

665
01:13:17,069 --> 01:13:22,259
So that's something to consider. If we have like for whatever reason, maybe a low volume,

666
01:13:22,679 --> 01:13:28,829
they might have to have additional supplementation because we're not meeting all those vitamins and minerals with their enteral formula.

667
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:35,699
We have information on electrolytes. So you can see over here, sodium, potassium, phosphorus.

668
01:13:36,359 --> 01:13:41,529
When might this be helpful? What types of patients if we're.

669
01:13:41,619 --> 01:13:47,009
We're trying to. See how much sodium we're giving in the central formula.

670
01:13:50,739 --> 01:13:58,108
Riccardia you know, like our heart failure patients, usually the total amount of sodium is is much lower than what they would get on a diet.

671
01:13:58,109 --> 01:14:03,838
But we can at least have all this information. Perhaps even phosphorus will be really important for our renal patients.

672
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:08,189
We'll get into that. And then also this free water.

673
01:14:08,189 --> 01:14:12,019
So there is water in the formulas. Okay.

674
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:15,959
And when we calculate how much we're delivering to our patients,

675
01:14:16,499 --> 01:14:21,809
we also are going to provide recommendations for how much additional water the patient needs to receive.

676
01:14:21,899 --> 01:14:31,109
So like flushes for hydration. And we'll base that really on how much fluid we estimate them to be and how much free water they're getting.

677
01:14:31,589 --> 01:14:37,079
And then we'll find how much then additional water they need. So we'll put all that together next week.

678
01:14:37,229 --> 01:14:41,029
But just keep in mind that information is available on that formula card.

679
01:14:43,139 --> 01:14:47,189
Some formulas will also have prebiotics probiotics added to them.

680
01:14:48,059 --> 01:14:53,458
You know, the benefit of these are still kind of under debate, dietary fiber.

681
01:14:53,459 --> 01:14:57,659
So some formulas will contain fiber. We'll talk about when we might want to use that.

682
01:14:58,169 --> 01:15:01,079
So it might be soluble and insoluble forms.

683
01:15:01,709 --> 01:15:08,369
There may be situations where we want to steer clear of a fiber formula, but there's all, all different types of formulas.

684
01:15:10,289 --> 01:15:12,959
So let's talk about these disease specific formulas.

685
01:15:14,839 --> 01:15:20,569
So in addition to standard enteral formulas, there are numerous disease specific formulations on the market.

686
01:15:20,569 --> 01:15:28,519
And as noted earlier, enteral formulations are classified as medical foods, so they are not regulated by the FDA as medications.

687
01:15:28,789 --> 01:15:30,889
Okay. So it's just a different classification.

688
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:40,369
Therefore, they do not require the same rigorous pre-market research to determine whether they are indicated for various clinical conditions.

689
01:15:40,379 --> 01:15:49,379
So many specialty and formulas will contain hydrolyzed proteins or free amino acids that are marketed as being more easily digested.

690
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:58,109
However, the superiority of these specialty products over our just standard formulas really has not been clearly demonstrated.

691
01:15:59,699 --> 01:16:03,119
So let's talk about a renal formula, for instance.

692
01:16:03,129 --> 01:16:10,489
So. Selection of enteral formula takes into account the patient's fluids, limitations,

693
01:16:10,909 --> 01:16:17,829
electrolyte imbalances if they have an increased nutrient requirement or a decreased ability to receive nutrients.

694
01:16:17,839 --> 01:16:22,168
Okay. And also the ease of digestion.

695
01:16:22,169 --> 01:16:29,639
So for our patients with renal dysfunction, patients with renal dysfunction may require a formula that is,

696
01:16:29,969 --> 01:16:34,229
what do you think, more or less calorically dense. And we kind of already looked at this.

697
01:16:34,829 --> 01:16:43,459
We looked at an example of a renal formula. More calorically dense often, and this is usually due to fluid issues.

698
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:54,419
They are often so restriction. And what about do they need to be higher and lower or adequate in phosphorus and potassium?

699
01:16:54,459 --> 01:16:58,419
Then you do think lower.

700
01:16:58,649 --> 01:17:01,588
And again, we have not gotten into chronic kidney disease,

701
01:17:01,589 --> 01:17:11,069
but often our renal formulas will be more calorically dense and they're going to be have less phosphorus and potassium than our standard formulas.

702
01:17:11,969 --> 01:17:15,419
That doesn't mean all of our renal patients have to be on a renal formula there.

703
01:17:15,599 --> 01:17:18,719
There's definitely situations where they do fine on a standard formula.

704
01:17:18,809 --> 01:17:29,129
Yeah. Do you find like since they aren't regulated by the FDA and like a certain phrase and center on it,

705
01:17:29,219 --> 01:17:33,239
do you find that patients, I guess, like if they're on home to feeds,

706
01:17:33,239 --> 01:17:43,289
are like more confused by what formula to be on in that sense versus like being in a hospital where you would be prescribing this certain one?

707
01:17:43,349 --> 01:17:50,039
Yeah, that's a good question. So patients that are on an enter formula at home,

708
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:56,399
maybe they get started on it after at a other hospital and now they're on a formula at home that they do well on.

709
01:17:57,329 --> 01:18:03,089
This happens a lot and they come in, they're admitted to Michigan medicine and we don't have their formula on formulary.

710
01:18:03,689 --> 01:18:08,678
Let's say we have an equivalent formula there on. 71.5.

711
01:18:08,679 --> 01:18:13,179
We have new term 1.5. It's just whatever companies bid the lowest.

712
01:18:13,419 --> 01:18:20,229
That's who we pay. You know, patients do not want to change their formula, especially if they're tolerating it.

713
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:25,939
And maybe it was a you know, it was a journey, even if we can say these are essentially identical.

714
01:18:27,099 --> 01:18:29,139
They they really don't want to change it.

715
01:18:29,139 --> 01:18:36,758
And they'll they'll kind of if we do do a different formula, sometimes there's issues not saying that it's like psychosomatic,

716
01:18:36,759 --> 01:18:44,079
but they that people tend to really just want to stay on their formula or they're adamant they have to be on Gusano or,

717
01:18:44,169 --> 01:18:47,709
you know, and we don't carry that. So it can be a little bit of a struggle,

718
01:18:47,709 --> 01:18:55,239
but it is confusing because of the marketing angle with all of this and some of the language that's really not supported by evidence.

719
01:18:58,279 --> 01:19:05,748
Okay. So pulmonary dysfunction, there are formulas targeted or marketed for patients with pulmonary dysfunction.

720
01:19:05,749 --> 01:19:11,629
So this has a modified carbohydrate to fat ratio to decrease carbohydrate intake.

721
01:19:11,629 --> 01:19:15,469
Why might that theoretically be helpful in a pulmonary patient?

722
01:19:17,749 --> 01:19:24,089
Can anybody think of why? These are.

723
01:19:25,479 --> 01:19:32,829
A controversial oxidation of carbohydrate results in greater CO2 production and fat oxidation.

724
01:19:33,829 --> 01:19:42,169
So therefore, if people have pulmonary dysfunction, this is maybe useful in patients that have CO2 retention.

725
01:19:42,979 --> 01:19:47,799
This has not really been proven to be to be helpful.

726
01:19:48,169 --> 01:19:50,239
So there's not great efficacy behind that.

727
01:19:50,239 --> 01:19:58,189
And I think even our we used to carry a pulmonary specific formula and they eventually just dropped it because the evidence just wasn't there.

728
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:06,379
Liver dysfunction. These are often calorically dense, providing a high calorie to nitrogen ratio.

729
01:20:08,599 --> 01:20:14,789
Sometimes our liver patients might have lower protein needs.

730
01:20:14,879 --> 01:20:20,149
We'll get into that later on. Yeah, for the pulmonary one, it just kind of reminded me.

731
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:26,149
I thought like with cystic fibrosis patients we talk about with labored breathing, you would want more energy and carbs.

732
01:20:26,719 --> 01:20:30,769
So, like, I don't know what kind of pulmonary function we're talking about.

733
01:20:30,829 --> 01:20:33,859
Yeah, more energy. You're struggling to breathe.

734
01:20:34,099 --> 01:20:39,859
Yeah. So this would potentially it would have the same caloric energy,

735
01:20:40,129 --> 01:20:45,199
but the macronutrient ratio would be different that more of the calories would come from fat.

736
01:20:46,459 --> 01:20:49,608
This used to be marketed more as like an ICU type of formula.

737
01:20:49,609 --> 01:20:58,609
So patients on a ventilator that we don't want to overfeed carbohydrate to then have them retain CO2, make it difficult to get them activated.

738
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:04,998
It hasn't really shown too to help with that, but that that's a good question.

739
01:21:04,999 --> 01:21:09,559
They do need still need high energy. It would just be from a different macronutrient.

740
01:21:11,159 --> 01:21:14,698
Diabetes. This is probably the biggest one cause there's diabetes specific formulas.

741
01:21:14,699 --> 01:21:18,769
Most patients with diabetes can be on a standard polymeric formula.

742
01:21:18,779 --> 01:21:23,839
They don't need to be on that diabetes specific formula, which is going to be more expensive, right?

743
01:21:23,849 --> 01:21:28,949
Because it's a more specialized formula. Sometimes the formulas with fiber may help.

744
01:21:29,099 --> 01:21:36,359
And in that rule, we'll talk about that in a couple of weeks as to why it's really our patients with diabetes.

745
01:21:37,139 --> 01:21:41,338
It's kind of how we all should be eating, just kind of a more balanced approach.

746
01:21:41,339 --> 01:21:48,629
And it doesn't have to be. There's no such thing as like a diabetic diet, so there's really not a diabetic formula.

747
01:21:48,629 --> 01:21:58,708
Sometimes that can be helpful. But in general, a lot of patients can just be on a standard formula and then there are some trauma or wound healing.

748
01:21:58,709 --> 01:22:05,009
These are high in protein and include arginine and glutamine as well as zinc and vitamin C.

749
01:22:06,209 --> 01:22:12,029
Again, not strong, strong evidence. I did post a practice guideline for this.

750
01:22:12,509 --> 01:22:21,119
I want to show you real quick. If you're if you're interested in any of this information, if you go to our page for today,

751
01:22:21,119 --> 01:22:27,989
this impact guideline impact is the name of the formula alone for us.

752
01:22:31,439 --> 01:22:36,209
Just want to give you like an example that you can't just order this for your patient in the hospital.

753
01:22:36,209 --> 01:22:40,559
There's an actual guideline on who this might be appropriate for.

754
01:22:43,109 --> 01:22:46,949
Maybe it's not going to be okay for us.

755
01:22:47,769 --> 01:22:56,209
Try it one more time. Okay.

756
01:22:59,939 --> 01:23:07,768
So this is the formula. What is it? It has a blend of arginine, omega three fatty acids, dietary nucleotides.

757
01:23:07,769 --> 01:23:12,269
So which means patients may benefit from this, just like our trauma burn patients.

758
01:23:12,269 --> 01:23:19,499
But there's a whole slew there. There might be some other efficacy there, which patients should not be on this.

759
01:23:20,789 --> 01:23:28,259
What benefits may be expected? So you can see we have a whole guideline as to when we might select this very highly specialized formula.

760
01:23:28,679 --> 01:23:33,749
So if you're interested in that, you can you can look at what some of the the guidelines say there.

761
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:41,589
And usually there's like a minimum amount of days of therapy that is required to use those types of formulas.

762
01:23:46,459 --> 01:23:58,909
Okay. What I will say is always choose the formula to meet the needs of the patient rather than a formula to match the disease, say, case.

763
01:23:58,919 --> 01:24:08,959
So if I give you a case, a case study where they have diabetes, don't immediately think you need to do a diabetes specific formula.

764
01:24:08,979 --> 01:24:13,479
Same for like a renal patient. So we're always going to meet the needs of the patient.

765
01:24:13,689 --> 01:24:17,439
We're not matching the disease state. In some cases that will line up.

766
01:24:17,739 --> 01:24:22,089
Okay, but that's not going to be your first consideration for these formulas.

767
01:24:23,959 --> 01:24:27,508
What? Okay.

768
01:24:27,509 --> 01:24:33,959
So let's we're going to get maybe 12 minutes or so on and complications of animal nutrition.

769
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:43,949
So let's do a quick class pause. We have a six year old, critically ill patient who's been tolerating a standard one called parental enteral formula.

770
01:24:44,729 --> 01:24:50,039
This is like using a pretty gentle formula. The one cal is going to be relatively hypertonic.

771
01:24:50,429 --> 01:24:54,599
She begins having so she's been on this, tolerating it well for the past week.

772
01:24:55,169 --> 01:24:59,879
She begins having frequent bouts of loose stools requiring placement of a rectal tube.

773
01:24:59,879 --> 01:25:04,979
So essentially a tube into the rectum that helps dispel the the stool.

774
01:25:05,189 --> 01:25:08,969
So what should be the clinician's next suggestion?

775
01:25:08,969 --> 01:25:12,938
Let's say you get paged by the M.D. saying you got to change the formula.

776
01:25:12,939 --> 01:25:16,809
The patient has diarrhea. And that happens all the time.

777
01:25:16,819 --> 01:25:21,619
That's why we have this example. What do you think would be our first step?

778
01:25:24,349 --> 01:25:27,889
Yeah. I would say determine the cause of the tiger.

779
01:25:28,249 --> 01:25:32,929
Yes, if we can right there, we can immediately go to a peptide or a semi elemental formulas.

780
01:25:32,929 --> 01:25:37,489
Patients been doing well for a week now. All of a sudden there's diarrhea.

781
01:25:38,299 --> 01:25:44,029
That's a pretty good sign is probably not the formula. So we want to determine the cause of diarrhea first.

782
01:25:46,149 --> 01:25:50,289
And then we can talk about do we add probiotics to the feeding regimen?

783
01:25:50,469 --> 01:25:54,789
Maybe depending on what the cause is, do we want to change to a fiber supplement?

784
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:59,469
Maybe, depending on what the cause is, we have to understand what the cause of diarrhea is.

785
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:05,799
So that's what we'll get into. Yes. For you.

786
01:26:05,819 --> 01:26:09,069
I hope it could. So if there was.

787
01:26:11,239 --> 01:26:18,189
But I like significant diarrhea relief. Fast, rapid stools, signs of potential malabsorption,

788
01:26:18,669 --> 01:26:27,339
one that is enzymatic broken down a little bit will be better absorbed in situations where there is rapid catch intestinal transit.

789
01:26:27,789 --> 01:26:36,279
So potentially a lot of times if somebody has diarrhea, they'll say put them on a semi elemental formula, but that's usually not necessary.

790
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:42,309
Okay. So let's talk about some gastrointestinal complications that often get blamed.

791
01:26:42,309 --> 01:26:45,878
The too often gets blamed or so nausea and vomiting.

792
01:26:45,879 --> 01:26:49,359
Why does it happen? These are common complications of enteral feeding.

793
01:26:49,689 --> 01:26:53,109
It can increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia potentially.

794
01:26:53,109 --> 01:27:00,428
But there are multiple etiologies for nausea and vomiting with enteral nutrition delayed, gastric emptying is the most common cause.

795
01:27:00,429 --> 01:27:08,409
So for feeding into a stomach where there is delayed gastric emptying, usually that's going to be the biggest cause of the nausea and vomiting.

796
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:15,849
So both gastric retention and rapid infusion of a hyper as molar formula can cause nausea, vomiting.

797
01:27:15,849 --> 01:27:22,239
So for giving a really concentrated, hypertonic formula quickly into the stomach with,

798
01:27:22,239 --> 01:27:27,069
say, somebody that has delayed gastric emptying, they might throw that up.

799
01:27:28,819 --> 01:27:33,079
So what can we do about it? So in these cases, we can first.

800
01:27:34,569 --> 01:27:37,778
We may need to hold it until nutrition, if they're actively vomiting.

801
01:27:37,779 --> 01:27:41,258
So pause it. But we can also reduce the rate of feeding.

802
01:27:41,259 --> 01:27:48,699
So how quickly it's being infused, we can consider the fat content of the formula, although a lot of them are very similar.

803
01:27:49,659 --> 01:27:56,159
What else might we want to do? Yeah.

804
01:27:56,659 --> 01:28:02,909
You do not like Zofran. They might have medication management to help you.

805
01:28:05,909 --> 01:28:13,819
What else might. Might we do, let's say, for feeding into the stomach and this continues to persist.

806
01:28:17,189 --> 01:28:25,409
Despite our best efforts. That may be a situation where we would push to have the tube extended into the small bowel.

807
01:28:27,029 --> 01:28:30,869
So if you think of vomiting, that's generally coming from contents in the stomach.

808
01:28:31,409 --> 01:28:35,758
That's what we're vomiting up. So let's say we troubleshoot it.

809
01:28:35,759 --> 01:28:38,399
Maybe those medications have been started.

810
01:28:38,399 --> 01:28:44,699
We've reduced how quickly we're infusing the formula with maybe change the formula and it's still happening.

811
01:28:45,269 --> 01:28:48,449
That might be a situation where we'd want to go to a small bottle feeling.

812
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:53,649
Yeah, it's more common than almost any more intuitively rather than if they get through.

813
01:28:53,939 --> 01:28:59,549
It is theoretically, yes, but usually our patients that are on bolus or intermittent feedings.

814
01:28:59,909 --> 01:29:04,889
It's been a journey to get to that point and they're usually pretty stable on those regimens.

815
01:29:05,579 --> 01:29:08,008
Sometimes we'll go to that too quickly,

816
01:29:08,009 --> 01:29:14,759
like we kind of don't take our time to really get them transitioned over to those in and then maybe that happens.

817
01:29:15,929 --> 01:29:22,349
But this can this can happen just with maybe too fast of a continuous infusion with a more hypertonic formula.

818
01:29:22,359 --> 01:29:28,419
Maybe we're trying to meet calorie needs and they have delayed emptying and it's just too much at.

819
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:35,558
Okay. So delayed gastric emptying. Well, we had an asterisk on the first slide.

820
01:29:35,559 --> 01:29:41,198
Now we'll talk about that in more specific. So what causes it?

821
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:48,429
There's multiple potential causes of delayed gastric emptying. You guys remember so gastroparesis from last year, what was the big cause?

822
01:29:54,799 --> 01:30:00,299
You remember, like our poorly controlled diabetic patients that had neuropathy or vagus nerve damage,

823
01:30:00,299 --> 01:30:04,859
then they would have potentially delayed gastric emptying or gastroparesis.

824
01:30:06,749 --> 01:30:13,919
There's different there's lots of different potential causes, but a lot of times it's some type of insult to that vagus nerve.

825
01:30:14,189 --> 01:30:17,579
Most often, whether it's diabetes or maybe a surgical procedure.

826
01:30:18,629 --> 01:30:26,788
So what can we do about delayed gastric emptying so we can reduce or discontinue all narcotic medications?

827
01:30:26,789 --> 01:30:31,229
That's not our role. And is that really feasible? Like if somebody needs pain management?

828
01:30:31,559 --> 01:30:40,739
No, maybe not. Maybe there's that can be looked at, though, if you're rounding with your team, like, is there any changes to the medication regimen?

829
01:30:40,739 --> 01:30:44,608
Because these the narcotics are like GI stoppers.

830
01:30:44,609 --> 01:30:53,668
They really slow things down. Switching to a low fiber, low fat and or isotonic formula may help if we think about back to our gastroparesis.

831
01:30:53,669 --> 01:30:58,259
Remember, fat takes longer to digest, so it just kind of hangs out there.

832
01:30:58,739 --> 01:31:03,239
Fiber slows, gastric emptying. So we want to make sure our formula doesn't.

833
01:31:03,899 --> 01:31:10,049
It's not a fiber containing formula. Probably a more isotonic formula would be better tolerated.

834
01:31:11,489 --> 01:31:14,938
Sometimes administering the feeding solution at room temperature,

835
01:31:14,939 --> 01:31:23,518
sometimes if they open a can and they make stored in the fridge that's there, especially at home, you know, we tell them to do that.

836
01:31:23,519 --> 01:31:27,029
So it might be best to get it up to room temperature.

837
01:31:27,599 --> 01:31:34,889
We can temporarily reduce the rate of infusion by like a certain percentage or even just cut down by 20 miles an hour.

838
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:39,628
Slow it down, see if that helps. Changing the infusion method if needed.

839
01:31:39,629 --> 01:31:43,739
So like if it is bolus feedings are really having a hard time tolerating that.

840
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:47,159
We can go back to continuous in assess their tolerance.

841
01:31:47,669 --> 01:31:54,719
Also there's coconut kinetic that we talked about regulate and erythromycin that help stimulate peristalsis and get things moving.

842
01:31:56,059 --> 01:31:59,779
Yeah. You mentioned the verb being hypertonic.

843
01:31:59,989 --> 01:32:03,159
See the most gentle. So why isotonic in this situation?

844
01:32:03,159 --> 01:32:09,818
Either one of those would be. Those either one would be fine.

845
01:32:09,819 --> 01:32:13,599
Sometimes in a truly hypertonic formula is going to be.

846
01:32:14,759 --> 01:32:15,419
There's a very,

847
01:32:16,829 --> 01:32:23,149
very few patients who that it's going to work for in terms of meeting their nutritional needs because it is usually pretty low in the calories.

848
01:32:23,159 --> 01:32:27,749
So isotonic is what we're trying to avoid is like a hypertonic formula.

849
01:32:30,939 --> 01:32:34,748
Okay. Abdominal distension could be another complication.

850
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:39,459
So this might be a patient's report of symptoms such as bloating or cramping.

851
01:32:39,459 --> 01:32:44,319
Sometimes I'll say, like as soon as we start. The two things my stomach is is cramping.

852
01:32:45,309 --> 01:32:51,428
If there's no obvious distension or bloating, there could be a that an illness has formed.

853
01:32:51,429 --> 01:32:56,829
Remember, that's a temporary stoppage of intestinal peristalsis at certain sites of the small bowel.

854
01:32:57,279 --> 01:32:58,809
Maybe there's a bowel obstruction,

855
01:32:58,809 --> 01:33:07,388
so sometimes they'll hold two feeds and rule out that there's an obstruction of the patient is really they're not passing they're not passing gas.

856
01:33:07,389 --> 01:33:16,749
So it doesn't mean that their bowels not awake, but it's just not like really, really moving a lot so that they can get some distension there.

857
01:33:17,589 --> 01:33:22,209
If they have a condition called a that's usually specific to our liver patients, we'll get into that.

858
01:33:22,209 --> 01:33:29,348
That's like a very distended abdomen. That can be very discomfort and uncomfortable diarrheal illness.

859
01:33:29,349 --> 01:33:36,069
So see, did you know maybe that's something they have an infection could be due to

860
01:33:36,069 --> 01:33:42,038
excessively rapid administration of formula or infusion of really cold formula.

861
01:33:42,039 --> 01:33:46,598
So if it was in the refrigerator and it just immediately gets poured into their tube,

862
01:33:46,599 --> 01:33:52,539
that can cause some cramping and then of really giving too much fiber in the formula.

863
01:33:52,869 --> 01:34:00,428
Usually that would be hard to do, but you might have a lot of fiber modulus ordered and maybe it was put in it incorrectly.

864
01:34:00,429 --> 01:34:04,539
And they're getting a bunch of fiber so that can that can cause some distension.

865
01:34:05,289 --> 01:34:06,278
What can we do about it?

866
01:34:06,279 --> 01:34:14,739
Really just monitoring the closely but also depends on the cause, whether they would require an adjustment or even a pause in their enteral nutrition.

867
01:34:16,209 --> 01:34:18,608
Definitely things like an alias or an obstruction.

868
01:34:18,609 --> 01:34:28,599
They might have to pause and see if we can continue feeding safely or reposition the tube or we can slow down the rate of infusion as well.

869
01:34:30,299 --> 01:34:36,268
Okay. Okay, let's do a couple more slides. All right.

870
01:34:36,269 --> 01:34:39,479
Well, we'll stop after these gastric residual volumes.

871
01:34:39,479 --> 01:34:47,058
So. I want to talk a little bit about the use of gastro gastric residual volumes in assessing tolerance of N.

872
01:34:47,059 --> 01:34:53,559
So what are these so. When measuring a gastric residual volume, the clinician,

873
01:34:53,559 --> 01:35:02,559
usually the nurse is going to withdraw or suction fluid intermittently from the enteral access device with the syringe or by gravity drainage.

874
01:35:02,559 --> 01:35:09,159
So they're essentially going to hook up the syringe to the feeding tube access and withdraw fluid.

875
01:35:09,549 --> 01:35:13,839
And they have specific times that they do this in according to the feeding regimen.

876
01:35:15,289 --> 01:35:21,229
So then that fluid is collected and measured over 24 hours. Often, Bill, they'll measure them every 4 hours or whatever.

877
01:35:21,739 --> 01:35:27,769
So normal gastric residual volumes range from 250 miles to 500 mls over 24 hours.

878
01:35:29,449 --> 01:35:34,369
If they're withdrawing more of that fluid, that may indicate delayed gastric emptying,

879
01:35:34,369 --> 01:35:42,289
which some associate with an increased risk for aspiration so that the fluid is not moving through the GI tract fast enough.

880
01:35:43,399 --> 01:35:50,119
There is potential that there could increase their risk for aspiration because they're they're retaining more gastric contents.

881
01:35:51,109 --> 01:35:59,869
This is highly subjective. It's prone to accuracy. Concerns and studies on the value of using these measurements are really conflicting.

882
01:36:00,259 --> 01:36:03,419
It also depends on when the nurse withdraws it.

883
01:36:03,439 --> 01:36:09,319
Maybe they just did a bolus feeding and they check a partial residual volume and like, Oh, this formula is coming out.

884
01:36:09,319 --> 01:36:15,829
Well, they just infused their formula. So it's not a perfect practice, but it is still done.

885
01:36:17,309 --> 01:36:20,919
Now, tell you what the the FCC guidelines say about this.

886
01:36:20,929 --> 01:36:24,239
So this is the Society of Critical Care Medicine in Aspen.

887
01:36:24,259 --> 01:36:30,439
So gastric residual volumes do not correlate with incidence of pneumonia, regurgitation or aspiration.

888
01:36:30,439 --> 01:36:37,429
So you can see this this body of evidence, this kind of governing scientific body does not support the use of this.

889
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:43,399
A high gastric residual should raise some concern as to if the patient needs a regimen.

890
01:36:43,399 --> 01:36:47,118
So do they need to be on to something to help them go to the bathroom?

891
01:36:47,119 --> 01:36:56,778
A proper network agent, possibly small bowel feedings, if they are retaining a lot of gastric fluid and they should not be a routine care to monitor?

892
01:36:56,779 --> 01:37:06,959
This is a bit of a dicey patient. So. You'll see a lot of protocols where if gastric residual volumes or over 200 hold enteral nutrition

893
01:37:07,079 --> 01:37:12,539
like that's just in a policy and so they check it then their their feeds are always on hold.

894
01:37:13,679 --> 01:37:17,039
So depending if you end up if any of you end up working in a hospital.

895
01:37:18,249 --> 01:37:21,789
You'll know if these are used and what the policy is.

896
01:37:21,789 --> 01:37:27,608
And it could be a really good topic to to debate and look at the evidence.

897
01:37:27,609 --> 01:37:34,749
But they're basically saying if they're under 500 samples like that, using that 500 mile threshold,

898
01:37:35,229 --> 01:37:39,159
there's no need to hold the feeding tubes if there's no other signs of intolerance.

899
01:37:40,809 --> 01:37:48,999
So just to be aware of these that this is a practice, I've seen it a lot that their feeds are held because of a GR over 300.

900
01:37:49,009 --> 01:37:52,139
And so like when did they check it?

901
01:37:52,209 --> 01:37:55,539
There's no other issues with the patient that's probably not necessary.

902
01:37:56,499 --> 01:38:00,039
It's a little bit of a controversial thing. We'll stop there.

903
01:38:00,039 --> 01:38:04,299
But does anybody have questions on any of that or the the gastric residual volumes?

904
01:38:05,289 --> 01:38:08,589
Yeah. So that would be hard for them to be continuously.

905
01:38:09,069 --> 01:38:12,339
But yes, they do check it with continuous feeds.

906
01:38:12,499 --> 01:38:16,449
Okay. So they have a threshold above.

907
01:38:16,449 --> 01:38:21,189
There's like a calculation of what percentage of the infusion rate is normal.

908
01:38:21,309 --> 01:38:31,929
Okay. So there is calculations there that we won't bother with, but they didn't think it, but they likely wouldn't always.

909
01:38:32,109 --> 01:38:36,445
Well, as you said, when all this is the jargon in any way, like we're.
