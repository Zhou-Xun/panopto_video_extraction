1
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:11,704
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,704 --> 00:00:17,360
you will be able to explain basic
concepts about generalized linear models.

3
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,229
In this course, we're going to
learn five different models.

4
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:25,390
So far, we have learned linear and
logistic aggression models.

5
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:29,497
We will also learn log-binomial and
Poisson models in this unit, and

6
00:00:29,497 --> 00:00:33,840
we will learn Cox proportional
hazards models in Unit 7.

7
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,303
What is interesting about this
models is that four of them linear,

8
00:00:38,303 --> 00:00:40,535
logistic, log-binomial, and

9
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:46,540
Poisson belong to the same family of
models called generalized linear models.

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,700
The generalized linear model is a family
of models that allow us to analyze

11
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,452
the linear relationship
between predictors and

12
00:00:53,452 --> 00:00:57,760
the outcome independently of the
underlying distribution of the outcome.

13
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,690
They have many things in
common that we will see next.

14
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,482
The fifth model, the Cox model does
not really belong to the family,

15
00:01:06,482 --> 00:01:09,456
it's not a generalized linear model, but

16
00:01:09,456 --> 00:01:14,175
in practice you will see in Unit 7
that some things will be similar.

17
00:01:14,175 --> 00:01:16,947
So that's why we put it here as the cat,

18
00:01:16,947 --> 00:01:23,520
not really part of the human family,
but with many things in common.

19
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,220
So, going back to all the models
we will learn this semester,

20
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:31,131
here you can see why we will learn
these models and not others, and

21
00:01:31,131 --> 00:01:35,360
why these models are highly
used in epidemiologic studies.

22
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:40,214
Basically because from each of them
we can get some of the main measures

23
00:01:40,214 --> 00:01:43,340
of association that we
use in epidemiology,

24
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,970
such as a ratio with ratios and
rate ratios.

25
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:50,316
We will go back to this graph a few times.

26
00:01:50,316 --> 00:01:54,834
For now, just to highlight that we will
be learning these two models, Poisson and

27
00:01:54,834 --> 00:01:58,060
log-binomial in this unit.

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:02,368
So going back to the generalized
linear model family, we have here,

29
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,462
the components of these models.

30
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:07,876
All of them have those components,
one random component

31
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:12,869
that identifies the dependent variable,
Y, and its probability distribution.

32
00:02:12,869 --> 00:02:17,395
The second component is a systematic
component that identifies the set of

33
00:02:17,395 --> 00:02:20,980
explanatory variables,
the right side of the equation.

34
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,083
And the last component is
the link function, and

35
00:02:24,083 --> 00:02:28,080
this is the key to identify every
single model in the family.

36
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,446
Since it identifies the function
of the dependent variable,

37
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:34,564
that is a linear function of
the explanatory variables.

38
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:38,511
So if we look at a generic equation for
the generalized linear model,

39
00:02:38,511 --> 00:02:40,440
it will look like this.

40
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,608
The right side of the equation
is always linear, and

41
00:02:43,608 --> 00:02:47,143
that's why they're called
generalized linear models.

42
00:02:47,143 --> 00:02:50,691
While the left side of the equation
can be different things.

43
00:02:50,691 --> 00:02:55,562
We wrote it as g(mu) here as a generic
way of saying that it can be many things.

44
00:02:55,562 --> 00:03:02,250
It can be means, it can be logit, and it
can be many other things that we will see.

45
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:07,049
So if we look at our four generalized
linear models, linear, logistic, Poisson,

46
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:11,106
and log-binomial, we can see in
the models that they all share the same

47
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:14,148
linear side of the equation
as we already mentioned,

48
00:03:14,148 --> 00:03:17,077
while the left side is what
makes them particular.

49
00:03:17,077 --> 00:03:21,528
For the linear model, the most simple of
all of them we saw that the underlying

50
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:24,543
distribution of the dependent
variable is normal,

51
00:03:24,543 --> 00:03:28,603
and there's not really a special
link function, just the identity.

52
00:03:28,603 --> 00:03:32,445
For logistic regression,
since our outcome variable is binary,

53
00:03:32,445 --> 00:03:36,983
it's distribution is binomial and the link
function is the logit or log odds.

54
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,310
We saw that before.

55
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:42,391
Now, our junior models are Poisson and
log-binomial.

56
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:45,861
The underlying distribution
of the Possum model is, well,

57
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:50,498
the Poisson distribution because we're
modeling counts, more on that later.

58
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:54,765
And that's why it's called that way,
and the link function is the log.

59
00:03:54,765 --> 00:03:56,915
While for the log-binomial model,

60
00:03:56,915 --> 00:04:01,291
the dependent variable is again a binary
variable like in logistic model.

61
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:04,663
So it's underlying distribution
is also binomial, but

62
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:07,870
the link is the log, not the logit.

63
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,402
So this may sound like
a lot to remember now,

64
00:04:10,402 --> 00:04:13,762
but don't worry since we will
go over every single model.

65
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:17,188
But to summarize again,
this is what you should remember.

66
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:20,605
For linear models,
your response variable is continuous,

67
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:23,625
its distribution is normal and
the link is identity.

68
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:28,537
For logistic models, the response variable
is binary, you're modeling proportions or

69
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:32,815
probabilities that follow a binomial
distribution and the link is the logit.

70
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:37,749
For Poisson models your modeling counts
that follow a Poisson distribution, and

71
00:04:37,749 --> 00:04:39,546
the link function is the log.

72
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:43,594
And for log-binomial models you're
going to have a binary variable,

73
00:04:43,594 --> 00:04:48,454
modeling proportion, or probabilities, so
follow a binomial distribution as with

74
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,908
logistic, but this time the link
is the log, not the logit.

75
00:04:51,908 --> 00:04:56,143
In the next video you will see why it's
important to remember the link and

76
00:04:56,143 --> 00:05:01,190
the distribution for
each model when we start using model.

77
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:02,043
So in summary,

78
00:05:02,043 --> 00:05:06,523
in this video we learn the most basic
concepts about generalized linear models.

79
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:09,834
In the next video we will
continue with the SASCO template,

80
00:05:09,834 --> 00:05:14,453
program that we can use for
all generalized linear models.
