1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:08,500
You know. I don't know.

2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:21,930
Maybe. She couldn't wait for an hour.

3
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:29,430
And I was like, Oh, my God. No, you can't.

4
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:33,360
You can't sit here.

5
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,140
And I said, Get over my head.

6
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:53,640
But I know what I got.

7
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:04,490
My one time I was probably with my dad and I was like, it looks like like a ton of rain,

8
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:15,480
like, with, like that kind of, you know, like I was like, you're like, I know what it's like.

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:25,110
I'm for one. Oh, you could just see today.

10
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:32,879
This week, we're going to be focusing on the stress.

11
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:41,040
So I'm going to talk about today. And then on Wednesday, we'll be talking about racism and how we operate.

12
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:47,280
Coming up next week, I'm sure everyone's looking forward to you all deserve a break.

13
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:58,040
I'm starting to get busier. So we're going to enjoy your break and then we'll come back next Wednesday to talk about support.

14
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,610
So today I'm going to talk about stress and concrete and stress affects our health.

15
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:13,800
And decades of research has shown this. So that's sort of the general conclusion on the relationship between stress and health.

16
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,160
So why don't you sort of walk me through some of the major findings from the stress literature?

17
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,610
It's a very big literature. My goal here is to distill it down for you.

18
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:42,400
So when stressors such as negative events, chronic strains and traumas are measured comprehensively,

19
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,920
their damaging impacts on the physical and mental health are substantial.

20
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:57,060
We also know that differential exposure to stressful experiences is a primary way that gender,

21
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:03,660
racial, ethnic and social class inequalities in physical and mental health are reduced.

22
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:20,890
So when we see differential exposure to stress, and that is one way the disparities in physical and mental health status are reproduced in third.

23
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:29,490
So Minoritized members of various groups are additionally harmed by discrimination stress.

24
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:37,410
The particular kind of stress and stressors proliferate over our life course.

25
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:47,790
They can proliferate across generations, which results in widening gaps between needs and disadvantage group members.

26
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:59,670
So as stress can can be passed down through generations and then the impacts of stress on health and wellbeing are reduced.

27
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:07,080
We can actually reduce the impacts when people have high levels of mastery, self esteem or social support.

28
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:14,940
And from a physiological standpoint, we know that a limited amount of stress can actually be beneficial.

29
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:23,549
So not all stress is bad. There are proteins and physiological pathways that allow our bodies to adapt to stress.

30
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:32,820
And in a healthy life, what we aim to do is achieve a balance between good stressors and bad stressors,

31
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:37,379
and we seek to provide that balance for others as well.

32
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,110
And that's one of our primary goals of public health is striking that balance between good stress and stress.

33
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:54,190
There are a lot of theories and models related to stress response and out there are many early theories focused on our perceptions of stress or how

34
00:04:54,190 --> 00:05:02,950
we view this and how we view a stressor in a large body of work suggest that when we change how we think about stress or how we handle stress,

35
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:07,390
it can change. Your body's response is just stress certainly changes how we think about it.

36
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:13,690
Our body's response to stress can also change. And what models suggested in your readings?

37
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:22,149
The transactional model stressing coping really highlight the mechanisms and processes through which stress can

38
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:28,209
really affect our health outcomes and it really provides a useful framework for public health interventions.

39
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:34,450
So that's what I'm going to walk you through today. There are tons of frameworks and theories on stress.

40
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:44,200
We just don't have the capacity to dove into that deeply because this is just not, of course, related solely to stress.

41
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:49,510
But I want to walk you through a model that's commonly used in our discipline and to

42
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:55,870
highlight for you different sort of areas where you might think about intervention.

43
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:08,030
That's pretty useful in this model. So the transactional model of stress in coping suggests that external stressors impact on health

44
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:14,840
is mediated by the person's assessment of this stressor and the resources at his or her disposal.

45
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:26,000
So the external stressors impact is mediated by the person's assessment of the stressor and the resource at his or her disposal.

46
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:34,820
So when we think about a mediated relationship, it's usually something in the middle between one thing and another.

47
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:41,010
So this is what it looks like. So we have stress. We assess the stress and we cope.

48
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:48,859
And that leads to our hope that that's sort of this is really the core of the transactional model of stress and coping.

49
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:54,950
You'll see like a lot of other boxes and arrows. But when it comes down to it, this is the core of the model.

50
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:01,099
This is the main, main pathway. So there's a stressor we assess and we cope with it.

51
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,720
And then that influences are called out.

52
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,410
So this model starts with a stressor and we can all probably recall a time when we

53
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:27,600
experience stress and we can categorize stress into sort of three general mean times.

54
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:34,830
We can experience routine stress, such as pressure at work, family and other sort of daily responsibilities.

55
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,010
This can include dramas and sets, homework.

56
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:47,430
It can include paying our bills, somebody saying something new to us or being disrespectful of being late for an important meeting.

57
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:52,620
And these are considered all of the category of routine stresses.

58
00:07:53,610 --> 00:08:02,129
And then there are stressors brought about by a sudden negative change, such as losing a job, a divorce,

59
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:15,540
or an important relationship ending illness, your house burning down, graduating and not having a job, a loved one dying, a terminal diagnosis.

60
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:20,610
These are stressors brought about by a sudden negative change.

61
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,360
And then a third type of stress is traumatic stress.

62
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:34,169
I'm experienced in an event like a major accident or a assault or industrial disaster where one may be seriously hurt

63
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:42,960
or in danger of being killed or their life is really threatened so that that falls into a bucket of traumatic stress.

64
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:51,750
So these are different types of stressors. And stressors are demands made by the internal or external environment that sort of

65
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:57,659
upset the balance of homeostasis affecting our physical and psychological well-being.

66
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,740
And it requires some sort of action to restore that balance.

67
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:07,290
And the key thing to understand here is that stress affects people in different ways.

68
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:13,170
So we respond to stress in different ways. And our views about stress can vary from person to person.

69
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:24,579
So when we're exposed to a stressor, we first engage in primary appraisal of a stressor.

70
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,350
That stressor has occurred. The first thing we do is we engage in primary appraisal.

71
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:37,360
We focus on the features of the stressful situation, and we make judgments about those features.

72
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:44,380
So primary appraisal is really a person's judgment about the significance of an event as stressful,

73
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:49,030
positive, controllable, challenging, benign, or relevant.

74
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,390
Health issues are typically evaluated as threatening or negative stressors.

75
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:03,160
A positive stressor might be something like receiving a promotion or a raise at work, starting a new job,

76
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:11,290
getting married and buying a home, having a child, moving, retiring, advancing your education.

77
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:15,970
Remember that these are all good things. So why are they stressors?

78
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:21,280
Well, remember, stressors are demands that change the balance of your routine stability.

79
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:27,160
Even things that are typically celebrated fall under that category of stressors as a result.

80
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:36,010
Sort of primary appraisal may be related to our perceptions of susceptibility and severity.

81
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:40,930
Right. Where, you know, where did we see these concepts before?

82
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:56,190
Susceptibility and severity of threat. Hopefully tomorrow.

83
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:04,490
No. Okay. So, you know, familiar concepts from the help believe model.

84
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:10,520
These provide our prevent perceptions of risk or threat that the stressor induces.

85
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:17,510
And we want to get risk perception just right. So our risk perceptions may because to engage in certain types of coping.

86
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:25,520
And one caveat to really think about is that our perceptions of our perception of our risk is too high.

87
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,420
It can generate distress and make us avoid engaging in health, promoting behaviors.

88
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:38,239
So, for example, if you perceive yourself to be very susceptible to a certain type of cancer or illness that

89
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,720
may cause you a lot of distress and therefore not get you to engage in regular screening.

90
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:54,500
So trying to get risk perception just right is an important sort of outcome of an intervention focused on us.

91
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:04,880
When we appraise the stressor, we also assess whether it has a major impact on our goals and concerns, which is considered motivational relevance.

92
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:14,239
That's what motivational role is. We assess whether it has a major impact on our goals and our concerns, and when a stressor has high relevance to us,

93
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:22,130
we're more likely to experience anxiety or situation specific distress that may or may not lead us to seek improvement resources.

94
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,150
And we may also assess the causal focus of this stressor.

95
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:30,410
Who or what is responsible for that stress? What's causing this?

96
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:38,240
So when we make judgments about our stressors, we're thinking about our perceived risk related to the threat the stressor brings,

97
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:43,370
how relevant it is to us in our situation, and what is the cause of that stress.

98
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,210
Those are all the things we're doing when a primary appraisal.

99
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:59,870
Then we have secondary appraisal and this really relates to our assessment of our coping resources and our options.

100
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:02,190
So primary appraisal is really appraisal.

101
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:09,020
The stress, secondary appraisal is our appraisal of our coping resources and our options to manage that stress.

102
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:18,470
And these assessments include our perceived ability to change the situation, which refers to our perceived control over the threat and its outcomes.

103
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,490
In another part of secondary appraisal includes our perceived ability to manage our emotional reaction to the threat.

104
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:32,569
In other words, our perceived control over whatever sort of feeling that ensues so stress can

105
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:37,600
bring upon a stressor may bring upon anger or sadness or a whole host of emotions.

106
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:43,130
So how do we perceive our ability to exert any sort of control over those sorts of feelings?

107
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:51,530
And then the last part of secondary appraisal includes our expectations about the effectiveness of our coping resources.

108
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:54,589
So in other words, are coping self-efficacy.

109
00:13:54,590 --> 00:14:00,920
How confident are you that our coping resources are sufficient to address the threat of the stress?

110
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,209
We feel like we have more control over a situation.

111
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:10,730
We may be more likely to improve our physical wellbeing by adopting recommended health behaviors.

112
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:18,470
One caveat is that when we're in situations that can be altered or when we're in a that can't be altered,

113
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:24,170
cannot be altered, the stressor or the stressor is extremely severe or fatal.

114
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:31,099
Beliefs of our personal control may cause distress and dysfunctions of control.

115
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:37,879
Beliefs are adaptive based on when they get closest to sort of the reality of the situation.

116
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:45,440
So sometimes that stressor creates a situation that a person just really has no sort of control over in terms of coping and changing that.

117
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:51,020
So control beliefs again are adaptive when it really fits the reality of the situation.

118
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:59,629
And then there's a secondary appraisal that allows us to think through our perceived control over the outcome of the threat that the stressor

119
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:07,850
brings on and our perceived control over the emotions that the stress elicits and our self-efficacy over utilizing our coping resources.

120
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:17,180
So that's all secondary appraisal. So when we face a stressor, we do both of these things are primary and secondary.

121
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:30,060
So now we're sort of going into continuing to sort of walk through some mediating processes.

122
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:34,710
So when we appraise our stress, it leads to actual scoping efforts.

123
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:45,330
And there are two sort of dimensions that include coping efforts that include problem management or problem focused coping and emotional regulation.

124
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:55,620
Those are two things sort of involved in our coping. So problem management includes strategies that are directed at changing a stressful situation.

125
00:15:55,980 --> 00:16:01,050
Very sort of can be pretty cognitive in nature.

126
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:07,940
When we think about problem management, this includes active coping, problem solving, information seeking.

127
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:17,879
It can also include stimulus control and counter conditioning, like we learned in terms of change strategies and stage models when we went over that.

128
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:24,840
And operant conditioning problem management is most adaptive for stressors that you can actually change.

129
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,440
You may face stressors you cannot change, but problem management is most adaptive as a strategy,

130
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:36,330
and when you're in situations with stressors that you can change and a whole host

131
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:41,850
of stressors or things that cannot be change or can or cannot be easily changed.

132
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:48,389
And then emotional regulation or emotional focus making efforts are really directed at changing the

133
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:54,750
way you think and feel about a stressful situation and include things like seeking social support,

134
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:58,230
venting about feel, avoidance or denial.

135
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:07,490
And emotional regulation is most adaptive when you can't change the stressor or when all the problems, the focus, coping attempts have been made.

136
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,200
So, you know,

137
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:24,360
you're in a situation again where you can't change the stressor and you've used all you've really exhausted all your problem management strategies,

138
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:30,629
problem focus. Coping in terms of emotional regulation becomes most adaptive where you're really

139
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,760
focused on changing the way you think or feel about the stressful situation.

140
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:39,870
And when a stressor is highly threatening or uncontrollable,

141
00:17:39,870 --> 00:17:47,100
a person is more likely to use disengaging coping strategies where they distance themselves from the stressor.

142
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,230
And this include things like avoidance, distraction, denial and distancing.

143
00:17:52,890 --> 00:18:00,630
Whereas when the stressor is controllable in person and the person has really high self-efficacy related to their coping resources,

144
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:08,430
they are more likely to use their coping strategies such as active coping, using their social network planning and seeking out constructive.

145
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:23,260
So are there common sort of coping responses to health threats that are made in our meaning based coping, which can again induce positive emotion?

146
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:32,350
And this can include things like positive thinking, changing your goals, your spiritual beliefs or positive prevention.

147
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,600
The key here is that meaning based coping is really meant to elicit positive emotions.

148
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,740
So if you're using meaning based coping as an intervention strategy, your goal is to really try to elicit positive emotion.

149
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:54,850
And this can influence on coping efforts and our dispositional coping style and social support can influence or secondary appraisal of a stressor,

150
00:18:54,850 --> 00:19:02,120
which is I'm thinking about our perceived control of our coping efforts and our ability to engage in meaning basically.

151
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:08,080
So coping styles are dispositional or stable characteristics of an individual,

152
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:14,950
so they are more generalized while coping efforts are more situation specific.

153
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:20,319
So your coping efforts are not necessarily universal.

154
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:27,370
They often they depend on the stress situation that you're sort of working on here,

155
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:35,110
whereas your coping style tends to be a more stable characteristic across individuals and can be a little more generalized.

156
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:45,850
So dispositional coping styles are typically characterized as either being optimistic or pessimistic expectancy of outcomes,

157
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,580
as well as how we seek out information.

158
00:19:49,120 --> 00:20:00,010
So information seeking can be you know, if you if you are thinking about how one seeks out information related to their dispositional coping style,

159
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:11,290
it can either be monitoring or blunt it. So monitoring is those who really seek out information and wanting refers to avoiding confusion.

160
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:17,290
You may not have a high need to know, and that's the way they more generally cope with stressors.

161
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:20,469
I just I don't need I don't need to know about it.

162
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:26,140
I don't need information about resources to figure it out.

163
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,630
They just sort of block it out and that's considered.

164
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:36,969
And then we have social support down there, and I'm going to unpack that a little more next week.

165
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:40,030
So I'm just going to keep that a little more general here.

166
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:51,110
So social support can influence beliefs about one's ability to cope with the situation and manage difficult emotions.

167
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:59,360
And it can also serve as a mechanism for downward comparisons, comparing ourselves to someone who is worse off.

168
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:07,790
And when we do that, it increases our self-efficacy and increase our likelihood of active coping strategies.

169
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:12,859
Rather than working in a supportive environment can also protect against stress

170
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:16,730
by providing opportunities to explore different sort of coping options.

171
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,760
And social support also helps us promote active coping.

172
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:31,010
So now comes when we adapt to a stressor outcomes.

173
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:37,250
We can expect that related to our emotional wellbeing, our functional status and our health behaviors.

174
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:46,290
So. So how we cope essentially influences the psychological and physical health outcomes.

175
00:21:46,290 --> 00:21:56,270
That's essentially what this model's telling us. And the three main categories of outcomes, again, emotional well-being, health, David.

176
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:10,380
And. And recent studies show that reactions to stress may affect health status through physiological processes, immune and nervous system responses,

177
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:16,860
and how behaviors such as seeking care and communicating with our health care providers are adhering to treatment.

178
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:24,420
Recommendations may be influenced by both their physical limitations and by emotional reactions.

179
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:33,570
So again, these outcomes are essentially related to how we cope with different types of stressors.

180
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:43,820
So let's sort of walk through this model again with the story of my father.

181
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:48,330
So I'm thinking about a stressor and particular illness.

182
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:54,000
So about eight years ago, my dad got Guillain Barre Disease.

183
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:59,850
What that is, is a pretty rare neurological condition,

184
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:07,740
which results in my rapid onset muscle weakness as a result of damage to the peripheral nervous system.

185
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:13,049
People don't know a lot about how it's really caused,

186
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:21,570
but essentially it's your immune system sort of attacking yourself and your nerves and then sort of starts to damage your muscle function.

187
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,440
Some say it's triggered, it could be triggered by an infection.

188
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,460
But for him, we really didn't know where he could have gotten this.

189
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:37,070
It was just all of a sudden he like sort of lost control of his muscles.

190
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:49,350
And luckily, my mom was able to get him to the E.R. before it started affecting his breathing muscles, which would have landed him in the ICU.

191
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:52,950
And he would have had to have, like, assisted breathing that they were able to stabilize.

192
00:23:52,950 --> 00:24:02,970
Then by the time they stabilized, then he basically lost all control over the design of his legs.

193
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,540
He really couldn't eat himself or do anything.

194
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:14,520
So, so, so in this age, when I sort of think about my dad and I walk through this model, I really think about the stressor.

195
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:22,620
It was this illness that suddenly came on. And you know, what I think about is primary appraisal of this stressor.

196
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:26,190
It was challenging, very severe and really bad.

197
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,690
He couldn't work anymore and he lost all independence.

198
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:38,610
He couldn't even feed himself. And he essentially interfered with everything he did on a daily basis.

199
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,290
And he couldn't really comprehend how this happened to him since it's so rare.

200
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:53,669
So he was really fixated a lot on the console focus, which caused a lot of distress for him in terms of, you know, how did this happen to me?

201
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:59,440
How does this happen? And people just don't know a lot about how the brain happens.

202
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,889
So it's hard to engage in any sort of prevention around it.

203
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:10,020
So there was a lot of causal focus and then secondary appraisal.

204
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:14,400
Remember that thinking about assessment of our coping resources.

205
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,110
So my dad's assessment of his coping resources and options,

206
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:26,760
he didn't perceive control over his situation because his doctor told him he would make a full recovery eventually,

207
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,650
but he had no control over his emotions. He became really depressed.

208
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,310
He cried a lot. It was a very slow recovery, so it was really hard to see progress.

209
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:46,560
And it took him about two and a half years to really bring back all of his muscle strength again and walk again.

210
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:53,280
So that's just, you know, on a day to day basis, over two years, you just it's really hard to see that sort of progress.

211
00:25:54,360 --> 00:26:00,680
And then, you know, when we think about self-efficacy and utilizing as coping resources and, you know,

212
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:07,290
his family, he really appreciated that everyone was around to support him and he felt a lot of guilt for this.

213
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:14,490
Our sacrifices my sisters and I and my mom were making related to taking care of them.

214
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:25,139
But in general, I would say his self-efficacy with his coping resources, you know, we were pretty stable.

215
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:32,070
So he had a lot of confidence that we were there to support him in his recovery.

216
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:39,750
So when we think about coping efforts, problem management, so he found that he had a lot of nerve pain.

217
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:46,120
When you're getting back, your muscles experience a substantial amount of nerve pain.

218
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,410
And when we think of problem management related to his illness,

219
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:56,990
he found a lot of tricks for handling his pains and utilized strategies his doctors and his physical therapist gave him.

220
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:02,950
Then in terms of emotional regulation, I would say that was totally low.

221
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:11,470
He would cry a lot. You lost his appetite. You lost a lot of weight and avoided some of his doctor recommendations around his diet.

222
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:18,660
But so I would say emotional regulation was pretty low.

223
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:23,160
I didn't feel like he had a lot of control over how he dealt with.

224
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:29,919
Whenever we think about meeting base coping, he's not religious.

225
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,080
So to rely on religion to help with finding any sort of meaning.

226
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:41,350
He would make goals for himself and positive events made him handle his emotions better.

227
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:46,270
So during those events he became a grandfather for the first time.

228
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:58,450
So that was a sort of nice event that gave him a little bit of meaning based coping in terms of thinking about his recovery.

229
00:27:58,870 --> 00:28:07,930
And then for us, social support was really huge. So he had my mom, he had my sisters, his friends call him all the time and was busy all the time.

230
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:12,340
And, you know, he also did a little bit of social comparison.

231
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:18,190
So I remember one time I was in the hospital with him and, you know, this isn't funny,

232
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:26,950
but it's just it's an example of social comparison where, you know, he's lying in the hospital bed, has no to move his arms, legs, nothing.

233
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:33,520
And then there was some plane had gone down in Asia.

234
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:37,480
I forgot which one it is. It was like eight years ago.

235
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:44,080
Everyone died on the plane. You saw that on the news and thought, well, I am better off than those people.

236
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:54,579
That that is technically social comparison. It's a you know, it's it's a tragedy what happened to everyone on that plane.

237
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,500
But that was a comparison you made.

238
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:07,120
I am better off than those people because I am still alive, even though I have no sort of control over my arms or I can really do anything.

239
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:17,319
And so, you know, his recovery took a little longer than I anticipated.

240
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:24,459
But like in about a year and a half, two years later, he was walking again in better spirits and sort of back to normal.

241
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:36,910
We luckily didn't develop any other health issues, but, you know, he ended up eventually going back to work, driving again, gardening.

242
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:44,470
So it was a normal life again. And, you know, it took a while, but he was able to recover from that stress again.

243
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:50,620
You know, I think a lot of these mediating processes really help you think about, I think.

244
00:29:52,570 --> 00:29:57,280
So many questions about this model before we talk about intervention.

245
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:17,050
So before we consider an intervention or any sort of one on one counseling related to stress management, measurement becomes really important.

246
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:25,629
The typical approach has been to assess how the person perceives their stressors and how they evaluate and respond to those stressors.

247
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:30,130
And there are tons and tons of tools out there that help us do that.

248
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,670
So really, there's no need to reinvent the wheel there.

249
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:43,480
There's also this need to also think about your unit of analysis or you thinking about a person and their stressor.

250
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:49,330
Are you thinking about stress of a community and what that community experiences?

251
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,099
So you want someone to really think about that unit of analysis.

252
00:30:54,100 --> 00:31:00,100
So the actual model of stress and coping doesn't necessarily have to be an individual level model.

253
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:10,960
I walk you through an individual level example where it can also be applied on a higher level level, including more people.

254
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:21,510
So the goals of stress management interventions are there really to improve coping, increased supportive ties and a sense of empowerment.

255
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,299
So when we talk about social support next week,

256
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:30,060
all of those tools that we're going to talk about become really important in terms of intervening on stress.

257
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:37,450
And then another goal of interventions is to reduce the impact of stressors that are physical and psychological.

258
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,070
And these goals are not only aimed at behavioral interventions,

259
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:48,360
but also policies and initiatives at the community level that aim to sort of improve our structural conditions,

260
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:58,650
that put people at risk for experiencing stress. And we'll be able to think about that a little more on Wednesday when we talk about racism and how.

261
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:08,880
So we can use a whole host of strategies and behavioral interventions to improve stress management.

262
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,020
And biofeedback and relaxation is one technique.

263
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:23,510
And what that is, is the focus is on the interplay between a biological and psychological response to stressors.

264
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,500
So during a biofeedback session, which is often done one on one,

265
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:34,230
a therapist attaches electrical sensors to different parts of the body in these centers.

266
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:41,720
These sensors sort of monitor your physiological state, and this information is fed back to you, the accused,

267
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:47,219
which is like a big silver flashlight and then sleep that teaches you to change or

268
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,840
control your body's physiological reactions by sort of changing your thoughts,

269
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:58,889
emotions or behavior and how the condition for which you sought treatment in

270
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,820
the first place when you when you sort of engage in new biofeedback sessions.

271
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:14,069
And then we can also use relaxation techniques. And this is an alternative response to fight or flight to counteract the effects of stress.

272
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:18,390
And this can include things like your diagnosis or relaxation training.

273
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:24,450
And then finally, cognitive behavioral interventions.

274
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:28,049
And these can just look very, very different.

275
00:33:28,050 --> 00:33:37,590
And I think over time they've evolved into very creative ways of delivering cognitive behavioral therapy beyond just sort of one on one counseling.

276
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:45,090
So a lot of different ways that cognitive behavioral therapy shows promise from a public health perspective

277
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:54,300
and sort of scaling up this course intervention strategy to a larger segment of the population.

278
00:33:54,930 --> 00:34:00,240
So cognitive behavioral interventions can also be used for stress management.

279
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:07,020
And it's a form of treatment that really focuses on the relationship between people's thoughts, feelings and their behaviors.

280
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,700
And it's often used to treat a variety of mental health conditions,

281
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:19,590
but it essentially works by exploring patterns of thinking that lead to self-destructive actions.

282
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,600
And the beliefs that drive these thoughts.

283
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:30,240
And people in cognitive behavioral therapy really aims to sort of modify those patterns of thinking and coping.

284
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:39,449
And with stress, the same logic applies. So cognitive behavioral therapy interventions really aim to achieve a more accurate primary

285
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:45,959
appraisal of the stressor and evaluate their coping resources to enhance as necessary.

286
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:56,930
So really tries to get a better appraisal of that stressor for folks when the thinking patterns may not be aligned with.

287
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:08,640
And then when we think about the structural and community level interventions, you know, the goals are really to reduce exposure to toxins,

288
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,870
stress and trauma and really try to create more trauma informed services for

289
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:19,089
communities and really think about local monitoring and response capacity making,

290
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:24,549
environmental modifications and setting and monitoring public health schools.

291
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:35,650
And this can also include legislation as well. So when we think about intervening on stress from a community or structural perspective,

292
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:44,980
these are all sort of strategies that are used, you know, in tandem with each other.

293
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:54,610
And this is often SAMHSA, sort of the federal body that has a lot of best practice recommendations.

294
00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:02,550
It sort of often falls under the umbrella of sort of trauma informed care and trauma informed interventions.

295
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:11,400
So there are tons and tons of stress management interventions out there.

296
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:18,330
And these are different types of questions you might ask if you're, you know,

297
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:25,229
maybe your group is thinking about intervening on stress as part of your project.

298
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:32,790
And if that's the case, where do you start? And you want to ask yourself these sorts of questions, what kind of stress situation is this?

299
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:37,140
What culture are we working on? And who exactly is the population?

300
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,420
What intervention activities might be taxing prior evidence?

301
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,690
Again, there's so much out there on stress management that you don't necessarily need to reinvent the wheel.

302
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:53,489
So you can think about bringing in a lot of the different strategies that I talked

303
00:36:53,490 --> 00:37:00,270
about and creating a program or a package around that for your population of interest.

304
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:07,500
And again, what can be adapted from existing interventions that might fit the situation better.

305
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:21,510
So I've talked about what I've talked about so far is with stress is really

306
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:26,729
based on objective stressors and is probably primarily rooted in psychology.

307
00:37:26,730 --> 00:37:37,590
So the psychological perspective about discipline, sociology as a discipline is really focused on people and their interaction with social structures.

308
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,280
And the sociological view of stress is that a significant amount of stress that people experience,

309
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:51,660
that psychological models don't account for, come from our social structures and our systems of social stratification.

310
00:37:52,350 --> 00:38:00,060
So that's a sociological view of stress that the transactional model stress and coping didn't really account for.

311
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,540
When I went through that bottom line, it really addressed many factors that may have been crossing your mind.

312
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:12,060
What about all of our social systems that induce stress on communities and people?

313
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:20,310
And these factors can impact or moderate each phase of the general stress model that we just walk through.

314
00:38:21,570 --> 00:38:29,549
And so this should can be considered a more comprehensive approach to really understanding the stress process.

315
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:34,740
When we think about our social structures and systems of social stratification that

316
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:39,700
may influence all aspects of that generation model of stress and coping modeling.

317
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:46,470
So things I'm referring to when I say social structures and systems of social stratification,

318
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:52,889
I'm talking about things like racism, sexism, homophobia in general discrimination.

319
00:38:52,890 --> 00:39:08,650
And all of these can impact multiple things, which is. So articulations of minority stress are fairly recent compared to more general stress models.

320
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:21,940
But the field has evolved and we do have a model in the literature focused on minority stress and this comes from the fields of sociology.

321
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:26,290
And so this is the minority stress model for one of your readings.

322
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:33,790
And this and in this paper was this because it was specifically focused on sexual and gender minority populations.

323
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,860
And it shows us that minority stress really situates itself in general.

324
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:50,290
Environmental circumstances and minority status in the context of this environment lead to different sort of stressors such as general discrimination,

325
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:53,830
general stress discrimination, internalized processes.

326
00:39:54,280 --> 00:40:01,389
And the overlap means that sort of there's a really close three points with each other.

327
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:07,120
So several factors can sort of facilitate thing and can be used as affective interventions.

328
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:14,559
So, you know, when I look at this, I definitely see areas of the transactional model of stress and coping,

329
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:27,639
but it takes into account some antecedents to how how our environment may induce some of these general stressors,

330
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:34,300
especially as it relates to being potentially a minoritized individual.

331
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:44,510
Any questions about any of the stress models we talked about.

332
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:54,139
So the first one was more from the psychology discipline, and this one is from a sociological perspective.

333
00:40:54,140 --> 00:41:01,520
And, you know, that same core that I talked about in the slide one stress assessment is proofing and outcomes.

334
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:12,409
You see that here. But this takes into account how our environment and especially our social environment might impact stressors as well,

335
00:41:12,410 --> 00:41:20,870
which is important to acknowledge because that that could very well be an important target for intervention.

336
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:37,010
Okay. So. So when we think about interventions related to.

337
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:44,000
Um, subjective stress.

338
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:48,350
We really want to change the appraisal process of coping with adversity.

339
00:41:49,130 --> 00:41:52,340
We think about the transactional or the minority stress model.

340
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:58,340
An objective is really, again, altering the stress inducing environment and reduce exposure to stress.

341
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:13,040
So, Sudhir, you really think this is really up here is really more subject to changing and for assessment and coping.

342
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:19,440
This is subjective stress and objective stress is really focusing on preparing an environment.

343
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,019
Think. Okay.

344
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:40,700
So let's do an activity and sort of apply these concepts and see if we can identify and sort of place these different constraints in an example.

345
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:51,979
So on canvas, under today's session I posted a reading and it's focused on the aftermath of

346
00:42:51,980 --> 00:43:00,130
911 and people going back to work after experiencing that very traumatic event.

347
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:10,070
So they did a series of focus groups with some people in that particular workplace,

348
00:43:10,070 --> 00:43:17,540
and I thought this was a nice example in terms of being able to think about the different ways you see the

349
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:25,640
transactional model of stress and coping and so on highlighted within the findings of these focus groups,

350
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:33,960
and also give you an opportunity to sort of critique the use of this model and springboard in looking at these questions.

351
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:37,879
So go ahead. You don't have to read the full article,

352
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:44,810
but I sort of indicate in our core activity sheet where to sort of focus your efforts

353
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:49,160
and then work with some of the folks around you to work through some of the.

354
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:22,170
It's. You.

355
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,950
Yes. Yes.

356
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:25,590
And. Yes.

357
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:14,670
Which means something. Me?

358
00:48:04,690 --> 00:49:56,400
It's. So if you get.

359
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:17,820
Contest. Which is a great thing because.

360
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:35,390
I imagine. Quality.

361
00:50:41,360 --> 00:51:18,410
There's just. We're not.

362
00:51:20,050 --> 00:51:38,680
It's. Thanks.

363
00:51:49,030 --> 00:52:08,360
Like average to discuss this I'm curious about your that's because you don't just try to constructions people

364
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:30,770
just because it is interesting just as much as I do it it's just you know if they come from I don't know,

365
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:43,069
like you talk to me sometimes it's like very easy to cook up a little bit.

366
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:50,930
I'm not comfortable. I don't it out like that.

367
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:58,730
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

368
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:20,739
Look, I wouldn't want to be an import some 23 times so that she could sit for 20 hours.

369
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:28,180
And, you know, I think that they said that the manager screwed the mother.

370
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:36,740
And what if this happens again in our workplaces like it again was a huge stressor for a manager.

371
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:47,550
I know what I was looking at this Mickey Rooney, for instance.

372
00:53:47,640 --> 00:54:01,060
Right. So I was like a section of the public system.

373
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:08,390
So in closing, I was like, you know, what was it like for you?

374
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:21,700
It was a weird yeah, I guess that's the way she looked at the time.

375
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:38,080
So we looked at it and it was like we were like actually trying to identify her.

376
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:52,990
Like we have hundreds of families like this and I just get into the topic and

377
00:54:54,520 --> 00:55:04,960
one of the things we're doing is why were you going to I think do you remember?

378
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:10,600
It was like number two, straight line across the street is not around.

379
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:16,299
Somebody fire on a plane. And that's what my mom was like.

380
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,790
I don't remember that I was barely alive.

381
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:28,680
My friends were the ones where she was like, Oh, and well, she was, she was she was in college, so she did the dishes.

382
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:41,139
And so she remembers like everything immediately that, oh, like, I don't believe, like I can say, all right, she can take time.

383
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:44,080
But it's actually these are the only people working.

384
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:56,710
So we got really, really lucky because my friends, like I said, how dare you like babies to be like the same thing?

385
00:55:57,250 --> 00:56:20,470
And I was working with all these other people that are like, you know, I think that would be something like this is not true.

386
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:38,739
But they were like, I wrote down like I could, you know, I could say that there was nothing.

387
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:48,430
But actually, you know, they would you know, there was nothing.

388
00:56:49,270 --> 00:57:12,400
Yeah, they don't have any training. There was no drama, no excuse for the whole time.

389
00:57:12,730 --> 00:57:16,210
I was surprised to see.

390
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:23,010
Yeah, I felt like there was only because like because I would I was like that was fun.

391
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:36,320
And I started going to those times more than 20 years ago.

392
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:44,820
I think, like, I know this almost.

393
00:57:50,180 --> 00:58:10,009
Excuse me, but she just told me not to talk about like we used to.

394
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:17,420
Like, I think I might actually ask something to you guys.

395
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:28,660
I'd like you to do the same thing.

396
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:44,600
I wouldn't be surprised if Barry says she wants to interact with the town hall meeting, like, oh, why do I have to ask you this question?

397
00:58:45,740 --> 00:58:57,290
I do not agree with you this morning.

398
00:58:59,300 --> 00:59:10,730
Yeah, I. Yeah, he's the one that's like you want us to tyrant.

399
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:15,800
And I think that.

400
00:59:16,670 --> 00:59:23,380
So you're okay just yet.

401
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:34,820
The process is never explained, so I don't know a lot of the time, you and I.

402
00:59:35,030 --> 00:59:41,930
But maybe our plan is the way they really want.

403
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:52,760
Yeah, I like getting out of my house. If I like it. Yeah, I'd like to meet someone.

404
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,650
You know, it's like house, and you're like. She's.

405
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:04,080
She's like a big emotional aspect.

406
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:13,460
She was telling me she didn't want some rice, but she was like, why not?

407
01:00:13,980 --> 01:00:20,450
Yeah, because we like, you know, social terror.

408
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:24,120
I don't know. What would you say to her?

409
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:28,100
I think most kids got sent to our parents.

410
01:00:29,510 --> 01:00:39,800
You know, I don't know.

411
01:00:39,920 --> 01:01:05,650
We'll just have to position to be able to make the rules. So actually talking about how years of college.

412
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:12,290
Yeah. How society. Let me see.

413
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:21,280
I don't know.

414
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:24,719
I don't think about know. I got what it is.

415
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:39,980
It's like I know what it means. And I would say, yeah, I mean I wasn't that it doesn't really matter to you.

416
01:01:40,190 --> 01:02:16,280
Like I'll let you take my time and something that but I really want to write this on a piece of paper that says,

417
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:34,490
you know what, I, I don't want to read my far as going to be that guy.

418
01:02:36,740 --> 01:02:44,600
I don't cannot seem to provide any kind of stressors because it's like you.

419
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:51,010
What I mean is that literature says that she was reflecting.

420
01:02:51,760 --> 01:03:16,980
I want to concentrate on the table because I think I'll bring you or I'll take a listen to me because I know that I just don't think that way.

421
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:20,230
I look like that's not what I look like.

422
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:34,590
I think she was just wondering if there was more like a job on the side.

423
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:37,390
You know, I see.

424
01:03:37,390 --> 01:03:52,150
You know, I think I think this happened in 2001 because two planes were hijacked and looking into the World Trade Center towers in New York City.

425
01:03:52,570 --> 01:04:02,590
And I realize how old I am, and maybe some of you guys may not have remembered this or experience this or it's totally unknown.

426
01:04:02,590 --> 01:04:05,660
Context should have provided a little more context.

427
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:12,070
But that's very different than that.

428
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:20,260
Yeah, again, I apologize for that, but I hope you and your three really mean something from the article.

429
01:04:20,740 --> 01:04:29,880
And I remember I was in high school when this happened and literally the countryside and it's a very yeah,

430
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,580
I don't remember a lot of things, but that's something I vividly remember.

431
01:04:34,330 --> 01:04:38,260
But that was a big mistake on my where that was suddenly realized.

432
01:04:38,260 --> 01:04:46,510
All the politicians say, well, give a little more context by giving us a historical example.

433
01:04:47,710 --> 01:04:50,740
I think a lot of us know about love.

434
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,550
Not all of us were cognizant of it. Yeah.

435
01:04:54,760 --> 01:05:00,700
Yeah. And I realize. So I'm not as young as I used to be, so.

436
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:05,630
Yeah, I would definitely like to provide a little more context.

437
01:05:06,370 --> 01:05:12,370
And in being able to walk through this example with some of your peers,

438
01:05:12,370 --> 01:05:19,719
what are some things that jumped out at you in terms of thinking about some mediating processes or even just thinking about the

439
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:26,380
stress or what was the stressor from the employee's perspective and what were the stressors from the employer's perspective when.

440
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:35,980
You know, we're getting very literal with something. This was a stressor.

441
01:05:36,540 --> 01:05:37,680
We're talking about your.

442
01:05:44,520 --> 01:05:53,190
I think like for the employees, the stressor was like returning to work and like trying to do your job and just like going on.

443
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:59,250
And then for like the employer is it's like their stressor was how do I.

444
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:06,160
Mediate the situation for the employees will ultimately increase.

445
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,010
You know, how do I support employees?

446
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:23,800
And so what were some mediating processes that reduce sort of adverse outcomes of the stress that you know, this from their perspective?

447
01:06:25,210 --> 01:06:28,590
Like some bad stuff in the middle? Yeah.

448
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:35,410
Like a lot of them appreciated a rapid return to work, which was probably social support and like causal purpose.

449
01:06:36,340 --> 01:06:50,860
Yeah. So of course, the focus, social support and then come back to work reducing the impact of that stress on the job and health outcomes.

450
01:06:51,640 --> 01:07:04,750
What else? Yeah.

451
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:12,630
Well, some of the employees perspective, they recognize that being at home kind of led to the isolated and also they didn't necessarily understand.

452
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:17,170
So I guess like going to work helps a lot with regulating their emotions like depression.

453
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:27,860
Yeah. So being able to go to work helps with this emotional regulation in some sense, in tandem with social support.

454
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:35,470
And so those processes sort of working together. What about employers?

455
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:49,540
No emotional well-being for themselves, but also the employees, other people around them.

456
01:07:51,820 --> 01:08:01,630
So can you say a little more about that? Yeah. So it seems like so for a person to be in a leadership like minded manager position,

457
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:08,800
you are responsible for the group of people and you're very aware that those people have been affected by this figure,

458
01:08:08,810 --> 01:08:17,140
that you yourself have also been affected by this about whether or not like you are missing like a person because they died in 911,

459
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:26,290
but like it's because of it, like you were affected. And so like managing their own emotions because when somebody is in a leadership position,

460
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:31,760
there's like this social of understanding that they're supposed to be the person you can support.

461
01:08:31,780 --> 01:08:36,640
And like they have, you can, like, lean on them in those times.

462
01:08:37,270 --> 01:08:46,750
Well, that's where employees can be the ones who are more likely to like, express like, I guess sensitive emotions like crying or anger.

463
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:51,580
Somebody a leadership position has to be kind of like not like that.

464
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:55,509
But same time, like there are some employees who are like, would have a nice test.

465
01:08:55,510 --> 01:09:02,620
You're like my manager, like go to these like sessions so like emotional selves but also for the other ones that make sense.

466
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:14,500
Yeah. So I guess it was sort of a combination of, you know, when you think about their employers assessment of their coping resources,

467
01:09:14,980 --> 01:09:24,010
sort of really drawing on that to be able to support other people by from the employee's perspective,

468
01:09:24,010 --> 01:09:30,219
they would have liked to possibly see their employers sort of going through the same process.

469
01:09:30,220 --> 01:09:33,760
But from what I hear you saying, it seems a little invisible.

470
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:38,620
So some of this you probably don't even know really, you know,

471
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:47,140
a little bit from what was shared in the article that probably don't know as much about you as their own sort of trajectory with their coping.

472
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:56,860
So what are some practical recommendations that came out in the article in terms of addressing from my point?

473
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:14,380
They mentioned the importance of peer support versus the supports from social supports from CEOs.

474
01:10:14,650 --> 01:10:20,180
That wasn't topic. That's good.

475
01:10:21,750 --> 01:10:27,540
Yeah. So that power of peer support versus a trained provider.

476
01:10:29,010 --> 01:10:34,530
When we talk about social support next week, we'll sort of I'm like, why is that?

477
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:42,600
Why? Why was that more powerful? And then we'll have some answers for you next week when we talk about support and the power of peers.

478
01:10:44,670 --> 01:10:54,569
Yes. It seemed like a really strong consensus for us to really return to work, but it's something that the employees all preferred benefited from,

479
01:10:54,570 --> 01:11:00,600
etc. But it made me kind of think to the beginning of the COVID pandemic why?

480
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:08,849
You know, all of a sudden we were all just at home when we were dealing with the stress and the trauma of navigating the pandemic.

481
01:11:08,850 --> 01:11:16,290
And obviously a quick return to work wasn't necessarily something that was feasible in that context,

482
01:11:16,290 --> 01:11:22,130
but it made me think about how that may have impacted people's coping with depression.

483
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:25,679
And so thinking about problem management and return to work.

484
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:36,749
And you know, what's interesting is some of it is that a lot of the literature for leadership during the COVID pandemic and trying

485
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:47,460
to support our workforce actually drew on some lessons from how folks managed 911 and return to work things.

486
01:11:47,530 --> 01:11:49,019
So kind of different things.

487
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:58,470
But they were able to glean some strategies from that time to be able to figure out how to manage an issue that, you know,

488
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,430
I think many of us are still sort of grappling with, you know,

489
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:09,629
we haven't solved return to work, but it's something that is what are you doing the workforce.

490
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:16,020
But it is. Again, some of these lessons sort of get the kind of sound that we try to figure out ways

491
01:12:16,020 --> 01:12:20,130
to make it fit into the context that we're sort of working in at the moment.

492
01:12:22,110 --> 01:12:24,780
Are there things that you think the transactional models,

493
01:12:24,780 --> 01:12:33,930
stress and coping is just not maybe adequate to think about this issue and in this article or maybe some things that might have been missing?

494
01:12:37,230 --> 01:12:46,170
Yeah. So there's been some research on what they call trauma induced growth, which is kind of the opposite of post-traumatic stress disorder.

495
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:49,260
And they didn't really talk about it too much.

496
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:55,200
They hinted at it in the article on the idea of like adaptation is that once you go through something really traumatic,

497
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:56,879
you can respond in multiple ways.

498
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:04,230
And one of them being like, you can come out of it significantly more resilient, significant with significantly better coping strategies.

499
01:13:05,190 --> 01:13:09,629
And so the idea being, if you can get past that trauma, you can grow from it,

500
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:14,790
you can become stronger, you can become more resilient to future events that come on later.

501
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:20,909
So, yeah, that's great. So this model we talked about didn't address resiliency at all,

502
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:26,399
or even how much our coping resources might have been enhanced by going through a

503
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:33,690
particular experience or a stressful experience in particular is definitely an

504
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:38,909
important element missing from this model that it's not necessarily the other

505
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:43,820
coping and assessment resources are just Band-Aids that we put on our stressor.

506
01:13:43,830 --> 01:13:48,480
But they could be things that sort of carry us forward in, you know,

507
01:13:48,570 --> 01:13:55,620
maintaining our own outcomes of interests sort of beyond a particular intervention or even a particular event.

508
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,800
So thank you for sharing that. That's a really important observation.

509
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:03,570
What about some other things that you felt might be missing?

510
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:17,570
Yeah I could see that maybe underlies and if it isn't explicitly discussed is just like the importance of the time being.

511
01:14:18,340 --> 01:14:24,730
And someone mentioned early on, when someone dies, you need time for healing.

512
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:32,170
And yeah, I feel like. A lot of stress and coping.

513
01:14:33,430 --> 01:14:39,579
Like it required. Like you need both like active coping to kind of get to a place of healing,

514
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:45,820
but also feeling like the time and like what that coping is like looks differently as time goes on.

515
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:49,899
Yeah. So that's, that's a really important element.

516
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:57,850
It's like it's sort of this model doesn't necessarily give us sort of seems like stress comes on and we have to do something about it right

517
01:14:57,850 --> 01:15:09,370
away and hopefully something gets better after it and it doesn't take to account just time itself or space or whatever you want to call it,

518
01:15:09,610 --> 01:15:20,010
the same sort of or indicator or or second way so.

519
01:15:21,620 --> 01:15:24,630
So on Wednesday, we're going to talk about racism in health.

520
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:29,950
So what I wanted to do today was give you some little bit of a foundational

521
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:38,469
understanding of just what stress is and how sociology thinks about minority stress.

522
01:15:38,470 --> 01:15:47,020
And so on Wednesday, we're going to unpack racism in health and what that actually looks like and how people are studying it,

523
01:15:47,060 --> 01:16:21,750
measuring, intervening on it. So hashtag of all your life and your school learning, I know it really needs to happen without any of that.

524
01:16:22,070 --> 01:16:27,650
I think the whole thing I. I am not.

525
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:43,710
I thought that I was going to use this by myself.

526
01:16:47,310 --> 01:17:01,460
I was like, you know, I like that one.

527
01:17:03,210 --> 01:17:11,550
I don't know what I look like.

528
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:37,650
I was like, not sure, you know, that kind of like a reaction to all the social research papers.

529
01:17:39,800 --> 01:17:46,530
Oh, thanks for one of the.

530
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:53,390
I thought you were like, oh, that.

531
01:17:53,510 --> 01:18:00,280
You'll give us some time to start.

532
01:18:00,580 --> 01:18:17,520
I don't really know how this works, because I want you to drop your answer.

533
01:18:17,610 --> 01:18:22,780
I'm sorry. I totally forgot to, guys.

534
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:29,880
She has a very typical here to say.

535
01:18:31,260 --> 01:18:34,320
Yeah. Oh, yeah. I didn't know you guys like that.

536
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:45,240
So that was that. I think the ice cream day was an alcohol, but I'll call you later on.

537
01:18:45,380 --> 01:18:48,120
Yeah, but I mean, I feel like it.

538
01:18:48,120 --> 01:19:01,200
You know, I got a word, you know, if they were going to make friends and I, you know, I'm like, yeah, I like the cross.

539
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:05,310
Thank you. They'll try to match day. Oh, yeah. The Michigan.

540
01:19:06,630 --> 01:19:11,820
Okay. Because I know I need to get more Michigan stuff.

541
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:19,410
I went to Costco's. It was like $50 for the hoodie. Like, I can get to this looks like a picture of being like the public health, let's say.

542
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:25,290
Yeah. Like one person with immaculate diversity told you.

543
01:19:26,370 --> 01:19:32,070
She she goes, she goes, this is your mom's diversity.

544
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:36,540
And we should be like, why so very.

545
01:19:37,230 --> 01:19:41,610
But it's okay because then they're like, because you really, like, questionable.

546
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:46,650
Questionable. I thought I thought I heard some printing going on different areas of this.

547
01:19:46,650 --> 01:19:50,540
I know the upstairs was in my apartment.

548
01:19:50,730 --> 01:19:59,700
It doesn't matter. Exam open note last week I wasn't gonna let me go take notes, but it's no fun stuff.

549
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:05,130
They took a couple months, like I just wrote whatever she. I wrote some of the stuff she said that wasn't on the slide.

550
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:10,229
Yeah, I know me. I just. I want to go. I love those smart.

551
01:20:10,230 --> 01:20:14,670
And I'm also going to start, you know, I don't just put it in the PowerPoint.

552
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:21,180
Yeah, I just write it on a PowerPoint, slides halfway through the semester and I'm over here like, yeah, most probably just there were only seven.

553
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:26,640
It's too late now getting to. Oh I don't get tickets.

554
01:20:27,270 --> 01:20:35,430
You think they're going mad. So the ticket I got a ticket like because I wasn't adjacent to the thing, but I was going to Iowa, so.

555
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:45,180
Yeah, right. Because I parked outside. Like when you watch those tickets are 15, but then every two weeks it goes something like $45.

556
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:52,650
Why did you how did you pay when I was 15? Because actually, if you like and I figure that I got to pay in the next day.

557
01:20:53,460 --> 01:20:58,320
Yeah. I wish tickets were like the fix up, but it was it was only 15.

558
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:04,080
I was a man because I was on the side. Oh, well, now that you keep pushing, it's going to go up to 6345.

559
01:21:04,590 --> 01:21:11,710
Well, next week it's only 645 for next week because it was 35 my last match on Friday.

560
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:17,549
Okay, so compare. I know she was in. I know I don't.

561
01:21:17,550 --> 01:21:21,720
I should do it before you know it. It's going to be it's going to be 85.

562
01:21:21,870 --> 01:21:25,090
Yeah. It's going to catch up on you and you're going to be like, Let's go.

563
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:32,280
So I got to. I've got a bias that's going about this on Wednesday, too.

564
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:36,830
I did. I know the buyers like them. I don't know either. I text or answer said, Oh damn, we just had to tomorrow.

565
01:21:36,850 --> 01:21:41,020
And she was like, No, we don't. And I was like, What do you mean? She's like, We have an exam. I said, Oh, that's not good.

566
01:21:41,050 --> 01:21:45,530
I said, Wait a minute, man. Did you see what I said about that voice?

567
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:51,250
No, no, no, no, no, no. Not necessarily. She'll be right here.

568
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:59,440
Yeah. It. Since we're off the tracks.

569
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:06,540
Are you okay?

570
01:22:07,070 --> 01:22:13,930
No, no. He loves it. Y'all got it. As soon as I knew it, you know, I was talking about the end developer,

571
01:22:13,930 --> 01:22:17,890
Oklahoma stuff opening up my MacBook because it's like, dude, I'm like, oh, my God.

572
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:23,889
No. Looked over shoes. And I was like, Damn, she saw a marketing visit because I cracked up.

573
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:29,500
I was like, Oh, it's so for I was like, you were like said, don't do it.

574
01:22:29,500 --> 01:22:35,680
And I was like, It's just local law, and that's just my number.

575
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:39,610
Who what are we supposed to do last night?

576
01:22:40,150 --> 01:22:44,110
But you got to go. Oh, the girls are sleeping.

577
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:48,219
I was not sleeping. You're going to say no.

578
01:22:48,220 --> 01:22:51,820
You're not going to the game. Are you guys one of the innocents? Was it this Saturday?

579
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:56,230
You're going out after an apple with anything?

580
01:22:57,040 --> 01:23:00,510
I'm coming. I'm doing anything. This is cute. Thank you.

581
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:04,230
I did all my party mission games, undergrad. I really need to go to one.

582
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:08,680
I'll do this all the way. See, I did that on iPhone a lot.

583
01:23:09,130 --> 01:23:12,310
I did it. I went, I want to leave my brother.

584
01:23:12,310 --> 01:23:15,140
Well, it's not so. It was mine. A little crazy. Yeah.

585
01:23:15,190 --> 01:23:24,720
I mean, that's one of the reasons I was friends with people and to do but like also I was just like they're like, oh.

586
01:23:24,850 --> 01:23:33,550
So their idea of fun and our idea of fun is to talk to their, you know, what I'm talking about.

587
01:23:33,590 --> 01:23:41,020
And I tell her this all the time to be like I always go to to someone, you know, let's on that same sex and cocaine,

588
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:50,510
the first excuse is only bar because every other bars they do they really do that one a line Alina what we went to level she's high and

589
01:23:50,920 --> 01:24:01,180
like this like this much things like this is as this reeks you know I'm never gonna so I would never step foot inside so she's like,

590
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:01,900
oh, it's a friend, Abby,

591
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:12,399
like your phone or my what happens where my patron and sometimes they're like your talking because it's a yeah emphasis I told her I spoke with

592
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:20,100
said she can and I would do that was so fun most days because it's a lot of diverse I guess I I've heard to be more diversity here but it's well,

593
01:24:20,290 --> 01:24:22,329
it was more diversity in Kentucky than here.

594
01:24:22,330 --> 01:24:29,470
And I'm like how any of my wife and who I was in Louisville not like but of our population are very small and as well.

595
01:24:29,590 --> 01:24:35,350
Yeah, really, I was expecting diversity from you, what you did from Masters.

596
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:38,590
I've seen a lot of us like for orientation over university.

597
01:24:38,620 --> 01:24:42,210
Oh yeah. For our program is a lot like a lot.

598
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:45,990
I don't see that many Arabs. I do a lot.

599
01:24:46,030 --> 01:24:49,600
I see a lot at UMass. I've never seen this much in my life. Like growing up in Chicago.

600
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:52,629
I didn't go, I'll drop you to in state. I don't want to see them.

601
01:24:52,630 --> 01:24:58,851
I am good. I, I work at the multicultural center. I see diversity, but I see a lot of Arabs have never seen so.
