1
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,670
Okay. Good morning, everyone. Morning. We are going to start today's lecture.

2
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,020
That is a recording, this recording. Okay.

3
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,450
First, before we start, I got the semester is going well.

4
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:44,680
This is our fourth week of the semester. First, let me ask you, how do you feel the homework was too far, too easy about right.

5
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,390
I see. So. All right. Okay. Yes.

6
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:57,970
The idea the homework is to try to evaluate the material that we are going to discuss every week.

7
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:07,450
Then the last one was about population, genetics, evolution, trying to recapitulate some of those topics.

8
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:14,110
Um, I will write the homework during the weekend week class during the week.

9
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:22,300
Also I will put both and I said key and then we can discuss the the answers next week.

10
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:35,110
Today we are going to discuss that repeating hypotheses are also we are going to discuss the evolutionary aspects of insulin resistance.

11
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:47,320
Now if you look at my announcement from last week, we did change to they were talking about these drifting hypotheses and next week,

12
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,820
next Monday, we are going to start with the students presentations.

13
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,370
Now for the two presentations. That way this is going to work.

14
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:11,620
I will take the first half of the class I say, and I want to introduce the topic to um to maybe discuss some of the articles.

15
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:19,060
And then in the second half the student would present, um, you have a guide there that I post in campus.

16
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,149
Those are the type of point that I think they are more relevant.

17
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:36,460
I feel free to add more. BOWIS To Jane, the point that you want to discuss, but I would appreciate if, um, before your presentation, um,

18
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:45,570
meet with each of one the week before and then for example for presentation next Monday, uh, then let's,

19
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:53,800
let's set up a meeting, uh, to get to our group presentation to give you an idea and a guide.

20
00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:02,860
And then I hope to do that for, for everyone. Then, um, then every week we can set up the appointment.

21
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:16,630
I'm flexible with my time. I usually Tuesday and Thursday I would they for me to meet but we can discuss that every week before each presentation.

22
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,420
Okay. Now, just let me introduce that topic for today.

23
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:32,240
I think you are aware about the epidemic of diabetes in the world, and you can see in this graph.

24
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:44,260
This is a global incidence of diabetes. I grew that war from the 1980s up to the expected 2025.

25
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:52,060
Then you see almost a linear trend increasing that you see them with more diabetes.

26
00:03:52,990 --> 00:04:00,310
Basically, if type two diabetes, that one that is are we are having more incidence across the world.

27
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,130
You suspect it. And again, these are estimations.

28
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:16,660
He suspected that by the year 2025 will be almost 25 million new acute and new cases for diabetes in the world, 25 new cases per year.

29
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:29,650
That would mean that for 2025 would expect to have 600 millions of person with diabetes across the world.

30
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:41,560
Then this is that is this is a great problem. No economic problem, health problem, society problems for these high incidence of type two diabetes.

31
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,130
Now, again, this is we think about death,

32
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:55,820
the total death of diabetes by the year 2025 and taking the three years ahead will be more than a half a million.

33
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,220
Number of deaths per year due to diabetes all the way around.

34
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:19,030
Now, anyone knows whether there is any one knows what is done means values of daily life, daily activities of life, be it, but not quite right.

35
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:34,740
Yeah, but it related your close. Your close is are disability adjusted life years disability adjusted life and like the year because death normal day,

36
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:42,520
they don't give us all that picture or that problem because you can imagine that people with diabetes or any other chronic disease,

37
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:49,660
they are going to have disability for several years before they they die.

38
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:55,780
Then that the values what they measure is the amount of.

39
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:06,100
Of health life that is lost due to a chronic disease that is on how we try to

40
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:13,419
estimate how many years of health are lost due to this particular disease,

41
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:19,030
in this case diabetes. Then this is includes death, but also disability before death.

42
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:36,070
Then again, by the year 2025, we expect that across the world will be lost more than about 80 million years of life health at that time.

43
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:47,050
And again, you can imagine the huge impact that type two diabetes having is going to continue to have in the in the world.

44
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,170
Go back to that. Those graphs is one. Yeah.

45
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,830
And the color of these lines.

46
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,460
Yes. Blue is total diabetes.

47
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,230
Green is type one and red is type two.

48
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,800
And deaths. Yes.

49
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:14,320
The number of dead. Is that the total number of death by diabetes? The first one.

50
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,960
So the second graph or this. The deaths with this one?

51
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,150
Mm hmm. And they are a differing scale because these are the number of deaths.

52
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,410
Mm hmm. In how many. How many subject are dying per year?

53
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:38,680
Now, here, what we are measuring are number of years that are lost due to disability this years.

54
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:46,480
Yes, actually, yes. Imagine, for example, that let's say I got diabetes right now and I have complications.

55
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:54,130
And then imagine that that following five years I will be unable to walk.

56
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,680
Or maybe I just going to work for the dying uncle because of that disease.

57
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,540
Then if I can count how many time I lose in due to my problem.

58
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,710
Oh, okay. Until death. Then this is.

59
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:13,360
Then what we have here in the Y-axis is another is case that if we measure that just the number of death,

60
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:23,140
because number of death are persons that are dying per year and is the number of years that we are losing your disability.

61
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,800
But the estimated is not by estimated the lifespan based actual death.

62
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,300
This one what if we die young? Because that would be lethal here.

63
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:39,969
Exactly. Yeah, exactly. How many imagine die if I didn't have diabetes?

64
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:43,360
Let's assume they have diabetes. I hope not.

65
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,050
But assume that because of diabetes, I'm going to die five years younger.

66
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:57,730
You might do with five years counted for any but calculated by the estimated prediction.

67
00:08:57,820 --> 00:09:04,420
Exactly. Yeah. This is based on population data, for example, how many days per year?

68
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,420
So we have moved in due to diabetes, to disability,

69
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:18,249
how being in the hospital or not being able to walk that type of population's not due to complications any related to diabetes in this case.

70
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:27,220
So when the complications due to diabetes then but like COVID it hits and so many people are we call calculated by committees.

71
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:30,700
We have the data we can we can do this type of health condition. Thank you, sir.

72
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,570
You're welcome.

73
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:48,190
Now, if we just focus in the United States, we also see a huge problem and this is data from the CDC is we have by the ability, by race,

74
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:57,880
ethnicity in the United States, the ethnic group that is more affected by diabetes are American Indians and also American native.

75
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:04,329
And also we observed non-Hispanic blacks and Hispanics.

76
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:12,880
They are also have higher they have a bargain, a high burden type two diabetes compared, for example, to Asian or white Hispanic.

77
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:20,559
By still for the groups that are that they have the lowest prevalence.

78
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,800
What they believe is a huge number is still is a huge number then this is this is a problem that is affecting all races.

79
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,220
An ethnic group in the United States, even though they are a group that are more affected than others.

80
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:41,470
And here they are different reasons, access to health, socioeconomic factors that we will discuss.

81
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:46,300
Any questions so far? Feel free to ask me at any time.

82
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:56,590
The most worrisome last one or the most worrisome aspect of diabetes is that now is also affecting young.

83
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:09,499
People are now so usable type one diabetes and type two diabetes, they were usually called young, upset onset type two diabetes.

84
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,950
For that, they won an adult onset for that.

85
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:17,320
They do because it was thought that type two was only observed in adult person.

86
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:34,270
However, they see that the incidence of type two diabetes, again by race or ethnicity among in that age group, less than 19 years old here with well,

87
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:45,730
we were talking about child and teenagers and you can see for type two diabetes that

88
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:52,900
prevent that sorry this is is that incidence is very high and this is data from 22.

89
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,730
This is from total from 2017. This is a report that is data from 2012.

90
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,220
And these data these these are issue has been increasing over that years.

91
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:10,480
Then we had this huge problem that now type two diabetes is also starting very young

92
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,470
life with all the consequence that that person is going to have to prove life.

93
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:23,200
Now that leads us to this paradox.

94
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:37,540
Now, according to the data that I show you. Diabetes is a disease with a high frequency in the world affected by our reproduction.

95
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:48,040
We are talking to someone that in the last few years, people with diabetes, they are losing years of life and also they are losing use of health.

96
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,500
Also, we know that diabetes as a genetic basis.

97
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:01,200
For example, that heritability or diabetes is in there between 20 and 80%.

98
00:13:02,190 --> 00:13:11,430
Now, heritability means how much of the proportion of diabetes risk is due to genetic factors, to genetic variation.

99
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:16,920
Let me give you an example. In identical twins.

100
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:28,930
If one of the twins have Type two diabetes and for type two diabetes is one of two identical twins, type two diabetes.

101
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:34,030
The other two are 70% probability also to contact with diabetes.

102
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:41,320
No question that that means that there is a genetic component or not.

103
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,330
We don't know. We don't know. But is that identical twins?

104
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:53,740
Yes, these are identical twins. One of the things that diabetes, the other has a 70% probability of diabetes as possible.

105
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:59,680
Mm hmm. Yep. Do you see also any problem with this estimate?

106
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:11,880
Yeah. Because identical twins besides genes, they are environmental, they are an environment.

107
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,330
If it's really pure genetic, you'll be 100%.

108
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:24,450
Yes, but even if we're 100% because identical twin, they share a 100% genetic environment.

109
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:29,670
And also they share, um, utero environment.

110
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:37,410
Mm hmm. Well, now we know the exposure to the intrauterine life can affect the disease later in life.

111
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:43,570
Now, even by even taking into account that limitation of this estimate,

112
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:50,220
this point throughout is from the genetic component that they do diabetes, even if we take into account environment or environment.

113
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:59,430
But these points to a genetic component. I'm 40 psychotic twins are these are not identical twins.

114
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:10,230
They can be from the same sex are not. The concordance is 30% is still higher than the work in their population so far,

115
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:16,740
although we know more than 200 gene variants associated with type two diabetes.

116
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:23,600
Then. Now we have now we have these questions.

117
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:35,420
If they do diabetes, this harsh, harmful disease that affects survival, affects reproduction, affects health.

118
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:40,580
Why this burden exists where they have been settled.

119
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,080
Why natural selection has not eliminated type two diabetes.

120
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:49,040
Why we had these burdens in the human population.

121
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,790
Because we should expect if we have these strong natural selection,

122
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:59,360
these this eventually they are going to disappear, but rather anything that is increasing.

123
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,660
The in the incidence of type two diabetes.

124
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,420
Now, before the discussion that papers are getting a new depth,

125
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:18,879
let me talk a little bit about a different type of two type of different type of diabetes.

126
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,830
And this is a more for general types.

127
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:30,790
Our discussion today is going to be more related to type two diabetes that account for more than 90% of all cases.

128
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,940
Two other major characteristic are insulin resistance, insulin deficiency.

129
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:43,270
The older type that we will not disclose is type one diabetes.

130
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,870
That account for between 5 to 10% of all cases.

131
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:57,010
And the major characteristic is the auto immune destruction that the pancreatic beta cells are the ones that produce insulin.

132
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:07,899
Also they are gestational diabetes. And is it that type of diabetes that is present during pregnancy is observed

133
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:12,400
between 1 to 40% of all pregnancies and they are due for that to be factors.

134
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:20,680
For example, weight before pregnancy, side risk factor for gestational diabetes.

135
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:31,000
What is also important is the women that have gestational diabetes.

136
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,670
They are even higher risk to develop type two diabetes. I say after.

137
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:42,190
But not only that, the mother, but also the offspring will also be the offspring,

138
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:49,960
the higher risk of type two diabetes later in life if they their mother have gestational diabetes during pregnancy.

139
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:55,900
Now there are other type of type two diabetes. And here they are saying that they have some diabetes.

140
00:17:55,940 --> 00:18:05,080
You do, too, are viral infections that can destroy the pancreas beta cells.

141
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:12,610
Also, there are some specific disorders on pathologies that can also result on this drug film businesses.

142
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:16,870
But now our discussion would be mostly about type two diabetes.

143
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:25,750
Okay. Question So far, okay.

144
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:30,920
Then what went to discuss the restrictive hypotheses that were proposed before I?

145
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:35,920
James Neill That's cool.

146
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:46,780
Okay. Before I talk then any one explain me briefly that review hypotheses.

147
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:59,110
I'm guessing you're not going to looking to lead up to a specific in your answer right now.

148
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:20,659
And I think the basic idea is that if there was like starvation and like like if there was like dips in food access, how many did you have?

149
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,959
Like for fat accumulation?

150
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:30,000
It would have been beneficial. Mm hmm. And that would. That could carry on to.

151
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:35,230
Yeah, exactly. You hear it? Mm hmm.

152
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:43,900
Yeah. Basically, the idea is the past time, the risk of retaliation was higher than it is today.

153
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:48,670
How do you think? Modern society in Western societies?

154
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,680
Now, then, because of that and the risk of dying, of starvation,

155
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:02,050
then natural selection will favor genetic variants that will lead to fat accumulation.

156
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,500
Because you can imagine then if food was rare or not widely available.

157
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:17,770
Exactly. fluctuateD then is better to accumulate energy right now, like have food and be more able to survive if there is a starvation.

158
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:27,250
That was the idea. But but in modern society, with the plentiful food that we have now, at least in Western societies,

159
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:34,950
also feel the lack of exercise, the these barriers that were advanced that see in the past.

160
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:41,800
Now they have disadvantages. They are harmful. Hmm. That will be a causal or evolutionary mismatch.

161
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:51,790
Remember that we have upgrade wasn't active in the past, but now under the new environment, this trait or the genes would be rather harmful.

162
00:20:53,110 --> 00:21:03,670
Professor. Yes, we also read that, in fact, genetic variants conferring protection against obesity also are identified.

163
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:06,520
Yep. Yeah, we're going to discuss that later today.

164
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:13,900
I also argue that protective against diabetes and obesity they are some get into part of that they they'd rather protect.

165
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:20,710
And we also talk about animal study when they try to do this they do it gracefully.

166
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:29,350
But when we do it, we start to have more illnesses like the heart and stuff like this also happen to often to else.

167
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:35,920
But they did diet for the purpose of preventing maybe lack of food.

168
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:46,990
But when we have compared to the animals, we start to have more issues with cardio, with cardiovascular outcome.

169
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:57,400
Hmm. Now, just to talk a little bit about anything else that you see here, he was here, a professor here in the University of Michigan.

170
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,990
He worked in the Department of Human Genetics in document that medical school.

171
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:13,750
In fact, I am not completely sure, but I think the department, like human genetics here in the medical school, was the first one in the country.

172
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:24,740
Department of Human Genetics in medical schools. Wow. Now, he was a physician named Bob Model, but he did a lot of work in politics.

173
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:34,510
And based on his observations in topology, he proposed these the hypotheses.

174
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:41,200
And now we will discuss the the evidence in favor for and against all the hypotheses.

175
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:49,920
Now, I know also you are interested that medical school is bombed for this lecture.

176
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:58,840
Lecturer in human genetics is usually being made each year then meaning that this little group for me who just happens in May,

177
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:09,850
but I think every May day they have someone invited to talk about genetics in general is seeking or not to after jinx you are

178
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:20,980
interested I will let you know once I know the the date for the next year because for the kids are already was already done in May.

179
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:31,840
Now again James are he work a lot of genetic anthropology are interesting he working he work in Central

180
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:39,459
America or in Costa Rica do any studies of anthropology genetics in with the indigenous populations.

181
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:50,130
And you see here some of the papers have that he work because he he and now I mention this paper because this bears some pyramid over

182
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:58,120
on this module so that he worked with gang still he wasn't my mentor in the past with the idea of my master's thesis in Costa Rica.

183
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,230
How not now? He's retired. I didn't met him in person.

184
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,210
Let's say I was one of his students.

185
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,630
Okay. Then let's talk a little bit about that rethinking hypothesis that this is again,

186
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:24,350
the basic framework and you see that that that you that there was paper was published in 1932 is that you say you know exactly that

187
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:32,810
classic is that classic paper now then we see that basic idea that population they have this period of feast or famine in the past.

188
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:41,210
Therefore not the right selection will favor these three values that promote the historical energy.

189
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:52,430
However, given the modern conditions in in Western societies, we have plentiful available availability of food.

190
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:59,450
Now, this thrifty gene or type of gene, they become deleterious and will they will lead to development,

191
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,980
development of obesity and type two diabetes, then as a consequence, will run it as a conclusion.

192
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:10,430
We can say that obesity and type two diabetes are modern diseases.

193
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:15,170
Diseases on society. No, but let is cause.

194
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:19,190
Okay. And this is one of the few that you saw in one of the papers.

195
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:24,170
Then you see the idea that red line here represents individuals with that

196
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:30,430
thrifty genes and the blue line representing the view that we felt that years.

197
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,150
Then we had this period of famine and no famine.

198
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:40,190
Then there is a minimum or thought this theory for survival.

199
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:50,930
So subject without that refried beans they will be more likely to die of starvation that individuals are treated in.

200
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,850
They are more likely to survive this period of famine.

201
00:25:56,660 --> 00:26:07,100
And it was in the past, as a consequence in their societies, when there is not this widespread famine that you see with their societies,

202
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:15,950
because these trees have been selected and they are pressing the populations that people just they are going

203
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:23,000
to gain weight leading to obesity and their whole life cardiovascular outcomes including type two diabetes.

204
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,030
That that is a general hypothesis. Excuse me, what are the two lines.

205
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:32,600
Yeah, that's true. Like you have to represent that because that,

206
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,600
that we will is that you will have some barriers to in the population then some person that were more likely to get

207
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:46,040
to to become obese faster than all others that that represent that genetic variation that we have in the population.

208
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:57,740
Huh. That this represents the genetic variation that we have in the population that that, that, that the observation that not all people get obese,

209
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:05,070
even in more societies that we have about own body weight, body mass index with obesity, these are all the people.

210
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:14,480
Has this shifted gene. No type was only some of them develop obesity or will be developed adjusted among others.

211
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:23,740
But all these people in the study right now contains this gene get the data that did the hypothesis and we're going to discover whether that's true.

212
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:29,240
What is the evidence or what would you what now?

213
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:41,330
What do you think in general that would be hypotheses. Do you feel that you saw to will do it to?

214
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,320
I mean, how do you believe it?

215
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:51,530
Do you feel that it's a good explanation to the to the epidemics of type two diabetes that we have right now?

216
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,160
No, because I have told you that. Yes.

217
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:05,329
Well, it would do this genome type identified way before the situation arise.

218
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:13,970
I mean, how do we know people actually have, if they want to work, when to see that it is becoming having due to mutation.

219
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,680
Yeah. Where I went to this court that they because anyone else what do you think.

220
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:28,969
One reason that I am a little interesting is this.

221
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:33,770
Like the idea of the Puma Indians. Mm hmm. Like just because of the.

222
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:39,280
Kind of thought processes there. I mean, like, I know it's, like, different, but just like.

223
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:49,140
You gave me something that I don't know. Um, yeah, yeah, yeah.

224
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:53,680
No, that's true. We know that they are from the epidemic genetics.

225
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:59,379
Which activity? Type two diabetes, with the active team embarking on that more frequent and sustained population.

226
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:07,030
That will be my influences and example that they are more susceptible to develop type two diabetes compared to others.

227
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:11,970
They are European ancestry subjects, no less.

228
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:23,709
I'm going to try to then to try to guide you about the discussion that now one big assertion of these hypotheses is that farming,

229
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:31,600
where we are very frequent in the past, because for these barriers to be selected,

230
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:39,940
then that means let's say that I do know how, how every ten years or something like that, or at least once every generation,

231
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:46,630
we are going to have a unifying that is going to be to kill big proportion of the population.

232
00:29:47,200 --> 00:30:00,550
Now, this is a tricky question because when we talk about famines, we talk about a society that has agriculture,

233
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:11,980
because you imagine with ancestors when they were hunter gatherers, that they they didn't have agriculture.

234
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:14,650
Again, they haven't domesticated any plant.

235
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:25,659
What happen if one particular prey is are is low in a certain group in Africa region they say they are eating is more demise is more animals.

236
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:29,080
They are hunting wild animals or gathering plants.

237
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:37,479
And what happens is that is these are certain regions when to be lucky.

238
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,860
What does the resources what what what the or what do you think you are going to do?

239
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:53,950
What they did with the diet beginning with they just have to to something else exactly different like diet that we used to.

240
00:30:54,670 --> 00:31:04,120
Yeah. They will try to fish because we were basically omnivores and also they can move yeah, they can move from one place to the other.

241
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:12,670
Then what that means is that to have farming we need to think about a society,

242
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:20,560
a human group that for some reason has to be in a fix in a certain location that is unable to move.

243
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:26,290
And for that to happen means our society, depending on agriculture.

244
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:34,210
Now, when agriculture ordinated,

245
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:44,950
our estimates are around 6000 years in the past we see based on that bureau you got record them to

246
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:53,230
have famines that which means that if famine they took out in the last 6000 years before that.

247
00:31:56,780 --> 00:32:02,629
Again the evidence and again that the evidence he had in his case she based on archeological records of bombs.

248
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:10,940
Also, you feel that in human history, at least when we have available historical records,

249
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:15,650
there have been about 60 famines across the world in human history.

250
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:32,600
Then, if you can, some of the local famines going around. Other question to ponder are well what the mortality use that starvation during the famines.

251
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:43,500
What I'm trying to ask. How big was the mortality?

252
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:48,480
How is it from using with famines in the past?

253
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,890
Mm hmm. I assume starvation.

254
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:01,720
Mm hmm. Well, that even that people live. Mm hmm.

255
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,170
Get along really easily. Mm hmm. Yeah.

256
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:12,010
Yeah. There is going to be Aboriginal mortality. So these are going to die out faster than others.

257
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:24,730
But another that point to take into account related to that is that most likely will that people that were going to die during the famine were

258
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:37,149
older people rather than younger older people that they usually have been past reproduction then from that from that evolutionary point of view.

259
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:41,140
But that means that older people are dying more likely than younger ones.

260
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:54,680
Mm hmm. Then there are number two. Deaths do not affect the population of new populations yet because they are after reproductive life.

261
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:01,640
Then the effect of natural selection is going to be weaker because natural selection is going to be stronger.

262
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:08,870
The effect will affect younger population because these are filtering the transmission of genes to the next generation.

263
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:20,500
Now, also, we are going to discuss these in other lectures that maybe it was a famine.

264
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:26,630
The strong the factor leading to the selection of the genes.

265
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:32,210
Now, anyone know how long can one live without food?

266
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:40,200
Hm hmm. 5 to 7 days with water.

267
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:49,040
Yeah, they say with water. They say we water. You see the range of days with water.

268
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,790
Yeah. So, I mean, that would have water, but food. 5 to 7 days.

269
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:06,920
I think much of what we're thinking about is also maybe one more week without food, but with water.

270
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:10,150
With water. Yeah. Okay. Now the point.

271
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:19,910
I'm trying to say that even if farming they kill, but there are other factors that grew faster during that drought, during evolution.

272
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,350
Can you think of any other factor that could foster the starvation?

273
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:31,180
Imagine our ancestors. I think everything.

274
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,960
Everything. You have an example.

275
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:39,250
Fire. Fire. Best quick.

276
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:47,650
About five years in the army. This is infections, white animals, predation.

277
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:52,250
Yes, an infection can kill a person. And I was, uh.

278
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:57,220
Uh. I'm going to keep close up. There's one a minute.

279
00:35:57,550 --> 00:36:07,260
In fact, one of the hypotheses is this, that the the brief the hypotheses that we would discuss is related to predation.

280
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,770
Now, then I'm tell you,

281
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:18,100
I'm telling you this because they may be where all their selective fire factors acting out if in that infection is one of them.

282
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:26,980
Um, because yeah, I think we know we had guys going through a pandemia.

283
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:34,010
Uh, the infection agent can kill now.

284
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:40,570
Okay, then, let's, let's, let's now talk a little bit an evolutionary perspective about the insulin resistance.

285
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:48,100
Now we know insulin is produced in the pancreas.

286
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,070
Sales and affect multiple tissues.

287
00:36:56,510 --> 00:37:06,020
For example, a lever is going to affect that output in skeletal muscle is going to regulate the glucose uptake and social life policies.

288
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:14,210
And importantly, seizing adipose tissue also is going to regulate sodium rather than the justice system.

289
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:20,630
It's also regulating the this recreational use within from pancreas and also use can affect the brain.

290
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,610
We know that in the brain we have receptor for insulin is related to the control of appetite.

291
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:41,570
I think we don't know yet whether because the brain can take glucose independent of usually because it skeletal muscle needs insulin to take glucose.

292
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:50,810
However, the brain doesn't need to be that glucose and we are going to see at least one evolutionary explanation why,

293
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,980
why, why brain doesn't need insulin to take glucose.

294
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,330
Now, what is the insulin resistance anyway?

295
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,810
True. It is true.

296
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,000
I have. And what is it? Because we're eating?

297
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:20,090
Because we're heavy sugar constantly in the bloodstream, and therefore that decrease the insulin sensitivity is,

298
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,370
of course, around the body, but then eventually in the liver, too.

299
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:25,940
So I always want you a little bit quick. Quick.

300
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:35,700
Hard to fix that is I have to intermittent fasting, not always provide any sugar and then do some liver flush and so forth.

301
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:41,560
So. Okay. That's it. Yes. Insulin resistance is just the fact that targets you.

302
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:47,160
They fail to respond to insulin then it is not acting as we expect to act.

303
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:54,510
They as a consequence, because we can have degrees of insulin resistance as a concept,

304
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:59,730
the pancreas is just going to produce more insulin to offset that resistance.

305
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:03,800
Then we have insulin resistance. Pancreas are going to produce more easily.

306
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:14,220
However, you will have this chronic insulin resistance on the hyperinsulinemia that may result in damage of pancreatic cells.

307
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:23,430
Then if we don't have pancreatic beta cells, we are going to affect IBD now.

308
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:31,590
But then the question is what is the white insulin resistance axis?

309
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:36,600
And all that is an evolutionary advantage for insulin resistance.

310
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:42,240
Are you saying insulin resistance an example of evolutionary mismatch?

311
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:58,900
I want to go back to the fear here. What is one more dot organs in our body that takes more energy, or at least take a proportion of energy,

312
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:07,600
sometimes more fall when we are active by the, say, resting brain.

313
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:15,220
Brain that brain take a lot of energy. I think in resting glucose is about 25% of that energy.

314
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:23,050
And although here is no press, this is not explicitly in this figure about the immune system.

315
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,959
The immune system takes a lot of energy.

316
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:32,080
When we are fighting an infection, we are consuming that full lot of energy that the reason why is that you need to rest,

317
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:36,940
have the infection, because we need to to get that energy to that immune system.

318
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,720
Then imagine that they imagine that we have an infection.

319
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:47,470
We need that energy to go into that immune system.

320
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:54,400
Then how dark the body is going to regulate that, how the body,

321
00:40:55,180 --> 00:41:02,470
how that metabolism is going to make sure that the the energy is going preferentially to the immune system.

322
00:41:09,110 --> 00:41:12,410
Because this in response. Yes, he said respond.

323
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:20,600
But just look and if you can imagine the mechanism because see, he had da da da multiple is glucose.

324
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:26,870
Mm hmm. The skeletal muscle. But do we know that?

325
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:31,220
Do. Do we need that energy going to the mouth? What if we are fighting an infection?

326
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:40,970
No, I think your brain has to control that. Exactly. Then how the body is going to make sure that that muscle is not taking that glucose.

327
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:51,630
Insulin resistance, then the body what is going to do is insulin resistance in certain features.

328
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:58,080
Then the energy is preferentially mobilized to the organ.

329
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:07,080
Daisy. In this case, there's the immune system and that that will be another reason why also the brain doesn't need insulin to take

330
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:16,530
glucose because just to make for an evolutionary perspective makes sense that if we have insulin resistance,

331
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:22,960
then we'll forget when to have a breath of fresh air transport glucose to the brain because we need that brain to live for.

332
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,530
Ding dong dong. I think you saw this graphing while you paper.

333
00:42:30,530 --> 00:42:40,290
Don't get to ask about that. These are some of the molecular mechanisms you got more interestingly that the would classes in biology,

334
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:45,980
human biochemistry and the physiology or the mechanisms or insulin signaling.

335
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:52,040
But basically what I want to show you here is that we got that right sector off into the interest sector.

336
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:54,800
There is a sector of utility in the membrane cell.

337
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:03,950
Then we have that insulin that attaches to the insulin receptor and there is a whole cascade of response inside that cell as a consequence.

338
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:09,920
One of the consequences that is are these transporters of glucose that they are in that sort of blossom,

339
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:17,600
but they travel to the membrane cell, allow for the uptake of glucose to the cell.

340
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:23,510
And also we have a series of both responses in the liver, for example,

341
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:30,200
where I went to have morphine to see of glycogen also is going to be suppression or production of glucose in that liver.

342
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:40,590
Because we are circulating glucose here in the adipose tissue, we're going to have relatively synthesis of lipids in that skeletal muscle.

343
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:50,120
You are going to have the uptake of glucose and for the synthesis of glycogen, no overall insulin is going to promote the anabolic response.

344
00:43:52,870 --> 00:44:00,390
Now we can modulate our response, blocking, filling that or that pathway.

345
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,680
And again, the worry too much about that for this cloud.

346
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:10,990
We don't need to know all this molecular mechanism, but the consequences are you'll see here that now the transporters of glucose,

347
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:19,420
they don't travel to the memory cell, therefore there is no glucose uptake into the cell in the liver.

348
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:27,759
One of the consequences of that, right, is that we are going to have our production of glucose in that area that even is going to produce glucose and

349
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:36,340
export it to other teachers who are going to address operational synthesis of glycogen in the adipose tissue.

350
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:40,830
We're going to have to place only be seen. This is in the skeletal muscle.

351
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:48,040
We're going to have a decrease uptake of mucus as to pressure, more fatigue like we don't see disease that really can present this work.

352
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:58,540
In opposite to what you were saying before because like the other theories, like we're eating more too, so we can have more cloud stores than than.

353
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:04,270
Inspiration and the best periods like for promoting a catabolic path.

354
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:09,800
Yes. It seems kind of like opposing to itself.

355
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,570
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. That's that's that's a good observation.

356
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:23,270
And I think that's one of the problems that we see in hypotheses because the idea is that is their

357
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:32,750
they were selected to talk but why we just wasn't able to keep it or if we felt any bad consequences.

358
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:43,250
Now these are that you'll be able to say noise. The insulin resistance is a mechanism to to mobilize energy under different conditions.

359
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:55,040
Now what is happening now in, uh, under chronic conditions of inflammation is that these insulin resistance,

360
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:02,180
you can think of insulin resistance as a short term mechanism to mobilize in total particle energy.

361
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:07,770
Mm hmm. Um, so they're like, different situations, like the first circumstance of being severe.

362
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,290
That this would be you just have an infection, but maybe you're not.

363
00:46:13,310 --> 00:46:23,270
Exactly. In fact. In fact, we know that when we have an infection and these have been we know that that that we develop sharp tensions for resistance,

364
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:29,840
for example, in the skeletal muscle, because that energy is being mobilized to the immune system.

365
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:36,560
Now that what I want you to do for you to see here is that insulin resistance is

366
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:46,010
in order to be a mechanism to for the body to a particle energy to give anymore.

367
00:46:46,250 --> 00:46:55,730
Because also insulin resistant when we talk about insulin resistance is not completely generalized,

368
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:03,229
at least enough eating, nor are the, you know, pathological terms we don't have have to receive them is plain.

369
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:11,670
You know, when we have an infection, we know that we are going to develop a certain level of insulin resistance.

370
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:21,530
And also, however, are other organs that they rather they become more insulin sensitive because they need to take this energy to fight.

371
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:26,269
The infection then is the important evolutionary perspective of insulin resistance,

372
00:47:26,270 --> 00:47:34,730
that short term mechanism and also can affect different features at different times to allow for the mobilization of energy.

373
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:40,250
This is the meat is more or less clear of it.

374
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:50,870
Now again, what a wonderful idea to see that that insulin resistance equal has are able to

375
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:58,880
have advantages and maybe was selected as a mechanism to look to mobilize energy.

376
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:07,160
Now, what what are these bandages? And this is what we know under fasting.

377
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:12,320
And they say this is the original feeding hypothesis. They say do during the starvation.

378
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:19,270
Then the idea was to try to mobilize energy to survival.

379
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:31,579
However, other conditions like stress, infection, injury, these these stress, they say even that injury they are bent.

380
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:36,570
The body's going to mobilize inflammatory processes to, ah.

381
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:41,659
To heal that injury. Mm hmm. Then we are going to have insulin resistance.

382
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:45,770
But again, you think about this insulin resistance as tissue specific.

383
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:50,780
A short term organ is specific and short term.

384
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,830
Then the idea is to mobilize this energy, to say to the brain, we could bring with glucose,

385
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:06,590
and then we are going to develop insulin resistance and skeletal muscle and maybe even eat that

386
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:13,940
in the liver to put to arm to allow that energy going to the brain or to the immune system.

387
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:17,269
This illness that you can be the, let's say,

388
00:49:17,270 --> 00:49:22,670
the normal mechanism or what we think is that evolutionary that that evolutionary mechanism that was addicted.

389
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:36,750
What you. Now, of course, we know that we eat a lot here.

390
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:46,890
Now we know. So we don't know the mechanisms. If we start to accumulate fat, we are going to increase the inflammatory response.

391
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,809
We are going to have an infiltration with these type of cell macrophages. We will talk about this later.

392
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:54,180
In another lecture, we talk about immune systems,

393
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:03,030
but the point here is that we're going to have a chronic low grade inflammation and this is just a pathological response.

394
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,890
And then we have chronic insulin resistance.

395
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,970
At the end, we are going to have the development of type two diabetes, metabolic syndrome, all the type of outcomes.

396
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,730
Questions. Yeah.

397
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:32,020
Presumably you're talking about the last few slides to talk about is evolutionary changes, but how do we know that it wasn't like this to start with?

398
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:37,930
Yep. That's a that's a good question. How do we test the hypothesis now?

399
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:46,210
One, what a way to test the hypothesis. Well, is to have some evidence is to see whether these mechanisms are present in other organisms.

400
00:50:47,770 --> 00:50:51,819
And we know that that that video stuff that the fact that these mechanism insulin

401
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:56,920
resistance to mobilize in they are not ah they are not present in humans,

402
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:03,210
they are also present in a little organism. Organism or if not useful is a very old gene.

403
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:14,680
They all in the evolutionary perspective, if anything, are even in in flies, they are full genes related weensy.

404
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:21,059
Mm hmm. There is a very good gene. How? There are very key forms jumping in energy metabolism.

405
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:29,799
We get it now. We can do experimental studies to try to test these, but also we can look in that genetic evidence.

406
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,060
That is what I'm going to try to to discuss in the second part of the lecture.

407
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:38,740
Okay, let's take 5 minutes break.

408
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:45,340
Uh, you need a bathroom break because now we are going to talk a little bit about the evidence.

409
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,540
How do we test for mechanistic perspective? These are these hypotheses.

410
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:01,230
In medicine. Are you listening to?

411
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:06,200
Yep. Within the blade. Okay. You Mexican?

412
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:16,020
Thank you. How are you? Yeah.

413
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:27,260
I'm not much of an idea. This is all happening on Tuesdays and anything like that.

414
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:37,980
Yeah. No, not today's. I care enough for me today, but whether that be at work on Tuesday.

415
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:46,010
I thought we could go. Yes. You are not in person for us.

416
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:52,610
Well, we don't know that those people are so small.

417
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:03,530
You already have one there, and I haven't got anything for you.

418
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:16,960
I have your. And. It has to be at home and we're just going to have to make sure we have people to.

419
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:24,280
And you know, tomorrow morning, for instance.

420
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:29,380
Yeah, yeah, yep, yep, yep. At least twice tomorrow.

421
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:33,270
One person who was pretty screwed up in Canada.

422
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:36,670
I think we shall make it at this early stage.

423
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:42,690
I feel like the last year that I have.

424
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:47,340
You have a few, you know.

425
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:54,390
Yeah. You know, the white people wouldn't get for this.

426
00:53:55,250 --> 00:54:06,550
Yeah, well, right. Yeah. But we have a lot of people stay with the same level this afternoon.

427
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:12,760
Yeah. That's what they want to do, right. Because I have another problem, what I'm looking for.

428
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:16,000
Oh, well, I don't know.

429
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:22,569
Maybe I don't think there's even a topic within because you want to meet you personally.

430
00:54:22,570 --> 00:54:42,250
What would be? So this is the first time you get to really talk so much about because you want to let me know what you feel, okay?

431
00:54:42,250 --> 00:54:48,630
And then could you make us feel about certain things that you did you haven't done?

432
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:55,330
I was impressed that me know what you. I don't have any time raising money if I can.

433
00:54:55,930 --> 00:55:03,780
So if we will solve a problem from then, we can meet with the money that we have created.

434
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:08,290
For it is going to be the newspaper. Always.

435
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:15,360
If there. Ready?

436
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:25,060
Yeah. Oh, yeah. And that was the thing.

437
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:36,200
I mean, I didn't find. So I tell you what.

438
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:45,800
That's right. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

439
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:49,500
What was it like working with him?

440
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,310
Yeah, we just. We just did really well.

441
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:59,010
Yeah. Yeah, I think.

442
00:56:05,520 --> 00:56:13,330
Right? Yes. So for the presentation, I thought the.

443
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:30,490
And they just. Or I can read the readings and I think we continue to talk on the phone and I can finish it.

444
00:56:31,420 --> 00:57:07,720
But I guess anything you. Okay.

445
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:13,000
Let's continue. The second part of that class is going to be a little more.

446
00:57:16,890 --> 00:57:26,040
Uh, maybe theoretical, I will say, or write a little more genetics focus.

447
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,440
Then I will go as slope.

448
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:47,490
Don't worry, you miss somewhat out of the fine point that is clutching about my majority in order for me to try to understand all of what is going on.

449
00:57:47,670 --> 00:57:50,850
What did the aliens argue with that would do that?

450
00:57:51,810 --> 00:57:57,720
Okay, then this is a question. How do we test that hypothesis?

451
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:11,879
Now, remember, according to the hypothesis, genes associated with diabetes right now, in their time, they were good genes.

452
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:21,150
In the past, they were beneficial. Then one way to test the hypothesis is to look for evidence of natural selection.

453
00:58:21,150 --> 00:58:28,260
Positive. Natural selection by positive by being then attracts a natural was increasing the frequency

454
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:34,440
of the genes over time with genes associated now with risk of type two diabetes or obesity.

455
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,230
Although we can do it the other way around.

456
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:45,990
Let's say before you read in some of the papers that we have deemed rather to protect against obesity and against type two diabetes,

457
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,629
then according to the tree feeding hypothesis,

458
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:55,020
those genes would be rather under negative not to reservation because they will be rather harmful in the past.

459
00:58:55,640 --> 00:59:01,440
If they are protective now, they will be they were harmful in the past, a body type of disease.

460
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:10,660
Okay then. Now how do we select these areas of natural selection in the human genome?

461
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:15,490
There are some clear cases of natural selection in the human genome.

462
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:22,299
We discussed deciding one of the previous classes that resistant to the malaria in sickle

463
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:27,670
cell anemia mutation in the beta global global warming gene to protect against malaria.

464
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:32,950
Also, I think we discussed a little bit about the persisting will of lactase.

465
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:41,380
We know that there is also maybe no natural selection for the better system lactase due to that memory to that dairy consumption.

466
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:49,000
We also know about and for this implementation, people living in very northern latitudes,

467
00:59:49,330 --> 00:59:58,930
they have high frequency of eyelids or lighter skin because they need to die from life or by them in the team disease in the scheme.

468
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:05,109
And also these are just examples. They are other examples of people living high altitude.

469
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:10,900
For example, in the in the Andean mountains in Peru, for example,

470
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:18,379
are the acceptance in the allow those persons to live at the height we got that you can imagine

471
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:25,240
that does height because the oxygen is lower than they are so much for genetic adaptation to that.

472
01:00:25,570 --> 01:00:29,320
Then this example, a gene that we know had been under natural selection.

473
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:43,840
Now, another important question that we need to ask is where during that evolution of our species, not selection, was acting on these drifting genes?

474
01:00:45,050 --> 01:00:52,600
Then, as we discussed previously, most likely was a very recent selection from the Aborigines perspective.

475
01:00:53,410 --> 01:01:06,069
This is the evolution blessing with the primate in the last 20 million would use that well that last 20 million years of we know what a species

476
01:01:06,070 --> 01:01:18,880
is so not be disabilities in this species according to some estimates our species what we need is about 100 to 200000 years ago in Africa.

477
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:28,790
However, I also we discussed famines where more likely to be to happen in North Africa.

478
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:35,049
What we need to report, because if we are hunter gatherers, people just move from one place to the other.

479
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:40,870
Also populations actually what is more in hunter gatherers, groups that they were able to move from one place to the other,

480
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:46,749
then that what that means is that natural selection for feeding will be to happen.

481
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:50,860
Bigger reason from the evolutionary perspective, maybe in the last 10,000 years.

482
01:01:55,230 --> 01:01:58,410
Now. Then how do we test these ideas?

483
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:03,630
Do you remember that class about or that we discussed genetic drift?

484
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:08,750
Mm hmm. Now, we saw that in the simulations,

485
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:19,860
and I hope that you did some of those simulations at home so that if they can reach 100% frequency, one population just by chance.

486
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:27,750
Hmm. Now, imagine that we have a population of a certain size.

487
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,620
We have a new variant. Now, all that genetic variant that we have right now,

488
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:47,040
they all are in a different mutation that that mechanism to ah or we get to by Johns Hopkins but by mutations now.

489
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:55,079
But these mutations when they happen imagine a new variant they happen just one person and

490
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:59,970
then by random genetic drift that delta variant needs to increase and reach 100% frequency,

491
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:10,739
then decide as a result of certain simulations to show in average how long it takes.

492
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:22,740
And you get into baryons to reach 100% frequency in one population just by genetic drift that this is like the we have a new mutation.

493
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:30,630
Most likely that mutation is going to disappear. You see in this line because we have only one mutation most likely is going to disappear,

494
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:36,780
but in some cases going to increasing frequency just by chance up to 100%.

495
01:03:37,470 --> 01:03:43,890
Now this time depends on the population size, as you can expect here, and it means population size.

496
01:03:44,700 --> 01:03:52,050
The smaller the population, the faster the that environment is going to reach 100%,

497
01:03:52,950 --> 01:04:00,659
the the larger the population then will need more time than this time.

498
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:08,280
What we call fixation time depends on population so far for the okay, these are the basic ideas.

499
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:15,480
Then this is our hypothesis and this is where we are when you study using genetics to test for natural selection,

500
01:04:17,370 --> 01:04:28,140
because the new hypothesis will be that there is an isolation and the variation that we observe that there is a lot of random genetic drift then.

501
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:41,480
I'm going to put you this example. I assume that we have a new variant of albeit very lethal.

502
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:46,849
Imagine they are the vaccine that we have right now.

503
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:50,960
They don't work. They don't work. But now imagine that they don't work at all.

504
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:55,880
Imagine that the vaccine that we had nowadays doesn't work for these new variants.

505
01:04:56,510 --> 01:05:01,520
And imagine that is how you better infectious is going to kill.

506
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:10,370
I'm making these numbers up. But listen, imagine there's going to be 50% half of the people that get that virus.

507
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:21,310
I'm all also imagining that there is a new mutation that protects against the virus.

508
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:31,610
Know that we have a population that's a million subjects.

509
01:05:31,790 --> 01:05:41,660
I mean, in Libya, once we had this new mutation that protects against the virus and the virus is killing 50%, 50%, not very infectious.

510
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:46,070
Then how the frequency of that Bahrain is going to increase over time?

511
01:05:46,670 --> 01:05:52,590
Fast. Slow is not going to increase. What was the question again?

512
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:57,600
The frequency of the variant of these double digits. I didn't call you again.

513
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:03,299
You knew that, but you said anything about it.

514
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:08,190
Double digits. I didn't call you. That's going to happen. Various law, very slow.

515
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:13,769
But the quality of this, you know, this is a very lethal, very infectious of kills.

516
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:19,860
Half what I see will be the same speed then no is going to accelerate the apparent is going to

517
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:26,070
ah he's going to increasing frequency very fast because it's a very strong selective force.

518
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:32,399
Now in this graph that means that is that these patterns are going to increase something like this.

519
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:36,560
Ruth I'm going to make a line here, begin.

520
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:40,980
And I can I can write. I don't.

521
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:48,960
Okay. Something like this. Because there is a strong natural selection that nobody wants to increase very fast.

522
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:58,050
Then we can we can compare this time again, that expectation under genetic drift.

523
01:06:58,350 --> 01:07:09,930
And this is the idea. If we observe a variance that reaches high frequency turpentine that is suggestive of natural selection.

524
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:17,340
That idea, of course, can be all that explanation that we within it that we need to discover.

525
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:25,510
For example, funded effect in manipulable subject, moving from one place to the other for that for which they they carry a variance.

526
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:29,760
Then that will identify the explanation that we need to explore. Okay.

527
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,300
Give me 1/2. I'm going to remove this. Okay.

528
01:07:33,750 --> 01:07:42,180
Then this is the idea. Now, how do we test these in populations using human data, you know, genomic data.

529
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:46,920
Then just to remind you, imagine that this is a this is me.

530
01:07:48,960 --> 01:07:56,490
I chair 25 years ago, my genes, my grandparents and I share 50% with my.

531
01:07:57,540 --> 01:08:07,950
Sorry. I repeat, did I see the right. I chair 25% of my year with my grandparents and I shared 50% of my you with my partners.

532
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:14,700
Now but an important point here is that there are chromosomes because of recombination.

533
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:23,730
They are more things you see here that these chromosomes, they have different colors because they are these they have for me, for all my ancestors.

534
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:33,210
Now, the size of these fragments is going to depend on time, how long that last recombination happens.

535
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:42,880
Then we can measure using different recombination rate the aspect that Len or the chromosomal size.

536
01:08:43,650 --> 01:08:47,210
Then what that is important for our for our purposes.

537
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:53,190
And again, I'm trying to to give you the basic at least that that you that you can actually concept.

538
01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:04,830
Okay. Imagine again that in this here we have a population and this red square here represents

539
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:11,400
that genetic variant that is protecting against going against this new type of COVID.

540
01:09:14,170 --> 01:09:23,770
Now, because in this hypothetical scenario, Kobe, these are very strong selective four with a high mortality rate,

541
01:09:24,850 --> 01:09:29,770
very infectious, then this pattern is going to increase in frequency in the population.

542
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:40,630
What you see here now, more persons after a certain time, they are going to have a variance because they are able to survive and to reproduce.

543
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:45,070
But another consequence of that, what do you observe in these chromosomes?

544
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:50,950
Let's say you see this chromosome here, this one, this one. What do you see here?

545
01:09:51,640 --> 01:10:04,390
Besides that, they had these this square. You'll see that these parties, they are similar.

546
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,489
What is that? What? What is that? That is the you.

547
01:10:09,490 --> 01:10:18,290
Because this election is acting very fast in a few generations that there is not enough time for a combination to happen.

548
01:10:19,870 --> 01:10:28,150
Then as a consequence, this chromosome, this this size of fragments, they are going to be longer than expected.

549
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:38,420
Because there was no enough time for recombination, because this is called the heat seeking effect,

550
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:45,560
because alternative gardens around the one that had been selected, they had been carried with that variant.

551
01:10:48,580 --> 01:10:59,180
Then we can use again that idea to test for natural selection, because in this graph, this position here, this is just imagining a chromosome.

552
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:03,640
And here we have in this position.

553
01:11:04,630 --> 01:11:10,870
You said there natural selection. I think that what you actually we have a measure of genetic diversity,

554
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:15,670
yet there is some measure of how we fit in our genes around this particular point.

555
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:21,190
What we observe around our barrier that is selected by natural selection,

556
01:11:21,190 --> 01:11:28,540
we are going to have a decrease of all genetic diversity because remember, all these chromosomes, they look the same around that red.

557
01:11:28,540 --> 01:11:36,040
The square is create the concept about why these chromosome fragments are longer than expected.

558
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:48,250
Now I'm going to show you how I did the study when I was doing my my Ph.D. less back on top of independent study.

559
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:55,510
Very nice. And we got very nice results. Let me explain you this.

560
01:11:56,170 --> 01:12:02,290
There is a gene repair, gamma ray claim, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism.

561
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:13,690
And that is a particularly that is called the adapt well l because I change the amino acid alanine alanine in the positive number 12 in the

562
01:12:13,690 --> 01:12:24,160
protein for our interest is this particular is protective against type two diabetes is associated with lower risk of type two diabetes,

563
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:28,480
lower body mass index and also higher insulin sensitivity.

564
01:12:29,770 --> 01:12:33,820
These are good right now because protects against type two diabetes.

565
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:40,930
However, according to that, refuting hypotheses, they would be of thrifty value.

566
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:46,090
We got it. Good. Now then. He was back in the past.

567
01:12:48,250 --> 01:13:00,100
It's clear. The idea then also is interesting that this ideal and this idea that these are in frequency

568
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:08,630
distributions or that these are in all the world has a frequency of about a set of about 7%.

569
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:14,319
But you see that they are certain population that they have lower frequency, for example, in African ancestry populations,

570
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:25,480
about one per saying in a population here an MC from the Americas you about with are saying these Asian three you'll see this is a European ancestry.

571
01:13:25,630 --> 01:13:30,070
12 South Asian 12%. The is used by region of the world.

572
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:40,740
The idea for this analysis was to test that repeating hypothesis estimating the age of the alien.

573
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:54,969
Then the question was can we use genomic data to estimate when in the past these are lead ordinated because

574
01:13:54,970 --> 01:14:00,760
remember hold up allies that we have the order united because of mutation then we can estimate using.

575
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:07,420
So my son John with the pastor happens that I am not going to go to about how that detail here.

576
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:17,760
But basically we have two differing estimates of the age that you want and that the two that you want was basically assimilate the chromosome,

577
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:27,940
remember this fragment of chromosomes and that it too was based on the assuming the alley was neutral then.

578
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:34,000
And I am not going to go over to you about basically if Wolf estimates are similar,

579
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:41,559
then that means there is not areas of natural selection if the one higher latitude in the west area and

580
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:48,790
so negative natural selection if the one place that they do then is avian positive lateral selector,

581
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:54,370
meaning that the elderly stiff them again the hypotheses that both estimates actually similar.

582
01:14:54,790 --> 01:14:56,590
Therefore there is no not reservation.

583
01:14:57,670 --> 01:15:08,400
Therefore this analysis are we use genetic data for different populations and basically that yes to look the results in this last poll,

584
01:15:10,060 --> 01:15:19,959
this last column go back to this low. This was the age estimates using the length of the chromosomal fragments and these are age

585
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:28,600
estimates using are and if frequencies here then even when we have some variations but

586
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:34,690
they basically look around us about the same you see that the confidence intervals for

587
01:15:34,690 --> 01:15:38,980
all these estimate they and the differing are selected they overlap one with the other.

588
01:15:41,290 --> 01:15:49,270
And we found down the more reasonable estimate for these lead these around 30,000 used in the past.

589
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,720
Oh, it's a very different evolutionary perspective.

590
01:15:56,100 --> 01:16:05,790
We then we estimated that this idea well originated about between 30 to 40000 years in the past.

591
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,070
These have a confidence limit.

592
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:19,380
But what is what is interesting here is that at the origin of this year is after the migration of humans from Africa migrating out of Africa,

593
01:16:19,530 --> 01:16:25,770
because remember, humans started to migrate out of Africa in between around 50,000 using the bus.

594
01:16:26,520 --> 01:16:30,510
That is in that is all originated after that migration.

595
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:36,420
Then what? Then what do you see in the alleles present in African ancestry population in about 1%.

596
01:16:37,230 --> 01:16:41,550
It is after migration of humans.

597
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:54,480
Any explanation, because we observe this are using in African ancestry populations in a very low frequency and any suggesting.

598
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:06,040
Barranca. Maybe we were looking around as much.

599
01:17:08,040 --> 01:17:11,460
To have that adaptation, like when you're moving around your.

600
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:20,580
So you have, like, more body fat, so. Location.

601
01:17:23,030 --> 01:17:31,660
And then the people that stayed. I know I can be the opposite.

602
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:36,069
Yeah. Not good for your argument. You're right.

603
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:45,139
But I think. Ah, I think I did this play with the question because imagine that we have humans in Africa.

604
01:17:45,140 --> 01:17:50,260
I would, I, would it be sort of united then some 50,000,

605
01:17:50,510 --> 01:17:55,839
60,000 years in the past they started to migrate out of Africa and then that mutation

606
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:01,479
happens in these populations out of Africa that mutates even more into the pool.

607
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:06,530
Decided then why African ancestry population they have really.

608
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:18,310
If you do a recent mixture with other populations like that, there are some of our population.

609
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:29,790
Yeah. If in doubt. Because I also I think I figured I'd show you that even after the immigration

610
01:18:29,790 --> 01:18:33,780
vote out of Africa human having migrated to different parts of the world,

611
01:18:34,230 --> 01:18:40,139
they are I think are the the cell that we observe in Africa and assess the population.

612
01:18:40,140 --> 01:18:44,490
Yes. A period of recent genetic mixture with non-African populations.

613
01:18:45,300 --> 01:18:49,770
No, but but but for our for our interest.

614
01:18:51,210 --> 01:18:55,620
These results, they showed that there was no evidence of natural selection because,

615
01:18:55,620 --> 01:19:00,140
again, I don't want to go over this research, but it's this estimate late.

616
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:08,850
They look similar then in competition this analysis showed that that be but gamma I looked well

617
01:19:08,850 --> 01:19:18,479
for you wasn't under natural selection you there's things that neutral that you know that well

618
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:26,010
there is studies and it was done using people from Polynesia and you I mean that pneumonia in

619
01:19:26,010 --> 01:19:33,900
the Pacific Iceland then because we have high incidence of type two diabetes among Polynesians.

620
01:19:34,950 --> 01:19:42,390
However, in so neighboring Iceland, for example, in Urania, we had rather low incidence of type two diabetes.

621
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:49,049
They have similar environment. Then the question of whether they are from genetics Bolivia indicate is plainly

622
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:53,920
differences and whether they are still periods or natural selection them.

623
01:19:54,150 --> 01:19:58,080
In this study, what they did was both better and in frequency.

624
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:05,600
So different genes associated with are with an element of autism and they found these barium in the prepared gamma

625
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:14,430
a.s.a.p that people gamma seeking that was highly different comparing people on eulalia versus body nation.

626
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:21,719
What you see here in these in parentheses is that value in that P value for differences and you see

627
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:29,549
that is highly significant are these 0.7 at that 50 remember that we discussed the last cloud that the

628
01:20:29,550 --> 01:20:36,390
best antibody relation differentiation between one population and other meaning therefore these are

629
01:20:36,390 --> 01:20:44,120
little people from Uganda are 70% different compared to people of Polynesia for deciding for respect.

630
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:57,830
Now, however, it is evidence of natural selection and while we know about this particular alil e that shows a huge allele frequency diversity,

631
01:20:58,060 --> 01:21:01,830
the war here black represent higher frequency,

632
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:10,320
light represent low frequency, and you see that they are certain regions with higher low frequency anything that again that result or genetic brief.

633
01:21:12,330 --> 01:21:12,850
Then again,

634
01:21:12,870 --> 01:21:22,709
remember the fact that we observe difference of radio frequency between population doesn't necessarily mean that the resonator can be gas genetic.

635
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:26,160
That if that is in that case, too. Mm hmm.

636
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:36,810
Now, there was another more recent study using genes that we know are associated with type two diabetes and obesity.

637
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:50,280
In this particular study, they analyzed 13, 18, 13 and 17 genes associated with type two diabetes on their team associated with obesity.

638
01:21:52,860 --> 01:21:59,429
Don't worry too much about these particular values and yet are just putting in red that one that was significant,

639
01:21:59,430 --> 01:22:01,460
meaning that they have evidence for natural selection.

640
01:22:02,820 --> 01:22:12,240
Then you see digest do this at EPA and the study here out of all this group only to show evidence for natural selection.

641
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:29,250
And these are for die for the 17 genes associated with type two diabetes, just two for that they're being associated with obesity, just one.

642
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:36,750
Then you see that that evidence for natural selection is why way strong using genomics data.

643
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:45,650
Then just two out of 17 type two diabetes gene.

644
01:22:46,310 --> 01:22:51,880
So some areas or not, the regulation only one out of 13 for the obesity.

645
01:22:53,440 --> 01:22:57,640
Then the conclusion is that most of the aging they don't show evidence for natural selection.

646
01:22:59,080 --> 01:23:14,680
Now, if I ask you this, what do you think is more important for weight, for body weight genes, for environment in an environment.

647
01:23:16,210 --> 01:23:18,250
Environment. And let me show you some results.

648
01:23:20,550 --> 01:23:30,870
These are the emporiums that have been found associated with body weight issues with body weight that different

649
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:40,220
colored to represent that you that they were in square in that exactly we had a frequency and that what

650
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:45,910
actually we had the effect on body weight in kilograms then you'll see that most of the variance that we

651
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:52,770
that people have discover this that one around here they are the effect site is less than half a kilogram.

652
01:23:55,170 --> 01:24:03,360
But of course we are shown, for example, this one in the gym, they feel that it's associated with one kilogram effect,

653
01:24:03,570 --> 01:24:11,490
meaning that each athlete or DG in average is associated with an increment one kilogram of body weight.

654
01:24:13,620 --> 01:24:22,410
They are all there's Aliu, there is this one the ANC for our gene is that Miller Miller nicotine Miller Miller not

655
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:29,250
hurting receptor you'll see that it's associated with a seven kilogram effect but these

656
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:33,930
are very rare in that population you'll find you said you've seen a few fufu you maybe

657
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:40,430
one out of 1000 or one out of the 2000 that even when we have bargained that out,

658
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:47,520
associated with a high body weight. But they are very really the populations they are not quite that frequent at that did you hypothesis predict.

659
01:24:50,610 --> 01:24:56,300
Regarding the question that IEEE, I ask you, do you see data up to 2017?

660
01:24:57,450 --> 01:25:06,060
Do you see how would proportion or the variation in body weight is explained by genes that we know?

661
01:25:07,380 --> 01:25:17,190
Then up to 2017, all that gene that we know let that they just been let down for passing all that by regional body weight.

662
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:36,700
Most of them. And then some people made them. Oh, no, I was just thinking because you don't know to like how much of an impact certain genes are made.

663
01:25:37,390 --> 01:25:48,120
I think you're saying it could be like a one. Now, if you'd like an explanation for what's happening at the large scale.

664
01:25:49,870 --> 01:25:53,200
Like James was saying. Yeah, yeah.

665
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:59,830
There are certain, Gene, that they have huge effect. And again, you'll see here, this one has an effect of seven kilograms,

666
01:26:00,670 --> 01:26:08,110
but is very rare in the populations that you observe decided like a one every 10,000 subject.

667
01:26:08,440 --> 01:26:11,979
Right. They are all die with some lower effect.

668
01:26:11,980 --> 01:26:23,890
That is still, I would say, significant to KG, but they have a frequency of hereupon white person, meaning that you find these in one of them.

669
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:28,510
This doesn't explain that that epidemic of obesity, people, they are barren.

670
01:26:28,510 --> 01:26:34,419
They are not quite frequent. They they can isolate that epidemics or obesity in the population.

671
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:49,749
And also and also we observe that change or increase of prevalence of obesity over time is fast and is not explained by changing somebody's frequency.

672
01:26:49,750 --> 01:26:55,270
Because we cannot we cannot expect huge change of any frequency is in a few generations.

673
01:26:56,020 --> 01:27:03,190
Takes more time than that. World foods that are that environment is that driving for maybe for some person they are

674
01:27:03,190 --> 01:27:09,370
starting to interact with with the environment that they are most susceptible to gain weight.

675
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:17,210
That is perfectly possible. But from the population point of view, you think that in the end displacement is multiple.

676
01:27:20,330 --> 01:27:26,860
Now there are. Then what I want to show my right these is that them and these are the limitations that re

677
01:27:26,870 --> 01:27:33,019
feeding hypotheses first assumes that there is a common selective pressure in all the world.

678
01:27:33,020 --> 01:27:36,080
In the human population there was a starvation find.

679
01:27:37,130 --> 01:27:45,320
But maybe why was not the case? Maybe they were all that selective pressure, for example, resistant infections, telomere regulation,

680
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:56,090
that one with that paper dimensions I would feel even be able to run from from predation, from plate, from predators.

681
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:04,580
And again and also famines most likely would be local, would be localized in certain regions in the whole world.

682
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:12,700
Now, do you read some of the alternative theories? And one of the papers.

683
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:24,480
One is this one. And I again, the point I want to make is that maybe the reason that it's not a unique theory, maybe they are acting out.

684
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:31,300
Maybe some they have some true. Maybe have some limitations on this around this story.

685
01:28:32,590 --> 01:28:44,320
Either way, I proposed it that obesity genes are just a byproduct of our by reaction to burn off excess of caloric intake.

686
01:28:44,980 --> 01:28:58,120
And the basic idea, let's say that first part of that graph have a we need to set we need to eat a certain amount of food to meet our energy

687
01:28:58,120 --> 01:29:06,370
demand they represented by this like year and also we this food they need to meet certain let's say a critical nutrient.

688
01:29:09,100 --> 01:29:13,600
If we are inactive, then our energy requirements are going to be lower.

689
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:21,940
But if we eat less, we are went to get less of these critical nutrients than if we are inactive.

690
01:29:22,420 --> 01:29:29,350
We need to eat more to get these critical nutrient, but then we will need to burn off this excess calories.

691
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:39,309
And then on the hypothesis that that that is part of the accepted person's certain genes that allow person to burn off more easily.

692
01:29:39,310 --> 01:29:51,350
These and we know that they are certain things that they do that this gene, the uncoupling protein, they are timbering that is in doubt.

693
01:29:51,370 --> 01:30:01,580
The people with those by humans are able to more able to burn off excess calories by feedback about what place and oil is not safe.

694
01:30:02,300 --> 01:30:05,740
You know, like are they adequate to burn off a thousand calories per day?

695
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:07,770
Is this not the case?

696
01:30:10,690 --> 01:30:22,300
And this one that distributing hypotheses say that that selective factor was rather at risk of predation, then they are to limit the upper limit.

697
01:30:22,570 --> 01:30:26,410
Sorry that our limit is the that risk of starvation.

698
01:30:26,470 --> 01:30:31,720
If the body weight go below that limit, that person is going to die.

699
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:42,879
But also there is an upper limit for that risk of predation, meaning that if a person has too much weight, will be unable to escape predation.

700
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:47,590
And again, remember, this is a hypothesis based on look both what happens in the past.

701
01:30:49,030 --> 01:30:57,190
However, in our society we don't have now these risk of predation is still we have that lower limit.

702
01:30:57,790 --> 01:31:03,940
But because we don't have this upper limit, then the body weight is going to able to increase and increase.

703
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:11,230
This is called attributing hypothesis. I found that interesting, but I didn't find it quite convincing.

704
01:31:11,650 --> 01:31:21,010
And then in summary, also, we know obesity is a multi-factorial and diabetes or cardiovascular outcomes.

705
01:31:21,460 --> 01:31:30,460
They are multifactorial. And one of the papers also mentioned the the social aspects equal to the aspect of body weight, body image.

706
01:31:33,140 --> 01:31:40,170
They are. There are a lot of factors. I mean, in this class, we're not going to discuss epigenetics.

707
01:31:40,770 --> 01:31:50,460
But I think at least in some. Maybe we can touch it a little bit in some of the lecture about we have also some lectures about sleep evolution.

708
01:31:51,180 --> 01:32:02,510
We're going to discuss that while the lectures. Then in general is a multi-factorial trait obesity type two diabetes.

709
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:12,050
Then to summarize, I would say that no single evolutionary theory explained the origins of obesity and Type two diabetes.

710
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:17,420
However, the existing or certain genes cannot be ruled out.

711
01:32:17,770 --> 01:32:25,940
And we saw from the analysis that at least two genes associated with type two diabetes and one associated with obesity,

712
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:28,070
they show some evidence or natural selection.

713
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:38,420
Important to understand the role of insulin resistance as a mechanism of energy partitioning and mobilization.

714
01:32:39,290 --> 01:32:45,860
I want that to to be clear that insulin resistance has evolutionary advantages.

715
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:57,630
The now immoral society is maladaptive, but there is a reason why certain tissues, septic organs develop insulin resistance.

716
01:32:59,640 --> 01:33:03,240
Most likely, again, we are going to add all this diversity or selective pressure.

717
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:08,790
We will discuss infection in our lectures when we talk about the immune system

718
01:33:09,870 --> 01:33:16,830
that may be related to to the epidemics of type two diabetes in older society.

719
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:36,390
Questions for. Yet in any comments, any question whether you're thinking in general about or able to validate hypotheses for back to diabetes.

720
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:45,300
Right. Famines are fascinating and they happen.

721
01:33:46,540 --> 01:33:49,990
I really wanted to look into this theory.

722
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:54,340
They had tried, like the potato famine to go back.

723
01:33:55,950 --> 01:34:00,460
They? So maybe like more recent populations have.

724
01:34:01,690 --> 01:34:04,959
Yeah. Yeah, that's how I don't know it.

725
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:15,190
You know, these are the Baker Baker hypotheses like the theme was this observation that people down so far

726
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:22,510
starvation during World War two let's say their mother worked pregnancy were pregnant and they,

727
01:34:22,510 --> 01:34:29,020
they, they they they were starving and after birth that these person they develop,

728
01:34:29,620 --> 01:34:37,329
they had a reasonable argument that what dyslipidemia they do diabetes then if in that they are

729
01:34:37,330 --> 01:34:46,180
epigenetic mechanisms explaining that the genome is reprogram the the is said good explanation.

730
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:55,329
The problem from the evolutionary perspective is that epigenetic marks like a methylation you somebody because they don't pass from

731
01:34:55,330 --> 01:35:06,310
one generation to the other then my at least in humans then that means that maybe my epigenome is going to suffer some modifications,

732
01:35:06,490 --> 01:35:09,760
but I don't pass that modification to many of them.

733
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:22,420
Then remember, 111 necessary aspect of I try to be selective has to be passed from one generation to the other.

734
01:35:23,650 --> 01:35:30,950
Yet now they're saying that if I. Yeah.

735
01:35:31,020 --> 01:35:42,390
It's not exactly that. That's yeah, that's hard because we know that, for example, kids that were born with that low birth weight,

736
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:47,000
they have higher risk of type two diabetes and baby two by nutrition.

737
01:35:47,430 --> 01:35:54,870
And until you turn your life on, they are somebody who can recognize mechanisms, including epigenetics.

738
01:35:57,210 --> 01:36:04,440
But the from but again, from an evolutionary perspective, those modifications epigenetic modification,

739
01:36:04,850 --> 01:36:08,490
they are not transmitted let's say, for liquid to the offspring.

740
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:17,760
Then the the the translation does impact on those people has to be have passed from one generation to the other.

741
01:36:18,390 --> 01:36:22,860
It's a clear nothing. Yeah, it sounds like evolutionary theories.

742
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:29,900
Very so far because you have no way to directly.

743
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:35,959
Yes. So what then, Ali, is this Christine hypothesis?

744
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:39,770
But now, as I say, Main, you find these results.

745
01:36:40,130 --> 01:36:43,580
We can use genomic data at least to date. So we've had both these.

746
01:36:43,800 --> 01:36:52,250
So what that means we can we can do this to say, okay, I want to see whether this gene is under natural selection and we can do that.

747
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:56,840
We're able to do that using genomics data. But yes, some of these theories,

748
01:36:56,840 --> 01:37:10,340
some more mundane are very speculative because our theory to be scientific has to be at this would theory that it would be a good way to test it.

749
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:18,230
There is no way to test that. It is unscientific. Yep.

750
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:34,900
That's a good question. But I want you also to keep thinking how how other will not perspective inform your practice as a public health professional.

751
01:37:35,530 --> 01:37:42,010
How what is give you another another perspective, another point of view, how to approach a particular problem.

752
01:37:42,910 --> 01:37:48,670
I see what one might want for this class that even even is some of the hypotheses.

753
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:54,429
They are wrong. Or maybe there is no way to test the hypothesis.

754
01:37:54,430 --> 01:38:04,720
But how did how having a new perspective can inform what we know about public health professionals?

755
01:38:08,240 --> 01:38:10,969
Question. Okay.

756
01:38:10,970 --> 01:38:21,680
Then just to finalize I will post homework to later today would be a question related to two days later and about today and about the readings.

757
01:38:22,310 --> 01:38:30,710
And then next Monday, we will start the student presentation with the ancient diet.

758
01:38:31,250 --> 01:38:37,370
That's in the past. Okay. These are very nice topic because these are how do we know?

759
01:38:38,150 --> 01:38:42,080
What do we know? How do we know about the digestive systems?

760
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:50,870
Okay, then I want to go next Monday. Thank you. I said you were saying I'm going to talk about brains, humility.
