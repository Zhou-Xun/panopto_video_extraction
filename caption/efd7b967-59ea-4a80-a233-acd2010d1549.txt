1
00:00:08,813 --> 00:00:12,910
Climate change is a global issue
that requires a global response.

2
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,048
Unfortunately, that's not enough, we also
need responses at the national, state and

3
00:00:17,048 --> 00:00:18,170
local level.

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,707
In this module, we'll explore policies

5
00:00:20,707 --> 00:00:25,642
that have been implemented at all those
levels and see how effective they can be.

6
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:30,637
One approach that's been applied to try
to mitigate climate change impacts is so

7
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:35,900
called carbon taxing or what are called
emissions trading schemes or ETS is.

8
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:40,132
So the concept of putting a price on
carbon dioxide emissions is basically

9
00:00:40,132 --> 00:00:42,670
designed to help us tackle climate change.

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,298
And it's been spreading this concept
across the globe over the past 20

11
00:00:46,298 --> 00:00:46,960
years or so.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,420
We have two primary approaches here,
one is a so called carbon tax.

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,080
So this is basically placing a tax on
fossil fuel use specifically designed to

14
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:59,610
reduce that use for
climate change prevention.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:04,510
And the second is cap and trade or
again an emission trading scheme or ETS.

16
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,175
A cap is basically a limit on the total
amount of carbon that can be generated and

17
00:01:09,175 --> 00:01:13,010
ideally that cap gets stricter or
reduced over time.

18
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:15,866
The trade element here
allows companies to buy and

19
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:23,410
sell allowances to create carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

20
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,844
The good news here is that various schemes
designed to implement Carbon taxes or

21
00:01:27,844 --> 00:01:30,624
these emission trading
schemes have already been

22
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:34,920
implemented in various nations and
within nations around the world.

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,444
So you can see in the lower left corner
of the image here a legend showing

24
00:01:38,444 --> 00:01:42,010
the different types of
implementations that have occurred.

25
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,135
You can see there's a cluster of
implementation that's occurred

26
00:01:45,135 --> 00:01:46,780
within the European Union.

27
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:51,504
So many countries that have implemented
either an emissions trading scheme, or

28
00:01:51,504 --> 00:01:53,430
a carbon tax or both.

29
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,350
You can see that a number of
the larger producers including China,

30
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:02,740
are considering the ETS or a carbon tax,
Brazil is in that same category as well.

31
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,160
The United States unfortunately is not
acting on this at a federal level.

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,095
But you can see there are states within
the US that have already moved towards

33
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:13,233
either an emission Trading Scheme
under consideration, or

34
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:17,970
one actually already scheduled for
implementation.

35
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:22,537
So again, a bit of good news, the world
has 57 carbon pricing programs in place

36
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:26,769
right now that cover about 20% of
our global greenhouse gas emissions,

37
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:27,742
that's great.

38
00:02:27,742 --> 00:02:32,059
We can also think not about
carbon emission regulations but

39
00:02:32,059 --> 00:02:36,549
rather about policies to move
us towards renewable energy and

40
00:02:36,549 --> 00:02:42,900
in fact as of 2014, 144 countries
have implemented these policies.

41
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,206
As a result of this implementation,
there's about an 8% increase in

42
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:51,802
the fraction of energy produced that's
from renewable energy sources that

43
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:56,270
are used to create electricity
between the years 2007 and 2017.

44
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,949
So we are seeing the impacts of
these policies and that more and

45
00:02:59,949 --> 00:03:04,920
more countries are using more and
more renewable energy.

46
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,710
If we look back in 2005,
there are different colorations on the map

47
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,199
that you're looking at here, red meaning
countries that actually have policies in

48
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:16,193
place for renewable energy but
also specific targets.

49
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:19,378
And then the other countries
that are shown in orange and

50
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,988
yellow either have specific policies but
no targets or targets but no policies or

51
00:03:23,988 --> 00:03:25,850
no data at all in gray.

52
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:30,183
If we contrast 2005, where much of
the world has gray meaning they're

53
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:33,016
not really doing anything
to the year 2015.

54
00:03:33,016 --> 00:03:37,888
Where virtually every country on earth
is at least moving in the direction of

55
00:03:37,888 --> 00:03:38,725
requiring or

56
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:44,760
endorsing or encouraging renewable
energy policies, this is great news.

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,420
So let's look at the 50 United States and
consider them in different ways.

58
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,756
The map here is showing in green
states that have a declared target for

59
00:03:52,756 --> 00:03:54,910
greenhouse gas emissions.

60
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,640
So 22 states plus Washington DC
have set a target.

61
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,740
Now the targets differ by State and
they also differ by the baseline year.

62
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:06,568
So when you talk about implementing
a change, you have to say well a change

63
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:11,350
compared to what some states may say
a change compared to 1990 or 1995 or 2000.

64
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:16,250
But again, the good news is almost half of
States have some greenhouse gas emission

65
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,092
targets set.

66
00:04:17,092 --> 00:04:21,717
So this is mitigation, again, the idea
of eliminating our emissions to reduce

67
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:25,720
the speed at which climate change occurs.

68
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,440
We can also look at states
with carbon pricing policies.

69
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,949
So again, this is mitigation designed
to prevent us from releasing,

70
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:34,665
Greenhouse gas emissions
in the first place.

71
00:04:34,665 --> 00:04:38,045
So we have states that use cap and
trade only.

72
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:41,475
In fact, carbon taxes are under
consideration in some States.

73
00:04:41,475 --> 00:04:43,687
So California has a carbon tax goal but

74
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:48,475
the other States shown here have some
variation of a cap and trade programme.

75
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:54,670
So 12 of our 50 states have already moved
in this direction, again, great news.

76
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,593
Coming back to electricity and renewable
energy it turns out 29 states and those

77
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:04,465
are shown in purple here have adopted a so
called renewable portfolio standard.

78
00:05:04,465 --> 00:05:07,566
So they have some expectations and
requirements for

79
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:13,360
electricity production to shift away from
fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.

80
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,331
And so
you can see other States have also adopted

81
00:05:16,331 --> 00:05:19,977
different ways to encourage
the use of renewable energy.

82
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:24,491
Such that now the vast majority of
states have something in place to try to

83
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:29,090
encourage or again require renewable
energy use, so this is great news.

84
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,852
We're absolutely taking
action here at a local level,

85
00:05:31,852 --> 00:05:34,554
you can see that perhaps your
state is taking action and

86
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:38,110
the federal government is at
least acknowledging the problem.

87
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:41,985
And globally of course, there are many
countries that are moving in the direction

88
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:47,392
of implementing policies to reduce climate
change impacts and promote public health.
