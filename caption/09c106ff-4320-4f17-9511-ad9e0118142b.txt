1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:28,060
Oh. Did you want to?

2
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:38,880
So that's already open. So. Only elevator elevators, I was just like to take the stairs.

3
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:56,620
Yes, I know I do. That's.

4
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:16,440
I've given up on the other day said. And I know I look, I'm not trying to get anywhere, I'm just tired.

5
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:26,880
That is open another tab, so this is out of it. Yeah, OK, so I'm going to do the check in first and show them if that's OK.

6
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:47,800
All right. Well. Yes.

7
00:01:47,800 --> 00:02:10,330
Good afternoon, everybody. Was.

8
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:14,710
We're going to get started and we're going to start out with our check in.

9
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:22,360
Remember, this is a very brief thought that you might have for the first time right now.

10
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,820
This is not something you need to forget or do ahead necessarily.

11
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:32,080
It is. We come together like, OK, we've got 600.

12
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:40,960
All right. What are we talking about? Let's have a brief check in where you're trying to connect to something that's been going on.

13
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:50,470
So just a reminder that that is not a a deep, hard, significant requirement, but a thought.

14
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:57,040
And people have been talking about all kinds of interesting things short and long in the discussion.

15
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,030
And I encourage people to take a look at that.

16
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:09,010
Kempson is going to do a quick overview of the assignment due on Monday, because there have been a few questions about that.

17
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:11,560
Just a reminder to next week,

18
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:21,530
we're going to be talking about the Affordable Care Act and we're going to catch up to health insurance as it exists today.

19
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:28,360
And then we're going to be talking about insurance variation across all kinds of plans.

20
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,950
We're going to talk about price. We're going to talk about health expenditures.

21
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:38,710
We're going to talk about social determinants of health. All of that is coming out this week.

22
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:45,220
We're talking about the evolution of health insurance through 2010.

23
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:50,920
So before the Affordable Care Act. So today we've got questions that you're thinking about.

24
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:59,920
How does this work today? What's going on? We're not going to we're going to hold those to next week and subsequent weeks.

25
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,910
So then today we're going to end up talking more about this period.

26
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:15,370
And in particular, we're going to talk about the 65 to 2010 and then really take a deeper look at what was happening in the 20 the the early 2000s,

27
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:21,100
sort of leading up to the Affordable Care Act. OK, I'm going to turn this over.

28
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:27,580
Let's do our check in and then we'll turn it over to Kempson.

29
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,670
And I'm going to start just calling on people.

30
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:43,210
So this is not this is just a thought that you are thinking about related to health services in the US.

31
00:04:43,210 --> 00:05:06,160
So how about Abby? OK, so I came up and I'm so trying to find out if I had anything to do with you, this is sort of a five year old deal.

32
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,390
OK, so. Right. Details about him. But not none of those guys are crazy.

33
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:18,550
Right. Which is surprising. And we can talk more about that. OK, let's see.

34
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:26,610
How about, uh, Steve?

35
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:38,990
Steve here, no, Steve Werrington. Yeah, I would think about.

36
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:50,260
Right. Just wondering if you like, really.

37
00:05:50,260 --> 00:06:15,690
They're giving. OK, so the role of the Supreme Court in policy, health policy, Roe v. Wade,

38
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:22,800
of course, Roe v. Wade was a court case establishing and now changes in that.

39
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,120
And certainly when we talk about the Affordable Care Act, we're going to talk about the Supreme Court again.

40
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,580
So the role of what is policy, what is health policy?

41
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,840
I know you're talking about that in 615, those of you who are in that class a lot,

42
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:42,930
but you don't usually think about policy makers like Congress, people.

43
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:53,640
Right. Or health policy experts. But the Supreme Court obviously is a key actor in that in that policy world.

44
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:05,390
How about Margaret? So I was really interested to learn to make a big deal that.

45
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:18,250
Yeah, OK, so the gap for aging populations between coverage by Medicare and coverage by Medicaid.

46
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:22,420
Yeah, that's an important one that we from the beginning,

47
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:31,540
as you can see in these programs and continuing on so we can talk a little bit more about some of that today.

48
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:50,670
And so great job. Thank you, everyone. I'm going to turn this over to Kempson.

49
00:07:50,670 --> 00:08:01,540
But Ignatius's. OK, I don't think the mic is working.

50
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:10,510
Can you hear me OK, so I just wanted to briefly show everyone how to access the assignment just in case you haven't had a chance to look at it yet.

51
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:13,480
I know some people are already turning in their assignment,

52
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:27,490
but you're going to go to the assignment tab and then you're going to click on the state insurance access or a sheet and an exercise,

53
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:32,860
and then you'll see the website where it tells you to go to find the state facts.

54
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:40,630
So I just wanted to let you know that as far as the instructions where it talks about demographics and the economy,

55
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:48,130
these are actually indicators and health insurance or health coverage and uninsured is the other indicator.

56
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:56,350
But these, for example, would be categories that you would click on in order to answer the questions for the columns.

57
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:03,790
And I just wanted to show you briefly, let's say you're interested in population distribution by age.

58
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,530
The time frame is selected here, but you can also pick other options.

59
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:19,420
But I just wanted to quickly show you that if you're asked to look at a comparison between the U.S. and Colorado, for example,

60
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:29,770
that you can click here, oops, in the United States would allow you to see both rather than having to scroll all the way down.

61
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:35,500
But I just wanted to give you just an idea of what the website look like and how

62
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:42,550
to find potentially different indicators that will help you answer the questions.

63
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:46,730
So if you guys have any questions, feel free to send me an email.

64
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:52,900
Are there any questions anyone has now that I could answer? No.

65
00:09:52,900 --> 00:10:05,540
OK. We have to record a new session.

66
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:21,380
Do you think? I did.

67
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:32,480
The courtroom right now. OK, that seems right, right. Just click on it.

68
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:40,850
Do you think I need to start a new one? Well, now it's still recording.

69
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:47,740
OK. All right. Who knows?

70
00:10:47,740 --> 00:11:04,130
OK, so fine that see how we're going to be assigned virtually before the media reports or don't know.

71
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,990
So you're doing you're doing that.

72
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:16,770
He everybody's doing that individually and then you are bringing that with you on Tuesday and you will be working with the team on Tuesday.

73
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,440
You will be back with your team and you'll get the assignment in class on Tuesday.

74
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,550
OK, so it's just the first one on insurance do on camera or by.

75
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:40,690
But yeah. And you know, for class as a possibility because you're going to be using it with your team for class on Tuesday.

76
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:52,400
OK. OK, so I've been getting a lot of questions about really good questions about how to approach the reading and how to think about,

77
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:59,540
but taking notes on the reading and how much detail from the readings you need so that the

78
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:10,730
general point is that I'm never going to ask you for really specific details from our reading.

79
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,590
Right. What did they say of the 17 or what was in table three? Nothing like that.

80
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:25,670
It's for a high level. The main points that the you know, the exact two to three percent summary of what this article is about,

81
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:35,510
there are often concepts in there that you should be you're going to get worse either in the posted lectures or in our discussion in here.

82
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,860
And that's a clue to, OK, let's talk about underinsurance.

83
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,230
We're going to talk about that today. What's that mean? That's the concept that you should know.

84
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:52,970
So you're reaching for the high level understanding of what the article is about and

85
00:12:52,970 --> 00:13:01,690
some of the key terms that you will hear also reinforced in the lecture and cost well.

86
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:09,410
OK, and so kind of what I wanted to do is think a little bit about like this was our discussion on Tuesday.

87
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:12,960
So for that question, why do we value insurance?

88
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:22,190
Of course, materials that you could draw on for thinking about that or the posted lecture on what is insurance,

89
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:30,200
the some of the elements from the readings or all of the readings for Tuesday, why do we value it?

90
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:38,270
And people, of course, were also bringing their own individual experience and knowledge to that as well.

91
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:43,100
The other ones, for what effect does health insurance have on health?

92
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:48,560
I wanted to briefly talk about the summers, that all article that I mentioned,

93
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:54,200
because that was this really detailed study and summary of lots of evidence.

94
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:59,390
So we could use that. But what level of detail do you need?

95
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:08,510
So they ask they posed the question, does health health insurance affect health?

96
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:18,740
And they actually talk about that. This is complicated to answer that question, because the factors that affect in the U.S.,

97
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:31,550
whether you have insurance, also affects your health in your nation where you live your age.

98
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:42,290
And both of those things are changing over time. So trying to tease out the effect of one thing on another when they are already,

99
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:49,340
there's a number of factors that affect the both and they are changing over time is to be complicated.

100
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,570
So that's something to keep in mind. And then, you know,

101
00:14:53,570 --> 00:15:00,710
they're going to evaluate a bunch of different studies that the reason they talk about experimental and quasi experimental

102
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:12,190
design is just to say that's going to be a better way to try to tease out the relationship between these two ideas.

103
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:17,600
OK, how does health insurance affect health outcomes?

104
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:25,460
They present lots of detail about chronic disease and health outcomes.

105
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:37,850
You don't need to know all of those details, but you want to be able to say, how do you answer that question related to chronic disease?

106
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:43,550
You want to have some sense that it is not straightforward, it is not an easy.

107
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:50,810
Yes. Health insurance or. Always improves health outcomes. That's not what the evidence is showing,

108
00:15:50,810 --> 00:16:00,620
it's showing it has a lot of positive effect for the diagnosis and treatment for diabetes, for example, for depression.

109
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:12,980
We even see a decrease in depressive symptoms after gaining health insurance, better blood pressure control.

110
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:23,600
So these are all some examples of some improvements. Other studies found that there wasn't always a benefit on cholesterol control,

111
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:31,250
for example, no change for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, for example.

112
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:36,950
So it's not a straightforward, simple relationship.

113
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:45,920
That's the point you draw or you should be drawing from an article like this, right?

114
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:55,310
Definitely a positive relationship, but not always and sometimes no relationship at all, depending on how you look at it.

115
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:59,690
How about old self reported health? That's true. They had a bunch of things.

116
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:06,770
Mortality, different ways of measuring health is part of the answer and all the news.

117
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:15,930
We will see different relationships or.

118
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,520
How does health insurance affect health care, access and utilization?

119
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:26,490
That's a different question. Not the same as how does it affect health health outcomes?

120
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:33,540
How does it affect health care services, use and access?

121
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:39,660
What's a positive impact there, which is what we expect?

122
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:51,070
Health insurance is supposed to help you access health insurance, and that's exactly what you find most of the time.

123
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:58,290
Use of medications and following your medication regimen, etc.,

124
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:07,860
where it's a little bit mixed is on utilization of some things, for example, like emergency departments.

125
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:13,050
Again, I'm going through some of the details to make sure you get it.

126
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:24,030
But think about how you would summarize to a friend who's not on the program what the answer to this question is from this meeting.

127
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:32,490
What is the relationship? What effect does health insurance have on health care access and utilization?

128
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:40,020
That's what you want to try to get out of the readings. And the same finally was the last.

129
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:49,230
How does it affect overall well-being or how does it affect people's lives separately from health care and health outcomes?

130
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:57,030
Well, they find it has a big effect on financial security in all kinds of ways.

131
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:04,140
That was pretty uniformly found across the studies.

132
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:21,470
OK, does anybody have questions or comments about that and about how to approach the readings?

133
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:30,230
OK, so let's move on to today and getting back to some of what we're talking today.

134
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:38,040
The evolution of Medicare and Medicaid and getting up to 20, 2010, we're going to do a poll.

135
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:42,470
Actually, poll everywhere is not working on this computer.

136
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:48,230
You don't need to look at it right now. But I need to ask you this.

137
00:19:48,230 --> 00:20:07,090
Yeah, I don't know what. So who has questions about Medicare, Medicaid and the features of those programs?

138
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:22,160
Not today, we're not there yet, but when they were created.

139
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:32,060
So one of the four questions I had was, who is not eligible for Medicaid,

140
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:41,220
what group of people is not eligible for Medicaid in this period from Medicaid was created in 2010.

141
00:20:41,220 --> 00:21:01,030
However, no matter what their income is, even if their income is director who is still not eligible for Medicaid.

142
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:06,440
I mean, I just say that again to a very low.

143
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:25,480
Adults over the age of 18 will say single adults, not a single, not permanent adults over the age of 18 and below the age of 65.

144
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:41,810
We're not eligible for Medicaid, even if they have no problem at all, because that was how Medicaid was established.

145
00:21:41,810 --> 00:22:17,700
So over this entire period. Do people over 65, are they eligible for Medicaid?

146
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:24,470
OK, so more elders, people over 65, who are you?

147
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,740
How would you go can qualify for Medicaid.

148
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:40,500
They would have both Medicare and Medicaid and there are some details about how you actually can be complexity in who qualifies,

149
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:55,600
how they're their assets and income is counted. OK, so everybody's good on Medicare and Medicaid, no questions.

150
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:09,940
OK, great. All right, something else we need to talk about that happens over this period that is emerging even even before 65.

151
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:16,270
But as health insurance is emerging, is the insurance,

152
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:25,510
the private individual insurance market and we're talking about this again prior to the Affordable Care Act.

153
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:31,000
So the individual market, as it's called,

154
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:42,190
is distinct from the market for health insurance and employer sponsored insurance that you talked about emerging,

155
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:51,250
you know, in the 40s and beyond is health insurance because the employer,

156
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:56,440
the University of Michigan or Motor Company,

157
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:08,710
Wal-Mart or any of those employers are then purchasing an insurance plan or helping to purchase insurance plans for their employees.

158
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:27,010
And the employees are then OK, Medicare or Medicaid or insurance for Medicaid or Medicare is for people 65 and older.

159
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:39,490
And so there are some who are not going to be able to access any of those group plans.

160
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:49,880
Why would that those. Who are some of those people?

161
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:56,210
Small businesses who might not have group health plan to purchase that.

162
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:05,590
If so, if you're an employee at a small business, you don't have access to an employer sponsored group plan.

163
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:22,750
So you might want to go to the individual market. Freelance workers who are not who are self-employed or who work for contract work.

164
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:29,200
Yep, retired today. Retired people.

165
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:36,040
So retired people who are not yet 65.

166
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:41,720
Right. That might be the case.

167
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:58,330
Maybe some of those adult nonpregnant adults who, you know, the over 18 hundred sixty five, some of them, no matter what group they're in.

168
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:08,630
OK, unlike group insurance, where and we'll look at some of this again, a little bit more detail.

169
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:25,250
But when the University of Michigan offers insurance, health insurance plans to its employees, the employee decide to take it out to buy it or not.

170
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:38,900
But if I decide to buy it, which means I have to pay my part of the premium when I sign up, I get because I'm an employee of it.

171
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:45,100
And that's the way employer sponsored insurance works.

172
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:48,640
That is not how it works on the individual market,

173
00:26:48,640 --> 00:27:00,610
even if you can afford the premium and of course you're paying the full premium because there is no employer helping to cover that premium,

174
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:07,870
you do not necessarily they will not necessarily sell you that insurance policy.

175
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:12,250
You have to be approved for that policy.

176
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:24,040
And to be approved, they are going to look in detail at your medical and health history and they are going to apply experience rating.

177
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:32,620
You already know what that is. And certainly preexisting conditions are going to be applied.

178
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:42,940
Remember, this is before the Affordable Care Act. In addition, you could you could be approved and get the policy.

179
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:51,730
And if they discover something later on that they think either you were completely honest about or is just found

180
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:57,340
that you could have been revealed in that history about your health information or your medical information,

181
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:07,420
they can then say just cancel the policy and you actually have to retroactively either back or anything they might have covered.

182
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:26,030
So it operates very differently. And in fact, when so up to 2010, 17 or 18 million people or so had insurance through the individual market.

183
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:36,920
However, there were there were at least as many people, I think, do a number here.

184
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:48,210
So, however, at least that many people who couldn't get access to group insurance through employers or any other means

185
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:58,040
that essentially needed coverage on the individual market were rejected from the individual market.

186
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:05,600
And when I was teaching this is from 2004 in the early 2000s before the Affordable Care Act,

187
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,250
I used to have people read like an article like this from The New York Times,

188
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:23,810
which is about this high income couple in their 40s who could not buy insurance on the individual market because they were denied every time.

189
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:31,190
It wasn't because they couldn't afford it, it wasn't because they didn't want it.

190
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:40,520
But each of them had a health issue. One had, I think I think that was a male female couple.

191
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:46,070
And I think the male had some minor heart issue.

192
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:54,740
He didn't have heart disease. He didn't have any kind of serious disease that was treated being treated.

193
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:00,740
But there had been one episode of a something about 10 years earlier.

194
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:09,930
And because of that, no individual health insurance plan was willing to insure.

195
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:17,060
And she had something similar in her health background. So this is very different.

196
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:32,630
The premiums for the individual insurance market were not they were more expensive if we looked at one time, but not not that difference.

197
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:39,920
And it was partly because they were only insuring people who had very low health risk.

198
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:46,520
Right. They were just rejecting out of hand anybody with any potential health risk.

199
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:52,010
And then they were applying for existing conditions, some others to say, sure,

200
00:30:52,010 --> 00:30:57,440
we'll cover you for everything except your cardiac issues or your diabetes.

201
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:08,540
So those made the you know, it somewhat affordable for people who could be approved.

202
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:17,270
And one of the other ways that the private insurance market kind of operated,

203
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:26,690
though, was they offered lots of plans that didn't cover all health care services.

204
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:35,840
What we might today call essential benefits would be, in fact, what the Affordable Care Act called essential benefits.

205
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,560
So lots of people had a plan that didn't include maternity benefits.

206
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,680
So for lots of people, that would be a problem, not for all.

207
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:54,050
They didn't have substance use, mental health, certainly prescription drugs.

208
00:31:54,050 --> 00:32:01,780
And this is the category part of the category of this idea of under insurance.

209
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:06,310
Which was a major issue.

210
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:11,170
It still can be to some extent, but much less because of the Affordable Care Act,

211
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:21,520
but it is when you actually have insurance, but you're still at some financial risk, right?

212
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:33,640
In classic insurance terms. And that's either because the economic features of the insurance plan, it might have a very high deductible.

213
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:39,430
Next week, in the next two weeks, we're going to actually talk today about today's high deductible plans.

214
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:51,190
But when you have a high deductible plan, that means you are paying out of pocket for almost all of the health services that you need until,

215
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:57,730
you know, some some high dollar amount, five thousand or above, for example.

216
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:07,870
The other big way is the second category that the the individual insurance market plans to under insurance,

217
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:14,440
which is whole categories of service, are just excluded from coverage.

218
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:24,160
So you have health insurance, but you get pregnant. That's not covered by your health insurance.

219
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:36,220
Another way is that the services themselves are restricted to only a very few providers and certainly some other insurance plans do that sometimes,

220
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:53,470
but that's another way that people can be under insured. Sometimes the restrictions aren't just categories of services, but limits within categories.

221
00:33:53,470 --> 00:34:02,180
So in about 2007, my sister was diagnosed with breast cancer.

222
00:34:02,180 --> 00:34:08,260
It's not the good news story. She's fine. She got treatment.

223
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:13,540
She had one of these plans because she was self-employed.

224
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:20,110
She had you know, she she had a business.

225
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:27,700
She had the resources and income. But this was the only kind of plan she could get.

226
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:33,610
And she didn't know she was under insured until she was diagnosed with breast cancer.

227
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:44,110
And she calls me her sister, who knows something about health insurance and says, OK, I'm am going to start chemo.

228
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:51,160
How much coverage do I need for that? And her sister, who knows a lot about health insurance, said,

229
00:34:51,160 --> 00:35:00,220
I have no idea that they in so many ways, across every kind of plan across where you are,

230
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:07,180
across where you're getting the treatment, not to mention what kind of cancer you have and all of those things.

231
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:16,250
So she finds out that her coverage is going to be for about a thousand dollars per chemo treatment.

232
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:21,310
It calls me again, says it's a thousand dollars per treatment that's in my coverages.

233
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:31,150
Is that enough? Again, sadly, I have no idea because that's the area so much.

234
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:39,230
So she goes back to her doctor and finds out, no, her treatments are three thousand dollars a treatment.

235
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:44,530
Right. That's an example of under insurance.

236
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:49,910
She was lucky she had savings she could use to get the chemo.

237
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:54,100
She's fine today and doing very well.

238
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:59,020
No recurrence. So that's a good news story.

239
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:06,850
But that underinsurance imagine if that wasn't the case, that she didn't have savings,

240
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:12,460
that there wasn't going to be somebody to help pay for that yet.

241
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:18,710
You would just likely not get.

242
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:24,980
That's your insurance, so you've got an insurance plan in the individual market.

243
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:34,400
You're paying your premium every month, but you're not going to have the level of coverage that you need.

244
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:45,890
And this is just an example from I think this is from twenty, twenty ten prior to the Affordable Care Act again,

245
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:54,230
and showing the differences in the individual insurance market and that how this VIJENDER,

246
00:36:54,230 --> 00:37:03,500
for example, how different the the price of the policy will be.

247
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:09,260
And that's mostly because of maternity care.

248
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,070
So we're going to offer you a health insurance policy.

249
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:22,130
Oh, you want to make sure you have coverage for maternity care or we can charge you a lot more for that.

250
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:33,060
Some states, the blue I know this is fuzzy. Sorry, it's just copied from the web, prohibited discrimination based on gender.

251
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:49,850
But as you can see, lots of states allow that. And there a lot of variation across the individual insurance market prior to the Affordable Care Act.

252
00:37:49,850 --> 00:38:02,700
OK, questions or comments about that. Here is what like how do you get individual?

253
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:15,890
Look like prior to your. It would be like calling up Cigna or Humana or Aetna or, you know, and say finding out about their plans,

254
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:21,410
what they offer you, some states they only offer one type of plan.

255
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:32,690
Some states would often tell Vermont is up there as having no data to Vermont through a network of Monteux, probably.

256
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:38,810
No, you don't. But it's a little gray state. It's not a big gray state and Maine.

257
00:38:38,810 --> 00:38:49,640
And then there's a blue state and there's not a great state. That's what Vermont had policies in place that said every every insurer.

258
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:56,240
So health insurance is like all insurance is regulated at the state level.

259
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,530
So that's another piece to put in your notes and keep track of when we talk about

260
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:11,450
the level of variation across health care and health insurance in the United States.

261
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:18,230
It is partly because of state variations.

262
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:23,930
Some of that is Medicaid. Medicaid is a state based program.

263
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:33,140
So every state's Medicaid program looks different from the next states.

264
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:39,170
But the other reason is because insurance is regulated at the state level.

265
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:44,990
There are some broad federal regulations and policies that apply.

266
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:50,060
But essentially, states regulate insurance.

267
00:39:50,060 --> 00:40:03,620
And so Vermont has had a policy that said any insurer who offers health insurance in the state of Vermont has to offer or cover essential benefits.

268
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:16,880
It can't say maternity care is excluded. It can't say that, you know, substance use care or mental health care is excluded.

269
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:23,630
Every insurance plan has to cover a basic set of essential services.

270
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:32,720
And so lots of private insurers in the individual market just chose not to offer insurance anymore.

271
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:43,280
So the good thing was in Vermont, if you bought if you were able to buy insurance on the individual market, you had a full set of coverage.

272
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:50,720
The problem was not very many insurers would even offer those plans to people in Vermont.

273
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:56,000
So lots of reasons for state variation.

274
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:15,760
OK, so now let's think about some of the changes that were happening in this period, really from 2009 to 2010 prior to the Affordable Care Act.

275
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:27,550
We're going to look at what was happening in employer sponsored insurance and talk a little bit about that as one of the key drivers here.

276
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:39,190
So this is showing employers or firms that were offering health insurance to employees by the size of the firm, really?

277
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:49,630
So all firms is in orange and then small employers, three to nine employees in the blue.

278
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:58,660
So up until about 2010, we can see that the firms are offering health insurance,

279
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:07,540
has been declining, is declining over this period, changes a little bit year to year.

280
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:20,530
But in general, it was going down. And if we went back before 99, we were back into the 70s, we would see an entire.

281
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:37,530
There is a little change right there and then it drops back down again, so that's been about twenty ten we think might be going on there.

282
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:46,470
It is the debate about the Affordable Care Act that is happening in that period prior to the passage

283
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:56,130
of the Affordable Care Act that led to more companies start offering health insurance in that period.

284
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:04,440
It does get passed and they no longer offer insurance there.

285
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:14,490
So but the main point here is what was happening to employer sponsored insurance.

286
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:20,540
Fewer firms were offering insurance as a benefit to their employees.

287
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:31,910
Spencer. Yes, absolutely.

288
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:45,200
Absolutely. Well, I mean, maybe by 20, not 2009, 2010, there's some stimulus money that's being there that might have led to that.

289
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:58,870
But really what most analysts say is it was the Affordable Care Act kind of discussions that kind of spurred that increase that you see.

290
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:04,960
But certainly, right in the 08 end of 08, 09 is the financial crisis.

291
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:13,330
So companies are scaling back and some of them were stopping, offering insurance as a benefit.

292
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:21,880
But you can see that's been declining over this period, this decade anyway.

293
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:33,620
OK, so this is now employee. What the employees have to pay, right, is in the orange.

294
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:45,940
This is premiums over this time, the orange is what the worker what the employee is paying on average for employer sponsored insurance

295
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:56,410
compared to what the employer is contributing to that premium when they offer health benefits.

296
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:59,680
The other distinction here between the two columns,

297
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:07,060
so and this is single coverage to an individual employee and this is to an employee who has a family.

298
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:17,650
So it's for the premium for the families insurance. And then we have two categories of employers.

299
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:30,100
We have employers where most of the workforce is high wage versus employers where most of the workforce is low wage.

300
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:45,320
So who would be what's an example of these categories of the kind of companies that where most of the workers are high wage versus.

301
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:54,320
I've had great companies, but most of the workers are in low wage.

302
00:45:54,320 --> 00:46:00,830
OK, so a factory baby is the lower wage worker.

303
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:10,940
And that software company like Microsoft might be good example of a company where most of the workers are higher wage,

304
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,320
so factories or manufacturing maybe,

305
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:27,420
but also have that Walmart as an example or other kind of retail service industry where most of the workers are a lower wage.

306
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:34,730
OK, so that's what's going on here. The change,

307
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:45,590
some change and some real differences between these two groups and what kind of how much of the

308
00:46:45,590 --> 00:47:00,070
cost of the premium is being passed on to the employee that the employee would be responsible for?

309
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:08,170
For I don't know if this would be for. Workers and companies, but for those that are on the.

310
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:13,980
It is part of a union or something like that. What I can do because of the.

311
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:29,190
Well, usually the union would be negotiating, and that's high wage and lower wage would be negotiating for the overall coverage of the insurance plan,

312
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:33,900
as well as how much of a contribution the employees have to make.

313
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:48,690
So, absolutely. And so we don't have we could that could be another way you could look at data like this union company versus non union companies.

314
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:52,410
So, you know, if you work in a higher wage company,

315
00:47:52,410 --> 00:48:03,870
you're not only getting better coverage to the extent that you know you're getting a higher price insurance plan,

316
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:17,220
you're also paying a lower portion of that better insurance plan than employees say in lower wage industries.

317
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:25,140
And what that means is, you know, if you are just go back to this, you know,

318
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:33,720
you are a parent and a two parent household that may be your spouse doesn't work

319
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:40,320
or your spouse is also in a low wage job that might not even offer insurance.

320
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:46,590
And so here you are. Your employer is offering you insurance, an insurance plan,

321
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:57,090
but you have to come up with five thousand dollars a year in order to own that insurance, to buy that insurance.

322
00:48:57,090 --> 00:49:04,290
That five thousand dollars a year might be a big chunk of your income.

323
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:11,130
You might decide to not take up that insurance.

324
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:27,060
So here this is first. The bottom row is showing the companies that are or the percent of the workers who are eligible for health insurance.

325
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:32,370
It's sort of another way of thinking about how many companies are offering health insurance.

326
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:45,500
Now we're looking at it. What percent of the workers in these different kinds of firms are even eligible for health insurance?

327
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:56,600
And so lots of workers in low wage industries or low wage companies aren't even eligible for insurance.

328
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:03,200
We know this from, say, for example, companies like Wal-Mart, lots of people work part time.

329
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:12,260
Part time workers aren't even eligible to buy into the or even eligible for health insurance benefits.

330
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:29,680
Then the middle row is what percent of the employees who are eligible actually take up that insurance, actually buy it through the premium.

331
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:42,190
And then you get to the top row, which then ultimately tells us what percent of employees are actually covered by employer sponsored insurance,

332
00:50:42,190 --> 00:50:50,230
even in companies that offer employer sponsored insurance.

333
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:57,040
So the very first lines are looking at her, you know, at most two thirds of companies,

334
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:06,010
and that was declining over 2000, even offering health insurance as a benefit to their employees.

335
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:18,370
They're passing along more of the cost of the premium to those employees, particularly in the lower wage industries.

336
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:24,730
And so fewer employees, your employees are eligible.

337
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:31,300
And then even among those who are eligible, fewer of them are taking up the insurance.

338
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:44,660
And we end up with lower numbers of employees covered by employer sponsored insurance.

339
00:51:44,660 --> 00:52:02,060
And that's basically what this says. So where we get to is by 2010 or throughout the 2000s, our accidental system,

340
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:19,890
which was health insurance provided through employers, which had some really in some ways beneficial features early on.

341
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:29,820
And then he supplemented that accidental system of employer sponsored insurance with government programs like Medicare and Medicaid

342
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:43,260
because employer sponsored insurance is not covering people who are no longer working 65 or people who are unemployed and poor.

343
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:56,340
So the government programs, Medicare and Medicaid came along to bolster that accidental employer sponsored insurance kind of model.

344
00:52:56,340 --> 00:53:07,690
But by the 2000s, fewer and fewer people are being covered by employer sponsored insurance.

345
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:20,090
And so if you work for a small company that isn't offering insurance, you can try to buy insurance on the individual market, but we already saw that.

346
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:30,040
That's really hard to get. If you were poor, you might not qualify for Medicaid if your state,

347
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:38,280
if you're a single adult male, doesn't matter because you're not going to qualify for Medicaid.

348
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,270
All right, why do you think what are some factors?

349
00:53:42,270 --> 00:54:18,770
What are some things changing in the economy or in society that might be leading to these factors?

350
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:31,490
OK, then that was in in high wage employer groups, they would typically be offering health insurance,

351
00:54:31,490 --> 00:54:43,700
but they they could be passing along more of the, you know, the cost of the premium to those high income workers.

352
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:49,800
But maybe, you know, as you talk about state wages going up so that wages from an employer through.

353
00:54:49,800 --> 00:55:05,940
But what are some other ways that people were starting to some of the reasons that you didn't have the individual market that we were talking about?

354
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:13,620
But I think it has something to do with the reduction in manufacturing jobs in the United States.

355
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:17,520
OK, so that's that's a different factor, right?

356
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:24,150
As those used in manufacturing and factory jobs were disappearing.

357
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:35,010
That means the benefits that those unions had bargained for were also going away.

358
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:43,320
So the decline in manufacturing in the U.S. starting in the 70s,

359
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:55,470
up through the 2000s was then resulting in fewer people being covered by employer sponsored insurance.

360
00:55:55,470 --> 00:56:03,560
So that's one of the factors.

361
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:16,850
So, yes, as some of those, they might be a high salary for high income workers, they are contract workers, they might be,

362
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:27,620
you know, engineers who work for different kinds of software firms but are hiring on a contract basis, not as an employee.

363
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:34,250
Contract workers are not offered and benefits.

364
00:56:34,250 --> 00:56:44,750
That's one of the differences between them. They might get paid more than you, but they don't get offered benefits.

365
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:58,280
And so they have to hire them. They might be able to get some of them, you know, not a good driver in that the economy is high income, certainly.

366
00:56:58,280 --> 00:57:05,270
But the high income was how the income with which they might be able to purchase insurance on the individual market.

367
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:12,920
And yet, of course, they had to face the restrictions, the health restrictions that might be found in that market.

368
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:25,980
So if you were people with insurance on the high end manufacturing, what other factors might happen?

369
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:39,510
Health care costs were rising dramatically. They they've been rising pretty much steadily, typically double inflation.

370
00:57:39,510 --> 00:57:48,150
So that's probably why we talk about health costs are rising, all costs are rising, oil prices are going up.

371
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:55,000
But how much health care services prices go up higher than the rate of inflation.

372
00:57:55,000 --> 00:58:08,190
So those changes. And so as health care costs go up, health insurance costs of those premiums go up.

373
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:16,020
And that means fewer employers offer it. That means fewer employers want to pay the same chunk of the premium.

374
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:22,680
And that's why fewer employees no longer offer that insurance.

375
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:32,460
So that's also helping the.

376
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:43,080
Health information privacy, oh, I don't know that that was having a negative effect on participating in insurance,

377
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:56,100
that you can help ensure our health information. Privacy sometimes influences individuals in whether they want to pay cash versus use their insurance.

378
00:58:56,100 --> 00:59:03,960
But I don't think it was it was affected whether people would actually buy insurance or take up insurance.

379
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:15,400
So some new ones there probably not one of the big factors behind the changes you're talking about.

380
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:32,040
More. You people change doctors now often, oh, jobs, so job change is just as matters a lot for health insurance.

381
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:43,740
But as you listen to the video, one of the video lectures about so you know what the risk is, and COBRA,

382
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:56,820
not a COBRA and PIPA, were initially created to help enable people to jobs and keep their insurance to some extent.

383
00:59:56,820 --> 01:00:01,560
And so as people are moving drugs and I think you're right, in this period,

384
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:12,410
people are less likely to stay with that same employer for their whole lives or even for decades.

385
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:25,850
The that affected whether they would have access to insurance or not, because Cobra health, you be able to keep your insurance.

386
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:29,990
But what's the care? What's a characteristic of COBRA?

387
01:00:29,990 --> 01:00:46,230
So COBRA is I've got employer sponsored insurance, but I'm going to do this job, can go to another job and I'm going to lose my insurance.

388
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:55,530
OK, you have to pay the entire premium plus plus two or three percent, so the entire premium product that you used to pay,

389
01:00:55,530 --> 01:01:02,490
but what you used to pay an employee is a plus two or three percent because there's an administrative fee there.

390
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:10,020
So if you are going to be starting another job, but not for six months or something like that, you like this job,

391
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:21,990
you could hold on to your insurance, but only if you will pay for that premium less than out of pocket.

392
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:29,580
So that is better than totally losing your insurance and that facing preexisting exclusions.

393
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:32,100
But lots of people couldn't afford that.

394
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:47,780
So as people are changing jobs, even though COBRA protections and legal protections were put in place, people were losing that insurance.

395
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:55,310
Lots of new jobs that were created over this period in the 2000s,

396
01:01:55,310 --> 01:02:00,170
so we talked about lots of these were small firms that never even offered insurance

397
01:02:00,170 --> 01:02:07,880
at all because they couldn't really get plans in there that were affordable.

398
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:16,500
There are too small. Talked about the gig economy, self employment.

399
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:23,430
You know, the female labor force participation rate, that's what LSP is.

400
01:02:23,430 --> 01:02:39,030
Labor force participation by women, particularly mothers of young children, increased dramatically in that period from the 80s to 2010.

401
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:50,190
And they were taking jobs either full time service jobs that may or may not have offered insurance.

402
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:58,980
Marriage rates had changed. So they might be single moms where you might have a dual income household with children.

403
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:09,120
But oftentimes those newer jobs and the people who help them, typically women will not offer insurance.

404
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:25,360
So the service sector, retail sector, where a lot of women who entered the labor force in this period went to did not offer health benefits.

405
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:38,460
And then, as we said, the rising cost of care and insurance.

406
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:46,410
So just thinking about that and now what we know about the parts of the health care system, so this is an easy one.

407
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:57,930
Why don't the programs the government started to help bolster the employer sponsored model of health insurance in the US.

408
01:03:57,930 --> 01:04:17,620
Why don't why were they able to. Help in this situation as lots of people were losing their insurance.

409
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:31,130
All right, me. Sorry, say that again, you know, the.

410
01:04:31,130 --> 01:04:39,200
OK, from a policy perspective, you're saying we as a society and the government didn't expand those programs.

411
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,970
That's true. So the programs didn't change.

412
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:53,120
But why don't these programs work to help cover some of these people losing insurance?

413
01:04:53,120 --> 01:05:07,160
They don't qualify for that, right? It's they those programs are not available to all of these people who are losing insurance over this period.

414
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:19,910
Medicaid is only for people with under the federal poverty line and who have another qualifying characteristic.

415
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:28,880
And if you didn't have that and you did not qualify for Medicaid.

416
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:38,300
Medicare, 65 and older, you also have supplemental insurance that I didn't talk a lot about for for the disabled.

417
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:51,530
Why do the people certain categories there, but but very, very stringent set of criteria to qualify.

418
01:05:51,530 --> 01:06:02,870
So the programs that were in place around and to bolster the employer sponsored insurance were

419
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:15,620
not going to be helpful to all of these people who are now who are no longer getting insurance.

420
01:06:15,620 --> 01:06:22,090
And so then why weren't they just buying it on the individual market?

421
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:38,800
The cost of that individual market insurance might be too high for them, but he's resisting the conditions they wanted and approved.

422
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:47,290
Well, that's a good one. Lots of people have said I'm young and healthy, I don't need insurance.

423
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:56,020
So think about all those people in the in the workforce where they're getting that they're getting offered insurance by their employer.

424
01:06:56,020 --> 01:07:01,420
Now, if I had a that, you know what I really mean?

425
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:08,920
It would take my chances young and healthy. And, you know, when you think about it, you might think, well, I might need to go to the doctor.

426
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:18,080
I can use less out of pocket or something like that. That's way better than five thousand dollars in a premium for year.

427
01:07:18,080 --> 01:07:33,320
So it wasn't bad year, but I.

428
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:46,330
I like to play a role that now we know, like the. So self-diagnosis himself because of the Internet.

429
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:54,190
That I would want to want to see that as a big factor, but that might have been contributing, I think,

430
01:07:54,190 --> 01:08:12,830
like you said to some people deciding, like I'll I'll pay out of pocket if if it's something that he's serious or important for, like.

431
01:08:12,830 --> 01:08:28,460
Right. That is part of that can be an added benefit from your employer as part of your influence is to benefit from your employer and.

432
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:35,650
I kind of think it helps me how they prove they are independent of the Affordable Care Act,

433
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:42,250
but they really keep more of a thing because of the Affordable Care Act.

434
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:53,180
So let's started the case at all stages of how to do something your employer allows you to do, take some money through tax.

435
01:08:53,180 --> 01:09:04,640
What do you do two and a half and then you can use that to pay for when you have to pay services to your deductible or out of pocket.

436
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:12,920
So it's a little bit to say it's a little bit of help there, but it's your own money.

437
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:47,280
It's not like if somebody else is your employee's income.

438
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:53,850
Exactly, so we can talk about that a little bit, too, with high deductible plans,

439
01:09:53,850 --> 01:10:00,720
all of which have been happening, increased quite a bit since the Affordable Care Act.

440
01:10:00,720 --> 01:10:06,030
They are working hard to encourage that through the Affordable Care Act.

441
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:12,810
So high deductible plans and so savings account, whether you have a high deductible plan or not,

442
01:10:12,810 --> 01:10:24,370
so that you are in sort of a force saving for the employee themselves to pay for health services.

443
01:10:24,370 --> 01:10:32,540
Yes.

444
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:44,730
So a retirement account is another kind of an employee or benefits that they offer to to their employees, they might offer you a retirement plan that.

445
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:55,820
So during the holidays, when we talk about employers trying to offer benefits to their employees and health insurance is one of those benefits,

446
01:10:55,820 --> 01:11:04,240
retirement plans or another type that they were offering at that time?

447
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:22,870
OK, so we get to 2010 and we are here are the you we're at 18 percent uninsured and this is looking at the non elderly.

448
01:11:22,870 --> 01:11:35,740
Why the growth have a level of insurance coverage live on non.

449
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:51,450
The. All of them are automatically covered by Medicare, Medicare up until this period will be only to over 65,

450
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:57,550
is the only group in the United States that has universal health insurance.

451
01:11:57,550 --> 01:12:10,209
Right, and so when we want to try to understand what percent of the population is uninsured, looking at the under 65 population makes.

452
01:12:19,069 --> 01:12:30,709
So fifty one percent, half of those who are uninsured are actually making under one hundred thirty nine

453
01:12:30,709 --> 01:12:37,879
percent of the federal poverty line in some states that qualify for Medicaid.

454
01:12:37,879 --> 01:12:46,179
The issue is in lots of states it does not qualify for Medicaid and you're still Medicaid.

455
01:12:46,179 --> 01:12:57,769
2011 is still income under the federal poverty line and another characteris.

456
01:12:57,769 --> 01:13:05,859
I was just curious about this, because if your.

457
01:13:05,859 --> 01:13:14,409
This. So green cards would be still covered, right?

458
01:13:14,409 --> 01:13:31,249
Yes, undocumented and some of that is changing through this period to avoid being explicitly excluded from programs like Medicaid.

459
01:13:31,249 --> 01:13:35,739
The Medicare Part look the of.

460
01:13:35,739 --> 01:13:41,879
They're they're all. I know that piece of paper.

461
01:13:41,879 --> 01:13:53,879
At least, you know, so that is traditional Medicare Part A, part B, that's traditional Medicare.

462
01:13:53,879 --> 01:14:03,719
Most Medicare beneficiaries have part A, B, and they have a percentage of the premium that they have to pay.

463
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:13,919
They have some out-of-pocket costs. Part D of Medicare was added to cover prescription drugs.

464
01:14:13,919 --> 01:14:27,719
And so lots of the majority of the Medicare population has passed A and B, and they're now part B, although not everybody pays for.

465
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:41,589
Reimer. And about 10 to 12 percent of the Medicare population has seen, which is an integrated delivery plan,

466
01:14:41,589 --> 01:14:53,209
which is not that they don't have a deductible, it is more like a managed care plan.

467
01:14:53,209 --> 01:15:00,119
And that's still the case today, actually, certainly was before the Affordable Care Act.

468
01:15:00,119 --> 01:15:06,529
OK, I'll ask questions or comments about the individual market.

469
01:15:06,529 --> 01:15:16,249
Medicare and Medicaid, uninsured on insurance changes leading up to the Affordable Care Act.

470
01:15:16,249 --> 01:15:27,229
We should if you don't know about the Affordable Care Act, then know we'll talk about that next week and some of the recorded lectures.

471
01:15:27,229 --> 01:15:29,789
But you couldn't if you know a little bit about it,

472
01:15:29,789 --> 01:15:41,979
you can start to see already why the Affordable Care Act was structured as it was just by looking at this one.

473
01:15:41,979 --> 01:15:50,809
So think about that as you go into learning about the Affordable Care Act.

474
01:15:50,809 --> 01:16:06,729
OK, thank you. See you. Have a good weekend. Is that what this is?

475
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:08,173
Yeah.
