1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,469
Divya Manohar: Question right yeah yeah I have in case though the infection was record and see it could happen again and, unlike this question, where it says that once you have it, you have an immunity.

2
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,640
Divya Manohar: So would we and given the episode of infection say seven days so will be added the rest of the days to this or.

3
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,760
Divya Manohar: The person is again actress great.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:31,140
Alison Mondul (she/her): yeah I think that's correct, so I think um you know we're not I don't I don't think we're asking you any questions like that, on the exam because.

5
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,240
Alison Mondul (she/her): it's more complicated.

6
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,670
Alison Mondul (she/her): But yes, you are correct that once you know if somebody can have.

7
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:50,940
Alison Mondul (she/her): could have the disease again like once they recovered, they would go back and the at risk pool right so then once they've recovered, they would start contributing person time to the denominator at risk again.

8
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,720
Alison Mondul (she/her): And they could become a case multiple times right.

9
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,460
Divya Manohar: Yes, thank you.

10
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:06,000
Alison Mondul (she/her): So there are certainly in in real life there are certainly times when that would be the correct way to calculate person time at risk.

11
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,780
Alison Mondul (she/her): But I mean when you're trying to teach people how to do it, so it.

12
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:26,340
Nolaundron Harris: will be have the what would what's the time frame like how much time we have to take the exam.

13
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,020
Alison Mondul (she/her): You have from 130 till five.

14
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,630
Alison Mondul (she/her): And i'm going to give you i'm going to give you my spiel.

15
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,440
Alison Mondul (she/her): Everyone is always like will I will I have enough time will I be pressed for time and and I hate I hate that question because, and not because it's an.

16
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:53,460
Alison Mondul (she/her): invalid question on your part, but just because everybody's different like when I took the exams, I never went back and checked, because I would always second guess myself and.

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,080
Nolaundron Harris: Changing the answer.

18
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,830
Alison Mondul (she/her): that's the kind of test taker I always was right, I would, so I would just go through.

19
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:01,860
Alison Mondul (she/her): And that would be it and I wouldn't like go back and recheck everything.

20
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:07,050
Alison Mondul (she/her): I also have students who are we checkers right and so they'll like they'll be kind of done but then they'll just go back and.

21
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:15,750
Alison Mondul (she/her): If you give them three and a half hours they'll spend three and a half hours double checking everything and that's also a perfectly valid way to take a test.

22
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:30,060
Alison Mondul (she/her): I think if you have been struggling a lot with time on the in class exercises, then you might struggle with time on this test, but most students complete it.

23
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:32,730
Alison Mondul (she/her): Does that make sense.

24
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:43,260
Alison Mondul (she/her): anybody else have other questions about.

25
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,450
Alison Mondul (she/her): The.

26
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:54,660
Alison Mondul (she/her): Practice problems or any of the lectures or any of the in class exercises have any you know anything at all, I should stop listening things, because if you can ask me any.

27
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,940
Alison Mondul (she/her): The AMA.

28
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:12,870
Nolaundron Harris: Is there any tricky wording we need to pay attention to So for me, I think I just was thrown off with the word control, for some reason my brain was not lacking that and so when are we going to have another situation like that possibly.

29
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:20,880
Alison Mondul (she/her): Not that I know of so past years have used some of these questions, and they are pretty well.

30
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:30,180
Alison Mondul (she/her): vetted at this point, so I think if there were something very tricky that trip people up kind of in general we've been know with these questions by now.

31
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,680
Alison Mondul (she/her): And that said one of us is going to be on the zoom the entire time, so if you have something like that you're more than welcome to ask.

32
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:46,170
Alison Mondul (she/her): Your correct, we have not done case control studies, yet, and so I think that's why that wording was a little bit tricky and I apologize for that, so I.

33
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:58,830
Alison Mondul (she/her): It is always my goal, not to be, and if there's wording stuff that makes you, you know that you're unclear on certainly login to zoom and ask us and we will do our best, you know if we can answer, without giving away the answer will do that.

34
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,950
Alison Mondul (she/her): Denise asked in chat you are not required to take the test if you're not taking the course for credit.

35
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:17,100
Alison Mondul (she/her): That said, I do think it's a good way to kind of see where you're at and what your understanding the material is so if you have time to take it, I encourage you to do so.

36
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:29,910
Abby Sossen (she/her): I have a question about showing your work so like if I do my work out by hand.

37
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,610
Abby Sossen (she/her): what's How are we supposed to like.

38
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,540
brenda.w.campbell: uploaded or.

39
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:42,360
Alison Mondul (she/her): There is a way I believe alley and Rachel can you just double check that i'm right about that, I think you can upload in addition to just answering the questions on canvas.

40
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:54,990
Alison Mondul (she/her): You can also upload a file to the with your exam I believe I have had students scan it and, like uploaded to the PDF i've had them take pictures with their phone and upload the pictures.

41
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:03,960
Alison Mondul (she/her): um However, you can do it i've had students type it in word which I agree, is not ideal for math and I wouldn't want to do it that way, I would want to be able to chicken scratch it.

42
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:17,250
Alison Mondul (she/her): But yes, if you do show your work, because we will give partial credit like if you if you've got the idea right, and you know missed one silly math error or something like you would get.

43
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,430
Alison Mondul (she/her): Right points here, and I mean like so definitely I encourage you to share your work.

44
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:29,370
Alison Mondul (she/her): If you have trouble uploading I mean i'm not going to be a jerk about this like if you can't get it to upload on canvas email it to me in the ta is right, like.

45
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:44,250
Alison Mondul (she/her): Like I said, you can take pictures with your phone if you have a scanner you can scan it whatever works best, am I, being a dumb gen X or and forgetting some very obvious piece of technology that I should not be forgetting.

46
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:49,830
Abby Sossen (she/her): The phone picture works for me if I can just like because I tend to do it out by hand yeah.

47
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,900
Alison Mondul (she/her): that's fine with us just.

48
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:58,650
Nolaundron Harris: People if people have tablets and can write that way that's the way the same things to.

49
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:08,490
Alison Mondul (she/her): that's true you can like write it on the tablet and then save that little screen, I actually this might be me being old also but I don't I really don't like writing on.

50
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:19,170
Alison Mondul (she/her): How it's like that i'm going to show you while we're chit chatting to show you my new favorite toy does anybody else have one of these rocket book or know about it.

51
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,200
Alison Mondul (she/her): These things are fantastic it's like it's like paper.

52
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,800
Alison Mondul (she/her): But it has like you can write on it, and then you use like a special pen like a friction pen that wipes off with water.

53
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:45,060
Alison Mondul (she/her): And it's got the little qr code in the bottom and so there's an APP on your phone, you can just write like it's paper and pen and then scan it with your phone, it will save it as a PDF and email it to you or text it to you or put it in you can do.

54
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:54,840
Alison Mondul (she/her): upload it to like one note and all kinds of stuff so for those of us who don't actually like writing on a touch screen with the pen because our hand always touches the stupid thing and makes a.

55
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,230
Alison Mondul (she/her): it's a really great like reusable.

56
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:20,490
Alison Mondul (she/her): high tech gadgets catch exactly so but they're only like 2030 bucks on Amazon they come in different sizes, you can buy a whole pack of fun colored pens, since my side my side office supplies, this is office supplies corner of episode 709 okay opposite wise corner, yes, called rocket book.

57
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:25,980
Alison Mondul (she/her): i'll find that i'll find the Amazon link and drop it in chat if someone reminds me.

58
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,510
Abby Sossen (she/her): All right, i'll ask another question i'm always looking for shoes.

59
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,470
Alison Mondul (she/her): Before exams.

60
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:48,180
Abby Sossen (she/her): So on the practice problems, all the data was sort of typed up like you had typed it up and cables and stuff like that we didn't have to pull it from like raw sources, like in the exercises that how the exam will be yes.

61
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,530
Alison Mondul (she/her): But as an example of how the exercises are much more.

62
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,870
Alison Mondul (she/her): The exercises are a little bit more complex than the exam.

63
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,510
Alison Mondul (she/her): Like the exercises stretch you a little bit more because you're working in a group and it's you know to learn.

64
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:09,030
Abby Sossen (she/her): takes more time when you have to go through those like that the raw data tables and.

65
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:14,100
Abby Sossen (she/her): Make your own tables and everything, but if you put it in tables like that it makes it.

66
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,400
Abby Sossen (she/her): yeah.

67
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:18,300
Alison Mondul (she/her): This is the practice pro hockey the practice problems are very.

68
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:27,060
Alison Mondul (she/her): Very indicative of of the kinds of problems that are going to be on the exam and how they will be given to you it's a good example of that.

69
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:34,530
Abby Sossen (she/her): Now, with problems like the quizzes that were sort of like conceptual are like not math based problems.

70
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,870
Alison Mondul (she/her): yeah if you yeah okay.

71
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:48,690
Alison Mondul (she/her): Yes, so the quizzes are also a good example, but you saw like with the math in the practice problems they were like, for example, with the um.

72
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:58,020
Alison Mondul (she/her): each generation they're like fewer categories right because we want to see that you can do it, but you don't have to do, eight right that kind of thing does that make sense.

73
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,220
yeah.

74
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,960
Alison Mondul (she/her): Other other questions.

75
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:23,070
Mostafa Fakhruldin: I guess just quick clarification, so you don't really have to jump on zoom unless you like you have a question just correct yeah alright cool.

76
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:33,000
Mostafa Fakhruldin: sounds good, I guess, so a follow up as well, so in canvas like when you hover the.

77
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:37,200
Mostafa Fakhruldin: The exam says there's like.

78
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,390
Mostafa Fakhruldin: 40 questions.

79
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:52,410
Mostafa Fakhruldin: So i'm like the practice exam or the exam review has like nine books like broccoli that sessions yeah is that what like the 40 will accumulate to within the.

80
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:02,910
Alison Mondul (she/her): Elio major can you guys take a quick look and see how how the actual exam.

81
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,970
Alison Mondul (she/her): breaks down in terms of like.

82
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:16,410
Alison Mondul (she/her): I think we didn't have, I think the 40 questions are all the parts like I don't think there's like 40 questions with multiple parts that I might be mistaken.

83
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,840
Alison Mondul (she/her): While they look that up.

84
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:44,430
Alli Seeley: yeah, so I think it's a lot, like the practice exam in the sense that there's um multipart questions.

85
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,020
Alli Seeley: But there's also.

86
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,680
Alli Seeley: A couple like stand alone multiple choice to.

87
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:58,680
Alli Seeley: me see how I actually was the choice, there are so I can see, I think there's like 15 accounted.

88
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,360
Rachael Jade Beer: For your question.

89
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:12,690
Rachael Jade Beer: Like towns like each individual part of the contract and there's a total boring.

90
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,860
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay, so there's several parts so there's one part, that is.

91
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,070
Alison Mondul (she/her): True false right there's.

92
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:33,540
Alison Mondul (she/her): Like 10 true false questions nine true false questions something like that right then there's multiple choice questions there's like words.

93
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:38,700
Alison Mondul (she/her): Like seven of those and they're short answer.

94
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:46,740
Alison Mondul (she/her): i'm like one short answer question and then there's some problem solving which are more like what you were given in the in the.

95
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:59,460
Alison Mondul (she/her): So the true false and multiple choice The short answer are going to be more like the quiz questions, I would say, and then the problem solving are going to be more like the the practice exam questions and those do have.

96
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:11,790
Alison Mondul (she/her): parts that add up to 40 so it's not like you have 44 questions that have multiple parts, the parts are counted as individual questions for the problems.

97
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,480
Alison Mondul (she/her): That help.

98
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,820
Mostafa Fakhruldin: So this Thank you you're welcome.

99
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,480
Other questions.

100
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,470
Alison Mondul (she/her): Good everybody feel good about the practice problems when you check them.

101
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:47,790
Yes.

102
00:12:50,580 --> 00:13:03,240
Nolaundron Harris: It was just a bit tricky tricky wording, but sometimes when you just slip those small details, yes, changes the math you have so that's what I catch myself on.

103
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:12,270
Alison Mondul (she/her): yeah and and I, you know some of these these practice problems are from other courses, maybe i'm.

104
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:25,350
Alison Mondul (she/her): You know, writing these is hard so i've gotten them from lots of sources, to give you examples of practice problems so like previous years of other courses that used to be taught and that kind of thing, and so what might happen is.

105
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:35,550
Alison Mondul (she/her): They might have taught something in a different order right so maybe they learn about case control and then, then they learned about this, and so that's why the word in here in the in the practices may not be exactly perfect.

106
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:42,630
Alison Mondul (she/her): I think there might be something that practice where we asked you about or there's a risk ratio or something like that which of course we haven't gotten to.

107
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:54,330
Alison Mondul (she/her): be asked about on the exam right so so the practice problems may not be perfect, in that sense, but they should have given you some some practice doing the calculations that are going to be important for the exam.

108
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:04,380
Alison Mondul (she/her): But again, if there's something like that that doesn't make sense to you that you think is tricky absolutely log on to zoom and ask us and we will try to clarify it.

109
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:09,930
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay well.

110
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,890
Alison Mondul (she/her): gosh you guys are confident huh.

111
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,160
Alison Mondul (she/her): and ready to go you're like bring on that exam.

112
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:27,120
Alison Mondul (she/her): All right, in that case I will go ahead and do um.

113
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:34,800
Alison Mondul (she/her): My kind of bonus lecture that will not be on the exam will not be tested on it, but I think it's a good thing to know about.

114
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:45,540
Alison Mondul (she/her): And so I will give this lecture and we'll take depending on how long it takes, we might take a little break in the middle, and if you guys think of other questions, we will.

115
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,040
Alison Mondul (she/her): certainly take those at the end.

116
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,140
Okay.

117
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:07,170
Alison Mondul (she/her): All right, so this is a course that I teach in the residential program and also that I have adapted for our coursera program here at university of Michigan.

118
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:18,540
Alison Mondul (she/her): And I think it's a really good course ali's going to take it, so this is like a little overview of what's going to be covered, this is coated like the non detailed version of of kind of what's covered in that class.

119
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:24,240
Alison Mondul (she/her): The class obviously goes into more detail because i'm conducting this down into a bit of an overview.

120
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:26,880
Alison Mondul (she/her): um.

121
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:38,700
Alison Mondul (she/her): But I think this is useful for people who are new to public health, this is, these are basically free data that are publicly available that people can use for research.

122
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,860
Alison Mondul (she/her): And I think it's good to know about them and how to access them that they're out there okay.

123
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:54,600
Alison Mondul (she/her): So i'm going to start with us census data, this has come up a bit in some of our some of our problems as easy as using these data for like denominators for rates and things like that.

124
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:07,230
Alison Mondul (she/her): US census is decennial meeting and is conducted every 10 years the first census was in 1790 so 22 have been conducted actually making 23 now because I think I made these slides before 20 20th.

125
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:19,260
Alison Mondul (she/her): it's actually mandated by the US Constitution and refusing are neglecting to answer this is this is apparently punishable by find this helpful I don't know if anybody who's ever been fired for not answering the census, but apparently you could be.

126
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:27,510
Alison Mondul (she/her): So how are these day to us we'll sort of number one with the bullet, of course, is to determine the distribution of Congressional seats to the States right.

127
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:38,220
Alison Mondul (she/her): and define legislature districts and school district assignment areas they planning decisions to do to do so at the long end of this long list is public health right.

128
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:44,910
Alison Mondul (she/her): So what this tells me is that these data are not collected for the purpose of doing health research okay we're kind of.

129
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:56,010
Alison Mondul (she/her): using them because they're there and they provide really good population estimates as denominators but for a lot of other things they weren't really collected for our purposes, which makes them not perfect right.

130
00:16:57,330 --> 00:17:13,200
Alison Mondul (she/her): um you know, like I said the Sentinel census of population housing is collected every 10 years there's also this other program of the census called the American Community survey or the ACS how many of you guys have heard the ACS before.

131
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:37,560
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay, so the American Community survey is an ongoing the survey that actually samples a small percentage of the population every year and it's done in this way that a lot of these population studies are done such that the data, you can do math to make sure that they are nationally representative.

132
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:43,860
Alison Mondul (she/her): There was a push actually to do something like this with the census, but it was kind of that.

133
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,230
Alison Mondul (she/her): That was not.

134
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:51,750
Alison Mondul (she/her): there's a kind of a political battle about the census a bit.

135
00:17:53,190 --> 00:18:02,700
Alison Mondul (she/her): Because it is used to determine legislative districts are two political parties have different opinions about how the data should be collected, because one way favors.

136
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:17,100
Alison Mondul (she/her): Some voters and one way favors other voters right, so the the Constitution says, we need to count all people, so if you do a direct Count of all the people as i'm going to mention a couple of slides you tend to undercount certain groups and.

137
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:23,340
Alison Mondul (she/her): Black men Hispanics I think young men renters and if you.

138
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:38,460
Alison Mondul (she/her): generalize those are groups that tend to favor democrats right as opposed to Republicans, so when they start having fights about this in Congress, the Republicans tend to favor of a true person by person headcount, whereas the.

139
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:46,830
Alison Mondul (she/her): Democrats tend to favor using mathematical weighting to try to account for undercounted some of these other groups, so a.

140
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:54,810
Alison Mondul (she/her): Historically, the Republicans have won this argument and we do a person by person headcount recognizing that we're on the accounting certain groups.

141
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:06,510
Alison Mondul (she/her): The ACS is a way to kind of get around that it's an augmentation to and it asks additional questions that are not just about counting the number of people and we'll get to that in a minute.

142
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:13,560
Alison Mondul (she/her): But it also provides data, every year, as opposed to only every 10 years so kind of bridges that gap, but it is not a.

143
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:19,290
Alison Mondul (she/her): Direct headcount It is this estimation method, and so it is not really a.

144
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:35,700
Alison Mondul (she/her): replacement for the Senate census that makes us there's all these there's a lot of other services and programs that are run by the census Bureau but we don't really use them for fb research and so we're going to focus on these two.

145
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:46,200
Alison Mondul (she/her): So what is collected, I think this is really interesting I believe this is the original 1790 census people had beautiful handwriting in 1798 as opposed to now.

146
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:54,930
Alison Mondul (she/her): um but it's literally just like a handwritten list, they would go door to door, this is on market street, and this is like the people and.

147
00:19:55,650 --> 00:20:06,090
Alison Mondul (she/her): You know, essentially, I think, exactly where they lived i'm just literally counting people and writing it by hand there was no form which I think is sort of fascinating.

148
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:22,590
Alison Mondul (she/her): um, then this is the I believe this is the 1850 census, we got a little bit more sophisticated over time we asked about you know the name of the person their age, their sex, we also had color.

149
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:29,670
Alison Mondul (she/her): Apparently the choices for color in 1850 were white black or mulatto those were the three options.

150
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:37,560
Alison Mondul (she/her): And then they had profession, you know if they own real estate place of birth and a few other things right.

151
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:46,230
Alison Mondul (she/her): So the first year that a standardized form is used in 830 at 3011 1850 we've got some additional questions here again beautiful handwriting.

152
00:20:48,630 --> 00:21:00,390
Alison Mondul (she/her): um but that we got you know, we have more like a modern form here in 1970 I think the 1974 was interesting we have certainly additional racial categories.

153
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:14,760
Alison Mondul (she/her): That have been added right, we have more choices, and I also think it's interesting that you are writing down the people you can either be the head of the household or the wife of the head or the son or daughter at the head.

154
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:26,460
Alison Mondul (she/her): So if I were filling this out, I couldn't go to my mailbox and pick out the census and I fill it out and put my husband and his person to because he's the head of the household and i'm the wife of the head right.

155
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:38,160
Alison Mondul (she/her): know also that there's no real way to indicate unmarried partners and therefore same sex couples on the 1970 census.

156
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,470
Alison Mondul (she/her): And in 2010 we've made some improvements right.

157
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:55,530
Alison Mondul (she/her): We now are allowing person one to fill it out and then have person to be indicated how they are related to person one we can ask the husband or wife, so now, I can fill it out and indicate that my husband is person to that's Nice.

158
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:02,220
Alison Mondul (she/her): And we also have a marriage partner right which is another option here i'm.

159
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,290
Alison Mondul (she/her): also note that there's a lot more on Hispanic.

160
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:15,810
Alison Mondul (she/her): ethnicity questions, and there are additional racial categories that are listed, so this is good.

161
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:23,880
Alison Mondul (she/her): Because we're getting more information we're becoming more nuanced we're collecting information that should be collected right.

162
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:37,110
Alison Mondul (she/her): But trying to harmonize this if you want to combine data from across all the census collections it's going to be harder right because you don't necessarily have the same categories, every time.

163
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:47,040
Alison Mondul (she/her): So you can actually go online to the census website, and you can actually look all of these questionnaires up if you're interested.

164
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,110
Alison Mondul (she/her): So.

165
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,670
Alison Mondul (she/her): This is a little bit of how we got into the ACS.

166
00:22:54,330 --> 00:23:09,780
Alison Mondul (she/her): In 1982 the central census a subset of the population received the long form which the short form is just the basic questions and then the long form included a lot more detailed questions on population and housing characteristics this went on for a couple of censuses and then.

167
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:16,530
Alison Mondul (she/her): After the 2010 census the long form was abolished and these questions became nice yes.

168
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,970
Alison Mondul (she/her): So that is kind of how that happened that makes sense.

169
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:32,940
Alison Mondul (she/her): So, like we said the ACS is ongoing it's conducted every year on a subset of the population, so it's actually about three and a half million people every year, who fill out the SS I said it was a small subset and I suppose that's.

170
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,280
Alison Mondul (she/her): Technically, true, but three and a half million sounds like quite a lot of people when you're thinking about actually doing it.

171
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:58,320
Alison Mondul (she/her): So these are some of the things that they measure So these are the population kinds of things i'm fertility food stamps the SAP us grandparents as caregivers income industry occupation, a class of worker language migration military service.

172
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:09,180
Alison Mondul (she/her): You know, and then they asked a lot of stuff about people's housing new bedrooms computer and Internet use what kind of heating fuel does your House have what kind of kitchen and plumbing facilities do you have.

173
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:17,190
Alison Mondul (she/her): Do you have telephone service, do you have Internet service, you know things like that, and so a lot of.

174
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:27,330
Alison Mondul (she/her): In epidemiology, a lot of social epidemiologists are very interested in using these data, because they include a lot of data that can be used to.

175
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:39,210
Alison Mondul (she/her): Create indices of poverty, for example, and neighborhood characteristics and things like that right so um, this is a great resource for people who are interested in that kind of.

176
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:40,770
work.

177
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:43,560
Alison Mondul (she/her): How do we access the data.

178
00:24:44,970 --> 00:25:00,300
Alison Mondul (she/her): Well, we have the 72 year rule which says that the US Government not released personally identifiable information about an individual to any other individual or agency until 72 years after it was collected for the study of census that seems weird where did we get 72.

179
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,420
Nolaundron Harris: So, life expectancy.

180
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,070
Nolaundron Harris: exactly right gone.

181
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:19,590
Alison Mondul (she/her): that's exactly right what's life expectancy right when they made the rule, essentially, so they figure 72 years i've selected that person is likely, no longer with us and therefore releasing their information is not really a breach of price.

182
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:36,450
Alison Mondul (she/her): And so you do not actually get when you get census data, you are not getting individual level data that we're getting aggregate data, so it is aggregated by some kind of geographic location census tract zip code census.

183
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,490
Alison Mondul (she/her): What else is there was there's tracked and there's.

184
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:51,210
Alison Mondul (she/her): i'm having a brain fart i'm sorry there's another census delineation that that you can get it by so you can get it by all of these different things.

185
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:57,150
Alison Mondul (she/her): So i'm telling you that this is not individual level data, because it would be you know.

186
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:03,600
Alison Mondul (she/her): The government doesn't release individual data until 72 years after it was collected.

187
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:08,310
Alison Mondul (she/her): Can you have individual level data that is not personally identifiable.

188
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,180
Nolaundron Harris: If you remove.

189
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,120
Nolaundron Harris: Certain bits of information.

190
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:26,460
Alison Mondul (she/her): Absolutely so personally identifiable individual data will never be publicly available that's data that's usually collected by.

191
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:39,630
Alison Mondul (she/her): Like we're running a research, study, right now, where we're recruiting research participants, we have an IRB we have a lot of rules about how we store their data to be hipaa compliant and to be compliant with IRB rules so.

192
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,130
Alison Mondul (she/her): we're never going to make that publicly available right, that is something that we have to store in a certain way.

193
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:51,060
Alison Mondul (she/her): But there is de identified individual data we're going to talk about several of these data sources in this lecture.

194
00:26:51,450 --> 00:27:04,890
Alison Mondul (she/her): And haynes purpose DHS and vital statistics, they are all provided at an individual level, so you get one record per person with their age, their whatever right but it's de identified in such a way that you cannot identify who these individuals are.

195
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:19,800
Alison Mondul (she/her): And in fact sometimes you are not allowed to or enhance, for example, won't allow you to publish data that has fewer than a certain number of people per per cell right so like if you were going to say.

196
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:28,170
Alison Mondul (she/her): You were going to categorize say how many people there were by like race, age, sex and.

197
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:34,650
Alison Mondul (she/her): Disease status in a geographic area like if there were only two people in one of those cells.

198
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:46,380
Alison Mondul (she/her): It might be pretty easy for people who live in that area to be like Oh, this is the one old Asian man who lives in our neighbor you don't I mean like so that's why you don't actually publish data with fewer than a certain number of people per cell with these data.

199
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:48,510
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay.

200
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:58,770
Alison Mondul (she/her): Then there's also aggregate data, which is what you get from the census So how do you access access census data well, you can go to data that census.gov.

201
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,420
Alison Mondul (she/her): God bless you if you tried their website is.

202
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:12,780
Alison Mondul (she/her): it's a challenge, they used to have this thing called American fact Finder they have now migrated to a new website that I pray is better I don't actually know.

203
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:20,580
Alison Mondul (she/her): You can also download the raw data and work with it from there, it is a, this is a challenge to use it has always been.

204
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:27,930
Alison Mondul (she/her): I do recommend if you want to use census data, there is this thing called social explorer very user friendly.

205
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:34,950
Alison Mondul (she/her): They have census data but also other sources of data are included in it, you can kind of make maps and all kinds of stuff through this interface.

206
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:43,950
Alison Mondul (she/her): You them students have access to the professional edition, otherwise you need a paid subscription and I actually do not know how much it is, but if you work at your workplace going to be using this.

207
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:52,260
Alison Mondul (she/her): For something it might be worth looking into what a paid subscription would be and whether your workplace that people into two foot the bill for it, if you needed it.

208
00:28:56,190 --> 00:29:06,030
Alison Mondul (she/her): So how do we use census data in every research we use it for age standardization and for denominators for calculating population base rate so that's we just talked about.

209
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:10,020
Alison Mondul (she/her): Both of those examples you've used these data right in our class.

210
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:19,260
Alison Mondul (she/her): Does these projections right population age projections are created using census data, so we know how our population age structure has been changing, and therefore we can.

211
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:27,810
Alison Mondul (she/her): Use math to project how it's going to continue to change into the future and for diseases that our age related knowing how the age structures by to change.

212
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,780
Alison Mondul (she/her): can tell you something about how the prevalence of that disease is going to change the incidence of that disease are going to change over time.

213
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:47,700
Alison Mondul (she/her): And, as I said, with the ACS data, we can also look at things like neighborhood level characteristics in relation to risk of disease poverty racial makeup all kinds of different things about neighborhoods that we can look at in relation to disease for this.

214
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:58,740
Alison Mondul (she/her): You can you can get these data, and this has been done in several large cohort studies, where, for example, we're probably going to do something like this with our.

215
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:03,840
Alison Mondul (she/her): My cares data that we're collecting so we're collecting individual data on people from all over Michigan.

216
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:18,030
Alison Mondul (she/her): But we can link that to census data and get you we know where they live, because they've given us their address as part of our data collection and we can then go to census data and bring in all the information about their neighborhood their census tract.

217
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:25,440
Alison Mondul (she/her): that we can then use to create neighborhood level characteristics variables and look at those in relation to their specific disease.

218
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,000
Alison Mondul (she/her): Alright, so what are some of the drawbacks of census data.

219
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:38,670
Alison Mondul (she/her): Like I said, we are limited by how the questions were asked one good example was how the racial categories have changed over time, other things have changed over time, the way that asked them.

220
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:44,880
Alison Mondul (she/her): Which is good, we don't want to be stagnant, but on the other hand it, it makes data harmonization, a bit of a challenge.

221
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:54,330
Alison Mondul (she/her): socioeconomic status is kind of complicated to assess you know, so you have a bunch of these variables they've collected and then you have to kind of use them in some way that makes sense.

222
00:30:55,020 --> 00:31:03,840
Alison Mondul (she/her): and collect collected only every 10 years which can be a challenge for some of that that using these data as denominators, for example, right.

223
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:19,710
Alison Mondul (she/her): And we know, as I mentioned earlier that the census undercounts certain groups blacks Hispanics renters and young men are among those and Congress ruled against us, as the statistical correction to deal with these other accounts for the 2010 census.

224
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:25,440
Alison Mondul (she/her): um and then you know decisions about what goes on the health.

225
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:34,620
Alison Mondul (she/her): Excuse me decisions about what questions get asked are not made by health researchers, so we may not be getting exactly what we would prefer.

226
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:38,640
Alison Mondul (she/her): we're kind of using data for health research that were collected for a different purpose.

227
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:51,330
Alison Mondul (she/her): And you know the geographic areas that are being used are not delineated based on anything health related so we may not actually be getting kind of the the aggregate that we would want for our questions.

228
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,240
Alison Mondul (she/her): That make sense.

229
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:06,420
Alison Mondul (she/her): So this is an example, this is a student who worked with me on her capstone way back in 2015 she was using she had environmental pollution data by zip code from the EPA.

230
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:12,960
Alison Mondul (she/her): About toxic releases and she had long and bladder cancer cases from cancer registry.

231
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:24,930
Alison Mondul (she/her): And then she got population data from the census and use that as her denominator and she was able to standardize her rates to the entire tribe tri county population distribution of race, gender, age, and she actually found that.

232
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:31,440
Alison Mondul (she/her): People living in zip codes, where they had higher toxic environmental the leases and higher rates of bladder and lung cancers.

233
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:41,070
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay, so now we're going to talk briefly about vital statistics, and this is something that came up.

234
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:44,100
Alison Mondul (she/her): was like a question what are vital statistics.

235
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:56,970
Alison Mondul (she/her): We consider births and deaths to be vital statistics and we also in this country collect information on fetal deaths which is usually defined as a death that occurs at over 20 weeks gestation, some states.

236
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:09,360
Alison Mondul (she/her): will collect all feel deaths, regardless of i'm kind of used to gestation some use a cut off of birth weight as opposed to beat suggest station that generally equates to about 20 weeks.

237
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,840
Alison Mondul (she/her): So that's a little bit of a mishmash.

238
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:27,030
Alison Mondul (she/her): So Who collects these data, so the legal authority for collections, with the States and territories, but then federal law dictates the National Coalition and dissemination of these days, so the state's collected and then they send it to the CDC.

239
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:36,420
Alison Mondul (she/her): The CDC within the CDC the national Center for health statistics houses, among other things, the national vital statistics system where the BSS.

240
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:49,860
Alison Mondul (she/her): So we said that these are the vital statistics keep in mind that marriage and marriages and divorces also used to be collected by spss, but this was suspended in 1996 because of a sort of.

241
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:59,670
Alison Mondul (she/her): duplicative right they already were collecting this on other surveys, and so they decided that they didn't need to it's just a lot of data that they didn't need to collect that.

242
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,310
Alison Mondul (she/her): at the national level statistics system.

243
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:17,580
Alison Mondul (she/her): loops so a new form and training materials for births deaths everything were developed in 2003 is a joint effort between the States and territories and ncaa chess as a 2013 so 10 years after that this form was.

244
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,170
Alison Mondul (she/her): Created 41 states that adopted it so.

245
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:29,220
Alison Mondul (she/her): Getting all the States to do anything is is a challenge right so i'm going to actually.

246
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:39,000
Alison Mondul (she/her): Go to that link may not be working anymore sorry CC bond with Sir.

247
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:55,530
Alison Mondul (she/her): I think this is actually really interesting because there's a lot of information that's actually collected on the birth certificate forum that even as a person who has had a child, I kind of didn't realize.

248
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:02,340
Alison Mondul (she/her): Some of this they pulled in from like the medical record or from the prenatal record.

249
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:15,330
Alison Mondul (she/her): Some of it, they actually asked when that when the parents is in the hospital, but you have a lot of information on the mother and the father, you know mothers education level race, ethnicity.

250
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,660
Alison Mondul (she/her): place where birth occurred.

251
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:27,270
Alison Mondul (she/her): You know previous number five verse did the mom smoke during pregnancy i'm drinking during pregnancy all of that kind of stuff.

252
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:36,060
Alison Mondul (she/her): And then, medical and health information about the pregnancy right was that were there, you know these kinds of things that were going on with Labor there's information on here about.

253
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:49,890
Alison Mondul (she/her): Whether the baby's breach there's stuff about whether it was a C section or not, whether there were infections present during during the pregnancy right so lots of stuff that are actually congenital abnormalities of the newborn.

254
00:35:51,420 --> 00:36:05,850
Alison Mondul (she/her): Lots of stuff is included on here, and you can access all of these data at the CDC website, you can either download them and analyze them with your software of choice, where you can actually access them like through their website using CDC water okay.

255
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:17,190
Alison Mondul (she/her): And I think another thing that's important to keep in mind here is that we think of all of this stuff is being very clear, not all of it is collected, with the same level of.

256
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:25,740
Alison Mondul (she/her): certainty as other pieces of it, for example, like, so I think smoking is probably a good one right there is a.

257
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:35,700
Alison Mondul (she/her): unknown correct answer right for whether you smoked during your pregnancy and whether you drink during the pregnancy, so I think that there is some amount of not telling.

258
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:43,290
Alison Mondul (she/her): People not being truthful about some of these questions, but even some of these other things that seem like they'd be very clear place where birth occurred.

259
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:54,150
Alison Mondul (she/her): I was like to tell this story, I have a friend who was having her second baby and her first pregnancy, she had been overdue and they induced her.

260
00:36:54,750 --> 00:37:01,080
Alison Mondul (she/her): And induce Labor is very different than natural Labor it can take a lot longer um.

261
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:07,710
Alison Mondul (she/her): And so, when she had her second baby and she went into Labor naturally she kind of didn't realize how quickly the Labor was progressing.

262
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:17,850
Alison Mondul (she/her): So you know they always tell you if you go to any kind of birthing classes anybody who's been to a birthday class you back me up there was a human Labor at home, you know don't run by to the hospital it's fine.

263
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:28,680
Alison Mondul (she/her): Because my friend did that, and she ended up in rush hour traffic trying to get to the hospital to have this baby and like.

264
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:38,400
Alison Mondul (she/her): She was really far along by the time she got there like they were on the phone like calm Dr they met them at like phil I just pull up in the er park in the er you know driveway.

265
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:53,250
Alison Mondul (she/her): They pulled up in the driveway she had already gotten in the back seeds, because she was having this baby like while they were driving the doctor in the doula come running out, and they essentially delivered this baby in the backseat of the car in the driveway of the er.

266
00:37:54,570 --> 00:38:03,480
Alison Mondul (she/her): So, which box, do you have some poor schmuck who worked at this hospital had to fill this out and, like a medical record clerk had to fill this out and decide.

267
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:15,000
Alison Mondul (she/her): Is it the hospital was she close enough was the other Honda accord like What was it what what box, do you check so that's one of my favorite stories for.

268
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:24,270
Alison Mondul (she/her): an unusual scenario, I suppose, for why it might be difficult to pick but somebody has to make make the call of what box to check out I don't know what I would pick.

269
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,760
Alison Mondul (she/her): So there you go.

270
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:33,450
Nolaundron Harris: Right like this class with you just make this class enjoy off sorry just.

271
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,530
Alison Mondul (she/her): glad you enjoy it oh poor me she doesn't know I told her that story every time.

272
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,070
Alison Mondul (she/her): All right, alright.

273
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,090
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay.

274
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:53,610
Alison Mondul (she/her): You can also go look at the standard def form here, it also includes quite a bit of information.

275
00:38:54,660 --> 00:39:03,810
Alison Mondul (she/her): That you might not expect, but we spent a bit of time talking about death certificates and and kind of the deep the details of how the particularly the cause of death piece gets filled out right.

276
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:11,430
Alison Mondul (she/her): Some of the other stuff about manner of death and all of that kind of stuff is more law enforcement related right rather than health related so.

277
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:26,910
Alison Mondul (she/her): not really my area and then feel that this is actually interesting it's if the if you want to go look at the form it's on kind of that same one web page it's a little bit of a mix between like the birth certificate and the death certificate for.

278
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:30,990
Okay.

279
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:42,930
Alison Mondul (she/her): So, as I said, you can actually go to the CDC website and and kind of access these data online, you can kind of point and click and get some tables and things like that, but you can always download the data itself.

280
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,480
Alison Mondul (she/her): I believe they require you to do like a little bit of a registration process but it's it's not particularly onerous.

281
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,910
Alison Mondul (she/her): And you can also get the depth data from the national depth index, and this is used.

282
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:04,170
Alison Mondul (she/her): very frequently and epidemiologic studies to link to epidemiologic cohorts with mortality data so essentially you would have identifying information in your cohort and you would somehow transmit that.

283
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:16,800
Alison Mondul (she/her): To the FBI, and they will kind of look up which of these people in your cohort had died, maybe the past year or two years, a lot of places like do link every couple of years kind of a thing and it costs some money essentially you're paying for the service but.

284
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:22,980
Alison Mondul (she/her): that's often how deaths are ascertained in perspective cohort studies, as I was looking at the I.

285
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:32,790
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay, so, as I said, these are some examples of how these data are used in epidemiologic research.

286
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:41,130
Alison Mondul (she/her): Almost all major cohorts us ascertain deaths related to them di the national vital statistics system publishes surveillance information, every year, and so that's how we get.

287
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:50,460
Alison Mondul (she/her): really important information, like the leading causes of death in the US right it's how we get information on child child bearing patterns in the US like we know the teen pregnancy has been decreasing over time.

288
00:40:51,450 --> 00:41:03,870
Alison Mondul (she/her): And here's an example of a research paper that was published looking at the relationship between serious delivery rate and the tunnel in neonatal mortality, because that information is included on the on the birth certificates, so this was all using birth certificate data.

289
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,510
Alison Mondul (she/her): Any questions about that before we move on to enhance and purpose.

290
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:31,620
Alison Mondul (she/her): So enhance again, these are like I don't know this is how I say them I think other people say them this way to i'm going to indoctrinate you now you're going to pronounce this acronym is them haynes forever if you've heard it from me, for the first time, but.

291
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:40,470
Alison Mondul (she/her): it's the national health and nutrition examination survey, so this is the program of studies that are designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the US.

292
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:48,360
Alison Mondul (she/her): It was begun in the early 1960s and continues today, so this is a major program of the national Center for health statistics.

293
00:41:48,660 --> 00:42:00,540
Alison Mondul (she/her): Which is part of CDC So if you recall, I told you that the national vital statistics system is actually part of ncaa chess so another part of ncaa chess is the administration event Hayes.

294
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:16,410
Alison Mondul (she/her): So enhance data is incredibly rich they collect so much stuff you would be shocked, if you just go look at their website and look at all of the data that they have it it's like a treasure trove.

295
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,470
Alison Mondul (she/her): So they collect all kinds of stuff about risk factors smoking, alcohol consumption sexual practices drug use.

296
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:33,300
Alison Mondul (she/her): weights body composition and when I say body composition, a weight, I mean that they actually measure their height and weight and they will do Texas scans skin full tests and bio impedance tests to measure like.

297
00:42:34,470 --> 00:42:37,080
Alison Mondul (she/her): percent body fat, you know what I mean what i'm saying bio impedance.

298
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:46,770
Alison Mondul (she/her): and doing this because there's like a little thing that you grab that as metal plates you i'm talking about anybody ever used one of those scales as a little metal plates on you stand on and that tells you your percent body fat.

299
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,910
Alison Mondul (she/her): The skills or something.

300
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,890
Alison Mondul (she/her): rude scales, is what they are, I like to call them anyway.

301
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:00,600
Alison Mondul (she/her): So yeah I mean they do incredibly deep detailed biometric.

302
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,730
Alison Mondul (she/her): information.

303
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:10,860
Alison Mondul (she/her): dietary intake reproductive health, use of oral contraceptives and other medications and when I say use of medications they actually do a household interview want a.

304
00:43:10,950 --> 00:43:15,300
Alison Mondul (she/her): Where they go into the person's house and The interviewer says, will you bring me all of your medication bottles, please.

305
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:19,590
Alison Mondul (she/her): And they literally write it down what they're taking as opposed to just saying hey what are you taking into like.

306
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:28,350
Alison Mondul (she/her): I don't know something for my diabetes, I think it starts with an m, you know I mean like it and they don't know the dose and so they're literally writing down exactly what these people are taking.

307
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:43,980
Alison Mondul (she/her): lots of different outcomes anything you might be interested in it is here right so and a lot of the stuff they're measuring like environmental exposures they're actually measuring chemicals in urine and the blood in some of these cases they do a hearing exam they do an eye exam.

308
00:43:45,360 --> 00:44:00,510
Alison Mondul (she/her): on nutrition, obesity oral health they actually do a dental exam when these people mobile examination Center so you get two counts, you know about two K all kinds of stuff there's a whole fitness and physical functioning and they actually do like a spear on low spirometry test.

309
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:07,230
Alison Mondul (she/her): and reproductive history sexual behavior respiratory disease STDs and vision, they do a vision test.

310
00:44:08,430 --> 00:44:16,560
Alison Mondul (she/her): And they collect all kinds of biological samples blood urine hair DNA and they do laboratory measures on all kinds of stuff.

311
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:25,590
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay, then you can actually go to their website and look at all the data that they have if you're interested it's a very nicely organized website.

312
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:39,240
Alison Mondul (she/her): um the sample is representative of the entire US population, so they select the sample, and this is kind of a bio stats than she could spend an entire course on right complex survey design.

313
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:45,210
Alison Mondul (she/her): But essentially they select the sample for the survey such that it represents the US population of all ages.

314
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:53,700
Alison Mondul (she/her): In order to produce reliable statistics, they oversample older people and certain subgroups like African Americans and Hispanics So if you just.

315
00:44:54,060 --> 00:45:06,240
Alison Mondul (she/her): To explain this better like if you just went out into Ann arbor into the random sample of 10,000 people do you think you would probably get enough of certain racial ethnic of age subgroups to make stable estimates in those groups.

316
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:14,220
Alison Mondul (she/her): Probably not right, so what they do is they say okay if we're going to get 10,000 people we're going to get 3000 white people we're going to get you know.

317
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,130
Alison Mondul (she/her): i'm okay nine because we're going to divide it by three.

318
00:45:17,490 --> 00:45:27,360
Alison Mondul (she/her): If we're going to get 9000 people bringing a 3000 white people 3000 standing people and make sure we get 3000 black people so that we can make stable estimates and then we're going to wait these estimates.

319
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:37,470
Alison Mondul (she/her): So, so that they get weighted by the proportion of the population that's in all of those groups than the US population, so that it is nationally representative does that make sense, yes right.

320
00:45:37,620 --> 00:45:39,390
Nolaundron Harris: This is so um.

321
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,110
Nolaundron Harris: How do I want to ask this, let me think about this.

322
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:45,300
Nolaundron Harris: Okay.

323
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:58,170
Alison Mondul (she/her): So when you use these data there's a lot of detailed information on their website about how to do your analysis, you must use their sample design variables and their weights, when you are using their when you entered programming.

324
00:45:58,470 --> 00:46:07,350
Alison Mondul (she/her): and using these data so it's a little bit you probably if you have no experience with this, you probably want to find a bio SAS person who can help you out.

325
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:14,460
Alison Mondul (she/her): and make sure that you're doing it correctly, but there is a lot of tutorial on the website on how to do it, but if you don't use those variables.

326
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:26,070
Alison Mondul (she/her): you're going to get you the wrong P values or you're like the wrong confident the wrong confidence intervals P values or you're going to get the wrong actual answer that is not related to the US population.

327
00:46:26,370 --> 00:46:31,950
Nolaundron Harris: That was actually what I was going to ask you if it was based on their specific rates were it was something that.

328
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:42,570
Alison Mondul (she/her): They provided sample bates and like cluster and variants units and it's very complicated how they choose the sample.

329
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:53,880
Alison Mondul (she/her): chosen it in a certain way with like clusters and sampling units and things like that which are like geographic divisions and it's all weighted according to that.

330
00:46:54,660 --> 00:47:03,630
Alison Mondul (she/her): So the sample design variables, all of these things we're going to talk about from here on out and haynes purpose and DHS are all this kind of service called a complex survey designed.

331
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:13,800
Alison Mondul (she/her): it's designed to be representative of a certain overall population in and an oversample certain groups in order to achieve stable estimates in those smaller groups.

332
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:23,040
Alison Mondul (she/her): And in order to do, then, in order to get the right answer from the data, you have to use the weights and the sampling frames variables in your analysis.

333
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:34,410
Alison Mondul (she/her): not actually hard to do it's like literally a couple lines of code like when you're running your code you just add these variables and in the right place, but you have to make sure you do it in the right place and you have to know that it's a thing you have to do.

334
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:48,030
Alison Mondul (she/her): So i'm just telling you if you want to use these data they're great, but you have to make sure you're using them correctly and you might need I can't hold her to make sure you're doing it correctly.

335
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:54,990
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay, any other questions about that before we move on.

336
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:05,370
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay, so continuous enhance so in 1989 and hands became continuous, which means they now examine nationally representative samples about 5000 people every year.

337
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:17,850
Alison Mondul (she/her): These are released into your waves of 10,000 people um and so basically you can analyze data from any two year cycle, or you can combine two or more cycles to increase your sample size.

338
00:48:18,390 --> 00:48:29,640
Alison Mondul (she/her): These are not the same people who are being asked questions repeatedly over time, it is new people every time, so you can add them up to get a bigger sample.

339
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:47,670
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay So how do they get people to participate in this beast they provide transportation to and from the medical Center if necessary people receive compensation and they receive a report of their medical findings from the exam.

340
00:48:49,140 --> 00:49:03,060
Alison Mondul (she/her): So step one is an in person interview they go into people's homes, they do an interview or administered questionnaire, which is very different than just like a mailed questionnaire right, it is an interview is not just a questionnaire that people are filling out on their own.

341
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,160
Alison Mondul (she/her): They have bilingual interviewers in Spanish in English.

342
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:09,840
Alison Mondul (she/her): Excuse me.

343
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:20,340
Alison Mondul (she/her): And step two is the mech exam as i've said before they roll these the trailers up and there's like an entire lab and doctor's office in here.

344
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:33,630
Alison Mondul (she/her): And this happens wanted two weeks after the phone interview they do a physical exam where they do all kinds of different things dental exam to collect specimens and they do, they do interviews a more personal nature with more sensitive data here at the MAC.

345
00:49:34,590 --> 00:49:42,690
Alison Mondul (she/her): So sexual experience depression to back when you send youth, you know things like that that people probably don't want to like talk about their family and their living room right.

346
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:52,350
Alison Mondul (she/her): um so as we've said, this is not obtained using the simple random sample it's a complex, multi stage probability sampling design.

347
00:49:53,070 --> 00:50:05,580
Alison Mondul (she/her): So people are selected to be representative of the civilian non institutionalized US population so not institutionalized means it doesn't include people like in nursing homes armed forces or people in prison or us nationals living abroad.

348
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:22,080
Alison Mondul (she/her): So they oversample certain population subgroups to increase the reliability and precision of health status indicator estimates for those groups, so you must use the sampling design variables and the weights for all analyses because of this complex sample design.

349
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:29,430
Alison Mondul (she/her): If you don't account for the sampling parameters, you might take my assessments or overstate your significance levels okay.

350
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:37,680
Alison Mondul (she/her): So you have to use special statistical software, you can use a survey procedures or Sudan, I actually don't know Ali Rachel may know if there's.

351
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:49,440
Alison Mondul (she/her): If you can use our if there's our packages for this now, I would be surprised if there are not in our is your thing but yeah you just you just you know can just pop it in excel.

352
00:50:55,110 --> 00:51:02,610
Alison Mondul (she/her): Rachel says there are so you can also use our and there's examples of code and all of that aren't like and there's little tutorials on their websites with very thorough.

353
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:09,000
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay, so that's the publicly available stuff and you can literally go right now and downloading analyze.

354
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:16,200
Alison Mondul (she/her): You can literally go to their website download the daily data and that's it it's yours um.

355
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:29,490
Alison Mondul (she/her): But there are some restricted in haines datasets so lots of the surveys have been linked with things like mortality data medicare data medicaid and chip enrollment social security benefits end stage renal disease registries.

356
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:43,470
Alison Mondul (she/her): They also have some genetic data and these data are not publicly available, they can be accessed on site at the research data Center or, in some cases remotely you do have to submit a research proposal in order to access those data.

357
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:54,120
Alison Mondul (she/her): So it's not like impossible or anything but it's just know that these exist there's just a few more hoops it's not just downloading it off their website.

358
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:05,220
Alison Mondul (she/her): They also have surplus bio specimens so they collect all these bio specimens they analyze what they are what they're going to analyze this part and haynes and the least that publicly.

359
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:15,420
Alison Mondul (she/her): But then they have extra that they've stored in the freezer and so you can actually apply to use them and the data will be embargoed for your use for certainly the time after Richard is made publicly available that's kind of.

360
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:23,640
Alison Mondul (she/her): So, usually if you are applying these these bio specimens you have a pot of money that you're going to use to pay for the laboratory tests right.

361
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:29,820
Alison Mondul (she/her): So you're in use the bio specimens for something you have to pay for the lab tests and most people about the grant like the research grant to do that.

362
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:43,710
Alison Mondul (she/her): And that's why the data our bar with for your use because you were like hey I have this hypothesis, I want to pay to run the sample still like cool you've got like two years to get your paper out and then we're going to put your these data publicly available to other people to.

363
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:46,890
Alison Mondul (she/her): That makes sense.

364
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:56,610
Alison Mondul (she/her): i've used these data quite a bit, these are some examples from Tibet of my papers using enhanced data, so I think they're great.

365
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,740
Alison Mondul (she/her): I recommend them.

366
00:53:01,710 --> 00:53:06,450
Alison Mondul (she/her): Alright, any questions about enhance before we talk briefly about purpose.

367
00:53:10,170 --> 00:53:12,510
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay purpose is kind of the other.

368
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:17,640
Alison Mondul (she/her): Like big data big surveillance efforts that happens in the US.

369
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:31,380
Alison Mondul (she/her): One of the limitations of enhances that it's not available on a State specific basis right, so they go out to various places around the continuous us and do these 5000 people every year but they're not.

370
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:41,130
Alison Mondul (she/her): The data are nationally representative they aren't for states and people who are you know working in state health agencies, they really want to know what's going on in their state.

371
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:55,260
Alison Mondul (she/her): So to kind of address this critical obstacle bertha's was established in 1984 and they started with 15 states, it became nationwide in 1983, it is also conducted by the CDC but a different group so.

372
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:57,420
Alison Mondul (she/her): This is.

373
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:13,680
Alison Mondul (she/her): In this office, this is kind of a CDC org chart this piece here, is where the national vital statistics system and haines and some other surveys run by ncaa chess are housed in this kind of group branch office.

374
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:32,520
Alison Mondul (she/her): institute arm office I guess i'm over here in this chronic disease disease prevention and health promotion section, this is where workers sits so they're both CDC but they're kind of different pieces there aren't many people that make sense.

375
00:54:35,430 --> 00:54:47,130
Alison Mondul (she/her): This is a brief timeline, as I said, it was established in 1984 they started with 15 states, it became nationwide in 1983 with about 100,000 interviews completed so you can see, already that the scope is much.

376
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,180
Alison Mondul (she/her): Larger just there's a lot more people being interviewed every year.

377
00:54:52,050 --> 00:55:04,500
Alison Mondul (she/her): And then they asked added some other things, including the cell phone survey in 2008 and 2011 was the first year that cell phone survey data was included in the public release and in 2011 they did more than 500,000 interviews.

378
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:14,040
Alison Mondul (she/her): So just a huge number of people right 5000 per year for enhanced 500,000 per year for purpose.

379
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:20,760
Alison Mondul (she/her): Now, keep in mind purpose is a telephone questionnaire they're calling people up on the phone.

380
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:31,200
Alison Mondul (she/her): And haines is in person, and they are literally measuring everything so and haines and purpose both collect the data.

381
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,500
Alison Mondul (she/her): Which one, do you think is more accurate.

382
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:42,030
Alison Mondul (she/her): purpose is asking you over the phone, what is your height and weight.

383
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:55,230
Alison Mondul (she/her): yeah and hands Chelsea says that was correct, whereas an haines is having you come to their thing where they're doing indexes scan so that they can tell what your exact body composition is and nurse is measuring your height and your weight.

384
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,800
can't live the nurse.

385
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:15,450
Alison Mondul (she/her): Alright, so the way the purpose data is collected over the phone, as I said, they do these standard core questions that are asked, every year, and must be asked by all states, there are rotating or questions that are asked, every other year and must be asked by all states.

386
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:20,250
Alison Mondul (she/her): So there is some stuff that is like.

387
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:27,300
Alison Mondul (she/her): That you can get on a national level because it's kind of required to be asked by all of the States then there's these optional modules.

388
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:34,770
Alison Mondul (she/her): These are standardized questions that are made up by the CDC group that states can select kind of from the menu and include if they want to.

389
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:42,330
Alison Mondul (she/her): And then states can add their own stuff right they're encouraged to gather data on topics related to their specific state health priorities, for example.

390
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:51,150
Alison Mondul (she/her): i'm going to say a few years ago, but I think it's actually more than that, now, this is the thing in 2013 Michigan enhance did an Arab American.

391
00:56:52,230 --> 00:57:00,060
Alison Mondul (she/her): behavioral risk factor survey because Michigan has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country, living in around dearborn.

392
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:14,400
Alison Mondul (she/her): And you don't actually get data on Arab Americans from the census or anything else because anybody know what box Arab Americans would check on the race on the race questioner.

393
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:24,840
Nolaundron Harris: Other.

394
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,530
Alison Mondul (she/her): Know denise's right they collect a paycheck white.

395
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:40,020
Alison Mondul (she/her): So they're included in the white category and so people have done some work like a coronas, which is a one of the health system hospitals in on.

396
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:46,650
Alison Mondul (she/her): Cancer Center in Detroit they've done a fair bit of work to try to use, like last name algorithms to try to.

397
00:57:47,130 --> 00:58:00,060
Alison Mondul (she/her): pull out the Arab Americans from the whites and there was actually a big thing on the 2020 census they tried to make an Arab American specific category on the census, and it didn't happen so anyway, this is something that.

398
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,580
Alison Mondul (she/her): was very interested in so in on their purpose they added this specific.

399
00:58:10,980 --> 00:58:12,570
Alison Mondul (she/her): um okay.

400
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:22,740
Alison Mondul (she/her): Oh, and there's a website, or you can go look at all the questionnaires purpose, so this is an example from 2014 at the core modules.

401
00:58:23,550 --> 00:58:32,430
Alison Mondul (she/her): You can see that some of this stuff is quite a bit, the same as what's collected on here, but some of it isn't right things like quality of life and falls.

402
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:43,530
Alison Mondul (she/her): And you get into even some more the seven optional modules there's a lot more kind of social stuff on breakfast then they then they tend to ask about on and haines and so things like.

403
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:53,910
Alison Mondul (she/her): reactions to race social context, sexual orientation and gender identity and more emotional support and life satisfaction, those are some examples of things that are in purpose.

404
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,220
Alison Mondul (she/her): and

405
00:58:57,720 --> 00:59:04,770
Alison Mondul (she/her): So the other thing to note is that this is for adults 18 and over and they're not compensated and it's a telephone interview.

406
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:16,410
Alison Mondul (she/her): The numbers are generated through religion right random digit dialing again like enhanced not a simple random sample so if you're going to do this on your own you need to use the way to design variables in your analysis.

407
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:27,450
Alison Mondul (she/her): So just as a little comparison both of these have both enhance and purpose, have a complex survey design, so you have to use those weights and survey variables in your analysis.

408
00:59:27,840 --> 00:59:39,870
Alison Mondul (she/her): they're both cross sectional, meaning that they are asking, at one point in time, all of these questions they're not asking people things and then following them over time to find out whether they got disease they're not following these people at all.

409
00:59:40,170 --> 00:59:43,500
Alison Mondul (she/her): They are at one moment in time, asking them a bunch of questions okay.

410
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:47,100
Alison Mondul (she/her): um they do cover some of the same information.

411
00:59:48,510 --> 00:59:56,040
Alison Mondul (she/her): differences and hands includes children purposes 18 and over, and he has no state level data and that's one of the big.

412
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:04,290
Alison Mondul (she/her): pluses of purpose right is that you get state, you can get state specific estimates.

413
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:16,830
Alison Mondul (she/her): And haines uses in person interviews exams and biological specimens whereas purpose is all self reported information over the phone, but this is why you're able to get 500,000 people right so.

414
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:32,130
Alison Mondul (she/her): Everything in epidemiology is a trade off, you can have fantastic laboratory data personal like exam data very, very detailed data on a smaller number of people.

415
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:50,310
Alison Mondul (she/her): Or you can have less detailed data on a huge number of people, and there are pros and cons to both right and it's just it's kind of always this seesaw between how detailed, can you get how perfect can your assessment be and how many people can you do it on.

416
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:58,110
Nolaundron Harris: Here is this could the i'm wondering, like a Kappa.

417
01:00:59,550 --> 01:01:01,860
Nolaundron Harris: thing could be applied to this to compare like.

418
01:01:02,550 --> 01:01:07,590
Alison Mondul (she/her): People have done so there's entire you can't do a Kappa because you're not it's not the same people.

419
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:17,220
Alison Mondul (she/her): Right and it's all de identified so I suppose it's possible actually that some of the same people are in both but we don't know because it's all to identify.

420
01:01:18,390 --> 01:01:26,730
Alison Mondul (she/her): So you can't do a cap of people have compared, for example, the BMI data like I said there's an entire paper out there, comparing BMI information from.

421
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:35,130
Alison Mondul (she/her): And hands up from purpose and, as you might imagine the BMI is lower and versus than it is in campaigns.

422
01:01:35,670 --> 01:01:43,410
Alison Mondul (she/her): Because people tend to when they have the option, they tend to if they're going to be untruthful about their weight they tend to be untruthful in the lower direction.

423
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,250
Alison Mondul (she/her): i'm at a population level right but.

424
01:01:47,880 --> 01:02:01,920
Alison Mondul (she/her): I will say that trends, over time, where the same right, so what you saw was that, although the absolute number for like average behind the population was lower in purpose and it wasn't enhance the trends of BMI increasing over time, you could see in both.

425
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:16,290
Alison Mondul (she/her): Does that make sense, so people are like consistently line, the same amount lower, I guess, but you can see, the trend in the population, so it's not worthless data right.

426
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:27,540
Alison Mondul (she/her): Self report data is not just trash you just have to recognize the limitations of it and getting it on 500,000 people allows you to do state specific estimates, which is important right.

427
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:43,290
Alison Mondul (she/her): So I think you know there's pros and cons to all of it and and comparing between an audience and purpose, when you can I do think is valuable, but um you can't do state by state estimates on 500,000 people if you're going to go measure their BMI.

428
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:49,830
Alison Mondul (she/her): can't do it it's logistically and monetary unfeasible it's just can't be done.

429
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:51,540
Right.

430
01:02:52,680 --> 01:03:03,450
Alison Mondul (she/her): So I think that's the kind of thing you just always have to be thoughtful about it's really easy to be like oh perfect that's telephone interviews who wants to use that but it's really valuable and.

431
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:05,370
Alison Mondul (she/her): It you know.

432
01:03:06,780 --> 01:03:12,540
Alison Mondul (she/her): it's 500,000 people you can't get in person exam data on 500,000 people every year you just can't.

433
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,720
Alison Mondul (she/her): So they both have their own pros and cons.

434
01:03:21,450 --> 01:03:22,170
Alison Mondul (she/her): Any questions.

435
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,880
Alison Mondul (she/her): The other thing to notice the response rates are different right.

436
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:29,490
Alison Mondul (she/her): it's real real easy.

437
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:37,230
Alison Mondul (she/her): Especially when cellphones became more common than landlines and you see like anonymous or like.

438
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:47,700
Alison Mondul (she/her): Wireless color or I don't know what it says when purpose calls you on the phone but it's not like your mom right, so I mean you probably aren't answering.

439
01:03:49,050 --> 01:03:52,320
Alison Mondul (she/her): So, if you look at just let's pick the.

440
01:03:55,980 --> 01:04:09,780
Alison Mondul (she/her): percent and then 2000 their response rate was 48.9% meeting of all the people they called about half of them actually answered the phone and answer their survey and haynes for the interview it's like 82% and 76% of the exam.

441
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:21,630
Alison Mondul (she/her): And that's because they're providing compensation they're driving people there there's a big draw in terms of they get all their exam results, so you know, particularly.

442
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:31,350
Alison Mondul (she/her): Before the affordable care act when people didn't you know not that there aren't still people who you know don't have health insurance, but you know, having someone drive if you are.

443
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:42,630
Alison Mondul (she/her): disabled or you have trouble getting around or Whatever the case may be, having someone drive you to a very comprehensive medical examination that you're getting done for free that's not nothing right like that's valuable so.

444
01:04:43,110 --> 01:04:53,820
Alison Mondul (she/her): um and hands just has a lot a lot better participation rates and I will say also, though, the thing to know here is that in all of these participation rates are falling.

445
01:04:54,180 --> 01:05:01,290
Alison Mondul (she/her): And this is something that people have noted across all kinds of research is that getting people to participate is hard it's getting harder.

446
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:09,750
Alison Mondul (she/her): alright.

447
01:05:12,060 --> 01:05:14,580
Alison Mondul (she/her): We only have a little bit left, so I think i'm going to keep going.

448
01:05:15,810 --> 01:05:16,920
Alison Mondul (she/her): Other than take a break.

449
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:21,720
Alison Mondul (she/her): Now we're going to shift gears and talk a little bit about global stuff.

450
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:24,420
Alison Mondul (she/her): So told you a lot about.

451
01:05:25,950 --> 01:05:32,670
Alison Mondul (she/her): US Data so now i'm going to tell you about the demographic and health surveys or DHS, so this is a global.

452
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:41,340
Alison Mondul (she/her): survey right trying to cut to look at various things in more developing countries.

453
01:05:42,030 --> 01:05:49,380
Alison Mondul (she/her): And so the objective is to provide decision makers in participating countries with approved information and analyses useful for informed policy choices.

454
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:59,790
Alison Mondul (she/her): To improve coordination of partnerships and data collection at the International country levels and to develop in the participating countries the skills and resources necessary to conduct high quality demographic and health service.

455
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:09,240
Alison Mondul (she/her): To improve data collection and analysis tools and methodology and to improve the dissemination and utilization of data so that's a lot of words.

456
01:06:10,170 --> 01:06:21,630
Alison Mondul (she/her): But really what this came out of was a concern about world population size, increasing and this idea of maybe a population explosion, particularly in developing countries and a lack of.

457
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:32,610
Alison Mondul (she/her): data being collected on final statistics in developing countries and so really they were interested in a lot kind of the core of thing that they were interested in when they started this was fertility.

458
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:38,730
Alison Mondul (she/her): Infant and child mortality right so like population data about births and deaths.

459
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:54,210
Alison Mondul (she/her): They also collect a lot of additional information on like health related to diarrhea immunization maternal mortality now they have knowledge attitudes and practices about HIV, AIDS, they have a lot of information on violence against women.

460
01:06:55,650 --> 01:07:03,990
Alison Mondul (she/her): And in countries where malaria is an important problem they talk about use of bed nets and things like that they also have some information on nutrition and.

461
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:14,910
Alison Mondul (she/her): In more recent years they've done some biological measures and height and weight, the edit and media testing and they turn five and they've actually added about 20 biomarkers to do surveys and 50 countries.

462
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:23,130
Alison Mondul (she/her): This has been ongoing for a long time we're now in a phase eight I guess.

463
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:30,660
Alison Mondul (she/her): it's included in 90 countries, these are nationally representative samples repeated surveys and countries.

464
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:40,740
Alison Mondul (she/her): But the model question is, do change from face to face and the optional modular modules also changed so again, this is one of those things we're combining across phases, can be a bit of a challenge.

465
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:45,600
Alison Mondul (she/her): And it's also important to know that.

466
01:07:47,610 --> 01:07:49,860
Alison Mondul (she/her): Not all of these countries have.

467
01:07:51,510 --> 01:08:01,950
Alison Mondul (she/her): have been represented in all phases are really good example is, for example, Thailand, I believe they were in Phase one and then we're not included in later phases, because they've actually.

468
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:14,460
Alison Mondul (she/her): moved up in development, so they were kind of a developing country and therefore sort of eligible to be part of DHS and then, as they developed further and became sort of a.

469
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:27,240
Alison Mondul (she/her): middle developed or a low low low or high middle income country, I was trying to say low high income country that's not right it's a high middle income country um.

470
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:32,970
Alison Mondul (she/her): As they kind of moved up through development they they started doing their own stuff and they no longer.

471
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:39,480
Alison Mondul (she/her): per se in DHS right so not all of these countries are in all phases, some of them are only in one phase.

472
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:53,580
Alison Mondul (she/her): But this gives you an example, so these are kind of like all USAid countries, because this is run through DHS has run in partnership with USAid so you don't have developed developed countries in in DHS it's really developing nations.

473
01:08:55,590 --> 01:09:02,610
Alison Mondul (she/her): So they have multiple different questionnaires they've got the household questionnaire, which can be completed by any adult member of the household who's capable of providing information.

474
01:09:03,750 --> 01:09:10,410
Alison Mondul (she/her): Members or visitors are eligible so visitors are people who don't usually live there, but you stay there, the previous night, for example.

475
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:23,190
Alison Mondul (she/her): And it can include all ever married women and men between 15 and the upper limit varies from them, but you know they say 49 is the upper limit per women.

476
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,460
Alison Mondul (she/her): Why do you think to have those age limits.

477
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:46,890
Alison Mondul (she/her): Like I told you that fertility was kind of the number one thing that motivated this questionnaire, in the first place, and so this is really the ages, during which women are potentially childbearing.

478
01:09:47,610 --> 01:10:02,280
Alison Mondul (she/her): This is also why didn't include ever married women because in many of these countries it's not socially acceptable for unmarried women to be sexually active, and so they are only asking these fertility related questions of married women.

479
01:10:03,780 --> 01:10:08,670
Alison Mondul (she/her): um so you can find out more about the survey types, if you go to the DHS website.

480
01:10:10,110 --> 01:10:16,860
Alison Mondul (she/her): They also have some of these other questionnaires, like the women's questionnaire the man's questionnaire biomarkers and modules and.

481
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:28,950
Alison Mondul (she/her): The women's questionnaire, maybe all are only one eligible women and they do some of these things on only selected household so not all of the households included will have these additional questionnaires.

482
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:35,910
Alison Mondul (she/her): Some of the modules are special like, for example, if the domestic violence module is included, it is only asked the one woman in the household.

483
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:48,030
Alison Mondul (she/her): And that is so, to kind of protect that woman, so that she can be more honest in her responses, because if multiple women are being asked, then they know that the questions were asked right, and so there could be retribution if.

484
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:53,490
Alison Mondul (she/her): You know, someone finds out that this woman was telling me about her true experiences.

485
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,990
Alison Mondul (she/her): And there's these other indicator surveys as well.

486
01:10:59,670 --> 01:11:08,940
Alison Mondul (she/her): So you can basically go download the data says, you have to register online, but it's not onerous I just want to kind of know who's getting the data again you have to use the sample weights.

487
01:11:10,470 --> 01:11:20,640
Alison Mondul (she/her): there's also some online tools, where you can kind of create maps and tables without registering but they're not as you're not going to be able to be as thorough as if you really wanted to do an analysis with these days, but download them.

488
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:29,880
Alison Mondul (she/her): So if you go to the DHS website, they have these reports that are published all over all I regularly like every year about each country.

489
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:37,440
Alison Mondul (she/her): They also have peer reviewed publications and i'm going to give you some examples of things that have been published by you event researchers.

490
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:48,510
Alison Mondul (she/her): So um This is all work, a lot of work that's been done by shimano Harlow has a professor here at university of Michigan and she does a lot of work with intimate partner, violence and violence against women.

491
01:11:49,230 --> 01:11:57,600
Alison Mondul (she/her): So, several of these papers are kind of in that vein, so this was published in 2012, this is a student who work with her on this paper.

492
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:04,860
Alison Mondul (she/her): And I think this is really interesting she was looking at intimate partner, violence and how it affects skill, the 10 minutes at the most recent delivery among women in Kenya.

493
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:19,080
Alison Mondul (she/her): So I think this is interesting to note that they started out with almost 10,000 households, but only 8889 were occupied So this was like what they tried to survey, but they only got responses for this funny and only this many had eligible women in.

494
01:12:21,120 --> 01:12:23,820
Alison Mondul (she/her): a subset were selected for the domestic violence module.

495
01:12:25,140 --> 01:12:38,940
Alison Mondul (she/her): And 4580 wherever married at only 1038 and giving birth in the private year and there was once they got rid of some of these other potential covariance or interest that were important they only had 975 with not missing data.

496
01:12:39,990 --> 01:12:47,760
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay, so we started out the very excited that we had almost 10,000 people, but that ended up being not quite so many once we made our expressions.

497
01:12:49,350 --> 01:12:54,870
Alison Mondul (she/her): So anyway, this is really interesting because if you just look at the crude um.

498
01:12:56,490 --> 01:13:09,180
Alison Mondul (she/her): So people, this is the odds ratios of skilled attendance at their birth by experience of intimate partner violence okay so essentially what this is saying is that if they ever experienced emotional violence they were less likely to have a skilled attendance.

499
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:10,830
Alison Mondul (she/her): With them when they were giving birth.

500
01:13:12,900 --> 01:13:25,680
Alison Mondul (she/her): And the same is true for those who experienced physical or sexual violence and after adjustment for multiple things these results are made similar some of the statistical significance goes away.

501
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:39,360
Alison Mondul (she/her): But I would not interpret that as this not being meaningful, I think, for example, those who are reporting ever sexual violence, this is probably a small number of women who are actually reporting this, which is why your confidence intervals or fighter.

502
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,140
Alison Mondul (she/her): But I do think this is this is pretty interesting stuff.

503
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:52,260
Alison Mondul (she/her): This is another of another study looking at women's sexual empowerment and contraceptive using bona.

504
01:13:53,760 --> 01:14:03,930
Alison Mondul (she/her): So, again we ended up with 2104 women with no missing data for this analysis I say we I didn't do this I don't know why i'm saying wait they ended up with that.

505
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:06,780
Alison Mondul (she/her): And so, these were the.

506
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:15,420
Alison Mondul (she/her): variables that they used to measure sexual empowerment, so the first the participant felt that they could refuse sex, yes or no.

507
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:20,250
Alison Mondul (she/her): And so, in this case know was the unimpaired response right.

508
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:29,220
Alison Mondul (she/her): The first person feels a meeting is justified sex is refused purchasing ask a partner to use a condom and so on and so forth, and then they created the score where they just.

509
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:42,960
Alison Mondul (she/her): added up the empowered response for each of the questions right So if you said yes to this one, and no to this one, yes to this one, yes and yes, you would get five does that make sense.

510
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,760
Alison Mondul (she/her): And so what you see is that, basically, for all of these the.

511
01:14:48,930 --> 01:14:55,830
Alison Mondul (she/her): empowered response of women were statistically statistically significantly more likely to use contraception.

512
01:14:58,140 --> 01:14:59,400
Alison Mondul (she/her): quick question yep.

513
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:00,270
Are.

514
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:03,090
Nolaundron Harris: So far, SOFA like crude are.

515
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:13,620
Nolaundron Harris: Is the equation, or whatever the plugin is that similar to like crew mortality rate is it similar how to calculate.

516
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,380
Alison Mondul (she/her): We are going to learn how to calculate an odds ratio.

517
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:19,770
Alison Mondul (she/her): This week or next week, I think this week.

518
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:31,350
Alison Mondul (she/her): you're going to learn how to do that, essentially, if it is equal to one it's a ratio measure so it's like if you were it's you can think of it like comparing to.

519
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:41,880
Alison Mondul (she/her): Like if you were going to take one mortality rate and divided by another if the answer was one that would mean never the same as each other if it was greater than one that would mean the numerator is bigger.

520
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:58,980
Alison Mondul (she/her): And if it's less than one the opposite right, so in this case they're saying odds of using contraception are higher compared to those who don't refuse sex and those who feel that they can't refuse sex, so if a woman is giving me more empowered answer she is more likely to use contraception.

521
01:16:00,510 --> 01:16:04,110
Alison Mondul (she/her): Is what this is telling you because the odds ratio is above one.

522
01:16:05,220 --> 01:16:10,710
Alison Mondul (she/her): And statistically significant day so according to their calculations, with a little stars right.

523
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:17,460
Alison Mondul (she/her): And this is telling you that PR increases score it goes up by 1.1 times.

524
01:16:19,290 --> 01:16:22,200
Alison Mondul (she/her): So that's kind of what you would expect right.

525
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:32,070
Alison Mondul (she/her): But this is interesting, so this is the sexual empowerment score.

526
01:16:33,270 --> 01:16:46,650
Alison Mondul (she/her): So, as this increases, you can see that the generally speaking the odds of contraceptive use increase right so for let's just look at this this line among the poorest women so they have stratified here by wealth quintile.

527
01:16:46,980 --> 01:16:52,200
Alison Mondul (she/her): So, if you look among the poorest women as the sexual empowerment score increases, so does their odds of US contraception.

528
01:16:52,830 --> 01:17:02,790
Alison Mondul (she/her): And that's true for all of the women but it's less true and the richest woman, so that tells you maybe is that the richest woman are already kind of high up here and sexual empowerment doesn't really.

529
01:17:03,240 --> 01:17:10,560
Alison Mondul (she/her): they're already it's it's almost like their wealth is more important than their sexual empowerment they're already in this kind of upper.

530
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:23,610
Alison Mondul (she/her): level of contraceptive use just because they're wealthy so sexual empowerment score seems to be more impactful in terms of these and contraceptives in those lower level entitles compared to the highest.

531
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:35,520
Alison Mondul (she/her): So I think this is interesting that you can get this from DHS data she also looked at women status and intimate partner violence right, so this is looking at.

532
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:45,540
Alison Mondul (she/her): I think this is actually really impactful that 68.2% of women in the in the dfc this is in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

533
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:53,220
Alison Mondul (she/her): ever experienced at least one of three types of violence, this wasn't associated with HIV education so obviously this is very prevalent.

534
01:17:54,090 --> 01:18:02,340
Alison Mondul (she/her): And so there were a partner factors that were associated with this so basically if their partner drink alcohol.

535
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:12,090
Alison Mondul (she/her): They were more likely to experience any of these types of intimate partner, violence and less likely to experience any of these types of intimate partner violence their partner heavily one way.

536
01:18:14,340 --> 01:18:22,320
Alison Mondul (she/her): So you can see that some of these questions that are asked our questions that maybe are culturally relevant to a particular country.

537
01:18:22,830 --> 01:18:35,070
Alison Mondul (she/her): Like the question about how many wives, do you have probably is not something that would be on a standard question here in the US right because that's just not a common practice in our country, but in the ERC is something that you know they need to ask about.

538
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:43,230
Alison Mondul (she/her): So it's interesting, I think that in, you will get kind of different questions on many of these questions, because the range of countries that they're covering.

539
01:18:43,620 --> 01:18:54,720
Alison Mondul (she/her): Remember, this map is huge right and so culture is different across all of these places, and so some things will be important on some questionnaires and some will not be on others, and so they are tailored to the the.

540
01:18:55,980 --> 01:18:56,760
Alison Mondul (she/her): country in question.

541
01:18:57,510 --> 01:19:09,060
Alison Mondul (she/her): I thought this was really interesting, you can also do interesting stuff looking across country, so the examples I showed you before within one country where they took data from one of the countries that the DHS operates in and looked at data from that country.

542
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:18,210
Alison Mondul (she/her): But you can look across countries as well, so this is factors associated attitudes towards intimate partner, violence against women, and this is comparing seven sub Saharan countries in Africa.

543
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:28,680
Alison Mondul (she/her): And so you can see that these are responses, I believe, from women so saying that the percentage of women who think that intimate partner violence is justified.

544
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:38,040
Alison Mondul (she/her): If they do these things right, so in Ethiopia 57.2% of women think that intimate partner violence is justified, but she goes out with her without telling her spouse.

545
01:19:39,150 --> 01:19:40,980
Alison Mondul (she/her): Right and so it's kind of ranked by the total.

546
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:52,050
Alison Mondul (she/her): And I think this is interesting because it's actually very different when you asked the men.

547
01:19:54,480 --> 01:20:02,910
Alison Mondul (she/her): First of all, the total is different, which I think is interesting, because I think it implies that the men know that they shouldn't be saying they think it's justified.

548
01:20:04,410 --> 01:20:09,480
Alison Mondul (she/her): So there's a bias toward a preferred answer here, I think.

549
01:20:11,070 --> 01:20:14,850
Alison Mondul (she/her): But um but, but the ranking of the countries is very different, which is interesting.

550
01:20:20,610 --> 01:20:24,660
Alison Mondul (she/her): So that's an example of the kinds of things that you can do with DHS data.

551
01:20:26,730 --> 01:20:31,440
Alison Mondul (she/her): and the last thing I wanted to tell you about his cancer registration, so this is another source of.

552
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:41,910
Alison Mondul (she/her): Data that's near dear to my heart, of course, that is publicly available so in the US, we have this year cancer registry the surveillance.

553
01:20:41,910 --> 01:20:43,440
Denise White-Perkins: epidemiology results.

554
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:56,370
Alison Mondul (she/her): It was started in 1973 as a result of Richard Nixon signing the national cancer act of 1971 provide the funding for this it originally included, only a few places.

555
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:03,060
Alison Mondul (she/her): That were selected for significant population subgroups and their ability to implement operate and maintain a high quality registry.

556
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:14,730
Alison Mondul (she/her): But it now includes quite a few more importantly, we have, until recently, have the Detroit seer site here, which included a large number of the African Americans that were included in here.

557
01:21:16,050 --> 01:21:21,960
Alison Mondul (she/her): they've made an effort to include native American populations in Arizona, and the cherokee nation in Oklahoma.

558
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:39,840
Alison Mondul (she/her): They have included sites in California, because this includes a large number of Hispanic as well as Asian populations they've also got Hawaii and Alaska for the Hawaii and Alaska native populations and they try to get both urban and rural populations so they're trying hard to.

559
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:46,260
Alison Mondul (she/her): Get places across the US that have the represent various populations subgroups.

560
01:21:48,420 --> 01:22:06,660
Alison Mondul (she/her): So, since he doesn't want to hear covers about 28,028% of the US population, including this proportion of the population, so groups listed here it is population based and currently contains records of over 8 million cancers, with about 440,000 new cases reported every year.

561
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:12,930
Alison Mondul (she/her): And you can go to sear cancer.gov and you can play around with cancer data.

562
01:22:14,310 --> 01:22:20,580
Alison Mondul (she/her): There are also a couple of definitive sources of global cancer information so serious, where we get definitive cancer information for the US.

563
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:28,740
Alison Mondul (she/her): But they're ci five and global can and they're a bit different from one another, a ci five.

564
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:31,770
Alison Mondul (she/her): So.

565
01:22:33,300 --> 01:22:39,450
Alison Mondul (she/her): Global can tries to make estimates for every country that it can.

566
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:47,970
Alison Mondul (she/her): Most countries, particularly developing countries do not have high quality population based cancer registries.

567
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:56,310
Alison Mondul (she/her): Because they are in the process of moving potentially maybe there aren't they aren't moving to the epidemiologic transition that we talked about and they're still quite developing.

568
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:02,280
Alison Mondul (she/her): And so, cancer is not like on their radar is the most important public health problem right there probably dealing with more.

569
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:14,220
Alison Mondul (she/her): into mortality malaria other kinds of infectious causes of death right and so it's very expensive to put together a cancer registry and if it's not your primary public health problem in your country, probably not going to spend the money to do it right.

570
01:23:15,150 --> 01:23:21,960
Alison Mondul (she/her): So global can uses whatever data it can to estimate for countries that don't have a great cancer registry system.

571
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:34,080
Alison Mondul (she/her): ci five when we includes high quality data from high quality population based cancer industries, so this is like if your registry is included in ci five That means that it's a very good registry.

572
01:23:35,370 --> 01:23:42,240
Alison Mondul (she/her): If that makes sense, but it may not include data for all countries, global canada's trying to estimate data for all countries that account.

573
01:23:44,310 --> 01:23:48,900
Alison Mondul (she/her): So you can actually go to this website I think it's actually really kind of cool i'm going to go.

574
01:23:55,350 --> 01:23:59,490
Alison Mondul (she/her): To the global cancer observatory and I Ark and show you a little.

575
01:24:00,630 --> 01:24:03,510
Alison Mondul (she/her): fun thing if you're a big nerd like me it's fun.

576
01:24:04,530 --> 01:24:15,870
Alison Mondul (she/her): um so you can do things like go to a maps right, and this is through 2020 so you can look at this is, you can make a map of the estimated.

577
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:27,750
Alison Mondul (she/her): cancer incidence rate a standardized incidence rate a standardized it's important to a real standard a all cancers both sexes all ages, you can do mortality instead.

578
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:38,880
Alison Mondul (she/her): You can just do certain age groups, you can do if you don't want the standardized right, you can get crude rate if that's what you want right.

579
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:49,950
Alison Mondul (she/her): You can do specific cancers, we could just do bladder cancer, for example, right, and you can do all kinds of it, and if you hover over the country or click on the country you're going to get.

580
01:24:50,580 --> 01:25:00,120
Alison Mondul (she/her): So I clicked here on Argentina and it shows me information, specifically for Argentina with like the cancer i'm currently mapping shown in a different color.

581
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,640
Alison Mondul (she/her): So this is like.

582
01:25:04,170 --> 01:25:10,020
Alison Mondul (she/her): If your mind kind of nerd you could probably spend a long time just website playing around taking pictures.

583
01:25:13,980 --> 01:25:17,340
Alison Mondul (she/her): Alright, are we back to the PowerPoint now is that what you guys are seeing.

584
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:21,630
Alison Mondul (she/her): Okay.

585
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:31,980
Alison Mondul (she/her): So just keep in mind that you're going to get data you saw that beautiful now that have various shades of red and it gave you data for a bunch of countries.

586
01:25:33,150 --> 01:25:46,920
Alison Mondul (she/her): Not all of it is created equal right, some of it is an estimate Okay, and so the dark green here are high quality with high coverage countries all the way down to the light yellow which is just frequency data so.

587
01:25:47,790 --> 01:26:03,750
Alison Mondul (she/her): And then the Gray, has no data and anything you're getting to that country is being estimated from data from nearby countries, so I mean the same with mortality data, I mean there's even more great on this map mortality data is not available from a large proportion of the world.

588
01:26:06,750 --> 01:26:12,570
Alison Mondul (she/her): So they'll give it to you, but it's an estimate and it's not always clear unless you know what's under the hood that you're not.

589
01:26:13,830 --> 01:26:19,500
Alison Mondul (she/her): it's not going to show you any difference right you're just going to get a number for all of these countries you're going to get a number.

590
01:26:19,830 --> 01:26:29,940
Alison Mondul (she/her): For this country, just like you're going to get a number for the US right and it's you just have to understand that it's not the same quality of data it's an estimate in some places that make sense.

591
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:33,990
Alison Mondul (she/her): In a click skip this.

592
01:26:35,670 --> 01:26:40,560
Alison Mondul (she/her): This was my student Christian and i'm in here and there, I am i'm hiding behind this lady.

593
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:48,660
Alison Mondul (she/her): And he actually used data from the Thai cancer registry, for his dissertation so we were visiting sample Thailand.

594
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:56,880
Alison Mondul (she/her): At the Prince of sampling university this gentleman here is such a stripper he is the reason that they have a high quality cancer registry in Ireland.

595
01:26:57,390 --> 01:27:03,690
Alison Mondul (she/her): And the reason we're interested in looking at registry data from Thailand this because they are unique in men in.

596
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:12,000
Alison Mondul (she/her): As far as I know, they are unique in the world, because they have had a high quality population based cancer industry during their entire up the logic transition.

597
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:28,410
Alison Mondul (she/her): So their registry started in 1990 because this guy started it, and so, if you want real time data on how cancer rates change in the population, as the country develops from a low to middle income country high middle income country Thailand is the place to look.

598
01:27:29,730 --> 01:27:32,280
Alison Mondul (she/her): We also went to Indonesia on this trip.

599
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:48,030
Alison Mondul (she/her): This lady right here is a pathologist at karmanos cancer Center in Jakarta, Indonesia and which means that she's incredibly busy because basically dermis is the national cancer hospital for Jakarta or for.

600
01:27:49,020 --> 01:27:56,220
Alison Mondul (she/her): Jakarta Indonesia, which is a mega city of millions and millions of people like the line is out the door, I mean she is busy, and in her free time.

601
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:07,620
Alison Mondul (she/her): She is i'm setting up a cancer registry system, which is a real challenge in Indonesia, because it's a series of like thousands of islands right and so actually just getting picking your sites.

602
01:28:08,010 --> 01:28:14,430
Alison Mondul (she/her): is a challenge, and then actually getting the data back to a centralized location is a challenge, so Dr Greene is pretty amazing.

603
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:18,630
Alison Mondul (she/her): area drinking water course.

604
01:28:20,940 --> 01:28:22,500
Alison Mondul (she/her): Anyway, so what he what a.

605
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:28,890
Alison Mondul (she/her): Christian was able to show based on industry data is that the projected rates of prostate cancer.

606
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:34,110
Alison Mondul (she/her): are quite high and mortality in particular.

607
01:28:35,160 --> 01:28:42,150
Alison Mondul (she/her): is going to increase in a prostate cancer mortality rates remain stable in the US, the projected mortality rate in stock levels surpassed the US rate by 20.

608
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:50,490
Alison Mondul (she/her): And, which means that maybe they need to start working on a prostate cancer screening Program.

609
01:28:52,650 --> 01:29:03,300
Alison Mondul (she/her): We were also able to use the registry data find out some interesting stuff we know the prostate cancer incidence incidence is higher in Buddhists and Muslims, since office so simple it is in the south of Thailand and one of their.

610
01:29:04,830 --> 01:29:14,160
Alison Mondul (she/her): Buddhist and the majority population and Muslims have kind of come in from neighboring countries, particularly in the south part of silence and they are more of a minority group.

611
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:19,770
Alison Mondul (she/her): And so, prostate cancer incidence is higher and Buddhists and Muslims, but what.

612
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:35,040
Alison Mondul (she/her): Christian showed what from the registry data was that among men with prostate cancer Muslims are more likely to dive into this and there's probably a bunch of reasons for this anecdotally doctors in Thailand will tell you that there's a lot of sort of cultural.

613
01:29:36,690 --> 01:29:42,090
Alison Mondul (she/her): Resistance to treatment sort of fatalism around cancer in this Muslim population that they kind of like well.

614
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:58,230
Alison Mondul (she/her): I guess I have cancer, I might as well go home kind of a thing, rather than really seeking treatment for it um so there may be potentially some culturally relevant or specific interventions that could be conducted to try to get this population so maybe they'll lose those and care more.

615
01:30:01,980 --> 01:30:09,540
Alison Mondul (she/her): not going to go through this So those are some examples of publicly available data sources in the US and globally and kind of some of the stuff that you can do with them.

616
01:30:10,230 --> 01:30:20,700
Alison Mondul (she/her): i'm in other sort of a whirlwind overview, but I think that, knowing that some of those things are out there and that they're accessible for free is really important, and I hope that that will be helpful to some of you as you.

617
01:30:21,840 --> 01:30:22,590
Alison Mondul (she/her): Do your work.

618
01:30:27,660 --> 01:30:28,470
Any questions.

619
01:30:36,180 --> 01:30:37,200
brenda.w.campbell: That was really.

620
01:30:40,260 --> 01:30:49,050
Alison Mondul (she/her): Good um I hope I hope it'll be helpful, like I said in the real class i'm able to go into a lot more detail about like how you do some of the analyses, with the enhanced data, for example, but.

621
01:30:49,470 --> 01:30:56,850
Alison Mondul (she/her): I think just knowing that it's there and and knowing that there are complexities that you need to be aware of if you're going to use it, you know I think just having that.

622
01:30:57,900 --> 01:30:59,370
Alison Mondul (she/her): In your back pocket is important.

623
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:08,880
Alison Mondul (she/her): All right.

624
01:31:10,470 --> 01:31:17,280
Alison Mondul (she/her): we're done a bit early does anybody have any questions burning questions that occurred to them about the exam while I was talking about data.

625
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:24,540
Okay.

626
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:39,420
Alison Mondul (she/her): Well hey Rachel and La Liga stick around I can't remember what we decided about who's going to be on when so if we could make sure we know who's going to be on the zoom call tomorrow at what times that would be that would be great and um.

627
01:31:40,590 --> 01:31:50,940
Alison Mondul (she/her): I guess the rest of you guys have a good afternoon enjoy your couple extra hours, and I will see you guys, we will be on zoom tomorrow you don't need to log in.

628
01:31:52,350 --> 01:32:06,930
Alison Mondul (she/her): But will be available on here if you guys have questions and the teams will be at office hours tomorrow, excuse me, I think, just over zoom since we're not coming in, because of the exam so um if anybody has any last minute like.

629
01:32:07,980 --> 01:32:15,330
Alison Mondul (she/her): You can go to office hours between 1215 to 115 correct on the classroom and they will be there to answer questions.

630
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:18,720
Nolaundron Harris: Thank you all so much.
