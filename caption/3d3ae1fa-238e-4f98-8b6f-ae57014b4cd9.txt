00:00:01,330 --> 00:00:06,940
Hi, this is Atisa Sioshansi. And welcome to the Connect, the Issues podcast,

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:16,780
where we highlight important issues and discuss how they are connected to our communities. Because as we say here, connection catalyzes action.

3
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:24,790
In our next two episodes, we will connect the health impacts of climate change to our homeless community here in Los Angeles.

4
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:31,510
In this episode, we will cover heat waves, climate change and the impact on LA's homeless populations.

5
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:39,380
And in episode two, we will discuss air pollution, climate change and the impact on L.A.'s homeless populations.

6
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:45,350
So let's start with some brief stats and background on the issues we want to connect today.

7
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:54,950
First, homelessness in L.A. Based on the last poll homelessness report that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,

8
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:04,840
or HUD Los Angeles is number two on the list of cities with the highest homelessness populations.

9
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,850
So New York City is number one. So let me put it all into perspective with the numbers.

10
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:14,300
According to the HUD report, in 2020,

11
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:22,190
580,466 people experienced homelessness on a given single night in the US,

12
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:26,390
which was a 2.2 percent increase from the previous year.

13
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:32,330
Unfortunately, homelessness rates have been rising consecutively since 2016.

14
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:41,780
California accounted for twenty eight percent of the total homeless population and 51 percent of the unsheltered homeless population.

15
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:49,760
Los Angeles, the metro area of Los Angeles, accounted for approximately sixty four thousand homeless people,

16
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:59,750
which is about 11 percent of the total homeless population, making L.A. and number two in New York City, with about 13 percent of the total.

17
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:07,520
So more than one in 10 homeless people reside here in L.A., which is a significant number.

18
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:14,660
Now let's discuss heatwaves and climate change in L.A. Although there are many impacts of climate change in L.A.,

19
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,630
two of the most critical issues for the L.A. region are heat waves and air pollution.

20
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:26,120
Since we are focusing on heat waves and this episode, let me give you some background on them.

21
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,350
L.A. is an urban city where temperatures surpass 100 degrees Fahrenheit quite regularly during the summer and fall months.

22
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:43,120
In fact, on September six, 2020, Los Angeles County recorded its highest temperature ever at 121 degrees Fahrenheit.

23
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,230
Climate change is increasing these temperatures to even higher highs and causing longer consecutive days of hot temperatures,

24
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:56,110
which cause heat waves, a heat wave is defined as a period of abnormally hot weather,

25
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:00,940
generally lasting more than two days, according to a study that Glen Holley,

26
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:10,540
who is a climate researcher at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and colleagues they published in July 2020.

27
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:17,620
They said heat waves are becoming more frequent, lasting longer and increasing in nighttime temperature and humidity,

28
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:22,610
particularly in urban regions such as the L.A. Basin.

29
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:29,180
Based on their examination of heat trends in Southern California from 1950 to 2020,

30
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:34,640
the team concluded that these temperature increases in L.A. are most likely because urban areas

31
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,360
act as heat islands consisting of less cooling vegetation and more heat absorbing surfaces,

32
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,370
such as roads and buildings that rerated heat stored during the daytime.

33
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:52,730
So climate change is increasing the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves in L.A.

34
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,150
For now,

35
00:03:53,150 --> 00:04:02,630
I'll also briefly state that air pollution is following similar trends that heat waves as heat waves in L.A. the increase in temperatures with

36
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:12,640
climate change is increasing in the amount of air pollution and bad air days in L.A. We'll discuss air pollution in more detail in episode two.

37
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:22,660
So now we see that we have two key issues coming together homelessness and climate change in L.A. we have a high homeless population living in L.A.,

38
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:30,160
which is the city that is experiencing even more and longer heat waves and bad air days due to climate change.

39
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:38,500
Now, let's discuss the health impacts so that we can make the connection between heat waves, climate change and the homeless population of L.A.

40
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:45,220
We will make the connection by considering what makes the L.A. homeless community vulnerable, vulnerable,

41
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:55,180
what the expectations of climate change impacts are and finally, what additional impacts this makes on this already vulnerable population.

42
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:04,750
So let's start with what makes the L.A. homeless community vulnerable while they live in vulnerable areas and spend more time outdoors.

43
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:14,530
They experience higher rates of poverty, food insecurity and poor access to transportation, and the community has a high prevalence of mental illness,

44
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:22,350
cardiovascular disease, respiratory conditions, alcoholism, drug addiction and social isolation.

45
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,700
What are the expectations of climate change impacts on the heatwaves? Well,

46
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,690
climate change will increase the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and

47
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,630
therefore heat related deaths are expected to double by 2050 and triple by 2080,

48
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:40,980
according to the Adrian R. Rockefeller Foundation Resilience Center.

49
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:46,290
Heat waves have a particularly strong impact in Southern California,

50
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:53,040
where they have become more frequent, intense and longer lasting over the past five decades.

51
00:05:53,040 --> 00:06:01,110
Los Angeles, as predicted by 2050 to experience an average of 20 to extreme heat days annually,

52
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:07,090
which is up from six days in the period from 1980 to 2000.

53
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:18,330
And finally, what additional health impacts. Makes this already, well hit on this already vulnerable population.

54
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:26,370
Well, LA's homeless population will experience even higher heat related deaths and illnesses such as dehydration,

55
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:33,260
heat exhaustion, heat stroke and heat cramps as a result of all of these increased heat waves.

56
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,340
So now that we've made the connection, let's talk about simple actions you can take.

57
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,130
Most of the solutions to reducing the health impacts we discussed are either tied to adaptation,

58
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:50,970
which means efforts to help the community live with the issues or mitigation efforts that will stop the heat waves.

59
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:58,440
Some actions that any of you who are listening to this podcast can take is to learn about the plans

60
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:04,320
and efforts your local community in L.A. already has in place to help the homeless during heat waves.

61
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:13,710
So, for example, many communities set up cooling areas and expand their shelter services, and so find out how you can help with your local efforts.

62
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,480
For example, many outreach efforts are required prior to and during heat waves to help the

63
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:24,350
homeless population know what shelters and cooling areas are available to them.

64
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:31,460
So now you have a much clearer understanding of how heat waves and climate change will impact LA's homeless community.

65
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:39,140
Thanks for listening to this episode of Connect the issue because as we say here, connection, catalyze this action.

66
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:49,550
Stay tuned for episode two, where we will discuss the air pollution, climate change and the impact on LA's homeless population.

67
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,996
Thanks.
