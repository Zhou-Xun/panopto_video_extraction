1
00:00:00,980 --> 00:00:05,430
Yeah. Oh, good. Okay. Okay. So then she should be on Zoom, and then we should be good to go.

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,260
Would someone here share with you? Oh, you know what?

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,250
They match their hair.

4
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,060
So just put it on the machine.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,470
Yeah. Look at you. Your beautiful face and everything.

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:30,570
And we have our mask on here. Lauren, can you see the class or can you see us?

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,180
I know, I. Yeah.

8
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:48,870
I'm going to try to get to the end so I can do that.

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,850
Okay. So they replaced the camera last year with that? Yes. Yeah, we got it.

10
00:00:53,700 --> 00:01:01,860
Okay, so the hour follows the speaker. Great. So we will stop talking and we'll let it turn around so you can see the problems.

11
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:05,760
Okay. And we'll start. Okay. I just started, like 2 minutes or so.

12
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,940
It'll be okay. That's great. It's so good to see you.

13
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:25,000
So. So Panopto should record that after recording with us right off, I could be so recorded in Zoom, so just kind of quality stuff.

14
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,830
I hate to fool around too much with like I'm going to be okay with me recording this for.

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,290
Okay. That's how it is with another generation.

16
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,980
I'll pass around this if you guys want to take a look at the. Nothing was scrapped.

17
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:07,380
You think you might be stuck on this one?

18
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,670
I only had one house with me.

19
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:35,040
The second thing I do is maybe.

20
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:46,020
I don't know.

21
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:57,150
Yeah, I do love it.

22
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:09,420
This is the best thing for me from everything I've done.

23
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:21,360
I don't want to see my partner's subject, so I just.

24
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,070
Do, you know? Yeah.

25
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:35,920
Okay. I was actually coming in from all over this week.

26
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:40,520
So welcome, Lauren. Yeah.

27
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:49,200
So, Lauren, I introduced earlier in the in the class is coming to us to talk a little bit about the world of recipe

28
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,820
development from your career trajectory actually in terms of are you going to share your screen?

29
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:57,840
How are we going to do that? Everyone has the.

30
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:06,360
I think I think probably the best way for people to see it on the screen is for you to share your slides.

31
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:14,219
And then they should do this. And otherwise everybody has the slides in front of them.

32
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,990
Said, I posted them on the camera site.

33
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:31,800
We need to I need to enable you to do that and I'll let you introduce yourself as part of your presentation and you should be able to share now.

34
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:39,809
So I think it's really helpful for you in this class to kind of hear from people within your

35
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:46,709
kind of peer group also that have careers in this field and explore these trends to see.

36
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:51,780
Perhaps we're learning more about food science and culinary medicine specific.

37
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,530
We can take you in the future if your career as a dietitian kind of takes that trajectory.

38
00:04:57,540 --> 00:15:35,900
So. Lauren, I will let you take it away. Yes.

39
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:18,030
It's great. Laurin Sydney, quiet. And I don't know if you guys looked at the film Lauren's ResumÃ©, but you've worked at some really cool places.

40
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:23,010
So you were you were you were at the test kitchen or Cooks Illustrated, is that right?

41
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,700
So are people familiar with Cook's Illustrated?

42
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:33,419
So sometimes, like, they're the place that they're going to give you like the best meatloaf that they're going to cook at six there.

43
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:37,499
I always wonder, what do you do with all that food that you've tried? That doesn't work out perfectly,

44
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:46,170
but a lot of like classic recipes done perfectly over and over and over again until the reader or the

45
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:52,319
person who purchases that recipe or reads the blog can mimic what they've done in the test kitchen.

46
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,220
So that's so much of from a food science standpoint,

47
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:59,460
that's kind of like the quintessential food science place to go if you really want to test the recipe.

48
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,190
Yeah, absolutely. Any questions?

49
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,939
I think for anyone. Thank you. One, I think you said it. Nice segue.

50
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,469
Wait till like the last 15 minutes that we have in class and kind of ramping

51
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:37,100
up recipe development because you have to put it in a box because you're on.

52
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,620
Even when you said like the cookie,

53
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:45,560
you know that you had to like putting the coconut said coconut flat and it wasn't enough that you had to add a nut butter.

54
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:51,440
My mind starts thinking about, Oh my gosh, food allergies, you're putting in that butter, and all of a sudden you have to identify that.

55
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:59,090
I mean, one of the things that we know is like the top reason for food recalls in the United States is actually not necessarily tainted or bad.

56
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:06,080
It's because there's any allergen that hasn't been listed on it. So, I mean, again, another kind of like important thing, like if you're altering it,

57
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:13,010
what audience do you open up that recipe to that that could become problematic where you have to kind of reveal those sources,

58
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,910
especially for all of us that might be working on medical community eventually.

59
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:20,250
So. Okay.

60
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,250
Well, if there's no questions, then I will stop the recording and we'll move on.

61
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,550
Thank you so very much for popping in. Where are you living now?

62
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,820
Oh, okay. One time. One time zone over then. Okay.

63
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,770
Thanks for joining us again. Okay.

64
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:44,530
Take care. Okay.

65
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,630
Oh, right. How about that?

66
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:54,000
And. And that meeting.
