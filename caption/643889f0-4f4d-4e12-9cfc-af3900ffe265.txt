1
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:12,940
Oh. Yeah. I only met Christian for.

2
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:31,370
Okay. Elizabeth is going to be joining us a little bit later.

3
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:39,830
A couple of announcements. So the quiz number, quiz number four.

4
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:45,980
Quiz number four is going to come up on Friday. So it will drop on Friday and be due on Monday.

5
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,080
And it'll focus on vitamin D and immune function. Okay.

6
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:57,980
Today we're going to be talking about vitamin E and immune function.

7
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:01,300
And all along, I've been telling you that, you know,

8
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:07,880
if you have sufficient levels of vitamin E or I should say if you have sufficient levels of micronutrients,

9
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:13,610
vitamins, minerals, supplementing that probably won't have an effect.

10
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:22,160
Vitamin D is possibly an exception. And we'll go through today's lecture and talk about why that might be.

11
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:27,770
But I would I would caution you in saying maybe not.

12
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:36,920
There are issues with vitamin E toxicity that need to be addressed in both clinical trials and animal studies.

13
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:41,990
And I'll touch on that the next time that we talk about vitamin E.

14
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:46,880
On Thursday, we're just going to talk about vitamin D and immune function today.

15
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:50,780
So here are the learning objectives to understand.

16
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:59,960
Vitamin E function is fairly straightforward and simple to describe the prevalence and effects of vitamin D deficiency,

17
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:12,290
to explain the role of vitamin D in immune function, and to describe the impact of vitamin D supplementation on respiratory tract infections

18
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:17,720
in a clinical trial that I'm going to be discussing toward the end of today's lecture.

19
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:28,970
So like many things, Vitamin E was something that was discovered by happenstance, by dumb luck.

20
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:38,810
So the discovery was made in their early twenties in the University of California, Berkeley, by these two individuals.

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:48,139
Evans and Bishop Herbert Evans was a scientist, worked in the laboratory, and his lab assistant was Dr. Katherine Bishop.

22
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:56,390
And they're both kind of credited with the discovery of vitamin E and at this time there was a lot of

23
00:02:56,390 --> 00:03:03,590
interest in vitamins and how they are essential for growth and development and all kinds of other functions.

24
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:11,480
But Vitamin E essentially initially didn't have the name Vitamin E that Evans and Bishop called it Factor X,

25
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:19,670
and they kind of stumbled upon this discovery by doing experiments with guinea pigs.

26
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:33,680
In this case, they were looking at the importance of diet and birth, and they were feeding guinea pigs, were pregnant, a semi purified diet.

27
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:41,899
So they had inadvertently excluded vitamin D and probably other things.

28
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,780
But this is how the discovery was made.

29
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:57,560
So after feeding them the semi purified diet, they noticed that the guinea pigs that were pregnant had no living parts.

30
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,230
It can't deliver a viable liver.

31
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:13,100
And to perhaps compensate for this, they decided to, in addition to giving them the semi purified diet to give them less.

32
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:21,559
So they gave them lettuce and after feeding them lettuce or wheat germ, something that they used later on,

33
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:31,850
after they discovered that lettuce worked, they were able to restore parturition and birth in one, giving IV pups to the pregnant guinea pigs.

34
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:41,900
Now, they really had no idea why this happened, but it was something to do with the diet.

35
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:52,340
And eventually, through lots of trial and error, they started to extract things from the lettuce to figure out what was there.

36
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,860
And it was actually a lipid soluble extract that was actually done with an alcohol

37
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:03,080
extract that they described or discovered this factor X as being important.

38
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,990
So this is how vitamin D was discovered.

39
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:19,670
But at this time, early twenties, 1921, when this was first published, around that time, it was described this Factor X.

40
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:28,620
So after this time or during the same time, you have another scientist working at the University of Arkansas.

41
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:38,880
And he also observed that a deficiency in what he called Vitamin E, and again, he had no idea what this was.

42
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,690
It just was essential for birth, because when he performed similar experiments with rats,

43
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,019
they didn't have a viable litter that didn't produce sterility.

44
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:59,430
So if you excluded something in the diet known to contain this factor, you wouldn't get a live birth of pups.

45
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:10,960
So later on 1937, Evans and Bishop were able to, with the help of a lot of a lot of chemists,

46
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,050
they were able to isolate Alpha Tocopherol from an alcohol extract of lettuce.

47
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:25,180
And they actually proposed a chemical formula for Alpha Tocopherol that actually turned out to be correct.

48
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:31,420
And this is before all of the high tech tools we have now to identify chemical compounds.

49
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:42,880
And with the attention to Bennett Shaw's work in University of Arkansas, they adopted the name Vitamin E to describe this essential nutrient.

50
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:54,729
So these discoveries were made by by luck and by following up on that luck with a

51
00:06:54,730 --> 00:07:00,640
very careful approach to isolating a compound that later was found to be important.

52
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:12,320
So. So they were able to add this extract back in the absence of lattice and actually show that in the case of the guinea pigs,

53
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,340
they could give a life birth. And this was called vitamin E.

54
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:24,770
The function at this time, besides being known to cure this sterility, was was unknown.

55
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:35,960
And it wasn't until 1931 that another group of scientists were working that they first started to describe the function of vitamin E,

56
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:48,710
and remember that back in this time in the early thirties, publications came out and they came out much less frequently, and now they were in print.

57
00:07:50,150 --> 00:08:00,470
Universities may have had limited access to this published material that the number of conferences may have been limited to maybe one a year, if that.

58
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,580
So communication between the scientists was somewhat limited.

59
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,670
So Alcott Monto to work at the University of Iowa and they were looking at

60
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,500
the properties of Vitamin D and discovered that it had antioxidant capacity.

61
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,440
And so that was great serves as an antioxidant.

62
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:30,050
It's important for for a live birth. What could you possibly do with this particular vitamin?

63
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:39,620
And is it important in human nutrition and experiments or clinical trials?

64
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:46,310
I should say by one, back in 1938 established the importance of vitamin E in human nutrition.

65
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:55,460
And at this time, you had problems with failure to thrive in premature infants.

66
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,690
And one of the things that they tried, based on the success in the rodent models.

67
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:12,200
One of the things that they tried was to give these premature infants who are suffering from growth failure an extract of or the oil,

68
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:20,840
the wheat germ oil. And in this particular trial, there were 17 premature infants who had a growth failure.

69
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:31,340
And of those 17, 11 of them were able to resume normal growth rates after they were given this turmoil.

70
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:43,910
So here's a clinical application of vitamin E in premature infants, and that had problems with their group, that had the growth, their failure issues.

71
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:53,540
They were able to restore normal growth so many years later through lots of chemistry.

72
00:09:54,770 --> 00:10:05,300
The cough Tocopherol and the Taco del Taco taurine also were established as having the vitamin E activity.

73
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:13,610
What I mean by that, they have an accident antioxidant potential that is essential for human physiology.

74
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:24,200
So these are lipids. On the left hand side you have alpha of Tocopherol, beta tocopherol, gamma Tocopherol and Delta Tocopherol.

75
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:34,939
The most prevalent in the North American diet is gamma tocopherol and then the form of alpha

76
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:40,080
tocopherol with the greatest vitamin E activity or antioxidant potential of this alpha tocopherol.

77
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:47,930
So a lot of the studies that were done through the decades have focused on Alpha Tocopherol.

78
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:58,880
When the Topo Torino Torino structure and lipids were discovered to have Vitamin E activity.

79
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:08,330
There was a lot of work looking at the potential for these types of lipids to have the same antioxidant properties.

80
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,810
And when you take sources of vitamin E, you have a mixture of all of these different compounds.

81
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:25,790
Okay? And a lot of the research was done in isolating these different chemicals and testing their ability to prevent lipid peroxidation.

82
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:31,820
And there has been a lot of interest in these types of molecules.

83
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:40,610
So where do we get the term tocopherol? Well, they went back to the Greek just to make this type of vitamin,

84
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:47,180
have a cool chemical name and Spartacus and Greek means birth, giving Pharaoh means to care.

85
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:52,820
And then all of that is an alcohol. So it's an alcohol necessary to carry a pregnancy to term.

86
00:11:53,270 --> 00:12:00,080
So that's where the term tocopherol came from. So some other differences about.

87
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:08,530
After Charles and Topo Tori and Charles is the structure and the number of double bonds and the slip at side chains.

88
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:13,450
So you have three double bonds here with the top story.

89
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:22,420
And. And then here you don't have any double bonds in the sidechains of the tocopherol molecule.

90
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:34,420
That's important in terms of potential lipid peroxidation that might occur or the ability of these molecules to act as antioxidants.

91
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,270
And again, in the North American diet, you're going to find the highest concentration of this one,

92
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:43,360
gamma tocopherol in the types of foods that we eat here.

93
00:12:48,590 --> 00:13:00,470
So what does it do? As far as we know, the main function of vitamin E is that it prevents oxidation lipid peroxidation.

94
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:06,079
So all of your cells have a lipid bilayer and we talked about this,

95
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:17,690
that the importance of polyunsaturated fatty acids in our diet and in ourselves and associated with this lipid bilayer are lipid soluble things,

96
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:27,260
including the Vitamin E, and it embeds itself in this structure or in close proximity to the structure of the plasma membrane,

97
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,700
and it acts as an antioxidant by preventing lipid peroxidation.

98
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:41,540
There have been some investigations looking at vitamin E, perhaps serving as a intercellular signaling molecule.

99
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:49,430
But this is controversial, not well established, is it?

100
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:56,330
Is it potentially a regulator of gene expression? Again, this is controversial, not well-established.

101
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:08,760
So it's not clear if other proposed functions of vitamin E occur independent of its ability to prevent lipid peroxidation.

102
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:15,870
So the function of iron may primarily serves as a antioxidant within cells.

103
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:27,629
Now, immune cells produce a lot of reactive oxygen species, so immune cells have the capacity to generate.

104
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:33,750
These are active oxygen species and cause oxidation which can use up a lot

105
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:42,720
of vitamin E and if there isn't enough antioxidant capacity in immune cells,

106
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:55,420
aberrant responses may occur. So the main function of vitamin E is to protect polyunsaturated fatty acids from PEROXIDATION.

107
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:08,170
So here's a diagram of what the vitamin E function does in terms of its preventing lipid peroxidation.

108
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,180
At the top of the diagram,

109
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:20,860
you have the initiation event where you have the radical being formed here and then a propagation of the peroxidation occurring.

110
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:29,980
When vitamin E does is it donates a hydrogen ion and it prevents further lipid peroxidation from occurring.

111
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:36,640
So in your tissue phospholipids, you've got a lot of polyunsaturated fatty acids.

112
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:41,320
So the potential for lipid for oxidation is very high, especially in immune cells.

113
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:47,080
And if you have sufficient amounts of vitamin E, it prevents this from happening.

114
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:52,390
Now, vitamin D doesn't do this all by itself. You need other partners.

115
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,610
Vitamin C, which is the the water soluble antioxidant.

116
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:06,340
And then you have through 2008, PD and ADP, H plus plus.

117
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:15,760
So it's through these interactions, you can prevent lipid peroxidation within your tissue phospholipids.

118
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,630
And this is thought to be the main function of vitamin E.

119
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:35,220
So how much do you need? Well, here is the RDA for Alpha Tocopherol now.

120
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:44,070
So these recommendation intakes are limited to the two are stereo isometric forms of alpha tocopherol.

121
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:53,040
So when we talk about how much you need, you have to remember that there are different forms of vitamin E that I just mentioned.

122
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,790
And this extra strictly refers to Alpha Tocopherol.

123
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:05,040
Okay. So here you have three different ways to measure it.

124
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:13,680
Or how many how much quantity do you need per day? It's measured in milligrams per day or international units per day.

125
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,790
And these are the values that you see for males and females.

126
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:25,740
And in terms of the conversion of MG to international units.

127
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:32,370
So one milligram of a two are alpha tocopherol is equivalent to 1.5 international units.

128
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,420
And one internationally is equivalent to 0.6.

129
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,970
Seven milligrams of two are tocopherol. So that's kind of confusing.

130
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:53,430
So when you buy when you buy a vitamin D supplement in the store, it probably going to give you international units rather than milligrams.

131
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:59,670
And you can see that the amounts that you need per day are kind of low.

132
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,670
So here's an infant. And here children, as they get older, they need a little bit more.

133
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:11,100
And adolescents are quite a bit more. And adults are about the same.

134
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:17,760
And during pregnancy, during breastfeeding, you need a bit more of out your comfortable.

135
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:27,420
Okay. So and people who are pregnant about the same as what you would need in an adult and in breastfeeding.

136
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:40,850
A little bit more. The other thing that I need to mention is this line here at the bottom,

137
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:48,200
if your diet is rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, was this kind of the recommendation for fat intake?

138
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,440
About 30% of your calories are no more than 30% of your calories should come from a lipid source.

139
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,730
The recommendation is to have a higher intakes of these polyunsaturated fatty acids.

140
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,830
And with that, you're going to need something to prevent oxidation of those lipids right when they become part of your tissues.

141
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,650
And to do that, you would take in a certain amount of vitamin D to prevent that from occurring.

142
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:29,780
So you could possibly need more vitamin E if you were ingesting a high level or you're if your diet is very rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids.

143
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:39,800
Now, the thing about that is if you are consuming foods that have high levels of these pufas,

144
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:44,990
they're already going to have a fair amount of vitamin D in them if they're fresh and if they're not oxidized.

145
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:57,270
So here is a table. This is from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

146
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:01,530
It's old, but it's pretty much the same.

147
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:11,760
If you were to look at more recent versions of this table and it gives you this the sources by the me in milligrams of al tocopherol per serving.

148
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:24,540
So the best source is a wheat germ. So one tablespoon of wheat germ will give you about 20.3 milligrams of alpha tocopherol.

149
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:40,950
And if you look in the previous one, if you need how many milligrams per day, 15, you're going to get all you need from one tablespoon of wheat germ.

150
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,570
How many of you eat wheat germ? Nobody.

151
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:54,930
So this is a thing to do in the seventies if you were concerned about nutrition.

152
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:59,190
So if you go down the cereal aisle in the grocery store,

153
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:07,049
you'll find in the very top shelf somewhere maybe near the oatmeal or I can't remember exactly in a grocery store,

154
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:16,530
but you'll find jars of wheat here and you can take that germ and sprinkle it on whatever type of food that you eat.

155
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:22,199
You show on your breakfast cereal or your yogurt or whatever you're eating, whatever you find palatable.

156
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:28,110
And you can get plenty of vitamin C through that, but you can get it through many other sources as well.

157
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:35,850
So in general, in foods that are high in polyunsaturated fatty acids, you're going to find a fair amount of vitamin E.

158
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:45,600
So the next richest source is nuts and seeds, almonds, safflower, sunflower and sapphire flower oil,

159
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:54,840
other kinds of nuts, hazelnuts, peanuts, corn, spinach, broccoli, soybeans, kiwi, mango.

160
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,000
And the lowest would be here, spinach.

161
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:06,660
And as I mentioned before, you want to take in about 0.4 milligrams of alpha tocopherol for every gram of polyunsaturated in your diet,

162
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,380
and you would need to take into account the degree of on saturation.

163
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:22,200
So if you're consuming a diet that's really high in unsaturated fatty acids and omega three fatty acid,

164
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:26,320
it might be a good idea to consume a little bit more. Okay.

165
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:41,770
So this is a diagram that summarizes absorption, absorption and distribution.

166
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:51,460
So you just foods containing lipids and vitamin E to get into your body that could pass through your stomach.

167
00:22:52,300 --> 00:23:01,290
They pass through your duodenum and be mixed with the bile and the lipids within your meal become emulsified.

168
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:10,330
And in response to this lipid rich meal, you have a secretion of pancreatic enzymes,

169
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:20,259
and then you have vitamin E being taken up and through the intestine and then being

170
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:27,160
incorporated into column microns and then it being distributed throughout the host.

171
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:38,730
And the vitamin E can be can associate with fatty acids and be delivered to tissues after the lipids are liberated by lipoprotein lipids.

172
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,010
And you still have some vitamin E circulating around that vitamin,

173
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:51,430
you can go to the liver and then you can have transport of vitamin E through the high density lipoproteins,

174
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:56,230
and it can circulate in other lipoproteins as well.

175
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:03,610
So it's a lipid soluble vitamins it's going to associate with lipids and lipid carrying molecules throughout the host.

176
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:18,870
So what would happen if you had a problem with lipid transport or you had a deficiency in one of these molecules essential

177
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:27,390
for lipid uptake or cholesterol uptake or whatever the case would be in terms of an ingested or circulating lipid,

178
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:36,170
what would that do to your Vitamin E status? Yeah.

179
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:47,910
You might develop a deficiency as a consequence. So getting to the next one, vitamin E deficiencies are very rare.

180
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:52,280
Less than 1% of well-nourished individuals have a deficiency.

181
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:58,610
Okay. So if you go into the CDC website and you look for prevalence of vitamin D deficiency,

182
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,080
you're going to have a hard time finding very much information because it's fairly rare.

183
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:15,160
So even people who are poorly nourished because of the concentration of vitamin D in oils in our diet,

184
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:18,050
North American diet, you're going to find a fair amount of vitamin E.

185
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:30,650
So it wasn't until 1983 that it was observed and a human and adult human of vitamin D deficiency.

186
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:39,200
And it was what I had mentioned earlier. And then somebody who had this congenital a better lipoprotein, AMIA.

187
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:45,320
And this is a condition in which they can't make better lipoproteins.

188
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:54,050
And as a consequence, their ability to carry lipids throughout their blood and to deliver vitamin E to the tissues was impaired.

189
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:57,980
So this impaired fat, fat soluble vitamin absorption.

190
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:09,530
And another place where you might find vitamin E deficiencies in individuals who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.

191
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:17,210
And exactly how what the mechanism related to HIV and vitamin deficiency, I'm not certain.

192
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,940
So vitamin E deficiencies are very rare.

193
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:37,190
But but the use of vitamin E supplementation perhaps has a place in disease prevention, as we'll discuss here in a little bit.

194
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:45,700
Okay. So the paper that I gave you is very simple in terms of vitamin D and immune function.

195
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:58,450
With the classical vitamins, you'll find a review paper maybe every 5 to 10 years, even on their function in the immune system.

196
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:02,260
So finally, good review papers.

197
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:09,910
This is is difficult to find and it's difficult to find them at in higher tier journals.

198
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:26,110
So the the review paper discusses how immune cells have lots of these and saturated fatty acids and they generate a lot of reactive oxygen species,

199
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:32,200
particularly the granule sites, neutrophils your sniffles base, it fills macrophages,

200
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:38,320
monocytes, the mononuclear cells and even the lymphocytes T cells and B cells.

201
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,900
So they generate a lot of reactive oxygen species.

202
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:51,099
And to combat the negative consequences of these reactive oxygen species,

203
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:56,980
you need to have within the tissue phospholipids something that can prevent oxidation.

204
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:08,560
So the reactive oxygen species themselves, without anything else, are able to produce inflammation.

205
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:19,030
So how might this occur? Well, you have the ability to generate reactive oxygen species through the mitochondria,

206
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:27,730
and you also have the ability to produce reactive oxygen species through the activation of what's known as an ATP oxidase.

207
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:32,950
So both of these sources can produce an awful lot of reactive oxygen species.

208
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:48,290
As you age you're you have an increased potential our ability to produce um,

209
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:52,880
reactive oxygen species not only in immune cells but all over all of your body.

210
00:28:53,870 --> 00:29:04,340
So perhaps you need to compensate this by taking in more fluids that have antioxidants and perhaps vitamin E.

211
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:15,799
There have been a number of studies done by the Madani lab at Tufts University.

212
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:21,740
That's they they also have a USDA research center there and Celine Madani.

213
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:31,190
Her work has focused on vitamin E supplementation in some other micronutrients in their role in the host defense against infectious disease.

214
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,870
And we'll talk about one of her papers here.

215
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:46,940
So through that work, we've learned that with greater oxygen, reactive oxygen species in immune cells, if you supplement humans,

216
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:58,160
cell culture and animals that are older with vitamin E, you can restore T cell cytokine secretion and cellular proliferation.

217
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:03,380
So the cytokine that's been used as a marker for this is interleukin two.

218
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:19,010
So the other thing that happens with reactive oxygen species is that if it's generated intracellular lead,

219
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:28,410
it can activate the production of cytokines, pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF, I one, beta and some others.

220
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:40,260
And this is done through the action of this transcription factor, nuclear factor Kappa B and I'll show you a diagram of that here in a minute.

221
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:48,060
So to prevent this from occurring, these inflammatory reactions from occurring,

222
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:57,090
vitamin E can can preserve the cellular function and prevent an aberrant inflammatory response,

223
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:02,670
particularly in people who have received a fair amount of vitamin E as a supplement.

224
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:20,950
The other thing that vitamin E supplementation has been shown to do in both humans and animal models is that it can suppress prostaglandin synthesis.

225
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:39,460
So Cyclooxygenase is an enzyme that catalyzes the the reaction of arachidonic acid in the formation of prostaglandins.

226
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:50,920
And if you have sufficient amounts of vitamin E and other antioxidants present within the cell, you can kind of prevent that from occurring.

227
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:55,540
In the absence of that, if you have a fair amount of oxidation occurring,

228
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:01,990
the prostaglandin levels can increase and this can have some negative consequences,

229
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:06,670
especially in regard to susceptibility to respiratory tract infections.

230
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:19,660
So here's a diagram that kind of summarizes what I've told you about what vitamin E does.

231
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:28,920
So at the very top of the diagram, you have the description Vitamin E forms, and there's 13.

232
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,470
It's a we see if I can pronounce this correctly down here.

233
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:45,770
So this is a the 13 o h is a carbon C, they put it here.

234
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:51,070
Now I did put in the diagram. So it's a car boxy chromosome criminal.

235
00:32:54,440 --> 00:33:03,919
13 Carp oxy criminal inhibit multiple proinflammatory pathways and carboxylic 13 carboxylic criminal is actually

236
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:11,960
a metabolite of vitamin E and you can actually measure this metabolite in the blood of humans and animals,

237
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:17,180
and it's thought to have some antioxidant capacity.

238
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:24,350
So this is a diagram showing you a cell membrane here and here.

239
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:31,759
You have things that can activate the cell cytokines on the outside of the cell or

240
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:39,680
in the case of an infection and a toxin associated with the gram negative bacteria.

241
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:47,710
And then you have over here extracellular calcium and other types of stimuli.

242
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:48,500
Ionophores four.

243
00:33:48,500 --> 00:34:02,720
And that's one piece when P is a is a this is a surplus, the lipid molecule that can activate the cell, particularly innate immune cells.

244
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:12,200
So these stimuli can activate, um, cytokine synthesis through this nf kappa B pathway.

245
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,800
So nf Kappa B is a transcription factor that sits in the cytoplasm.

246
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:27,440
And it's actually, it's linked to this nightcap of the complex stuff that's sitting there and dead,

247
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:39,290
preventing it from entering the nucleus from binding to the genes that would upregulate cytokine synthesis.

248
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:54,610
So when this receptor becomes activated and you can have actually anti you can have reactive oxygen species activate this cascade as well.

249
00:34:56,080 --> 00:35:00,790
You get an increase in the pro-inflammatory cytokines.

250
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:07,959
You also get the activation of these other latent transcription factors.

251
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:16,890
Step three It's that six. And by enriching your tissues with in this case its gamma tocopherol,

252
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:25,320
you can reduce the potential for the cells that are sitting at risk from producing pro-inflammatory cytokines.

253
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:37,980
IL six granulocyte colony stimulating factor in the attacks and three So these are cytokines that are associated with inflammation.

254
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,420
On the other side of the diagram here,

255
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:55,470
you have various stimuli that can occur in in vivo or in cell culture model system where you're trying to activate an inflammatory response.

256
00:35:55,470 --> 00:36:05,040
And in this case it's ion for like a calcium, something that will cause a calcium increase inside a cell or a molecule.

257
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:10,590
And that's one p they're going to do the same in influx of intracellular calcium.

258
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:21,890
This cascade, this increase in intracellular calcium activates this that kinase molecule junk or junk,

259
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:37,400
and this can result in the activation of cascades that liberate or activate these enzymes that metabolize arachidonic acid.

260
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:47,210
We talked a little bit about this already. Yeah fibroblasts adjacent soft to cyclooxygenase that form luker trained before and prostaglandin e two.

261
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:58,160
Having these two controls here and tissues are rich with vitamin E, you can block this process.

262
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:06,290
So these are reactions that occur that can be stopped in the presence of the antioxidants.

263
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:15,320
Now, this 13 c0h this is the metabolite of vitamin E that I told you about just recently.

264
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:27,200
And it can more potently, actually, than the parent forms block the activity of these enzymes forming these pro-inflammatory methods.

265
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,620
So this is in general the way which vitamin E is thought to be anti-inflammatory.

266
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:46,190
It's blocking cytokine synthesis by preventing this NF cat to be going into the nucleus and up

267
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:52,580
regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and it's broth blocking pro-inflammatory mediator synthesis.

268
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:11,130
Okay. So this is a very simple diagram that describes the effects of tocopherol on different immune cells.

269
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:14,310
And over on the left, you see the macrophages shown in green.

270
00:38:15,690 --> 00:38:25,170
So macrophages have this high capacity to produce cyclooxygenase products like prostaglandin e two.

271
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:34,230
And as you get older, you have an increase in PGE two levels.

272
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,620
And you can suppress this by taking in lots of antioxidants in the form of vitamin E,

273
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:46,110
you can suppress the levels of prostaglandin E2 that can be produced.

274
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:57,300
If you take an aspirin or a non inflammatory non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, kind of do the same thing.

275
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:10,970
You prevent prostaglandin synthesis. So by enriching tissues without tocopherol through your diet or through a supplement, you block these pathways.

276
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:17,090
You also block nitric oxide, which is also an accident.

277
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:25,310
That's pretty soon macrophages. Then you have the dendritic cell, the alpha tocopherol upregulates.

278
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:38,510
We don't come close to any. Call it FGF 23. And this is thought to downregulate the activity of the dendritic cells.

279
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:47,720
So they downregulate their expression of adhesion molecules.

280
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:53,270
It downregulated their expression of interleukin 12 and it reduces their migration.

281
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:58,430
So the dendritic cells perhaps become less active.

282
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:05,910
In terms of the lymphocytes over here, the T cells, B cells and K cells.

283
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,290
So what does Alpha Tocopherol do here?

284
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,420
Well, it seems to promote the proliferation of T cells.

285
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:25,500
It enhances the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cells through the synapse formation with the T cell receptor.

286
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:32,819
And the image C class molecules. And what this does, it enhances their ability to produce IL two,

287
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:41,470
which is a proliferation signal for the T cell, and then it reduces activation induced cell death.

288
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:47,010
So you have more T cells around if you have sufficient amounts of alpha tocopherol.

289
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:57,760
Studies done with the B-cell response, either through infection with the viral agent or vaccination.

290
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,060
The antibody response is improved with exhaustion,

291
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:11,650
alpha tocopherol and then finally shown all the way here in the orange cell is the natural killer cells.

292
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:19,390
So natural killer cells are important in anti-tumor activity and in host events against viral infections.

293
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:28,840
Okay, so alpha tocopherol increases the activity of these cells and if you have low vitamin E status,

294
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:34,990
which might occur if you're if you're age or elderly, this might reduce their activity.

295
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:42,900
Okay. Okay.

296
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:55,470
Now let's get to the paper. So. A lot of the work that I just showed you was done in either animal models or in cell culture,

297
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,650
where you take an animal and you get it cells macrophages,

298
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:10,020
or you recover the lymphocytes from the animal and you study them in culture and you isolate the cells

299
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:16,589
and you culture them with different levels of vitamin E and you challenge them with different stimuli.

300
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:28,860
And you see these responses that I just described. So as I mentioned earlier, vitamin D deficiency is really is very rare.

301
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:36,690
And so to demonstrate its potential importance in humans,

302
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:44,910
there have been a number of studies again done by Charmaine Madani at Tufts University looking at

303
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:51,780
the potential for vitamin E supplementation to preserve immune function in the elderly population.

304
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:58,170
So the elderly population is a real susceptible to respiratory tract infections for a number of reasons.

305
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:04,320
When I say respiratory tract infections, I'm talking about the upper respiratory tract,

306
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:10,140
the lower respiratory tract and in terms of bacterial and viral infections.

307
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:18,390
Okay. So we're talking about things in which the entire immune cell population plays a critical role.

308
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,390
Okay. So they're very prevalent in this population.

309
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:30,600
Respiratory tract infections increases, morbidity, mortality and the use of health services.

310
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:43,050
And prior to this study in animal models and in some human trials, Vitamin E was demonstrated to improve immune the immune response.

311
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:51,090
So the clinical importance of these findings hadn't been determined at this particular time.

312
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:58,920
So this is an older paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2004.

313
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:07,260
But it's a classic paper demonstrating the potential use of vitamin D supplementation in the elderly population.

314
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:12,330
So here's the the lead author, Simeon Madani.

315
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:19,710
And here you have vitamin E in respiratory tract infections and elderly nursing home residents.

316
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:24,450
So in this particular study,

317
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:31,979
they wanted to determine the effect of a one year trial with supplemental vitamin

318
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:38,130
E on respiratory tract infections and people who are living in a nursing home.

319
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:44,790
Okay. So this is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial.

320
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,050
And it was conducted over a period of about three years.

321
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:55,980
And they had 33 long term care facilities in Boston where they did these studies.

322
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,600
They had over 600 people participating.

323
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:06,510
And in order to be enrolled in the study, you had to be 65 years of age or older.

324
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:16,110
And 73% of the people in the trial completed the study.

325
00:45:17,190 --> 00:45:21,390
So about 450 to 451 people completed the study.

326
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:29,790
So this is how they went about recruiting their their subjects.

327
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:37,470
So they had these three different centers. They identified a large population over 2600.

328
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:46,260
And then they decided that 1940 didn't satisfy the inclusion criteria.

329
00:45:48,510 --> 00:45:54,090
So they left them a little over that, left them almost 900 eligible participants.

330
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:59,670
And then another group, 257, weren't enrolled for a number of reasons.

331
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:04,530
And then they were left with this number, 617,

332
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:13,320
and they randomize these individuals into two different groups, the vitamin E supplement or the placebo.

333
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:24,990
And in both cases, they gave them a multi vitamin K and one had 200 international units of vitamin E and the other did not.

334
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:31,050
So why do you think they did this? Both gave both the multivitamin.

335
00:46:36,450 --> 00:46:40,500
Yeah. We want to make you very deficient in other vitamins.

336
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:49,860
Yes, exactly. And it's kind of if you're going to give something, somebody something and tell them that it's beneficial, it better be beneficial.

337
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:56,709
It's kind of like the standard of care. You know, it's like, okay, if we're going to give somebody an incentive to participate in this trial,

338
00:46:56,710 --> 00:47:00,120
if you give them something and you leave just one thing out.

339
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:12,030
All right. So remember that the RBA now for vitamin E in this group is 22.5 international units.

340
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,100
So they're giving him almost ten times the amount that they need.

341
00:47:17,370 --> 00:47:19,410
Okay. All right.

342
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:34,960
So over the three year period, they are collecting information and they have a number of people drop out for a number of different reasons,

343
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:40,120
and they have about the same number of people in each group who completed this study,

344
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:47,410
and then they have collected data from the primary analysis and then completers analysis.

345
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:53,750
Why do you think they did both of those instead of just the completers analysis?

346
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:09,340
So you do in a clinical trial, you have lots of people and you have some people drop out, but you have some data on them.

347
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:21,100
Right. And it's important to know why they dropped out, what's listed here and if there were any effects, even though they didn't complete the trial.

348
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:26,890
So the initial analysis included everybody as much data as they had on them.

349
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:33,160
And in this case, making that including that data was simple.

350
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:39,220
Did you have a respiratory tract infection or did you not? And what kind of respiratory tract infection was it?

351
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:48,430
So it was it was a way to include everybody to determine whether or not perhaps there could have been some unanticipated

352
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:54,460
event associated with the supplementation that you weren't accounting for if you're just looking at the completers.

353
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:06,660
Okay. So what do you want? Here's the baseline characteristics showing you the randomize all randomize individuals and then completers.

354
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:15,630
When you see this type of table, what do you hope to see you do at the epidemiology work?

355
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,580
What do you hope to see when you when you randomize your subjects into different groups?

356
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:30,569
So you expect to see similar characteristics among the treated group and that the placebo group at the beginning of the study.

357
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:35,580
Yeah, because you don't want your randomization to bias your results so that's really important.

358
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:44,760
So they needed a big population to do this right and they looked at a lot of different things.

359
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:52,050
Okay, so they're in a nursing home, 33 nursing homes and here is the age spans 65 to 102.

360
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:57,000
The average age of the participant was about 85.

361
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:03,510
And you had mostly women.

362
00:50:03,990 --> 00:50:13,550
Okay. Why mostly women? There are more friends I know for this stuff.

363
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,260
Um. Yeah, but go ahead. It was better.

364
00:50:17,270 --> 00:50:21,620
Also more likely to actually be in nursing. Yes. And live long enough.

365
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:28,450
Right. Because men have shorter lifespans than women do in general.

366
00:50:28,460 --> 00:50:37,280
And yes, they're more likely to be nursing homes. The demographics in terms of race, most of them were white.

367
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,320
Why do you think that was? 95 and 95%?

368
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:55,220
Boston is a fairly diverse ethnic and racial population, but in this sample, 95% of the subjects were white.

369
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:03,500
Nursing homes are expensive. You need to have really good insurance.

370
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:10,180
Medicaid, Medicare and Medicare Part B, I don't work in a clinic.

371
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:21,020
So there are some really important details there about what Medicare, what nursing homes will take you if you have certain Medicare packages.

372
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:31,280
And so that's an essential have if if you're going to be in a nursing home and if you're paying out of pocket, you can supplement that.

373
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:36,020
But do you know how much it costs to live in a nursing home for about a year?

374
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:40,730
Especially in the Boston area? Isn't it more expensive than like a college tuition?

375
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:46,010
Yes. Yeah. No, it's worse. Yes, it's a lot more.

376
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,540
It's well over $100,000 a year. Okay.

377
00:51:51,590 --> 00:51:58,190
So the cost of being in one of these nursing homes is is ridiculously high.

378
00:51:59,660 --> 00:52:04,730
So how many of you have visited a nursing home and know what it's like?

379
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:10,409
You have Abby and a lot of very good. What was your experience at a nursing home?

380
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:15,110
What was it something that you could look forward to living in when you when you are much older?

381
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:19,940
No, no. I mean, like some of them are nicer than others.

382
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:24,130
Yeah. But in general, it's like a very sterile environment.

383
00:52:25,660 --> 00:52:37,510
Not a lot going on. You know, I visited two places that my grandparents have gone to, and the first one was very like it was like a progressive place.

384
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:42,820
It started, yeah, hospice. And the first one was in Ohio.

385
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:48,910
And like, this number was not great and, you know, really dark and kind of sad.

386
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:55,520
Yeah, I wasn't there. And now she's in Colorado, so, like, they're state agencies, but it is really like, great.

387
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:59,380
They have a lot of activity on the state. That's right.

388
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:04,720
So. So having 33 different centers is probably a really good,

389
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,730
good way to do this study because there's probably a mixture of really good places and not so good places.

390
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:20,680
Okay. So believe it or not, there are people that are still smoking at the average age of 85 and they're still alive.

391
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:28,390
So that's what that's showing you here. And then they have a little sample sample here, this cross here,

392
00:53:28,540 --> 00:53:35,590
which indicates that the P value is less than point one compared to placebo for these groups.

393
00:53:36,610 --> 00:53:41,620
Um, and then you have medical history and you have lots of issues here.

394
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:46,659
You have people with coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure,

395
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:52,719
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, um, malignancy, dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

396
00:53:52,720 --> 00:54:00,700
And um, there are some differences noted between placebo and vitamin E group here.

397
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:06,310
So that's noted here with the different symbols.

398
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,560
And then they also include some information about their medication.

399
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:21,980
So the percentage of people on non inflammatory non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs about, you know,

400
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:30,610
33 to 40% and then they include some information about, um, a measure of systemic inflammation.

401
00:54:30,610 --> 00:54:35,350
And this is c reactive protein here, and these values are fairly high for this.

402
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:44,650
Okay. Um, typically C-reactive protein levels are really low and um, they're, they're,

403
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:51,339
they're finding not a whole lot of people have measurable levels of C-reactive protein,

404
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:59,170
but you know, a fair amount, um, and then total number of medications and that's listed in the bottom.

405
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:05,889
So this is a heavily medicated group to treat all kinds of conditions.

406
00:55:05,890 --> 00:55:14,210
Okay. So this is the nutritional status of these individuals.

407
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:23,089
So you have here in this particular column deficient percent and then they have vitamin

408
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:28,070
E and placebo and it gives you all the different things in which you find deficiency.

409
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:33,740
So here there's the measured deficiency that they use here.

410
00:55:34,730 --> 00:55:41,960
And the very first thing that they show you is this seems to have the greater prevalence is albumin before and after.

411
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:51,230
So there's a change in albumin levels and increases with the vitamin treatment or the after placebo.

412
00:55:53,000 --> 00:56:00,230
Why would that happen? Why would you have albumin being the the most common difference here?

413
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:02,720
What does that say about liver function, perhaps?

414
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:16,430
Those of you in L.A. that were in the functions lower, and then they've had to make some of it, but because of the the placebo to go.

415
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:21,530
So let's see. This is significant. Yes, and it's significant.

416
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:26,270
Okay. So significant difference from the placebo group at the same time point.

417
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:33,200
And then this symbol, the double cross, significantly different from the before for the same group.

418
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:48,250
So the other things that you would find that you would expect to find would be iron deficiency and perhaps you would see lower levels of hemoglobin.

419
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:56,649
Or would it be indicative of iron deficiency in here in terms of not much of a change before and after,

420
00:56:56,650 --> 00:57:03,760
but you know, 33, 31 to 43 people have this kind of low hemoglobin status.

421
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:14,590
And then the carotenoids and the other some of these other vitamins, very low number of deficiency, B12, folate, nobody ferritin, nobody.

422
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:21,070
Zinc, zinc, the fair amount of people.

423
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:27,580
Zinc deficiencies are more common than anything else that appears in this graph.

424
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:36,490
And then some copper. So I can't remember if banana spirit has looked at zinc deficiency, but I'm pretty sure they might have.

425
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:48,280
So the other thing I wanted to point out is the level of vitamin D deficiency that they're indicating here, 15 nanograms per meal.

426
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:54,540
That was their threshold here. And I think we talked about that being a little bit higher in some of the other studies we've looked at.

427
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:59,860
I can't remember offhand exactly what the exact number was, but this was their threshold here.

428
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:11,160
So whenever you look at studies that show your tables with deficiencies, look for the cutoff would cut off value did they use all right.

429
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:20,170
So table three. This is respiratory tract infections among all participants enrolled in the study.

430
00:58:20,770 --> 00:58:24,700
So this includes everybody who started and who may have dropped out.

431
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:30,190
And again, to collect this data, they're just looking at respiratory tract infections.

432
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:37,370
So the very first tops the incidence of infection and all respiratory tract infections.

433
00:58:38,030 --> 00:58:45,460
And in terms of the number. So there were 365 in the Vitamin E group.

434
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:50,440
And this is 394 in the placebo group.

435
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:54,660
And this is infections per person per year in the following column here.

436
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:04,000
Here. And there's no difference here in terms of the p value when they looked at lower respiratory tract infections.

437
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:09,010
Okay. And the cross would include bronchial bronchitis and pneumonia.

438
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:18,790
They're finding no difference. 144 and or 45 in each group, about 4.5 per year.

439
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:28,180
And then here, the next row, they're looking at upper respiratory tract infections.

440
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:35,230
There's a fair bit more to 2250, almost about a one infection per year per person.

441
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:40,300
P value is still not significant. And then they look at colds.

442
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:44,620
And the P value starts to get close to significance.

443
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:55,830
Okay. So there seems to be a difference here in the placebo and the vitamin B group in terms of the colds that they got in the year.

444
00:59:56,850 --> 01:00:05,250
So that's interesting. Then they looked at prescriptions, antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory tract infections, and that wasn't different.

445
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:16,260
And to kind of tease out what was going on here, they looked at participants with one or more of the different infections,

446
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:21,360
and they found that the biggest differences weren't statistically significant.

447
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:29,780
They're all in respiratory tract infections here in terms of when you consider one patients with one or more, we start to see a difference.

448
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:35,340
Now, when we look at what type of respiratory tract infection,

449
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:41,490
we see upper respiratory tract infection or colds, we see some statistically significant differences.

450
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:51,380
Okay. And then they looked at things like the number of days per person, per year, different with the different breakdowns.

451
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:54,150
And here there's no statistical difference. Okay.

452
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:03,350
So it's the upper respiratory tract infections in people who have had one or more infections per year that we see a difference.

453
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:12,970
Now, that was everybody. When we look at the completers, we see a similar story.

454
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:18,049
But this difference between the upper respiratory tract infection and colds and the

455
01:01:18,050 --> 01:01:24,080
placebo versus the Vitamin E group becomes more interesting and more significant.

456
01:01:24,450 --> 01:01:28,950
Okay. Here's just in the top half of the table.

457
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:33,650
That's the same as the previous one, but it's just including the placebo.

458
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:39,800
Now you have values that are close for upper respiratory tract infections and colds.

459
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:45,110
And then when you break this down into participants with one or more infections per year,

460
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:51,620
then you start to see the same type of difference, except there's a greater difference between the groups.

461
01:01:51,980 --> 01:02:01,790
Okay. So it's the upper respiratory tract infection that seems to be different where the vitamin E supplementation seems to provide some protection.

462
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:12,340
And then differences in the number of days with infection still no statistically significant difference.

463
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:24,160
So. Let's go back here and let's look at vitamin E now.

464
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:32,770
So how many people had a deficiency in Vitamin E before and after supplementation?

465
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:45,870
It's only 3% start out and none in either group were deficient afterwards.

466
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:55,300
Yeah. Okay. So.

467
01:02:57,230 --> 01:02:59,960
What's going on here? We restored. We have.

468
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:11,690
We have addressed a group of people who don't have a deficiency with a super physiologic level of vitamin E and we're seeing an effect.

469
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:24,710
So this is one of the exceptions to the rule of, you know, supplemental micronutrients are only beneficial when you have a deficiency.

470
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:36,559
Well, this group, I mean, Madani has looked at vitamin E in humans and mice, and she's been able to show these differences and these types of studies.

471
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,950
So perhaps this is just one study now. There are others.

472
01:03:41,210 --> 01:03:51,410
Perhaps there's something here that supplemental vitamin E now can be protective against upper respiratory tract infections and colds in this group.

473
01:03:53,300 --> 01:04:00,490
Okay. So remember we were talking about the common cold and influenza earlier.

474
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:09,830
What are some issues with that in terms of using that as a biomarker for disease?

475
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,490
Go ahead, woman. I feel, like, closer. Like, really nonspecific.

476
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:33,710
Or something? Yeah. How do you confirm that? Does the common cold occur because of infection with one particular virus?

477
01:04:35,240 --> 01:04:38,870
Do you always know that the cold symptoms are due to a virus?

478
01:04:39,470 --> 01:04:49,700
No. You just have symptoms. Is it possible that you could get a cold like symptom in response to something that's not an infectious disease?

479
01:04:50,390 --> 01:05:04,670
Yeah. So that makes it difficult to categorize in terms of if you were to actually measure a PCR, perhaps for a particular virus,

480
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:10,309
you'd find all kinds of different things, some of which might, may or may not be responsible for these symptoms.

481
01:05:10,310 --> 01:05:17,320
So doing these types of studies and using these outcomes can add some ambiguity to your results.

482
01:05:17,360 --> 01:05:25,760
That's the point of what I've just mentioned. Okay. So you might see studies that have looked at the same type of a population that show no effect.

483
01:05:26,570 --> 01:05:30,870
And perhaps the difference lies in all of the things we've talked about so far.

484
01:05:31,490 --> 01:05:42,380
The subjects where they're living, whether or not it's a randomized, controlled trial, their age, what your endpoints are, and so on.

485
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:50,930
So these are issues that are really difficult to control when you're doing nutrition research.

486
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:55,610
You need to do the best you can to control your conditions.

487
01:05:55,610 --> 01:06:01,610
But when you're working with a free living population, this is what you've got to deal with.

488
01:06:02,150 --> 01:06:09,740
Okay. And this data set is fairly clean in terms of its controls, the endpoints that they measure.

489
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:17,990
This is not the case with a lot of effort study where you have issues with controlling lots of different things.

490
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,920
So. Okay.

491
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:25,440
So in terms of the conclusions of this paper,

492
01:06:27,360 --> 01:06:33,420
there was no effect of vitamin E supplementation on the incidence or duration of the respiratory tract infections.

493
01:06:34,590 --> 01:06:42,960
However, significantly fewer vitamin E participants required one or more acquired one or more respiratory tract infections,

494
01:06:43,350 --> 01:06:46,920
most evident in the upper respiratory tract infections.

495
01:06:48,690 --> 01:06:53,999
So they did a post hoc group analysis that was at the bottom of the table among individuals.

496
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:03,330
Completing the study revealed a significantly lower incidence of common cold and fewer participants acquiring a cold in the study.

497
01:07:04,230 --> 01:07:15,510
And what I think this should have said is cold symptoms, you know, not common cold, because they confirm that they didn't take a nasal swab and said,

498
01:07:15,510 --> 01:07:22,950
yeah, you've got you've got this particular infection or that's due to this virus and so on.

499
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:31,320
Okay. So that's that's the end of what I'm going to talk about in terms of the background of vitamin

500
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:38,940
E and how Vitamin E supplementation was used in a human clinical trial showing some benefit.

501
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:43,900
But this was a very well, well done and controlled study.

502
01:07:43,920 --> 01:07:46,950
It's classic. That's why I'm showing it to you, even though it's old.

503
01:07:49,110 --> 01:07:55,560
How does this compare to other data sets that you might have when you're looking at nutrition outcomes?

504
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,000
So generally,

505
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:08,820
what is your experience with data sets when you're trying to assess the nutrient of interest and potential lack thereof in health outcomes?

506
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:13,650
Is your your data clean enough to answer important questions in your head?

507
01:08:13,650 --> 01:08:16,830
No, no, almost never.

508
01:08:16,830 --> 01:08:21,120
There's always a lot of issues with the data.

509
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:25,170
And then even after you analyze, you have potential outliers.

510
01:08:25,500 --> 01:08:29,160
Maybe you haven't even accounted for. Yeah.

511
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:32,340
So it's it's like a back and forth process. Yeah.

512
01:08:32,640 --> 01:08:41,520
So how do you make decisions about what data you're going to use in terms of you get a big data set, you get 10,000 people if you're lucky, right?

513
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:45,050
Yeah. How do you decide what you're going to throw out?

514
01:08:45,090 --> 01:08:52,380
You talked about outliers. What what criteria do you use when you decide who you're going to keep when you have all of the data?

515
01:08:52,590 --> 01:08:58,499
I mean, this is a controlled trial. Yeah. So they had original group and they threw out some based on certain criteria.

516
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,820
But if you're working with a cross-sectional data set, what kind of decisions do you make?

517
01:09:03,030 --> 01:09:13,590
So I think first I would have to think of the research question to see which participants, I mean, excluding or excluding.

518
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:23,220
And then after that, maybe just think of the the role, how reliable the data is.

519
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:32,069
Right now I'm working with in Haines, and sometimes I see that it says only two thirds of the data is reliable.

520
01:09:32,070 --> 01:09:36,960
So you will have to exclude part of the participants so that it's biased already.

521
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:40,840
And then here comes the outliers and all. Yeah.

522
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,820
So that's that's difficult to control for. Yeah.

523
01:09:45,330 --> 01:09:57,659
So whenever you see a trial like this, think about that issues that you're going to face in terms of how you include who,

524
01:09:57,660 --> 01:10:03,840
how they make decisions, who to include what the endpoints were and the conclusions that they reached in their paper.

525
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:09,180
Okay. Yeah. So they have some issue with their analysis only,

526
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:18,300
including the participants who completed the study because that is almost like ignoring the randomization.

527
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:21,990
Yeah. That is how we started with. Yeah.

528
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:28,260
So this is yeah. The people who didn't complete the study, a fair amount of them died.

529
01:10:28,350 --> 01:10:35,340
Yeah. And some of them discontinued because their physician told them that they needed to discontinue this.

530
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:45,299
Why do you think that would happen? Why do you think they would do that? Physician said No more, no more gummy bears, vitamin D, gummy bears for you.

531
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,360
You know, you're going you're not going to be continue this trial.

532
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:55,030
Maybe it had negative implications on other aspects of their health.

533
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:59,470
Yeah. So I'll mention this in the next lecture.

534
01:10:59,740 --> 01:11:05,080
There are some studies looking at high levels of vitamin E and how it's associated with a negative health outcome.

535
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:08,350
And some of their physicians know this,

536
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:13,930
and they may have removed the patients because they may have been at higher risk for some of those negative outcomes.

537
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:25,480
So with true consent, 15 of them have okay then one maybe didn't want to have access to the data transferred out of the facility,

538
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:28,870
small number and then started long term antibiotics.

539
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:37,540
Another reason. So with 300 participants and you're getting rid of let's see what percentage of this.

540
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:49,030
20%. So what's 80, 80 divided by 31?

541
01:11:51,780 --> 01:12:00,180
300. Okay. You guys figure this out before I can get my phone open, trying to figure out what percentage dropped out.

542
01:12:01,890 --> 01:12:11,340
So for the vitamin E group, you have 8311 and you get 25%.

543
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:16,890
26% have dropped out based on this criteria here.

544
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:24,700
It was 28% dropped out. Okay.

545
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:34,210
So that's why it was important to have the non completed data to address that issue with a high dropout rate.

546
01:12:34,910 --> 01:12:38,700
Jane. All right? Yeah.

547
01:12:39,450 --> 01:12:47,490
All right. Any questions? So read the paper and the questions for Thursday, and I will see you then.
