1
00:00:01,473 --> 00:00:04,533
All right, folks, let's go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:09,333
Good morning. Good morning.

3
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:18,693
Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I hope that everyone has had a great weekend.

4
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:21,933
You must have because you're still wrapping up your conversation. There we go.

5
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:26,903
Okay. Okay. Great to see everyone.

6
00:00:26,913 --> 00:00:34,453
Welcome back. We are here for the official start of the content part of the course.

7
00:00:34,863 --> 00:00:39,803
So got a lot going on today. And we'll see how far we get.

8
00:00:40,593 --> 00:00:48,063
The broad idea for the next two class periods is to introduce some of the key definitions for the course,

9
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,692
to introduce some of the key concepts that we're going to be talking about

10
00:00:51,693 --> 00:00:57,723
this semester and also thinking about models of social determinants of health.

11
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:06,783
Okay. And I spend a lot of time in depth on Wednesday, really looking at models over the last 20 or 30 years, social determinants of health.

12
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:10,713
So that's our goal for the next two class periods.

13
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:19,083
I'm going to start out with a little bit of housekeeping and see if you have any questions from the material you've read since we last met.

14
00:01:20,013 --> 00:01:29,163
I'll share some learning objectives. I'm going to introduce something called In the News, which will be using throughout the semester.

15
00:01:29,553 --> 00:01:32,973
This is an opportunity to think about what's going on in current events.

16
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,293
So we'll talk about in the news and have an activity around that.

17
00:01:37,713 --> 00:01:41,342
And then we'll get into thinking about some of the basic definitions around

18
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:45,753
conceptualizing population health disparities and social determinants of health.

19
00:01:46,803 --> 00:01:56,343
For Wednesday, your first group journal is due and it will magically appear or become available at 1220 today.

20
00:01:56,373 --> 00:02:05,852
So I'm going to comment on the specific content of the assignment in just a minute, but that will be due at 11 a.m. on Monday.

21
00:02:05,853 --> 00:02:09,663
On Wednesday. And I have a couple of brief reading assignments.

22
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:14,253
I kept it a little lighter because I know some of you will be preparing your first entry.

23
00:02:14,793 --> 00:02:20,493
And there's a short article on US life expectancy, which I'd like to talk about on Wednesday.

24
00:02:21,873 --> 00:02:26,953
There's a video there that's just a review of what equity and equality is.

25
00:02:27,473 --> 00:02:30,512
And that should not be new content for anyone in here.

26
00:02:30,513 --> 00:02:35,283
But we're going to add to thinking about equity and equality on Wednesday.

27
00:02:35,553 --> 00:02:39,693
And so it'll be a good thing to review if you have the opportunity to do so.

28
00:02:40,723 --> 00:02:45,523
The middle assignment is a couple of pages in the Social Determinants of Mental Health book.

29
00:02:46,303 --> 00:02:53,083
I've asked you to specifically focus on pages 12 to 17 and the rest of the chapter you can skim.

30
00:02:53,983 --> 00:02:55,603
We're not going to get into too much detail.

31
00:02:55,633 --> 00:03:02,413
Again, I want you to focus on your journal entry and not spend too much time getting bogged down with the reading.

32
00:03:02,553 --> 00:03:06,823
Okay, so that's the agenda for next time. I'm sorry, the assignments.

33
00:03:07,123 --> 00:03:12,043
These are all on the canvas page under the January 11th module.

34
00:03:13,763 --> 00:03:17,843
Okay. Office hours begin today.

35
00:03:18,173 --> 00:03:23,333
Some of you have already begun signing up, which is great. You can do this.

36
00:03:23,573 --> 00:03:35,833
I think everyone knows this. But let me just show you on the homepage right here, there is a link to schedule an appointment, so you just click there.

37
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:45,443
And of course I'm not logged in, but um, and you can choose from the office hours for all of the sites, so we'll have you do that.

38
00:03:47,803 --> 00:03:51,233
Again. I really encourage you. Ten minute blocks. Come talk to us.

39
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:54,883
You don't need to have an agenda. If you want to, just come and say hello.

40
00:03:55,513 --> 00:03:58,963
We'd love to see you. You don't need to have a question, per se.

41
00:03:59,493 --> 00:04:07,213
All right. All right. I want to introduce to you the third member of our teaching team, our fourth Jackie Ho.

42
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:13,633
Jackie is in the back. Jackie, actually, come on down and introduce yourself to the class.

43
00:04:19,513 --> 00:04:22,603
Hello? Can you all hear me okay? Hi, everyone.

44
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:28,033
I'm Jackie. I'm currently doing my Masters of Public Health and health behavior and Health Education.

45
00:04:28,423 --> 00:04:32,803
A lot of my research surrounds have equity as well as access.

46
00:04:32,803 --> 00:04:37,483
I pivoted into corporate health care last summer where I worked at CVS Health,

47
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:43,663
doing strategy analytics, and upon graduation in May, I'll be working as a health care consultant.

48
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:49,183
So if any of you are interested in consulting, please feel free to reach out, discuss any of that.

49
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:56,443
Personally, I love food. I know everyone says they love food, but I love food.

50
00:04:56,653 --> 00:05:05,292
One of my life goals is to visit every restaurant Guy Fieri visited on divers drives into dives, specifically in Arizona.

51
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:08,653
I'm like 13 out of 24, which is really good for me.

52
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:13,212
And also I have like a food list for every city I visit.

53
00:05:13,213 --> 00:05:19,903
So if you want and harbor recommendations, I do have some I do think a lot of places here are made, but that's okay.

54
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:26,592
I see a lot of agreeance and I just enjoy being around people.

55
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:31,752
I love my dog who's named after two years, so if anyone wants to guess what cheese years I take like one.

56
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:39,283
Gas is not like a normal cheese. No, it's actually Pepper Jack.

57
00:05:39,923 --> 00:05:45,633
Anyway, anyways, that's really cozy.

58
00:05:45,673 --> 00:05:48,693
Hi. Thank you. You can keep that.

59
00:05:49,273 --> 00:05:55,933
Yeah. All right, well, welcome, Jackie. And I'm really excited to have folks here.

60
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:04,423
As you can see, we are. Well, hopefully you think we're fun, but it's not just about the business of the work, although that's important to.

61
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:09,583
And we love to talk about Pepper Jack or whatever you buy. Come on to office hours.

62
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:13,603
Welcome again to all three of the guests.

63
00:06:14,683 --> 00:06:20,623
OC student survey. Last I checked, we were in the nineties, which is fantastic.

64
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:26,383
The first year I did this we had 100% participation, which was amazing.

65
00:06:26,743 --> 00:06:31,993
Last year it dropped off. We were in the 90 90% or higher.

66
00:06:32,323 --> 00:06:36,643
If you haven't had a chance to fill out the survey yet, please go ahead and do so.

67
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:40,483
I know I've really enjoyed reading the responses so far.

68
00:06:41,203 --> 00:06:48,223
Learning about your pets and your interests and all these different things and the size and we need weekly on Wednesdays.

69
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:53,773
We are looking at the types of things that you said would make the course more interesting to you.

70
00:06:54,403 --> 00:07:00,702
And we're going to be trying out a couple of things as we go forward starting on Wednesday and based on your responses.

71
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:07,243
So to the extent that you want to be to weigh in on that, please do so through the survey.

72
00:07:07,843 --> 00:07:12,283
And again, thanks to you who have already done so. Okay.

73
00:07:12,343 --> 00:07:16,493
Syllabus updates. I caught a couple of errors on the syllabus.

74
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:21,403
One is that Julia pointed out the semester and sooner than I think we did.

75
00:07:21,403 --> 00:07:27,043
I don't know if I was looking at a different year or something, but the class actually ends on April 17th.

76
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:31,243
And so there are a couple of things I've heard from a few more guest lectures.

77
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:39,613
I have the office hours on the new syllabus and I have it posted here, but I will do that later today.

78
00:07:40,273 --> 00:07:42,463
And usually when I post an update to the syllabus,

79
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:51,583
it will tell you exactly what the changes are or I will highlight them in yellow so you can look forward to that later today.

80
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:58,213
I tried with the due dates of assignments to avoid religious observations.

81
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:07,603
The ones that tend to conflict in this course are Easter and Passover and the assignments are due to avoid getting around that.

82
00:08:08,083 --> 00:08:12,613
But if there are other dates that are important, please let me know.

83
00:08:13,243 --> 00:08:19,512
I know also during April we usually have folks who are observing Ramadan and we try

84
00:08:19,513 --> 00:08:25,473
to be mindful of the assignments that I do and give folks maximum flexibility there.

85
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:34,393
So just a word on that. Please feel free to approach us if we've missed other dates that are important to your particular religious observance.

86
00:08:35,773 --> 00:08:43,973
Okay. Let me just comment briefly that the housekeeping tends to be a bit longer in the beginning of the semester, so please just bear with me.

87
00:08:44,213 --> 00:08:50,393
It will get shorter as we go on with time because I have to say these things again, class recordings.

88
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:56,183
I thought about this a little bit. I was unsure about whether to post the notes or not.

89
00:08:56,693 --> 00:09:01,793
I was worried that if I posted them, no one would show up to class. After thinking about a little bit.

90
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:05,933
I've decided that I am going to make the recordings available.

91
00:09:06,773 --> 00:09:10,913
I will usually review them afterwards so I won't post automatically.

92
00:09:11,603 --> 00:09:15,083
But if you look, for example, Wednesday's class is posted.

93
00:09:15,803 --> 00:09:21,893
If there are topics of a sensitive nature or that I feel there's a reason we shouldn't post,

94
00:09:22,523 --> 00:09:30,433
I probably will not post those on line unless someone or I might edit it or something like that.

95
00:09:30,443 --> 00:09:33,533
So and those will become available.

96
00:09:33,863 --> 00:09:40,823
Some of you in your survey said, I really like to go and look at the recording and go through it at my own pace.

97
00:09:41,093 --> 00:09:45,353
And so hopefully this will help with that regard with with regard to that.

98
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:50,063
And I also hope that you will still continue to come to class.

99
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:54,442
You know, you all are adults. It's up to you if you come or not. I don't want to police.

100
00:09:54,443 --> 00:10:06,593
That lecture notes generally will be available by 9 a.m. the morning of was a little late today and I'm trying something a little bit different.

101
00:10:06,623 --> 00:10:14,393
Usually I just give you bullet points and with everything filled in, I'm trying kind of skeleton notes,

102
00:10:14,393 --> 00:10:19,223
skeletal notes to increase engagement in your ability to remember the information.

103
00:10:20,003 --> 00:10:28,253
So you'll see a version of that today. We are going to invite feedback over the next week, actually throughout the semester.

104
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:33,383
And so if everyone is like, I hate your skeletal notes, they're terrible, then we'll make some adjustments.

105
00:10:34,073 --> 00:10:37,552
But I do want to give them a try in the beginning of the course.

106
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:46,953
Okay, so we'll do that. And the next bullet here is about class participation, as I mentioned last week.

107
00:10:47,843 --> 00:10:51,023
Before you make a comment or speak in class, you should say your name.

108
00:10:51,803 --> 00:11:00,653
The guests are tracking who is speaking so that we can award extra points at the end of the semester if you're in a borderline situation.

109
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:07,012
As I said in last Wednesday, there are numerous ways to participate.

110
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:15,863
So don't only think of it as raising your hand in class, which is difficult for some of us to do, but coming to office hours,

111
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:25,073
sending an email to the GSI even once we get we're thinking about doing a discussion forum online if you have questions.

112
00:11:25,463 --> 00:11:29,873
And these are all ways that you can engage and participate in the class.

113
00:11:29,933 --> 00:11:41,393
Okay. There are 111 of us. I am not great with names, but I will try my best to learn as many of your names as possible by the end of the semester.

114
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:46,493
One of the ways that you can help me do that is before you make your comment saying, My name is so-and-so.

115
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:50,543
It'll also help the GSI to track your participation as well.

116
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:54,653
All right. Let's talk about the group journal assignment.

117
00:11:55,163 --> 00:12:01,013
Again, I know this is a bit tedious before getting into the actual content, but bear with me here.

118
00:12:02,813 --> 00:12:06,083
Hopefully you had a chance to look at this over the weekend.

119
00:12:07,373 --> 00:12:12,003
I just want to make sure we go through it so that you know exactly what's expected.

120
00:12:12,113 --> 00:12:17,333
Okay. So for Wednesday morning, you're going to write a journal entry to your group.

121
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:22,073
Again, this will become available immediately after today's class.

122
00:12:23,093 --> 00:12:29,333
You're writing in response to the readings up until Wednesday, as well as lecture.

123
00:12:29,363 --> 00:12:32,333
Okay, this is a little different.

124
00:12:32,573 --> 00:12:40,583
Last week we mostly went over the syllabus, but maybe you had thoughts about the course or about something the GSI said.

125
00:12:41,753 --> 00:12:45,833
It doesn't have to be in this first week. Only about today's class.

126
00:12:46,613 --> 00:12:50,393
Maybe there's something you have a question about, etc. So we want to think broadly.

127
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:57,383
The main thing that we want to see is that you are actively engaging with the course content and that you're

128
00:12:57,383 --> 00:13:04,503
thinking about what you heard and that you're not just summarizing or repeating what happened in class.

129
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:09,953
We don't need a book report of, you know, Dr. Neblett said this than Aaron Phypers, etcetera.

130
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:13,703
So we want to see that it's obvious you've done the reading.

131
00:13:13,703 --> 00:13:20,243
We can tell that you've done the reading and we can tell that you were in class or have watched the reporting, etc.

132
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:27,043
Okay, so the purpose of this assignment is to provide you with an opportunity to meaningfully engage.

133
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:33,683
This is not busy work with the course content and your peers ideas and thoughts about the material.

134
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:40,702
Okay, you're not writing to us, but the members of your group, they in turn will respond to your journal entries,

135
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:45,233
thus creating a dialog among your group throughout the first half of the semester.

136
00:13:46,103 --> 00:13:50,813
This assignment will not be greater than a traditional fashion, such as receiving a letter grade.

137
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:58,403
Instead, you're going to receive points based on a rubric that is at the bottom, I think, of this assignment.

138
00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:02,683
Yes. All right. Okay.

139
00:14:02,693 --> 00:14:15,143
So in terms of the specifics of it, Dubai started class on Wednesday and then the responses are due by Friday at midnight by midnight.

140
00:14:15,173 --> 00:14:18,773
That's pretty straightforward or posted on canvas.

141
00:14:19,763 --> 00:14:31,613
Your journal entry should be approximately 100 to 150 words, and your response that comes in on Friday should be 100 to 200 words.

142
00:14:31,643 --> 00:14:34,823
Okay. So you can do this a number of ways.

143
00:14:34,823 --> 00:14:40,823
You might choose to respond to two of your group members and just do short 50 word responses.

144
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:47,602
Or you might choose to respond to only one person and do a slightly longer response.

145
00:14:47,603 --> 00:14:54,083
So you have options. And then there's always a few people who get really excited and want to respond to multiple people.

146
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:59,093
But our expectation is only that you respond to at least one person.

147
00:14:59,153 --> 00:15:02,833
So bless you. Okay.

148
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:08,392
You can also respond some more than two members or write longer responses, etc.

149
00:15:08,393 --> 00:15:13,432
Okay. Each journal entries should thoughtfully and critically engage.

150
00:15:13,433 --> 00:15:23,333
You're going to quickly find out that I really encourage critical thinking and not just regurgitating material with the class lecture and readings.

151
00:15:23,363 --> 00:15:26,752
Okay, whatever you choose to write about should clearly demonstrate.

152
00:15:26,753 --> 00:15:31,463
You've finished the reading, attended lecture, and offered your opinion, judgments, observations.

153
00:15:31,883 --> 00:15:37,163
That is not simply a summation of the reading or a repetition of the lecture or discussion.

154
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:44,663
Maybe you can write about an aspect of the reading or class that you didn't understand something that surprises you,

155
00:15:45,353 --> 00:15:49,163
or formulate an insightful question or two about the reading.

156
00:15:49,223 --> 00:15:58,653
Okay, maybe as we start going over the social determinants of health models, you say this is interesting, but I think the models are missing this.

157
00:15:58,673 --> 00:16:08,243
They don't talk about X, okay? These are the kinds of things that we want to see critical, independent thinking about the topic.

158
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:12,323
You might discuss the personal relevance of the topic we are studying.

159
00:16:13,163 --> 00:16:20,573
All right. In your response, do on Friday again thoughtful and respectful reply to the insights posed by your group members.

160
00:16:21,263 --> 00:16:26,513
You can disagree with the writer, but again, obviously be respectful.

161
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:30,983
And it's not just enough to say I don't agree or I or I agree.

162
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:35,663
That's great. We want to know why you agree. We want to know why you disagree.

163
00:16:36,113 --> 00:16:42,233
Again, we want to show that you're just going beyond the surface of the assignment.

164
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:51,053
Hey, your response should not merely echo the writer, instead expand and build upon the observations and engage with their ideas.

165
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:54,633
Hey. All right. So that's the gist of it.

166
00:16:54,643 --> 00:16:58,213
Let me pause here. There usually a couple of questions.

167
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:05,023
Are there any things you're still uncertain about or unsure of about this assignment?

168
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:15,683
Okay. Everyone feels pretty clear on what the assignment is. I'm seeing head nods.

169
00:17:15,693 --> 00:17:18,743
Oh, I'm sorry. Here's a question. We have the mike coming. One second.

170
00:17:19,193 --> 00:17:23,873
We start with your name and then we'll hear your question. My name is Sarah Kabala.

171
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:30,593
And my question is, is the assignment already opened? So it will be open immediately after class.

172
00:17:30,743 --> 00:17:36,893
Okay, got it. Sometimes people start working on class and we haven't finished the lecture.

173
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:40,493
So I timed it so that. Okay.

174
00:17:40,503 --> 00:17:46,533
Are there other questions? And I didn't mind hearing Eric or Sara or neither Sara.

175
00:17:46,593 --> 00:17:49,623
Okay. Thank you, Sara. Any other questions?

176
00:17:52,843 --> 00:17:58,453
Okay. They probably will be some after the first set of grades come back.

177
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:04,153
I'm going to invite Aaron to make some comments about the assignment.

178
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:08,263
Since he's great at these, he's seen them all before. Hey.

179
00:18:08,293 --> 00:18:13,513
Ah, good morning. I was a GSI for this course before last year.

180
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:20,862
I'm gonna start by saying I fully love giving full credit. It's my favorite thing, and I think the best way to give full credit.

181
00:18:20,863 --> 00:18:27,613
I don't know if Doctor never went through this. Right now, here at the bottom are some examples.

182
00:18:30,123 --> 00:18:34,833
And if you click these examples and you read through them, it will show you this is what it looks like to get full credit.

183
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:38,732
This is what it looks like to get not full credit. And I think that if you go through that,

184
00:18:38,733 --> 00:18:42,963
plus look at the rubric in your attention or in specific about how you respond

185
00:18:43,353 --> 00:18:47,012
to each other and your intention specific about how you respond to the lecture,

186
00:18:47,013 --> 00:18:51,873
you will get full credit. And one of the things that I commonly saw last year is like a spell check your work.

187
00:18:52,443 --> 00:18:54,483
It's not like it's going to take a lot of points off,

188
00:18:54,483 --> 00:19:01,023
but like if it is so grammatically challenging to read that like I'm struggling to understand what you're trying to articulate,

189
00:19:01,263 --> 00:19:02,793
then you might lose a couple of points for that.

190
00:19:03,573 --> 00:19:09,092
In addition to that, the common thing that we regularly saw last year is that regurgitation of folks work.

191
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:14,943
I love to see when people bring in their personal examples. And personal doesn't have to be like very personal, intimate to your life.

192
00:19:14,943 --> 00:19:18,813
It can be personal to like your college student experience, personal and professional experience,

193
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:23,493
personal to like things that you've witnessed or you experience or even talking about somebody

194
00:19:23,493 --> 00:19:28,893
else's experience as long as you're anonymous and sensitive to their personal matters.

195
00:19:30,063 --> 00:19:35,943
Yeah, I really do love to give full credit. I imagine that the other parts of my teaching team really love to give full credit to.

196
00:19:36,153 --> 00:19:40,892
It's actually really hard to decide how to deduct points. So please follow the rubric.

197
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:45,753
Look at the examples we really want to give. You are exceed expectations every single time.

198
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:50,733
Our goal is to give you an A, not to deduct points. Thank you and perfect.

199
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:56,103
Yes, please. Can I get the my name, please?

200
00:19:58,523 --> 00:19:59,723
Hi. My name is Abby.

201
00:20:00,563 --> 00:20:09,413
I guess for the respond to your group members, is it is the discussion like all in one thread or is there like specific threads for each group?

202
00:20:09,773 --> 00:20:14,903
There's a specific thread for each group. And once I think we're usually set up.

203
00:20:14,903 --> 00:20:18,293
So you can't start responding until you've actually posted your response.

204
00:20:19,043 --> 00:20:25,553
But the threads should be as long as we clicked on the right things immediately apparent.

205
00:20:25,613 --> 00:20:32,303
Yeah. And there was a time last semester where we forgot to link it by group and it someone just let us know right away and we corrected it.

206
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:37,363
But I think it's also. Thank you for your question.

207
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:42,273
Anyone else? Okay.

208
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:46,083
Part of the reason that we have you drive one of these.

209
00:20:46,293 --> 00:20:50,283
Most folks do fine. But sometimes it takes a little bit to figure out what exactly we're looking for.

210
00:20:50,943 --> 00:20:54,153
You do have some flexibility. One thing to note.

211
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:57,143
Looking ahead, there's no class on Monday, right?

212
00:20:57,423 --> 00:21:07,523
So the second journal will actually become available to you right after class on Wednesday, even though you'll still be working through the first one.

213
00:21:07,533 --> 00:21:09,963
So I know from teaching this class,

214
00:21:09,963 --> 00:21:16,683
there's going to be some of you who want to jump right in and get started on your second journal won't be due until next Wednesday.

215
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:23,283
But if you want to get started running after class on Wednesday, you can because there's no class on Monday.

216
00:21:23,943 --> 00:21:28,143
And. All right. Examples, I think, will be helpful.

217
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:31,413
One thing I do want to comment on.

218
00:21:32,613 --> 00:21:36,483
I don't know how soon folks looked at the rubric.

219
00:21:36,483 --> 00:21:44,823
Last year this was out of four points. After a discussion on at the GSA meeting, we decided to make it five points.

220
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:51,863
I won't bore you with the reasons we did that, but all we did is made this last criterion.

221
00:21:51,873 --> 00:21:54,003
Your response to peers is now worth two points.

222
00:21:54,013 --> 00:22:00,063
So if you looked at it and you're like, But I thought it was four points, most of you saw it as five points.

223
00:22:00,063 --> 00:22:03,393
But I just want to comment in case anyone is confused about that.

224
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:08,083
Okay. That's a mouthful. Read the rest of it.

225
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:13,493
Look at the examples and you'll be in good shape. Okay.

226
00:22:14,673 --> 00:22:23,133
All right. Any questions before we move on about anything not related to the assignment?

227
00:22:27,673 --> 00:22:31,033
Okay. On Wednesday or soon after,

228
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:39,463
we will be inviting Feedback Anonymous throughout the semester so that if there are things that you think of or that aren't going well,

229
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:43,393
that you want to let me or the teaching team know about, you'll have an opportunity to do that.

230
00:22:45,413 --> 00:22:53,973
All right, so what are we going to do today? This is a class on population health determinants and disparities.

231
00:22:55,143 --> 00:23:05,043
It makes sense to me that if we're going to embark on this journey together, we want to have some kind of agreement about what we're talking about.

232
00:23:05,553 --> 00:23:09,243
We want to have some kind of agreement on what population health is.

233
00:23:09,693 --> 00:23:14,253
What are we talking about when we say determinants and what do we mean by disparities?

234
00:23:15,123 --> 00:23:19,383
This should largely be a review for almost everyone in here,

235
00:23:19,953 --> 00:23:26,283
but it is really important as we think about the glossary assignment and as you do this work going forward,

236
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:34,053
to have a common language before you launch off because population health means different things to different people.

237
00:23:34,773 --> 00:23:39,573
And so we want to think about what what is it going to mean in this class? What does health disparities mean, etc.?

238
00:23:40,443 --> 00:23:46,863
The other objective that I want to start working on today and that will really work on the entire semester,

239
00:23:47,523 --> 00:23:54,863
is thinking about the mechanisms by which social determinants of health influence disparities.

240
00:23:54,873 --> 00:24:02,853
So how do we get from things like food insecurity to poor cardiovascular disease?

241
00:24:03,843 --> 00:24:12,423
How do we get from things like housing insecurity, for example, to cancer outcomes, for example?

242
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:18,483
A lot of times we talk about the fact that there are disparities, we document the disparities.

243
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:23,603
But in terms of understanding how we get to the disparities, we don't do that.

244
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:32,193
Okay. That's a lot of what this class is about. The reason that's important is because if we want to do the work of intervention,

245
00:24:32,583 --> 00:24:41,313
if we want to do the work of thinking about programs, policies, etc., we've got to understand how we get from point A to point B.

246
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:47,913
So we're going to start thinking about that. And this is increasingly challenging, as you'll see later, I hope.

247
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:56,253
A lot of times we just look at black white disparities and we talk about African-Americans and whites and how they're different.

248
00:24:56,823 --> 00:25:00,183
And that leads a lot of groups out, for example.

249
00:25:00,513 --> 00:25:08,433
And if we're designing programs and policies, just talking about black white differences all the time isn't going to be all that helpful.

250
00:25:08,463 --> 00:25:10,563
So we want to expand that.

251
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:17,043
One of the things you're going to see when I give examples of disparities is that there's complexity to the disparities, right?

252
00:25:17,403 --> 00:25:24,903
So we might find that from age 45 to 64, that group has lower health outcomes.

253
00:25:25,413 --> 00:25:32,373
But we may find, as we did and you saw in chapter one, that it's particularly pronounced for women in that cohort.

254
00:25:32,733 --> 00:25:43,133
And so mechanisms, again, thinking about why is it that a particular group or subgroup within a group is experiencing and,

255
00:25:43,283 --> 00:25:50,043
you know, even exacerbated disparities? It's the type of thinking that we want to do in this class.

256
00:25:50,433 --> 00:26:04,173
So we'll start that today. All right. I asked you to read for today a article on uncounted people of color dying.

257
00:26:04,193 --> 00:26:09,803
So death rates in African-Americans and other groups.

258
00:26:10,013 --> 00:26:21,653
People of color. In regards to COVID 19 OC in the News is a segment of the lecture where we will

259
00:26:21,863 --> 00:26:28,043
rotate among the team members and discuss a recent news article that has happened.

260
00:26:28,643 --> 00:26:33,983
Sometimes it's going to be really quick. I'm going to tell you basically what the finding was.

261
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:40,373
Maybe if there are any questions and move it on. Other days, like today.

262
00:26:40,673 --> 00:26:44,473
We have an activity planned around discussing the article.

263
00:26:44,873 --> 00:26:49,943
So that's kind of the other extreme. And then a lot of times it'll be in between.

264
00:26:49,993 --> 00:26:54,743
So last semester when we did this or a year ago,

265
00:26:55,103 --> 00:27:03,053
the GSEs would come up with some discussion questions and we'd kind of discuss them as a large group and maybe in five or 10 minutes.

266
00:27:03,083 --> 00:27:06,793
Okay, so that's what you'll see with the In the News segment.

267
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:17,272
It usually would be at the beginning of class. Before we do the exercise, I want to basically summarize this article.

268
00:27:17,273 --> 00:27:21,473
So uncounted people of color are dying. Hopefully you got a chance to look at it.

269
00:27:22,943 --> 00:27:26,613
I'm going to. Introduce this by looking at.

270
00:27:27,733 --> 00:27:31,273
Some graphs here. So these are ill defined and unknown death rates.

271
00:27:31,663 --> 00:27:34,603
If you read the article, they talk about garbage codes.

272
00:27:35,173 --> 00:27:45,413
Garbage garbage codes is a category that is often used when you don't know the cause of death for an individual.

273
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:54,433
And what this graph shows with the garbage code is that they increased significantly for nonwhite groups.

274
00:27:54,463 --> 00:28:02,053
Okay. So if you look at American Indian Alaska natives, you'll notice during the pandemic we're kind of going along here,

275
00:28:02,983 --> 00:28:09,493
the excess or garbage code deaths that are unexpected based on prior years kind of jumps up.

276
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:15,883
Okay. So that's the pattern here. If you look at blacks, African-Americans, same pattern we're treading along.

277
00:28:16,363 --> 00:28:20,263
This is a garbage code. And I for some reason, 21, 22, boom.

278
00:28:20,293 --> 00:28:26,573
Okay. If you look at white non-Hispanic groups, you don't see that same increase.

279
00:28:26,593 --> 00:28:37,303
Okay. Uh, if you look at these numbers overall, they talk about how the garbage codes increase for people of color about 20% during the pandemic,

280
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:41,623
whereas for white non-Hispanics, they increased about 1%.

281
00:28:41,923 --> 00:28:51,163
So you see there's barely an increase. Asian you see a slight increase as well, similar for some of the other groups.

282
00:28:51,283 --> 00:29:02,793
Okay. One of the things that they point out in the article is that there seems to be an uncoupling of the vaccination rates.

283
00:29:02,803 --> 00:29:09,433
So there's some areas where you see vaccination rates kind of really high 80, 90%,

284
00:29:09,763 --> 00:29:17,803
but you still have these large garbage garbage codes being used for African-Americans and other groups.

285
00:29:18,913 --> 00:29:30,383
Also, in terms of COVID death rates, you have places during 20 2020 and 2021 where the rates of death from COVID leveled out or even decreased.

286
00:29:30,403 --> 00:29:36,613
They talked about Native American on some reservations, but the garbage codes didn't follow the same pattern.

287
00:29:36,643 --> 00:29:41,553
They kind of went in the opposite direction. Okay. That was the general premise.

288
00:29:41,563 --> 00:29:53,863
So this author reporter is arguing that the reporting and the accuracy of COVID 19 deaths is inaccurate

289
00:29:54,253 --> 00:30:01,513
and that really that big jump that we see in garbage codes is due to people getting it wrong.

290
00:30:01,653 --> 00:30:08,053
Okay. So some of these things that we're seeing are really COVID 19, but they're not being coded as COVID 19.

291
00:30:08,383 --> 00:30:17,233
And so her argument is that this is leading to inaccurate numbers around who has died of COVID 19.

292
00:30:17,503 --> 00:30:20,743
Okay. So that's the general premise. All right.

293
00:30:20,753 --> 00:30:27,233
What I'd like to do is an exercise we're going to use frequently throughout the semester.

294
00:30:27,313 --> 00:30:36,533
Okay. So I'm going to ask you first independently to spend 2 minutes thinking about the prompts that you see here on the screen.

295
00:30:37,073 --> 00:30:42,983
So quietly, you see, feel free to jot down and just think in your head about the questions.

296
00:30:44,503 --> 00:30:50,533
The questions are as follows First and you'll be doing these in pairs or small groups around you.

297
00:30:51,313 --> 00:30:53,413
What was your general reaction to the piece?

298
00:30:54,193 --> 00:31:01,753
And notice like, you only have one minute to do this, so just maybe think of a word and say why in a sentence.

299
00:31:02,143 --> 00:31:05,143
Not a long discussion. Okay, so what did you think about it?

300
00:31:05,173 --> 00:31:13,063
What was your general reaction? Second question, what were some of the reasons in the article?

301
00:31:13,423 --> 00:31:20,203
Or maybe you can think of others that account for this discrepancy in terms of the garbage codes.

302
00:31:21,103 --> 00:31:29,203
What were some of the reasons that they gave in the article? And then the last discussion question is why does it matter why?

303
00:31:29,313 --> 00:31:37,393
Why do we care? Like, who cares that the garbage code rates are different for Native Americans or Asian populations?

304
00:31:37,903 --> 00:31:40,933
Why is this an issue that we should be concerned about?

305
00:31:41,173 --> 00:31:46,693
Okay. So 2 minutes. Thinking by yourself about the questions I'd like you.

306
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:51,503
After the 2 minutes, I let you know to turn to a partner or folks in your row.

307
00:31:51,523 --> 00:31:56,323
Small group discussion will also be circulating in case folks need to find group members.

308
00:31:57,283 --> 00:32:03,013
And then. If 3 minutes and then final 2 minutes, why do we care?

309
00:32:03,543 --> 00:32:06,943
And any questions about the prompt?

310
00:32:09,103 --> 00:32:14,683
Okay. So 2 minutes will start now and I will let you know when the 2 minutes is up.

311
00:33:32,883 --> 00:33:42,303
Okay. Less than 2 minutes here, but let's go ahead and just talk with their neighbor form small groups folks in your immediate area.

312
00:33:43,773 --> 00:33:50,063
First spread out if you would like and we'll take the next, uh, 4 minutes or so.

313
00:33:50,283 --> 00:33:53,403
I'm sorry. 6 minutes to discuss the topic.

314
00:33:53,403 --> 00:34:03,753
So go ahead and start your discussion time.

315
00:34:15,603 --> 00:34:24,583
I would like to open up with my questions.

316
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:32,153
I'm gonna keep an eye on the cards. Or if I find something like that, I can remove all of them.

317
00:34:33,723 --> 00:34:41,573
So I want to go out and have a quick scan and someone to come out and.

318
00:34:45,193 --> 00:34:51,263
You know, I'm not proud of it.

319
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:58,563
So what did you think? You know, I. You know, the Germans.

320
00:34:59,223 --> 00:35:00,633
Yeah. Putting them in Des Moines.

321
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:12,723
Know, I was just about to this morning we were grabbing 30 people during which I don't mind laughing out loud and I don't know, I don't mind that.

322
00:35:13,143 --> 00:35:18,813
I think I'm just sitting at home doing right now.

323
00:35:18,813 --> 00:35:30,063
It's sitting in San Francisco. So like if you go over like that, say, you know, I'm not doing it for the one night.

324
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:36,703
It's like I just want to go to work like that.

325
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:44,603
That's like. We have 3 a.m.

326
00:35:47,553 --> 00:35:56,103
And so many things are many, many have not specified, many that we can figure out.

327
00:36:04,773 --> 00:36:10,573
And the reason why we saw it in Europe is that you can the headlines.

328
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:18,113
Are you on this? I am. Okay.

329
00:36:18,113 --> 00:36:22,433
If you haven't already start thinking about it, we're about to hear the reason.

330
00:36:23,243 --> 00:36:27,413
Okay. 3 minutes. You want to split it by five?

331
00:36:27,693 --> 00:36:32,933
Yeah. Yeah. You want to do tracking today?

332
00:36:33,503 --> 00:36:40,973
Okay, so we'll run around with these. Yeah.

333
00:36:42,653 --> 00:36:47,233
Last year. I don't know if you all want to do it this way or not. We split it, so, like, do it with someone else.

334
00:36:47,293 --> 00:36:54,893
Oh, is that okay? Okay. Just so you know, you can keep it.

335
00:36:55,073 --> 00:37:02,023
So you weren't flying over my room and my back, but you [INAUDIBLE] [INAUDIBLE].

336
00:37:05,513 --> 00:37:11,153
Okay, that's what I am going to say.

337
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:33,223
But. Like.

338
00:37:38,963 --> 00:38:43,003
Are. You can help. Hey, listen.

339
00:38:49,423 --> 00:38:52,593
I extend my services.

340
00:38:56,113 --> 00:39:05,123
Right. That's okay. I can tell.

341
00:39:08,493 --> 00:39:17,353
They were serving in the UK and. Okay.

342
00:39:20,543 --> 00:39:24,643
Oh, I was here. I.

343
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:42,193
Just get information first and then I think you and from now on and then also like

344
00:39:42,293 --> 00:39:51,753
is there any any sort of personality incident looking to make some requests.

345
00:39:56,843 --> 00:39:59,993
And sometimes I'll be traveling through that and.

346
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:07,013
Oh. Now.

347
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:31,842
I can't work about one more minute, one more minute, 60 seconds, and then we'll reconvene.

348
00:40:31,843 --> 00:40:43,523
One more minute. It sounded like folks are ready to go now.

349
00:40:46,873 --> 00:40:54,773
All right. So let's talk about this. I'm going to start and just invite folks who'd like to share today.

350
00:40:54,793 --> 00:41:01,543
We'll see how that goes. Sometimes I will call specific groups and folks to report back out.

351
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:08,473
And as always, if you are called on, which I won't do today unless no one says anything,

352
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:15,853
you can always feel free to pass or just say pass if you don't wish to participate.

353
00:41:15,863 --> 00:41:19,403
No, no harm or foul there. All right.

354
00:41:19,403 --> 00:41:24,263
So let's hear what folks talk about, talk this, talked about what are some of the things that came up?

355
00:41:25,073 --> 00:41:34,823
I'm going to cast a wide net any of the questions. So reactions that came up are reasons for the disparity.

356
00:41:35,123 --> 00:41:41,193
Why this is important? What did folks talk about? We've got lots of hands, which is great.

357
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:47,043
Well, I'm heading down. If you could say the first letter of your last name is one of a couple of you have the same first name.

358
00:41:48,843 --> 00:41:55,953
Okay. All right. And since there are a lot of hands, try to keep your responses brief and then pass it.

359
00:41:55,953 --> 00:42:03,303
Pass the mic on to someone in your area. I'm Amber s, I guess I.

360
00:42:03,363 --> 00:42:11,913
We were just talking about how frustrating it is that these deaths are being mis accurately represented and not reported properly because those

361
00:42:11,913 --> 00:42:23,103
statistics are what allow for funding and change and it's undermining the issue of racial discrepancies and disparities within the health care system.

362
00:42:23,433 --> 00:42:27,873
Okay, great. Frustrating has implications for fundings funding.

363
00:42:28,533 --> 00:42:33,263
Who would like to add to that? Pass it along. We'll go here and then we'll go ahead.

364
00:42:33,603 --> 00:42:40,533
Hi, my name's Lindsey EHR and I agree with what Amber said and what my group talked about was really similar.

365
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:50,103
And we just said that the way that the inaccurate reporting or the inaccurate reporting kind of reinforces a cyclical cycle,

366
00:42:50,253 --> 00:42:54,903
that's the same word, like reinforcing the disparities.

367
00:42:55,263 --> 00:42:59,913
So I would agree with frustrating and just the logic behind that, like made a lot of sense to me.

368
00:43:00,093 --> 00:43:09,123
Okay, Lindsay, a word. First of all, I love that you made a connection to a former classmate or not a former classmate, a current classmate.

369
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:15,273
How does it reinforce? So tell me just say a brief little bit more about how it reinforces.

370
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:17,613
Yeah. I think what she's done to mention that,

371
00:43:17,883 --> 00:43:27,573
what she said about the funding and then not being able to like get accurate data to develop proper interventions and make valid change.

372
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:31,203
Okay, great. Next person who has it and then we'll pass that.

373
00:43:31,953 --> 00:43:38,823
Go ahead. Yes. Hi, I'm Sophia. Are and I kind of, like connected it to a class I took last semester.

374
00:43:38,823 --> 00:43:39,843
Public Health 300.

375
00:43:40,083 --> 00:43:47,012
And Dr. Schwartz, you talked a lot about how like what is like the actual cause of death and then like like the theoretical cause of death, I guess.

376
00:43:47,013 --> 00:43:52,333
Or like you might say, you died of complications due to diabetes, but like what caused the diabetes?

377
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:58,963
So, like, you can't write on like a destiny. Forget they lived in a bad neighborhood, but like, in reality, that contributes to the death.

378
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:03,403
And so it's like, how are public health officials supposed to it's like hard for them to then, like,

379
00:44:03,403 --> 00:44:08,282
create like she just had like interventions when they don't really know what really caused the death because like the person's dead,

380
00:44:08,283 --> 00:44:12,842
they can't tell you how they grew up and their life circumstances into what led them to, you know,

381
00:44:12,843 --> 00:44:18,183
developing maybe like type two diabetes and maybe like a contributed to like their environment and like the way they grew up.

382
00:44:18,183 --> 00:44:23,313
And if they grew up in poverty and like what are like the real causes of death or really just their environment?

383
00:44:23,403 --> 00:44:26,102
Give me their name one more time. Sophia, are Sophia.

384
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:32,583
Okay, so, Sophia, you're getting at a really important point, which is that COVID 19 and cardiovascular disease,

385
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:43,322
that doesn't tell us anything about the actual underlying root cause of what led to them having the disease, for example.

386
00:44:43,323 --> 00:44:46,593
And so there's more to the picture that may be available.

387
00:44:46,623 --> 00:44:50,993
Okay. Thank you, Sophia. Let's go to this side of the room a little bit and then maybe we'll come back.

388
00:44:51,003 --> 00:44:54,393
Yes, please. We talked about.

389
00:44:55,023 --> 00:44:59,183
Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm Adler F on.

390
00:44:59,703 --> 00:45:09,783
We talked about how a lot of the times there are certain minority communities within America which are particularly communities

391
00:45:10,413 --> 00:45:19,142
that struggle with socioeconomic standing or other financial issues or other certain issues related to receiving resources.

392
00:45:19,143 --> 00:45:26,102
I think that within these minority communities, certain I mean, I don't know exactly who determines death by causes of death,

393
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:29,672
but the coroner's office or whoever is involved in that process might not be

394
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:36,693
receiving proper resources to truly decide whether how one has passed away,

395
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:44,193
what has contributed to that. So I think a lack of resources among like a lot of disparities is another way that this occurs.

396
00:45:44,463 --> 00:45:47,983
Okay, good. So Adler is getting a question number three here.

397
00:45:48,003 --> 00:45:54,583
There resources Adler is alluding to who determines is it the coroner?

398
00:45:54,603 --> 00:46:02,633
Is it the justice of the peace there? The article talked about inequities in terms of how many people are available.

399
00:46:02,643 --> 00:46:11,283
Are those positions filled? All these things contribute to discrepancies in understanding what the cause of death is.

400
00:46:11,773 --> 00:46:14,913
Okay. I thought I saw someone in the front here. Yes, please. Go ahead.

401
00:46:15,243 --> 00:46:19,513
My name is Hannah B. My first reaction to it was like,

402
00:46:19,533 --> 00:46:27,873
not surprising because I heard about it in the news before of just like the underreporting of COVID deaths in communities of color.

403
00:46:28,413 --> 00:46:34,262
But it's especially disappointing, especially like now that I'm looking at when this article was published,

404
00:46:34,263 --> 00:46:38,103
which was like two weeks ago, something like racism.

405
00:46:38,593 --> 00:46:48,253
It was a public health issue somewhat recently that like this is still an ongoing problem and it's like so obvious and blatant,

406
00:46:49,543 --> 00:46:54,762
especially since like we need this data to inform policy and we're still not

407
00:46:54,763 --> 00:47:00,793
getting that data despite like our newfound awareness of racism as a health issue.

408
00:47:01,123 --> 00:47:02,743
Okay. Thank you for that.

409
00:47:03,163 --> 00:47:10,422
I have lots of comments for each of them, but I'm going to pause and let more people come in because we're going to have to move on soon.

410
00:47:10,423 --> 00:47:13,993
So let's jump. Who has a mic? Okay. Yes, please.

411
00:47:14,263 --> 00:47:18,933
My name is Pharisee and we talked about question for a lot because we were talking about it.

412
00:47:18,973 --> 00:47:21,702
If you can't see the problem, then there's no way to solve it.

413
00:47:21,703 --> 00:47:26,773
So if you have inaccurate reporting, then you can't really say that there's a problem and then you can't solve the problem.

414
00:47:27,793 --> 00:47:30,883
Okay, great. Was it Farah? Farah.

415
00:47:31,193 --> 00:47:34,213
Okay. Thank you. Over here, please. Hi.

416
00:47:34,213 --> 00:47:37,423
My name is Peyton H. I was just going to basically touch on that.

417
00:47:38,143 --> 00:47:43,183
Just a quote from the article said, like, there's no data, then there's no problem.

418
00:47:43,483 --> 00:47:45,583
And I just want to talk about how Adler was saying, like,

419
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:52,932
a lot of these communities just have a lack of resources and you can't like basically when there's no data and there's no problem,

420
00:47:52,933 --> 00:47:58,873
we can't provide the funding to accurately like combat these problems.

421
00:47:58,873 --> 00:47:59,863
But then again,

422
00:48:00,103 --> 00:48:09,733
a lot of the times policy is put in place that also has barriers for people like to like some type of policy put in place that will help these people.

423
00:48:09,733 --> 00:48:16,842
But it's only it's put in place in a way in which there's still barriers to accessing the resources they need.

424
00:48:16,843 --> 00:48:22,573
So like a lot of time and money needs to be put in place into actually solving the issues.

425
00:48:22,573 --> 00:48:28,063
And that's like not something a lot of people want to do because of how much time and money and resources it takes.

426
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:32,773
Okay. So what you're adding to the conversation is that even when there is policy,

427
00:48:32,773 --> 00:48:39,763
oftentimes that policy has its own barriers within it that make it hard to realize addressing the underlying issue.

428
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:45,883
Great. All right. Let's take a couple more. I don't know. I see some hands over here and I will come here.

429
00:48:45,883 --> 00:48:49,723
So maybe these last two, please, I can just be like, let's use them.

430
00:48:49,763 --> 00:49:00,672
I mean, for accessibility reasons. The important again that again, my name is Libby K and I had more of like a question.

431
00:49:00,673 --> 00:49:05,413
If anyone wants to answer it, great, because we're talking a lot about COVID 19 deaths.

432
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:10,573
And there's a little piece in this article about the Navajo Nation,

433
00:49:11,143 --> 00:49:19,573
and they spoke about how they had massive COVID 19 death rates and then those dropped in 2020 and 2021.

434
00:49:19,903 --> 00:49:24,222
But the causes of death, such as car accidents and alcohol poisoning, increased.

435
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:31,243
And I felt like that was kind of an odd thing to add, given like the current discussion that the article was in the direction it was going.

436
00:49:31,543 --> 00:49:35,053
So don't know if that they're trying to speak to like mental health related issues

437
00:49:35,053 --> 00:49:40,753
that were arising due to their pandemic or if they just like giving us another fact.

438
00:49:40,763 --> 00:49:46,123
So. Okay. So one thing to think about, I, I think this is a great question.

439
00:49:47,623 --> 00:49:51,373
We could easily spend another ten or 15 minutes on just that question alone.

440
00:49:51,763 --> 00:49:56,713
This is an example of something you might respond to or talk about in your journal entry and say,

441
00:49:56,713 --> 00:49:59,113
I thought it was really interesting when this point was raised.

442
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:08,442
What I will do in this particular instance is say that I think it does make us think about some of the other things that are going on,

443
00:50:08,443 --> 00:50:09,252
as you alluded to,

444
00:50:09,253 --> 00:50:19,963
in terms of mental health and that maybe sometimes even if the immediate rates in a moment go down, there may be things that happen after time.

445
00:50:19,963 --> 00:50:25,963
How are people coping with the stress from the time before the vaccinations kind of went up?

446
00:50:27,253 --> 00:50:30,733
And we know we'll talk maybe about this a little bit later.

447
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:36,432
American Indian populations substance use because of some of the historic atrocities

448
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:40,603
that have been done to those communities have been a longstanding problem.

449
00:50:40,603 --> 00:50:44,083
So maybe we don't know the authors, not here.

450
00:50:44,383 --> 00:50:51,432
This is a way of saying, like even with the sort of decline in the garbage codes or even the rates,

451
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:58,243
there's still these other things that are going on that are are issues to think about.

452
00:50:58,253 --> 00:51:04,693
Does that make sense? All right. Let's take one more comment and then I want to invite the teaching team.

453
00:51:05,473 --> 00:51:11,442
Hello, I'm Superman P. And one thing I was curious was like kind of comparing it to like research.

454
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:15,013
How in research are we going to increase diversity in research teams then?

455
00:51:15,703 --> 00:51:18,913
And that will lead to more diversity in like participants in research.

456
00:51:18,913 --> 00:51:23,382
Maybe that same thing could be applied to the people who are actually doing the like results

457
00:51:23,383 --> 00:51:26,893
or like figuring out the data or like doing the death certificate and everything like that.

458
00:51:26,893 --> 00:51:31,542
If we increase diversity on that front and the people who are doing it, maybe that will lead to better data.

459
00:51:31,543 --> 00:51:36,073
And the reports of does not just in COVID 19, but in groups of color, in marginalized communities.

460
00:51:36,283 --> 00:51:38,893
OC Sigma. And why? Why would that matter? Or why?

461
00:51:38,893 --> 00:51:44,563
Why would having more diverse researchers or people who do the study like why would that lead to more accurate data?

462
00:51:45,433 --> 00:51:51,613
Perhaps in research? Much of the time we want to increase diversity because I just least more diverse pools of people.

463
00:51:51,893 --> 00:51:58,063
You're trusting that group or things like that could follow through in that retrospect that like it's like,

464
00:51:58,063 --> 00:52:03,672
let's say someone in my family died at the corner that I was going to or like talking to kind of look like me or relate to me.

465
00:52:03,673 --> 00:52:09,103
I'd maybe would ask more questions, dove a little bit deeper, and then that could lead the process even further to get the answers we needed.

466
00:52:09,373 --> 00:52:12,933
So, like, something along those lines could work. Okay, great.

467
00:52:13,723 --> 00:52:21,923
I'll start on the money, and I'm going to invite the teaching team to either add to what we've heard before we move on.

468
00:52:21,943 --> 00:52:25,033
Anything from anyone want to add? Anything?

469
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:35,713
No. Okay. This is a very important issue that the NIH is grappling with.

470
00:52:35,743 --> 00:52:47,772
So if you do some reading or research, you'll find out that there are long term disparities in terms of what researchers are funded.

471
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:53,743
So there's well-documented evidence that African-Americans are not funded by the NIH.

472
00:52:53,743 --> 00:52:57,133
The same is true for NSF, the National Science Foundation,

473
00:52:57,493 --> 00:53:04,023
at the same rate that other groups are in terms of research submitted, even when you control for a number of factors.

474
00:53:04,033 --> 00:53:10,413
Okay. A lot of the research that people are doing is health disparities research.

475
00:53:10,483 --> 00:53:14,533
It's about black people. It's about under-resourced groups.

476
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:19,273
And the folks who are doing it may not have lived experience.

477
00:53:19,933 --> 00:53:26,203
They're going into communities and doing the work, but the communities may not trust that individual.

478
00:53:27,253 --> 00:53:30,733
And so that can lead to who's participated in research, other things that someone said.

479
00:53:30,733 --> 00:53:35,563
I just want to reiterate that this is a thing that people are grappling with.

480
00:53:35,983 --> 00:53:48,163
The NIH is thinking about how do we get more diverse researchers into this space, how do we get their research funded, etc.?

481
00:53:48,523 --> 00:53:54,913
This is a personal, uh, soapbox topic for me.

482
00:53:55,963 --> 00:54:04,633
This is one of the more diverse cohorts of public health students that have come in since I've been teaching this course.

483
00:54:05,563 --> 00:54:08,262
There are invariably, if you look around the room,

484
00:54:08,263 --> 00:54:14,423
there are still some demographics that are not present or intersections of demographics, I would say.

485
00:54:14,443 --> 00:54:23,053
Okay. And so how do we get more of the folks who aren't in the room, who aren't taking this class, who aren't public health majors into the room,

486
00:54:23,053 --> 00:54:30,133
so that they will be the ones conducting research and be a part of the research teams with folks who are already doing the work.

487
00:54:30,393 --> 00:54:33,673
Okay. So all excellent points. All right.

488
00:54:34,093 --> 00:54:44,203
I spent a little bit longer on this exercise than I intended, but I appreciate the thoughts and ideas that came.

489
00:54:44,203 --> 00:54:50,953
It's clear people prepared. I love how folks are kind of adding on to responding to other folks in the class.

490
00:54:51,823 --> 00:54:56,523
And this is the type of thing that we want to continue to do as we go through the semester,

491
00:54:56,533 --> 00:55:00,343
although it'll probably be a little more collapse going forward.

492
00:55:01,003 --> 00:55:06,283
I think we have the luxury of doing it today because some of the other concepts are, I think, a little more basic.

493
00:55:06,373 --> 00:55:09,973
Okay. So again, nice job with that and more to come.

494
00:55:10,993 --> 00:55:19,423
All right. Let me look at the time. 55. Okay. So these are the key core concepts that I want to talk about for just a few minutes.

495
00:55:19,873 --> 00:55:24,973
Population health disparities, social determinants of health. That's that's what we're going to be talking about this semester.

496
00:55:27,043 --> 00:55:28,273
Population health.

497
00:55:28,753 --> 00:55:37,373
There are a couple of textbook definitions combined, a number of ways of thinking about this, but a lot of them focus on health outcomes.

498
00:55:37,393 --> 00:55:46,243
Okay, so kindergarten starter, the health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group.

499
00:55:46,723 --> 00:55:51,673
So almost all the definitions you look at say it's not just the outcomes,

500
00:55:52,033 --> 00:55:57,253
but it's recognizing that there's a distribution of outcomes, that there are groups within groups,

501
00:55:57,643 --> 00:56:06,893
and that if we're talking about population health, we've got to be thinking about the distribution of the outcomes within the entire population.

502
00:56:06,913 --> 00:56:15,413
Okay. When we talk about population health, we're thinking about patterns of determinants and policies and interventions.

503
00:56:15,443 --> 00:56:23,923
Okay. So I like this for you to realize population health as we go through the semester is not just talking about outcomes,

504
00:56:24,523 --> 00:56:30,103
but also thinking about the policies, the interventions that matter.

505
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:39,463
Okay. The CDC says that population health is an approach that allows health departments to connect practice to policy.

506
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:49,303
Okay, but is that P word again or to piece practice to policy thinking about things at a local level, bringing concerns into focus, etc.?

507
00:56:49,423 --> 00:56:57,083
Okay, so one approach, one definition is saying it's all about the outcomes and differences in groups.

508
00:56:57,973 --> 00:57:03,673
The other definitions are saying this is a general approach, that it's not outcomes but an approach.

509
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:11,323
And another definition reiterates health outcomes of groups of individuals in an economic framework.

510
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:16,513
And then I want to show you here quickly the triple aim framework.

511
00:57:18,653 --> 00:57:28,193
Which argues that in order to maximize the performance of health systems, we've got to address population health.

512
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:38,903
We've got to reduce the per capita cost of education, of health care, and we've got to get the experience of care to be better.

513
00:57:39,983 --> 00:57:45,923
So if we put all of these things together, it will lead to improving how our health systems perform.

514
00:57:46,703 --> 00:57:52,733
And so obviously, population health is important. I will frequently link articles.

515
00:57:53,003 --> 00:57:58,373
This is a short article. Feel free to go and read the page for additional information.

516
00:57:58,983 --> 00:58:03,563
Okay. All right. A couple more things. This is from the textbook that you read.

517
00:58:04,133 --> 00:58:08,183
So Hamer and Hamilton, it's about patterns.

518
00:58:08,453 --> 00:58:12,203
It's about trends. We're going to be talking about a lot of patterns and trends.

519
00:58:12,983 --> 00:58:20,063
What are the determinants of the trends? So population health is not just about the patterns and trends.

520
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:27,503
We get caught up a lot of times just documenting, as you see in bullet one here, what the patterns and trends are.

521
00:58:27,803 --> 00:58:34,023
But that's not the full extent of population health. Okay. We want to think about what are the things that lead to.

522
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:39,713
As was just mentioned in our prior discussion, the causes of the causes explanation.

523
00:58:40,553 --> 00:58:46,043
Why is it the case that particular patterns exist?

524
00:58:46,343 --> 00:58:53,783
It's the mechanisms part that I mentioned at the top of the hour. Population Health Focuses on research findings.

525
00:58:54,163 --> 00:59:04,972
Those are heavy emphasis on research. I would argue that there are multiple ways of knowing, and so research is not the only way of knowing.

526
00:59:04,973 --> 00:59:13,133
But in population health, data science, the emphasis is on studies, research despite their limitations.

527
00:59:14,243 --> 00:59:23,303
And the authors pointed out that usually when we think about population health, we're thinking about a specific geographic region or a population.

528
00:59:23,833 --> 00:59:30,983
Is probably a review for most of you as the book and as this class focuses on US populations.

529
00:59:31,313 --> 00:59:41,243
But there's tremendous variability within the US and we know that parents may look similar or different if we're looking at global populations.

530
00:59:41,723 --> 00:59:47,993
Last thing I want to add before we go on is that not only are we looking at outcomes,

531
00:59:48,593 --> 00:59:55,463
not only are we looking at determinants, but how do we translate?

532
00:59:56,613 --> 00:59:59,853
What we know into action, into intervention.

533
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:04,383
Okay. So as we go through this course and we're talking about population health,

534
01:00:04,773 --> 01:00:09,963
what I want to be at the forefront of your mind is not just outcomes and disparities.

535
01:00:10,383 --> 01:00:16,173
We can talk about those for days on end, but what are the determinants,

536
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:23,973
what are the action steps that can be taken given the mechanisms or explanations or processes?

537
01:00:24,843 --> 01:00:27,543
And what are the policies that that matter? Okay.

538
01:00:28,623 --> 01:00:37,473
The next couple of slides, just so different representations of that, this is a graphic representation in journal entry number one.

539
01:00:37,473 --> 01:00:40,983
Last year, a lot of people commented on this graphic.

540
01:00:40,983 --> 01:00:47,642
They said, Oh, I think this is great, but oh, I don't understand why there's five arrows and this arrow doesn't make sense, etc.

541
01:00:47,643 --> 01:00:53,522
So just to give you an idea of a general response, this population health,

542
01:00:53,523 --> 01:01:01,103
if you click on the link, basically says policies and programs cause the determinants, okay.

543
01:01:02,193 --> 01:01:07,473
And the determinants that lead to the outcomes that give examples of each.

544
01:01:07,773 --> 01:01:14,613
Okay. I think someone in their journal entry said, I don't understand how policies and programs cause determinants.

545
01:01:14,613 --> 01:01:19,983
I think they've got it wrong. What I think causes the determinants is okay.

546
01:01:19,993 --> 01:01:25,172
And so again, an example of being critical as I show you things in class,

547
01:01:25,173 --> 01:01:31,833
you don't want to just take it at face value, but think about how you might change it and make it different.

548
01:01:32,163 --> 01:01:37,203
Okay, you post here and see if there are any questions. It's pretty straightforward, I think.

549
01:01:37,563 --> 01:01:50,413
Okay. All right. So that's population health outcomes, distribution within a group, action mechanisms, explanations, etc. Hopefully a review.

550
01:01:51,293 --> 01:01:54,913
A health disparity according to healthy people.

551
01:01:54,913 --> 01:02:04,932
2030 follows this definition. It's a health difference that's closely linked with social, economic or environmental disadvantage.

552
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:13,873
Okay, so again, like the population health definition, it's arguing that there are these determinants and that they're social in nature.

553
01:02:14,533 --> 01:02:25,573
One of the criticisms that you saw in the reading is that population health distinguishes itself by focusing,

554
01:02:26,173 --> 01:02:35,233
moving beyond the individual level and individual explanations of the social factors that lead to these disparities are really important.

555
01:02:35,233 --> 01:02:38,292
That's why we're here. That's what we're going to talk about yet.

556
01:02:38,293 --> 01:02:50,022
And still, as we think about COVID 19 disparities, as we think about, you know, disparities between groups, there's been this observation.

557
01:02:50,023 --> 01:02:56,983
There was an article in The New York Times a week or two ago talking about how mask wearing is.

558
01:02:57,433 --> 01:03:02,023
You know, if only people would wear their masks, we would be in a much better position.

559
01:03:02,023 --> 01:03:05,922
And there was no discussion of all of the social factors.

560
01:03:05,923 --> 01:03:12,493
And one of the problems with that analysis is that it links the disparities to individual behavior.

561
01:03:12,553 --> 01:03:17,203
Okay. Individual behavior may play a role, but it's complex.

562
01:03:17,623 --> 01:03:22,213
And oftentimes these pieces that appear in places like The New York Times are an

563
01:03:22,213 --> 01:03:27,373
oversimplification that lead people to further blame individuals or think that,

564
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:31,993
oh, well, if people would just wear their masks, we would be fine.

565
01:03:32,023 --> 01:03:35,563
Okay. So I want to call that out.

566
01:03:36,373 --> 01:03:41,772
What appears on the next couple of slides are just examples of different disparities.

567
01:03:41,773 --> 01:03:49,183
So I'm going to read them one at a time. And there is an exercise we may not be able to get to in class today.

568
01:03:49,903 --> 01:03:54,853
That is to think about why these disparities exist.

569
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:59,383
Okay, so as I go through them, I want you to start thinking about that.

570
01:03:59,383 --> 01:04:02,733
We're not going to. Tackle that right now. Okay.

571
01:04:03,183 --> 01:04:11,133
So example one, those are the high school degree or less experienced and escalating mortality rate 1999 to 2013,

572
01:04:11,763 --> 01:04:16,173
especially for women relative to those with more education.

573
01:04:16,213 --> 01:04:19,743
Okay. So we're going to be talking about different economic factors.

574
01:04:20,043 --> 01:04:25,293
Notice there's an intersectional effect here in terms of women being more impacted.

575
01:04:25,623 --> 01:04:29,043
Why is the rhetorical question for now?

576
01:04:30,073 --> 01:04:35,463
African-Americans live nearly four years shorter than whites on average.

577
01:04:37,503 --> 01:04:42,813
A very striking analogy 83,000 African American lives each year discrepancy.

578
01:04:42,813 --> 01:04:53,613
And so they make this point in terms of imagery. Imagine of a plane, passenger plane crashing every day for the entire year of African-Americans.

579
01:04:53,943 --> 01:04:59,123
That's the number of people that we lose because of the disparities between the groups.

580
01:04:59,163 --> 01:05:04,083
Okay. And of course, this number looks different for different groups.

581
01:05:04,083 --> 01:05:09,273
But as I've noted, we've tended to pay attention to blacks and whites.

582
01:05:09,453 --> 01:05:16,023
Okay. The next bullet shows that black, white Native American disparities also are quite prominent.

583
01:05:16,773 --> 01:05:21,303
When we look at life expectancy, mental health, substance use, some of these kinds of things.

584
01:05:21,573 --> 01:05:27,423
Okay. Let's look at a couple more examples here. Many of you probably know, but some may not.

585
01:05:27,453 --> 01:05:35,672
Hispanics actually have Hispanics a longer life expectancy than whites, African-Americans.

586
01:05:35,673 --> 01:05:39,543
That is a health disparity. It's a disparity between two groups.

587
01:05:40,233 --> 01:05:42,633
But the rate of age or disability.

588
01:05:43,143 --> 01:05:52,112
So mental and physical impairments that disrupt ability to engage in society and live your life are more prominent for Hispanics,

589
01:05:52,113 --> 01:06:02,613
so that even though they're living longer, the quality of life, particularly towards the end of life, is lower quality than it is for other groups.

590
01:06:02,643 --> 01:06:06,153
So is living longer a good thing? Question mark.

591
01:06:06,183 --> 01:06:12,873
Okay. Why would it be the case that Hispanics are living longer than whites?

592
01:06:13,263 --> 01:06:18,123
We're going to get into this in a couple of weeks, but I want you to think about why that might be the case.

593
01:06:19,173 --> 01:06:27,553
And yet their disability is higher. OC Women tend to experience more health problems but live longer than men.

594
01:06:27,573 --> 01:06:34,173
So the question here why do women experience more health problems but yet still live longer?

595
01:06:34,473 --> 01:06:38,533
Hey, be curious about some reasons why you think that could be the case.

596
01:06:39,273 --> 01:06:47,013
And then region, we know that some of you in your survey said we really want to get to know about rural versus urban differences.

597
01:06:47,673 --> 01:06:55,833
The article that you read in terms of covered death rates talked about differences in rural versus urban communities.

598
01:06:56,493 --> 01:07:03,543
But notice that in some states, Virginia and Vermont, the health outcomes look like high income countries,

599
01:07:03,933 --> 01:07:09,783
whereas places like West Virginia and Kentucky, the health outcomes are further behind.

600
01:07:09,813 --> 01:07:14,473
Okay, a lot further behind. And so what are the reasons that that's the case?

601
01:07:14,493 --> 01:07:23,223
It is rural, rurality versus urban. This city plays a role in that access to medical care providers, as you saw in the article.

602
01:07:24,843 --> 01:07:27,453
Even the training, we didn't talk about that explicitly.

603
01:07:28,053 --> 01:07:35,973
Justice of the Peace have to take like a two hour training on death versus medical examiners who have more formal training.

604
01:07:37,173 --> 01:07:46,383
All right. A couple more disparity examples. Gay and lesbian respondents are more likely than straight respondents to be current.

605
01:07:46,383 --> 01:07:56,523
Smokers consume five or more alcoholic drinks and one day at least once and experience serious psychological distress in past year.

606
01:07:56,643 --> 01:08:06,753
Okay. So again, the rhetorical question here, why would LGBTQ populations be experiencing or using more substances?

607
01:08:07,173 --> 01:08:12,363
What about that experience would lead people to use more substances?

608
01:08:13,033 --> 01:08:17,823
And similarly, extending for transgender individuals.

609
01:08:18,213 --> 01:08:20,133
The studies are actually mixed here,

610
01:08:20,733 --> 01:08:28,773
but a number of studies have documented transgender people as having higher rates of mental health problems, psychological distress.

611
01:08:28,833 --> 01:08:38,103
Okay. I wanted to be careful. Some people make a blanket statement that all LGBT people have higher psychological distress.

612
01:08:38,523 --> 01:08:43,713
There have been a number of studies that actually have found that there isn't a discrepancy.

613
01:08:44,403 --> 01:08:51,093
And so trying to understand why the studies don't agree is a current question in the research literature.

614
01:08:52,023 --> 01:08:59,463
Okay. Bisexual respondents rates of distress are double that of other sexual identities.

615
01:09:00,183 --> 01:09:07,353
They have higher rates of suicidal ideation, risky alcohol and drug use, higher obesity, etc.

616
01:09:07,723 --> 01:09:20,823
Okay, these trends that have been found in studies are much more complex now as we think about how our definitions of gender identity have expanded,

617
01:09:21,723 --> 01:09:27,153
even how we define sexual identity, there's often a simplification in terms of gay, straight,

618
01:09:27,153 --> 01:09:37,893
etc. But the landscape in terms of how people define themselves is much larger now than it has been when some of these studies were conducted.

619
01:09:38,113 --> 01:09:41,723
Okay. So food for thought here. Why are these trends?

620
01:09:41,733 --> 01:09:51,813
Is the question black, pregnant and postpartum people have a pregnancy related mortality ratio that is 3 to 4 times that of white counterparts.

621
01:09:51,843 --> 01:09:57,273
Okay. Some of you mentioned last Wednesday interest in maternal mortality,

622
01:09:57,273 --> 01:10:07,083
thinking about the mortality rates of pregnant people and postpartum also infant mortality as well.

623
01:10:07,893 --> 01:10:15,573
And so, again, rhetorical question, what are some of the reasons for these different disparities?

624
01:10:16,743 --> 01:10:21,073
Okay, let me see where we are on time. Ten past. Okay.

625
01:10:21,233 --> 01:10:26,363
We often don't talk about health disparities for persons with disabilities.

626
01:10:27,293 --> 01:10:32,363
Again, in the slide notes, you'll see some examples of various disabilities.

627
01:10:32,393 --> 01:10:35,693
We often think about physical disability.

628
01:10:36,353 --> 01:10:41,093
If you click on the link, you'll see the American Disabilities Association's their definition.

629
01:10:41,573 --> 01:10:47,213
Really thinking about not only physical impairment, but mental impairment as well.

630
01:10:47,303 --> 01:10:52,013
Okay, concentration. Thinking, social interactions.

631
01:10:52,463 --> 01:10:58,223
Any sort of impairment that leads to difficulty in activities in life.

632
01:10:58,223 --> 01:11:01,913
Integrating with society can be thought of as a disability.

633
01:11:01,913 --> 01:11:04,613
And some of these things are visible. Some are not okay.

634
01:11:04,973 --> 01:11:12,353
As you can see from this chart, when you compare people without disabilities to people with disabilities, these are large bucket categories.

635
01:11:12,743 --> 01:11:17,643
You see that there are differences in terms of some of the things we think of as social determinants of health.

636
01:11:17,663 --> 01:11:23,213
Unemployed, victims of crime, obesity, smoking, etc.

637
01:11:23,813 --> 01:11:30,653
So in the same way that I asked you to think about why these disparities exist and I want

638
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:35,513
some nuance here there may be some things that cut across the different disparities,

639
01:11:35,963 --> 01:11:39,563
but there may be also things that are unique to different populations.

640
01:11:40,043 --> 01:11:50,663
Why would it be the case that individuals who are persons with disabilities, again, a large group, have higher social determinants,

641
01:11:50,903 --> 01:11:59,573
poorer health outcomes and higher things that we know are related to health outcomes, like unemployment, for example.

642
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:09,193
Okay. These next couple of charts, in the interest of time, I'm not going to go into a lot of detail.

643
01:12:10,033 --> 01:12:15,433
They're just COVID 19 charts that show disparities in different racial groups.

644
01:12:15,883 --> 01:12:22,093
One thing that I want to point out for technicality purposes, when you talk about a disparity,

645
01:12:22,573 --> 01:12:27,003
make sure that there is a comparison between two or more groups.

646
01:12:27,013 --> 01:12:37,753
Okay? Sometimes people say life expect mortality rates increased for that age group, 45 to 64 from 1999 to 2013.

647
01:12:38,173 --> 01:12:42,493
That's not a disparity because technically you haven't made a comparison.

648
01:12:42,493 --> 01:12:45,403
It's not a difference relative to another group. Okay.

649
01:12:46,003 --> 01:12:57,133
So this chart here is just showing different rates of COVID incidence, people who had COVID 19 and the average rates per 100,000.

650
01:12:57,463 --> 01:13:01,423
And you'll notice. So the dotted line shows you the average for the group.

651
01:13:02,023 --> 01:13:09,373
Notice that the lines are not all in the same place. The line for black people is much higher than for the other groups.

652
01:13:10,273 --> 01:13:13,063
If you look at people who died from COVID,

653
01:13:13,543 --> 01:13:19,873
it's a little harder to tell the lines actually in the beginning of the pandemic look pretty close to one another.

654
01:13:20,653 --> 01:13:27,513
But look at the population health, looks at the distribution across the population.

655
01:13:27,523 --> 01:13:35,053
So if you look at people who are older, you see that there is greater variation,

656
01:13:35,533 --> 01:13:42,253
even though the mean line for the group shows that the rates at which people were dying were pretty similar.

657
01:13:43,573 --> 01:13:48,113
That looks a little bit different, although the shape of the graph is the same for all of the groups.

658
01:13:48,183 --> 01:13:51,673
Okay, so it matters what outcome you're looking at.

659
01:13:52,453 --> 01:14:00,223
Again, there's not a specific comparison in each individual quadrant to another group,

660
01:14:00,643 --> 01:14:07,663
but we can kind of do our own analysis by eye and notice that the lines overall are similar.

661
01:14:07,873 --> 01:14:20,513
Okay. The last chart is actually a disparity chart formally because it compares on the left side the rates of COVID to whites.

662
01:14:20,533 --> 01:14:26,653
Okay. So one represents there's no difference between whites and the group.

663
01:14:27,133 --> 01:14:36,583
If the line for the average becomes above one, that means that relative to whites, there's a higher incidence of COVID on the left.

664
01:14:36,913 --> 01:14:42,133
And then these are the death rates. On on the right hand side.

665
01:14:42,163 --> 01:14:54,073
So again, you can see that Latino group in terms of people dying for COVID, their average is below that of whites,

666
01:14:54,313 --> 01:14:58,903
at least at this point, the snapshot, whereas for other groups, that's not the case.

667
01:14:59,013 --> 01:15:05,503
Okay. So again, just an example of what disparities look like.

668
01:15:06,853 --> 01:15:11,663
Okay. Before I spend a few minutes on social determinants of health.

669
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:16,383
Any questions or comments on disparities?

670
01:15:20,353 --> 01:15:26,903
Okay. Social determinants of health are what we're going to be talking about for the primary remainder of the course.

671
01:15:26,923 --> 01:15:33,453
Okay. So I'm not going to go into a lot of detail. You all have heard these definitions time and time again in 200 and probably other.

672
01:15:33,553 --> 01:15:37,963
Every other class you take. In the circumstances in which people live and work.

673
01:15:38,863 --> 01:15:42,103
Conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age.

674
01:15:42,553 --> 01:15:45,783
I've always found these definitions very unsatisfying.

675
01:15:45,793 --> 01:15:48,403
I feel like they don't really tell us a whole lot.

676
01:15:49,783 --> 01:15:59,083
And so part of our job this semester is to unpack what do we mean by conditions, circumstances, etc. The causes of the causes.

677
01:15:59,093 --> 01:16:05,683
When we did the thing fair share activity, one of the things people said is it's not just about,

678
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:11,803
you know, the reason people die may be heart disease, it may be high cholesterol.

679
01:16:12,313 --> 01:16:21,673
But social determinants of health is about getting at things like affordability of food, the availability of food.

680
01:16:21,823 --> 01:16:25,843
Okay. So someone might have high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease.

681
01:16:26,563 --> 01:16:36,013
But social determinants of health is about getting at the reasons that undergird why that person is eating fatty foods in the first place.

682
01:16:36,173 --> 01:16:40,413
Okay. Okay.

683
01:16:40,423 --> 01:16:46,833
This is the model will be using as we go through the class healthy people 2010 and 2030 and that you've seen.

684
01:16:47,403 --> 01:16:54,753
We will start off after the first couple of weeks in the economic stability and move through the other.

685
01:16:57,863 --> 01:17:07,053
Parts of the chart throughout the semester. These are different ways that healthy people 2030 has gotten more specific

686
01:17:07,053 --> 01:17:11,353
about what they mean by each of the different kind of parts around the circle.

687
01:17:12,213 --> 01:17:18,273
And these are the things again, I'm not going to spend a lot of time here that we'll be talking about throughout the semester.

688
01:17:18,303 --> 01:17:28,953
I just wanted you to see some examples. There are some things like digital divide in technology that don't fit very well in terms of the model.

689
01:17:29,283 --> 01:17:31,773
But we're trying to expand thinking, okay.

690
01:17:32,313 --> 01:17:39,063
One of the things we're going to be doing on Wednesday is looking at current models of social determinants of health and

691
01:17:39,063 --> 01:17:46,593
thinking about what things are missing from the current models and what can we do to enhance or improve the models.

692
01:17:47,073 --> 01:17:50,013
Digital divide in technology is one such area to think about.

693
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:57,512
I'm very happy to report that we have a guest speaker coming in April to talk to us about health care informatics,

694
01:17:57,513 --> 01:18:04,443
some of the bias in artificial intelligence, so on and so forth, and how that relates to health care disparities.

695
01:18:05,573 --> 01:18:09,232
Okay. These are the topics we'll go through with the social determinants of mental health.

696
01:18:09,233 --> 01:18:12,803
I have more to say about these on Wednesday and then.

697
01:18:14,623 --> 01:18:20,773
A couple of things. I'm going to skip these two sides. I'll start with these on Wednesday, but don't pack up yet.

698
01:18:22,663 --> 01:18:27,012
These talk a little bit about the biology. I know there's a lot of pre-med students in our class,

699
01:18:27,013 --> 01:18:36,883
so we're going to talk about the mechanisms by which people the stress of the social context leads to health disparities.

700
01:18:36,883 --> 01:18:43,633
So we'll get into that on Wednesday. What I want to leave you with before we end is a thought exercise.

701
01:18:43,633 --> 01:18:52,723
We're not going to do it here in class, but I want you to think about it as you write your journals and as sort of post work for today's class,

702
01:18:53,353 --> 01:19:00,253
I want you to go through the disparities that I listed, select one or two of them that you find interesting.

703
01:19:01,543 --> 01:19:10,093
And I want you to jot down as many kind of explanations as you can for how we get from,

704
01:19:11,953 --> 01:19:19,783
say, LGBT identity to increased smoking, etc., increased psychological distress.

705
01:19:19,903 --> 01:19:25,872
Okay. And very informal draw a figure illustrating the pathway.

706
01:19:25,873 --> 01:19:30,373
How do we get so with arrows? Well, it starts with this leads to greater stress.

707
01:19:30,373 --> 01:19:33,193
Greater stress leads to this, etc.
