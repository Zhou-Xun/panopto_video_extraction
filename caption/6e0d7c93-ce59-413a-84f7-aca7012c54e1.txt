00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,915
After watching this video,

2
00:00:09,915 --> 00:00:11,790
you will be able to
describe when to

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,260
apply weights in
survey data analysis.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,600
Okay. So far, I used sampling

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,245
weights in all the block
surveys that I show you.

6
00:00:22,245 --> 00:00:25,560
But this is a little more
complicated than it looks like.

7
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,245
For descriptive
statistics, that is,

8
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,390
getting means and proportions,

9
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,955
you always have to apply weights.

10
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:36,030
Because otherwise, the
means and proportions won't

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,130
reflect well the
general population

12
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:40,095
where the sample is coming from.

13
00:00:40,095 --> 00:00:43,700
However, we're making
inference, for example,

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,655
integrations,

15
00:00:45,655 --> 00:00:49,440
to weigh or not to weigh,
that is the question.

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,265
In this situations,
you will have to

17
00:00:52,265 --> 00:00:55,490
ask because every
survey is different.

18
00:00:55,490 --> 00:00:57,710
For example, the DHS,

19
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,690
the Demographic and
Health Surveys,

20
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:02,000
completely discourage the use

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,980
of weights when making inference.

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,280
They clearly say
in their website,

23
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,080
"Use of sample weights
is appropriate when

24
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:12,050
representative levels of
statistics are desired,

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:14,170
such as percentages, means,

26
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:16,620
and medians", same
as I said before.

27
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,395
"Use of sample weights is

28
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:21,290
inappropriate for
estimating relationships,

29
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:24,370
such as regression and
correlation coefficients".

30
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:27,450
However, NHANES recommends using

31
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,525
weights even when doing
the regression analysis.

32
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:32,220
The Health and Retirement Study

33
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,290
also recommends using weights.

34
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:38,015
Again, ask. In summary,

35
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,500
in this video, we'll learn how to

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,825
apply weights in
survey data analysis.

37
00:01:41,825 --> 00:01:43,820
This is it for survey data.

38
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,395
In the next video, we will

39
00:01:45,395 --> 00:01:48,008
start our wrap up on the course.
