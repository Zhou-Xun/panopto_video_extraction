1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,310
You talking about your letters?

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:09,450
Thank you. Yeah. Oh, did you start there? I did.

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:12,680
Oh, you were. Thank you. Yep. All right. Hi, everybody.

4
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:17,220
How are you? It's good to see you again. Um, yeah.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,090
So how many of you have already written a cover letter before?

6
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:24,840
Okay, um, so the majority of you are. Maybe all of you.

7
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:35,069
So what do you remember about, um, cover letters, like their purposes, features, anything like that?

8
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:45,360
Just to build some prior knowledge before I. It sounds like before I do a review for you, what's the purpose or for the purposes of the cover letter?

9
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:56,440
Yeah. Go ahead and kind of give more insight into who you are and your skills deeper than what your resume can really show.

10
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:00,760
Yeah. You get more specific? Yeah, absolutely. Where were you raising your hands?

11
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:04,260
No, just touching her face. Yeah. Sorry.

12
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:16,460
Other purposes? Yeah, it's been a while, but if I remember, it was like, uh, just kind of tailoring your resume and yourself more to that position.

13
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:19,960
Yeah, but you were in that position. Yeah.

14
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:28,250
Yeah. So it's sort of like a two way. So it's like, this is why I'm good for you, but this is also how you might benefit from me.

15
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:33,020
Not maybe you, how you. The position will benefit from me too.

16
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:39,769
So it's a double argument. Yeah. So today we'll talk about cover letter features, which again, sounds like it'll be a review.

17
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:43,129
And then like the last time I was here, I have a sample cover letter.

18
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:51,470
This is a real cover letter from a public health professional that you'll analyze and I'll serve as a mentor,

19
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:57,380
text for your own cover letters, and you can think about the features and how they appear in this cover letter.

20
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:01,399
So yeah, so what should your cover letter accomplish?

21
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,430
And I will say ahead of time, most of the information on these slides are from the Purdue online writing lab.

22
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,110
I don't know if you're familiar with that source.

23
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:17,360
So I mean, yeah, so you can go there and find a lot of this information, but it's also available, the slide deck, I think, on your course canvas show.

24
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:24,980
So like you've already said, like you are showing that your cover letter is tailored to the position you want.

25
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:32,120
Like last time we talked about having sort of like a, a master resume that you then revise depending on the position you're applying for.

26
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:40,250
The same thing can work with a cover letter. I have one that features the information that is going to be appearing in our cover letters,

27
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,680
but then you can revise them based on the internship in this case that you were applying for,

28
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:55,010
just like you were saying over there that you're talking about your experiences that, uh, compliments your resume,

29
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:06,379
but you're going to go more into depth about that, how your experiences relate specifically to that position and then how it says employer.

30
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:15,080
But like you are showing whoever is reading your letter, how your specific skills are going to fulfill the internship position.

31
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:22,879
And then also because it's a piece of writing and demonstrates your communication skills even better than the resume,

32
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,660
because obviously you're using like complete sentences and things like that.

33
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:32,330
So it's both content and communication that you're demonstrating here.

34
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:41,600
So in a cover letter, there's different parts of it, just like other genres, and there's an introduction.

35
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,930
So you have a salutation to the best of your ability.

36
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:53,870
Um, find out the name of who is going to be reading your letter and say, Dear so-and-so, I like this.

37
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:02,809
This is on the Purdue owl. Like, if you don't know the person's gender, don't see Mr. or Mrs. or even Emacs use their full name.

38
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:05,510
So that was a good tip for me to be mindful of too.

39
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:12,559
You're seeing who you are while you're writing, which would be like What is the position that you're applying for,

40
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:19,820
how you learned about it and why you're interested in it? Just in a sentence, say what your educational and related background is.

41
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:28,760
If you have any contacts at the internship, I don't know. You can tell me if this is like, is that kosher for public health?

42
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:36,170
Like, I don't know this person at this internship or would it make sense to mention like any faculty or something like that then?

43
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:43,340
Okay, you know, especially if you learned about it through them or you talked with them before you apply.

44
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,559
Yeah, I think those are good things to mention. Yeah. So do some name dropping if you're able to.

45
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,190
Basically it's going to get the reader's attention for sure.

46
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:57,379
And that's what you want to do right off the bat. And then again in another sentence you want to say like,

47
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:06,350
why your values align and goals align with this internship that you're applying for in the organization where you have your internship.

48
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,989
And then you can again say like how you are a good match for the specific position.

49
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,360
And this is the introduction is sort of like a roadmap for what is going to come up in the body of

50
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:27,140
your essay and doing the front loading of the arguments that appear in the body of the letter.

51
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,120
I said essay sorry letter.

52
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:38,060
So just like we've already talked about, like how you're showing your readers that you are the best person for this position.

53
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:46,370
Look carefully at the organization and the details of the internship and highlight if it makes sense

54
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,709
to you or pull out the skills that they're looking for and make sure you hit on those skills.

55
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:59,960
In your letter, you can leave out extraneous information because are these letters like a page one or can they go into to a second page?

56
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,110
Typically I think, okay, yeah. So you're trying to fit a lot in obviously, and not a lot of space.

57
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,100
So you want.

58
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:18,640
To really make sure that you are carefully studying the internship goals and the organization and, and making a nice alignment between you and it.

59
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,150
Um, again, you're convincing your reader that the organization is going to benefit from hiring you.

60
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:29,270
I don't know if you're actually getting paid. Um. Um.

61
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:35,600
Include in each paragraph a strong reason why your employer should hire you or how they would benefit from the relationship.

62
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,790
So it's good to have, like, very clear general topic sentences like you do in an essay that could be about

63
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,640
a particular goal or something that the organization is looking for generally.

64
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:58,390
And then get detailed in the body of the paragraph of how your experiences and skills, um, meet that specific goal of the internship.

65
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,540
So again, you're really making a case for yourself.

66
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:08,650
Be personable, but, um, like, but, you know, formal, but you are selling yourself in multiple ways.

67
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:16,150
And so that personable aspect is do is it's more than just you have the skills for the job,

68
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:20,770
but are you somebody that they're going to want around and want to be working with, frankly?

69
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:26,860
Um, and again, these two documents, the resume and the cover letter are working together.

70
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:33,700
Um, so you, you're using the resume and you're sort of expanding on the points in your resume in the cover letter.

71
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:43,899
Um, but you want to make sure you're not using the exact same language and, and maybe you're being even more selective in the cover letter of,

72
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:49,720
um, which of those skills that appear on the resume that you're going to go more into depth on.

73
00:07:51,850 --> 00:08:01,240
And then for the closing again re reiterate why you are a good fit, how your goals and the organization's goals are aligned.

74
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:10,210
Um, including the skills that you have and the experiences that will help the organization achieve these goals.

75
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:16,660
Include your contact information and thank the readers for their consideration.

76
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:24,400
I don't know if it's again like kosher for people to say like, I will be following up with you at a certain point.

77
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:29,050
I've never done that. Yeah, I maybe that's outdated, but yeah.

78
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,080
Just let, let them get in contact with you.

79
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:42,460
I would say so. Um, any questions about these different features of the cover letter at this moment?

80
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,890
Okay, so I'm going to send around two pieces of paper.

81
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:59,200
One is, um, is a file on canvas in your course, um, that has like tips, um, writing a cover letter and then, um, uh, sorry.

82
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,380
And then the other one is the sample cover letter.

83
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:14,980
And so if you can take a look at the tips paper handout and the cover letter, if you want to access the slide deck, you can do that too.

84
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:25,480
And again, like last time, see how the cover letter is achieving these goals of the, um, of what the cover letter genre is.

85
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:30,640
Could the author of this cover letter done anything different?

86
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:44,290
Um, yeah. So, and then we'll come together and sort of talk about the successes or places, the, uh, improvement or the cover letter.

87
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:48,670
And then by all means, speak, talk to each other. If you want to work by yourself, you can do that too.

88
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,630
And if I don't have enough copies, then you have to share with me.

89
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,720
Oh yeah. There's plenty of copies of the.

90
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:03,190
Yeah, so feel free to review it.

91
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,209
Talk to your neighbors. Yeah, you can write on it too.

92
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:12,070
These are for you to keep if you want it working properly.

93
00:10:23,030 --> 00:11:01,030
And I'll come around and I'll. Did you want?

94
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:10,800
I. Oh, don't talk like me.

95
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,390
So what? We're.

96
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:44,390
Maybe like two more minutes. We can relax.

97
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:54,630
I. Yeah.

98
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,920
I really think that's what he was talking about. Schools during the school day.

99
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:33,190
It's interesting. You know, I.

100
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:44,070
Happy about to have the things you just.

101
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:00,920
Okay. So let's talk about this letter systematically.

102
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:12,590
Meaning, let's start with the introduction. So what what is happening in the introduction and what is successful or what may be?

103
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,670
Would you provide feedback on. I'm just going to take a step back.

104
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:21,710
Yeah. What do you think about the introduction? Let's start with what is successful.

105
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,860
How did they achieve key features of the introduction?

106
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,930
Yeah. They would tell you explicitly which position and then.

107
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:56,960
Yeah. Right from the beginning. Yep. Mm hmm. I thought the bullet was pretty effective that summer.

108
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:01,610
Mhm. Yeah. I've never seen that before but it does.

109
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:07,970
Yeah. Yeah. It's like this person part like I've heard that because that's how they attach it on the left.

110
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:12,110
Mhm. That would be to include more of it.

111
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:21,469
Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Oh I really think they have like the last minute period realize they're like keeping to it.

112
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:27,480
So uh, in that case they would need to describe what those products were a little bit more than whereas.

113
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,740
Mhm. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Almost look like we're assuming bullets.

114
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:36,050
Yeah. So it makes sense that they had to see the other guy. Mhm.

115
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:42,370
Yeah. And then since civvies are longer and you know I, you know,

116
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,299
I don't know how often search committees are like looking line by line, especially if it's really long.

117
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:53,450
And so then this is an opportunity to pull the key things from a CV and like Plunkett and this cover letter to highlight them.

118
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,470
Yeah. Or is a resume you can like scan it a lot more quickly. Yeah. Really good point.

119
00:17:57,590 --> 00:18:03,150
Before I saw that they like I see later it was like I was like, oh, this gets rid of it.

120
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:06,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that's, it's a, that's a really good point.

121
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:13,160
Yeah. To think about how your professional documents are complementing each other and speaking across each other.

122
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:19,730
Yeah. And when you make a different decision, depending on the professional documents that you're submitting for a position.

123
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,150
Yeah. Other things that are successful about the introduction that you want to touch on.

124
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:43,540
I mean, are they sort of summarizing their skills and experiences very briefly to say how it's a match with the particular position?

125
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,500
I think so. Um. Okay.

126
00:18:53,460 --> 00:19:00,090
Um, anything you would suggest that this writer do in the introduction?

127
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:08,220
I mean, I don't have a position description that would be really useful so we could know how it matched.

128
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:17,640
Um. That's a note for self for next time. But, you know, imagining what this position is inside a university.

129
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:24,630
Um. Anything. Yeah, that you would suggest the student, the student, the applicant do.

130
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:32,220
Okay, we can move on to the body so that this would be like for the last six years,

131
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,060
um, you know, the three paragraphs that come after the bulleted list.

132
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:43,800
Um, so looking at the body of the letter and the argument, um, up here, but also on the handout I gave you.

133
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:49,740
What is the applicant doing successfully in their cover letter?

134
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:08,970
What what are the skills they seem to be highlighting in the three paragraphs?

135
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:26,740
I'm noticing a valuation and then they have specific examples of where they have used a valuation.

136
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:36,790
And then in the penultimate paragraph, talking about cultural humility would be the other skill,

137
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:40,959
I would say, and then they provide specific examples about that.

138
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,190
So that's something to think about.

139
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:52,170
Like, again, what are the, the, the goals or the values or the practices that it seems like the position is really prioritizing?

140
00:20:52,330 --> 00:20:54,610
How can you pull out two or three of those?

141
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:07,930
So maybe again, evaluation and cultural humility appeared in the job position description or maybe the applicant sort of like inferred that,

142
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:11,530
oh, cultural humility seems like it would be important. So I'm going to highlight that.

143
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,870
And what's also interesting about that paragraph is the applicant was like, well,

144
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:23,860
it seems like they have not worked with indigenous populations before in their research with colleagues they have.

145
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,580
And so they're like, I'm going to make this work somehow though.

146
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:32,889
So then it's also thinking about I don't have the exact experience that they're looking for where

147
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:39,160
there's some adjacent experiment experience and can I like make an argument and a connection between,

148
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:45,910
in this case, working with folks with disabilities and indigenous communities?

149
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:50,860
I feel like that could backfire sometimes. Do I kind of have questions about this?

150
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:57,370
But again, they're highlighting cultural humility and trying to make the argument of how these experiences,

151
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:06,640
the past experiences, can relate to working with this future population for the specific position.

152
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:13,450
Oh yeah, go for it. So are are these examples of people who got the job that they're applying for?

153
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,389
That's a good question. So I got this from a friend of mine who was on the search committee for this position,

154
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:24,340
and I didn't think to ask her if this was the person who got the job.

155
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,940
I can I can get back to Rebecca about that and let you know, though.

156
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,840
Yeah. What made you ask that? Just wondering how successful it was.

157
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:37,240
Like, if this works, then that seems like, okay, that could be a route that they could go.

158
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,640
But if this totally backfired, like we don't know. Yeah, know the outcome, then I guess we can know.

159
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:47,830
But then you that I, I also think it's a roll of the dice scenario.

160
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,940
Yeah. Kind of people who are like oh yeah that really works.

161
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:58,659
And you have the strengths that we're looking for in other areas versus like if there's just a stronger candidate who has that experience,

162
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:02,170
it's going to be really obvious. MM that you don't.

163
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:09,730
And I think it can be like depending on the context it's a more risky thing than others because like,

164
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,360
because this is like a so-called soft skill, like cultural humility.

165
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:23,850
I feel like maybe if it was like a technical skill or a different type of interpersonal soft skill, it would be less risky to make this connection.

166
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:32,139
Or because you're talking about different types of marginalized communities where it's like, Should you be making this connection?

167
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,700
Yeah, I think it is. It can be risky. So it is interesting to see it here.

168
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,779
Um, yeah. Oh, you had a question.

169
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,239
Others you know the question comment on that.

170
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:50,140
I thought it was also interesting the language they use because American Indian well used in government context of like considered like outdated.

171
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,330
Yeah. Mm. Like busy.

172
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:58,870
But like the job is also for indigenous health. And so I thought it's interesting they continue to use the term American.

173
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:04,960
Yeah. Native and not. Yeah. No one reflects the job language.

174
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,300
Yeah yeah, yeah, yeah. Really good point. Yeah.

175
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:13,240
Excellence. Um, and I do think one thing that I notice is that everyone kind of,

176
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:17,110
there was some people jumping out of that saying like, these are the skills that were highlighted.

177
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,240
How did you feel about the topic sentences? MM Were they specific?

178
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:28,810
Did they really like if you scan this and you're going through 1,000,001 read this amazing cover letters,

179
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,870
did you get what this person is trying to say easily?

180
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,190
I think the evaluation stands out better.

181
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,330
But then my gut like the for that penultimate paragraph.

182
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,410
Sorry, I'm answering your question. I'm not letting your second and third time. Yeah, okay.

183
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:54,070
But in the penultimate paragraph, that skill is buried for sure.

184
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:59,020
Yeah. Sorry. And anything else Rebecca wanted to point out?

185
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:04,760
No, I just, i, i it's frustrating because it seems like the person has a lot of really good experience.

186
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:10,089
It just wasn't necessarily framed in the best way. Yeah, but maybe that was regardless.

187
00:25:10,090 --> 00:25:14,320
And I got the job. Yeah. I will get back to you so that there's this mystery only solved for all of us.

188
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,150
Yeah. I mean, yeah, topic sentences especially.

189
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:28,570
I mean, always been something like Rebecca's thing where it's been scanned along with like who knows how many other ones are really critical.

190
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:31,210
When I was writing cover letters when I went on the job market.

191
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:38,020
Like that was feedback I got from my readers was like, Use those topics sentences to your advantage.

192
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:46,299
So yeah, they're really important. Um, I feel like, well, that we don't encourage you to write like you're writing that like fifth grade.

193
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:53,390
Yeah. So yeah, like cover letters are the place where you like go back to that exact like topics and then it's important to the board.

194
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,160
Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. Go back to the five paragraph essay for the cover letters.

195
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:05,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. And then for the conclusion, what do you guys think about the conclusion?

196
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:19,260
I always feel awkward being like I have demonstrated to you.

197
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,920
Mm hmm. Um.

198
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:30,870
I don't know, but still like that. Like, I understand why it makes sense to do that, but we, like, get it in that way.

199
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:38,040
But do you, um. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. The way to word it is kind of, uh, weird.

200
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:45,330
I mean, I think you should be, again, like, you're selling yourself the entire time, so don't be afraid of being feeling.

201
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,440
Maybe you're like, I sound like I'm bragging, but it's like, nope, go, go with that.

202
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,720
And, um, and while also sounding like you're somebody that they are going to want to work with.

203
00:26:55,470 --> 00:27:02,820
But yeah, that is weird language. As you can see for me, I don't like that first sentence at all actually, because it's just really vague.

204
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:07,890
And again, this would be a moment to be like, these are the goals and values you have.

205
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,630
This is where I also agree with you. So just being a lot more specific.

206
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:22,049
So it's a placeholder sentence, but I would be specific with each position that you're applying for and I really,

207
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,230
really hate the phrase, as you can see. Yeah. Just not sure.

208
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:29,830
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

209
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:38,549
Did you have another comment? Oh, yeah. I'm just kind of thinking going through this whole thing about just the tone in general.

210
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:45,510
And it just especially with this last paragraph, it feels a little bit more just cut and dry and less like I'm telling myself.

211
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:53,430
But I think I would be a great candidate because and I don't know how much of your like personal skill or personality you should highlight in it.

212
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:59,820
Like, I'd be a good fit because I'm bringing this to the table, pretty much table as opposed by like from what you can see.

213
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:07,340
I'm just wondering like what is the balance between kind of how this last part is cut and dry and how personable you should be with?

214
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:16,200
But yeah, I mean, I think being personable while like still hitting these like bullet points is, is the way to go.

215
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,629
So, yeah, I looked sort of briefly at the canvas files.

216
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:27,270
I don't know, I think immediately see like a another cover letter, which is why I printed this one out.

217
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:34,770
But I don't know if they're looking at other mentor text or it's like these are strong examples of um, yeah, but,

218
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:42,599
but looking at successful cover, whether it were ones that we know were successful will be a good practice for you as, as well.

219
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:48,239
So I do think that this last paragraph reads or something that they, they didn't know how to finish.

220
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,860
Mm. And so they just kind of you know, put in a couple of summaries I think.

221
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:56,520
Yeah. Mhm. And um, they could have ended stronger.

222
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:03,890
Yeah. Mm. Yeah. So if we were gambling people, maybe we would, um, gamble.

223
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,520
They did not get the position. But I will, um, or cover letter.

224
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:14,009
No, but I get a lot stronger, you know, they have good, good, like relevant skill.

225
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:20,430
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they do generally follow like this is where you doing an intro, the body and the conclusion.

226
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:28,020
But yeah, just putting it alongside other cover letters and yeah, I, I don't know what happened, so I'll let you know.

227
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:37,110
Um, any questions that you guys have about cover letters that you'd like to ask for or more comments?

228
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:47,980
Anything that you'd like to you.

229
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:54,270
No, no. Okay. Well, it was a pleasure seeing you all again.

230
00:29:54,290 --> 00:30:01,700
I hope that we see you in Sweetland in some capacity, either online or in the office soon.

231
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:11,090
Um. Yeah. And good luck writing your own professional documents and the internships in your master's program.

232
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,450
And while I'm on a roll the rest of your life, I don't know.

233
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:19,760
Um, no, but thank you. Thanks for the opportunity.

234
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,900
You think you could. Everyone, please. Thank you, Dr. Tyler.

235
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:24,440
Thank you.
