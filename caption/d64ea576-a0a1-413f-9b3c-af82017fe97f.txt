1
00:00:02,054 --> 00:00:09,314
Very happy to see you here. We have 18 of the 20 enrolled, so I'm going to go ahead and get us ticked off.

2
00:00:10,214 --> 00:00:14,804
And I am Marie O'Neill. I use be her pronouns.

3
00:00:14,804 --> 00:00:24,433
I was just sharing that. I've been at this university since 2005 and I'm actually jointly appointed Captain Epidemiology,

4
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:33,763
Health and Environmental Health Sciences because of the nature of the work that I do, which includes research on climate change,

5
00:00:33,764 --> 00:00:41,204
impacts on health, including some community based work that Adriana has been part of since she's been here,

6
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:51,373
as well as some research using data from Mexico City, a cohort of pregnant women with the focus on air pollution.

7
00:00:51,374 --> 00:01:01,014
So I am very happy to be part of the global health faculty and this course is the Capstone Seminar.

8
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:04,124
Obviously, you all are in your second your second term.

9
00:01:04,634 --> 00:01:13,664
So for today, as I mentioned in the announcement, I just want to go over the basic structure of the course.

10
00:01:13,664 --> 00:01:18,134
And then for me, most importantly, the self introductions.

11
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:24,084
I'd like to hear from you and I have some guidance on on that the technology check.

12
00:01:24,664 --> 00:01:32,834
I think we're all set with that. It's it's the idea is that this will be an in-person course.

13
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:40,464
It will be recorded on Panopto. So if people have to miss, they'll be able to catch up by watching that.

14
00:01:42,294 --> 00:01:47,783
And then I'm going to talk about the course plans and just give you a basic outline of what that is.

15
00:01:47,784 --> 00:01:51,354
And then we'll start with the self introductions with the prompts.

16
00:01:52,224 --> 00:01:56,244
I also like to have a break at nine. Just 2 hours is a long time.

17
00:01:57,924 --> 00:02:06,174
Nothing else to stretch. Stand up. And then we'll also talk further about planning for future weeks and idea

18
00:02:06,174 --> 00:02:12,654
exchanges and we'll kind of see why that is relevant after I give an overview.

19
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:17,754
All right. So teaching team, you've met me.

20
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:22,734
We also have a course librarian. Have any of you met Preet?

21
00:02:24,424 --> 00:02:28,774
Has she been, of course, librarian for other courses. Okay.

22
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:34,004
Which like five or six? Is this our first? I don't know. In the class, it was like.

23
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:40,574
Yeah. Back when we, um. Well, it was like a intro to international health.

24
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:46,654
Okay. So you have heard from her and hopefully now that she's not full and she's available.

25
00:02:47,464 --> 00:02:50,614
Have any of you avail yourselves of her?

26
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:57,434
Support since then. Transfer to the library.

27
00:02:57,804 --> 00:03:01,054
What's it called? Goodbye. Yes, she does, as I said.

28
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:10,353
That's really helpful. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, she and I have spoken, and she will continue to be available to our group.

29
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:19,554
And in fact, on the campus site, there's a library tools which has hopefully the tools probably that she's presented to you.

30
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:30,654
And then we have Sasha, who's a second year, uh, general AP student, who will just be available for course development support.

31
00:03:30,654 --> 00:03:37,374
And some of you may have met Sasha. And then I wanted to just highlight this.

32
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:46,854
Have all of you made your way to the only website where you have the assignments and everything?

33
00:03:46,944 --> 00:03:57,263
Okay. If not, I encourage you to do so, because even if you're fine with your main advisor, there are structures here.

34
00:03:57,264 --> 00:04:03,894
And the reason I'm bringing it up now is that when I spoke with Sasha, she she's working on her.

35
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:09,304
I was not familiar with it. And I think it's because the, you know,

36
00:04:09,354 --> 00:04:15,774
the the the way they've been teaching it has slightly changed in the sense that it used to be that

37
00:04:15,774 --> 00:04:23,394
you had to turn all your assignments in to August and other staff for kind of duplicate grading.

38
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:26,754
And I do not believe that that's the case now.

39
00:04:27,444 --> 00:04:31,464
Is that correct? Yeah. Okay. Good morning.

40
00:04:32,784 --> 00:04:42,354
So anyway, I just wanted to highlight this because, um, you know, sometimes people are not aware of do I support course?

41
00:04:42,894 --> 00:04:48,863
All right. So this course has been offered for many years.

42
00:04:48,864 --> 00:04:53,784
And the idea is really to provide a capstone seminar,

43
00:04:53,814 --> 00:05:00,654
an opportunity to integrate and reflect your learnings in global health, EPI and global public health.

44
00:05:01,254 --> 00:05:10,004
And then there are two competencies which I'm assessing through your demonstrated work in this class.

45
00:05:10,014 --> 00:05:18,204
One is developing strategies and capacity for resolving problems that arise and conducting epi studies in low and middle income countries.

46
00:05:18,204 --> 00:05:25,704
And then the second is demonstrating context to their expertise in at least one country and region.

47
00:05:27,684 --> 00:05:30,804
And then the main course requirements.

48
00:05:32,004 --> 00:05:37,824
Class participation. The ideas that will show up, actively participate.

49
00:05:38,364 --> 00:05:43,044
We're going to be using the yellow Digg platform for feedback.

50
00:05:43,044 --> 00:05:48,634
And this is something that Joanna that Kasich has introduced.

51
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:51,924
Have any of these yellow, big and prior classes?

52
00:05:52,114 --> 00:05:55,314
Nope. Okay. It looks pretty cool.

53
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:58,943
So we'll learn together. It does not look too complicated.

54
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:05,124
And there is an introductory video provided by Joanna that kind of tells you about it,

55
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:12,354
but it's a little bit of a richer platform for interaction than perhaps some of the other tools we have.

56
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:16,704
I would love to have you let me know if you're not feeling well.

57
00:06:16,704 --> 00:06:24,324
You can't make the class for whatever reason, and then you'll be able to listen to the recording.

58
00:06:24,804 --> 00:06:29,484
So half of the grade is seminar presentation.

59
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:38,873
And the basic idea is you will tell us about your internship or if you for some reason this is, you know,

60
00:06:38,874 --> 00:06:46,464
some people haven't had a chance to do a true international experience because of pandemic left over or whatever.

61
00:06:47,214 --> 00:06:53,904
Share your what your ideal paper is about, where it stands, where your you know,

62
00:06:54,354 --> 00:07:03,894
you might need assistance or have something to share or want some input from the class and then post program plans.

63
00:07:03,894 --> 00:07:10,193
That's another important feature of this class is that we talk about opportunities after graduation.

64
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:15,054
Some of you are searching for jobs, others applying for further studies.

65
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:21,664
So that's something that. I'd like you to share in your presentation and then the police help.

66
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:28,414
As you know, people have said anything from I'm having trouble with missing data, you know,

67
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:41,734
can someone help me with how do you address that issue or does anyone have an R program for doing this or that or even any suggestions for job?

68
00:07:43,764 --> 00:07:47,134
Job opportunities. So that will be you know,

69
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:57,534
the idea is that it's flexible in this course is intended to serve you both what I can help with and what you can help each other with.

70
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:04,414
And then this again is just this is from the syllabus, which is on the Kansas side.

71
00:08:04,414 --> 00:08:07,824
And I'll show that to you in a moment.

72
00:08:07,834 --> 00:08:11,194
But just to, you know, think about what you're going to do.

73
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,974
We're going to I'm going to have you all sign up for presentations.

74
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:20,644
So so those of you who kindly sign up for early in the semester,

75
00:08:20,644 --> 00:08:26,044
even if you're not that far along in your daily or job search, that's completely fine.

76
00:08:27,604 --> 00:08:30,964
All right. And then I'll show you the schedule shortly.

77
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:40,714
But once the 20 enrolled students have done their presentations, we have post winter break plans.

78
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:50,764
I've done these I've invited groups to do these in the past, and they seemed really useful for the global health students last year.

79
00:08:51,274 --> 00:08:54,664
It was a hybrid. They joined via Zoom.

80
00:08:54,664 --> 00:09:03,964
But we have five global hubs up the alumni talking about their experiences, job advice Laura Power presented on one health.

81
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:08,494
Have any of you taken. I know she was offering us a full course on one.

82
00:09:08,754 --> 00:09:14,354
Also doesn't any of you person that. No, I think it was available, but it wasn't.

83
00:09:14,624 --> 00:09:21,404
Okay. Yeah, she. I remember talking with her and then it was postponed because of other teaching responsibilities.

84
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:27,434
But she gets a really nice talk about that. And that's something that is not very heavily covered in the curriculum.

85
00:09:28,004 --> 00:09:36,853
And the same thing with mixed methods. Some of you have done qualitative research from one of the directors of the Mixed

86
00:09:36,854 --> 00:09:43,604
Methods Program here at University of Michigan presented a test done present.

87
00:09:43,604 --> 00:09:51,854
And then we have some case studies that we go over that kind of illustrate the value of qualitative research for epidemiology.

88
00:09:51,854 --> 00:09:58,104
So those are a few of the ideas. But as you will learn, I mean, you know,

89
00:09:58,454 --> 00:10:06,224
one of my goals in hearing from you is are there specific things that might be interesting for you that feel like a gap

90
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:14,114
in the curriculum or something that you want to integrate that you've been thinking through during your time here?

91
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:20,464
All right. So let me actually quickly.

92
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:29,414
Look over the canvas before I move into the questions, comments and suggestions just to guide you.

93
00:10:29,414 --> 00:10:33,874
This is not a complicated structure.

94
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:37,024
We have the syllabus which you can download here.

95
00:10:37,034 --> 00:10:41,594
I will update it as we populate with with nations.

96
00:10:43,404 --> 00:10:49,614
Of people who are presenting, etc. I won't I won't download that for the moment.

97
00:10:51,564 --> 00:10:54,793
And then. Core schedule.

98
00:10:54,794 --> 00:11:02,894
This is where we show we have we won't meet for two weeks because of the Martin Luther King Junior holiday.

99
00:11:03,854 --> 00:11:12,644
And then I have link the symposium web page. They're amazing numbers of folks and events that please attend.

100
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:13,604
If you're interested,

101
00:11:14,144 --> 00:11:27,554
then we have your presentations so the docs will be followed by your name and we're just going to do those 20 to 30 minute interactive presentations.

102
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:35,174
With questions after and the three person structure worked pretty well.

103
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:40,154
Then we'll have our winter break and then the last two and then these.

104
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:45,853
It says to be announced. But those four topics that I mentioned, I can fill those in.

105
00:11:45,854 --> 00:11:55,414
And then I'm also in in the past, I've also given small presentations sort of interspersed with what the students have given.

106
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:59,444
That's a way of addressing a topic that people are interested in.

107
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:04,904
So the idea, you know, my my philosophy on this course is.

108
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:15,953
That is, you know, it's for you. It's intended to support you in your final semester, you know, and for you to support each other.

109
00:12:15,954 --> 00:12:18,654
I know most of these cohorts have gotten to know each other,

110
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:26,994
but I think just the collective conversation as well as input on Elise can be very useful.

111
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:39,414
And as noted, you know, we have just the simple structure and the, the way you'll give feedback is, um.

112
00:12:40,534 --> 00:12:47,674
Through a yellow day so that the presenter will provide a background briefing on their.

113
00:12:49,054 --> 00:12:58,734
Topic. Ideally, the Friday before you present and then on the morning of your talk you can upload your slides and then other classmates.

114
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:04,713
It looks like most of you all have. Yes. Your laptops during the presentation.

115
00:13:04,714 --> 00:13:11,434
You can just launch the Yellow Dog platform and you can share your open ended feedback.

116
00:13:11,764 --> 00:13:22,144
This is the the video, the introduction to yellow Digg the dilemma that this has given we can.

117
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:29,354
I'll probably just. Would you guys want to watch it now together or on your own time?

118
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:38,424
And we do on their own time. How about that? Okay. And then I'm just going to show what it looks like.

119
00:13:40,314 --> 00:13:44,394
You know, and there's me left new to the community.

120
00:13:45,384 --> 00:13:49,344
And then, you know, this is the hyperlink to the presentations.

121
00:13:49,764 --> 00:13:54,414
And so, you know, the idea is that it's it is pretty straightforward.

122
00:13:54,414 --> 00:14:05,724
You can create posts. And if there are, you know, things that come up in the interim between classes that you want to share, you can do so.

123
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:11,614
So that's. Yellow egg and.

124
00:14:12,924 --> 00:14:19,254
I think that's about the main things. I wanted to go over with the syllabus.

125
00:14:19,284 --> 00:14:26,424
There's one other button where we have resources.

126
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:37,554
Helen, who was one of the students last year, suggested this this website on time management.

127
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:47,214
And so I think some of these things may be interesting. A number of these other sources have come up, for example, of this data issue,

128
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:53,064
and Balan has provided some guidance and students were interested in that.

129
00:14:53,454 --> 00:15:09,204
And then I mentioned pre as our course librarian and she has created this library tools site, which when I was opening it before it took a while.

130
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:18,174
There it is. Okay. So she's greeting greeting us and providing a number of research guides that may be

131
00:15:18,174 --> 00:15:27,564
useful as you do your background literature review or move forward in a me in any way.

132
00:15:27,574 --> 00:15:37,614
So now you're going to be meeting regularly, you know, sort of outside the course just to make sure that you're providing the support that you need.

133
00:15:39,534 --> 00:15:43,374
So that is. The this site.

134
00:15:45,094 --> 00:16:00,004
And. Just move back into the questions portion to see if people have any questions based on what I've said so far.

135
00:16:03,054 --> 00:16:14,304
Yes. With the seminar, is it? It looks like you're asking you to talk about our internships and our own and post-graduate plant business.

136
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:19,554
Okay. So does it matter if our internship has nothing to do with our illy?

137
00:16:22,864 --> 00:16:29,943
It doesn't matter because that that does happen. Like especially if you've done a global help global internship.

138
00:16:29,944 --> 00:16:38,854
Yes, we want to hear and that has happened in the past that people, you know, for whatever reason, they didn't collect data suitable for entirely.

139
00:16:39,094 --> 00:16:42,334
They moved on. Yeah. That is not a problem at all.

140
00:16:42,904 --> 00:16:48,773
Yeah, I think. Okay.

141
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:52,534
Well. Yeah. Oh. I guess the.

142
00:16:53,824 --> 00:17:01,203
I know some of the projects that me and Brooker have been working on don't like directly have articles about them specifically.

143
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:04,734
So is it okay if we have related content of the article that we offer?

144
00:17:05,344 --> 00:17:10,834
Yeah. Yeah. And, and yeah, it's just something that you think might be helpful.

145
00:17:10,834 --> 00:17:19,834
Like some of the students in the past, they've been addressing a topic that may not be familiar to the average person.

146
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:25,544
We had a student who was doing work on. Yeah.

147
00:17:25,574 --> 00:17:31,843
Just just things that are very different, like hospital infection prevention, the lucky ones, the global health of these students.

148
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:36,734
So it's just a way to kind of bring people up, to speed up a little bit with your topic.

149
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:41,353
And it can be any kind of article or reference.

150
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:49,224
And even if it's just, you know, a short. Blurb or something or a two page reference, that's also fine.

151
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:59,064
So it's just intended to inform so that people can be constructive and helpful to you as you share what your work is.

152
00:18:04,844 --> 00:18:10,194
All right. So now this is the part where I will.

153
00:18:11,294 --> 00:18:18,464
Be taking notes. I would love to hear from all of you, starting with name pronouns.

154
00:18:19,244 --> 00:18:25,574
Just your background. What was your undergraduate degree and the other degrees you may have acquired?

155
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:32,654
Um, the global health experience that kind of brought you or if any, you know, that,

156
00:18:32,774 --> 00:18:41,564
that brought you into this topic of your early name, of your advisor status, your potential post-graduate plans.

157
00:18:42,074 --> 00:18:51,614
And then, you know, I mentioned a few things that I'm planning to offer for the after the break, but.

158
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:58,224
Anything else that I haven't mentioned that you might want to discuss or enhance in this class?

159
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:06,614
And I like the apprehensive, grateful and any other reflections that you want to share today in class?

160
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:11,123
So with that and a monitor at the time.

161
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:14,544
So we will take a break around nine and.

162
00:19:16,454 --> 00:19:21,704
I'll just start with. The person that I represent.

163
00:19:22,154 --> 00:19:26,414
Right. All right. So my name is Abby, and I use she her pronouns.

164
00:19:26,954 --> 00:19:30,224
Last name. You know, like I know.

165
00:19:30,314 --> 00:19:34,664
And yeah. So I got my undergraduate degree in microbiology here at Michigan.

166
00:19:35,084 --> 00:19:39,144
And then in my global health experience, I'm supposed to study abroad and undergrad.

167
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:47,264
I got a chance of that cougar, but I did have this trip over spring break with a few other students where we to Vietnam.

168
00:19:47,744 --> 00:19:52,004
And that was my introduction to global health and some public health initiatives out there.

169
00:19:52,004 --> 00:19:57,943
And so that's what got me interested in pursuing a degree in public health, um, for my,

170
00:19:57,944 --> 00:20:08,204
I only I'm doing something completely separate than my internship, but I'm looking into behavioral drivers behind HPV vaccine uptake in Vietnam.

171
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:10,394
And I've been using mixed data for that.

172
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:19,424
And then for the status of that, I am very much in the beginnings of my interview in the intro, and I just got access to the data set.

173
00:20:19,424 --> 00:20:26,863
So I will be making record for analysis this week actually, and then for post-graduate plans.

174
00:20:26,864 --> 00:20:33,614
I'm looking into some jobs in clinical research right now, so I'm hoping to do that for a few years and then hopefully get to med school after that.

175
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:37,273
Um, some skills that I want to learn, I guess.

176
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:44,024
I don't know the specific skills, but I am excited to hear from some alumni their experiences for building the global health.

177
00:20:44,594 --> 00:20:45,734
You don't really know what's going to come,

178
00:20:45,734 --> 00:20:52,514
so it will be cool to hear about how their skills that they gained in this program apply to their own goals.

179
00:20:53,714 --> 00:20:58,693
Something that I'm apprehensive about, I guess just post-graduate plans with.

180
00:20:58,694 --> 00:21:06,044
I don't feel apprehensive about entering the workforce because I kind of went straight from undergrad into my grad program.

181
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:09,554
So that's been something I'm apprehensive about.

182
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:13,844
So I'm grateful for this. My family and my family.

183
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:25,274
And yet this fisher. On the question of, you know, who is your.

184
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:31,474
I only adviser. So I'm working with Dr. Taylor. Oh, yeah.

185
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:39,084
Okay. And when you say mixed data, do you mean, like some quality of some kind of thing?

186
00:21:40,034 --> 00:21:43,974
Oh, mixing. Like I'm using the multiple or cluster survey data from.

187
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:50,994
Oh, yeah. Okay. So there's like. Actually, I don't think that there's any quality I need to look into my life.

188
00:21:51,304 --> 00:21:54,543
It's mostly qualitative. Okay. Okay. So it's the same.

189
00:21:54,544 --> 00:22:00,664
I see. It's okay. Okay. All right.

190
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:05,104
Any other questions for Abby? Thank you very much.

191
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:11,314
Okay. So my name, my full name is Jones.

192
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:22,683
And I can do a whole lecture on my name. But if I go with Janet and I'm from China and I did my undergraduate primarily in China,

193
00:22:22,684 --> 00:22:27,244
I have a five year one graduate, so I did four years in China and one year in Nebraska.

194
00:22:27,274 --> 00:22:37,144
Here, Nebraska, Nebraska Medical Center. I got a graduate in public health and my global health experience.

195
00:22:37,144 --> 00:22:42,693
I am I'm sorry I did so international of Owen's earnings.

196
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:54,604
I came back from India and I in coaching my and I volunteered in a charity hospital where I shadow the doctor and

197
00:22:55,264 --> 00:23:03,124
sue me through their data collection and their training and to help them analyze their polls and increasing data.

198
00:23:04,144 --> 00:23:17,784
So and I applied here. So the topic of my Audi is on analyzing a COVID rapid antigen test in the context of Nicaragua.

199
00:23:18,204 --> 00:23:25,824
So my advisor is Dr. Albert Gordon here and it's Parveen and her partner suicide is in Nicaragua.

200
00:23:26,184 --> 00:23:31,404
And I also did my summer internship with her in Nicaragua for three months.

201
00:23:31,914 --> 00:23:34,433
So the status of my role is very interesting.

202
00:23:34,434 --> 00:23:44,394
So from my perspective, it's done because I have already sent my manuscript, according to the Journal to Dr. Goran,

203
00:23:44,394 --> 00:23:53,634
but she's on vacation, so I think I'll review that and poll potential post-graduation plans.

204
00:23:54,174 --> 00:23:59,664
I'm gonna say I'm gonna find a job first, preferably here in the U.S.

205
00:23:59,904 --> 00:24:06,654
But if I cannot, I'll just go back to China. You know, I'm thinking of doing a Ph.D. somewhere.

206
00:24:07,314 --> 00:24:15,524
The. But not recently an overhaul of public schools I might want to discuss.

207
00:24:16,004 --> 00:24:20,323
So I really Nicodemus, I learned some really cool new language in my past.

208
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:24,734
When you're in a house, you're uncle calling, not in the computer science major.

209
00:24:25,564 --> 00:24:32,084
And I want to learn as much coding as I want to and all the skills that are used on the coding,

210
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:41,444
skills that are using public health, all including language, other tips and for jobs and things of being a programmer as well.

211
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:44,974
I will apply for separate jobs, but I haven't heard back from that yet.

212
00:24:45,474 --> 00:24:57,614
And something I'm apprehensive about, probably sitting with Abby just post-graduation plans and something I'm grateful for you guys.

213
00:24:57,834 --> 00:25:04,904
Oh, yeah, I know I haven't.

214
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:13,904
So before I came here, I had been expected to meet some incredible people, and I feel like I find myself with you.

215
00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:19,184
Yeah. Am and the other reception to share. So.

216
00:25:20,634 --> 00:25:29,774
Reflections from Eileen experiences will set up a meeting with your advisor regularly and talk about that craft,

217
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:34,974
probably biweekly or weekly if they have time. I can read into that.

218
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:46,644
So. But the fact that you're done suggests to me that you need to begin the process from I think May.

219
00:25:47,154 --> 00:25:55,674
And I got my formal data set in September and the coding part of my program is pretty easy,

220
00:25:56,184 --> 00:26:02,694
is basically just calculating the system specificity on a value.

221
00:26:03,634 --> 00:26:14,844
But my dad was quite large, so I did sometimes things wrong and I've been doing a partial job in Dr. Albers Gordon's team,

222
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:21,024
so I learn a few coding techniques from them and I basically just sat down with myself.

223
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:27,564
So okay. More independent than perhaps I would like.

224
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:31,374
Okay. Yeah, yeah. That's good piece of advice.

225
00:26:32,154 --> 00:26:40,614
And you mentioned three coding languages, so I'm assuming are SAS and that took a python clause from the school of information

226
00:26:40,794 --> 00:26:49,254
so and I really love that and learn so much more about coding and Star Wars.

227
00:26:49,464 --> 00:26:53,254
So oh sorry.

228
00:26:53,304 --> 00:26:56,904
He is not related to any health topic.

229
00:26:56,904 --> 00:27:01,674
So he found a website called the Star called the Swap Meet.

230
00:27:02,094 --> 00:27:14,184
So basically some of the both area of data sat online and basically digitized the whole star series and like which plan has this kind of mass?

231
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:21,504
And it's all far away from earth. And they have every data on every all starships.

232
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:29,184
And I mean, I worked so hard to try these, but I didn't expect there to be so many people.

233
00:27:30,924 --> 00:27:37,163
And there's like, oh, there's like robots and stuff and all our homeworks, basically.

234
00:27:37,164 --> 00:27:47,424
Okay. So these people took this starship love to blast that star and we had to add those people on a starship and to the to the star.

235
00:27:48,854 --> 00:27:53,904
That's. Wow. Well, thank you.

236
00:27:53,904 --> 00:28:04,454
Imagine if we had that kind of data on ourselves and very interesting and that I remember some years ago,

237
00:28:04,564 --> 00:28:10,763
I had a student from India, a student from while she was originally from Liberia.

238
00:28:10,764 --> 00:28:18,624
Like I had a set of very international students and we were in a meeting and I said some line from Star Wars.

239
00:28:19,674 --> 00:28:25,864
It was just like it didn't it was not something that they knew anything about would have still that.

240
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:29,874
But the fact that you watched it in Chinese is impressive.

241
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:38,954
I watch the Chinese where there's a lot of lines. Probably you guys can like remind yourself from memory, but it's just different.

242
00:28:38,964 --> 00:28:43,343
It doesn't like half of the clock, like more than 50%.

243
00:28:43,344 --> 00:28:46,074
Of course, our international students are in China or India,

244
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:52,974
and the professors just kept saying the polls like may the force be with us and everybody.

245
00:28:53,184 --> 00:29:02,984
But we ask the question, has all in the Star Wars and we're like, oh, wow, that's that's amazing.

246
00:29:02,994 --> 00:29:09,114
Thank you for sharing that later. You can tell me who is a professor in Korea.

247
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:14,634
Right. Thank you so much. Stand so nice to hear from you.

248
00:29:15,624 --> 00:29:28,724
All right. Out here quickly, I go back a year ago, my undergraduate undergraduate degree was in sociology and Spanish, so no science.

249
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:42,544
So my topic, mahalo. I worked on water accessibility and quality with Joseph Eisenberg was specifically one of his Oh,

250
00:29:43,584 --> 00:29:49,764
I am in the data cleaning management organizing stage.

251
00:29:49,944 --> 00:29:57,263
So that's how that's going is just two questions that from his Ecuador project.

252
00:29:57,264 --> 00:30:03,644
Yeah. Oh, okay, great. Potential post-graduate plans.

253
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:12,524
I have a job opportunity at a hospital on their research team.

254
00:30:12,884 --> 00:30:17,954
I'm not sure if that's the direction I want to go, but that's an option, I guess.

255
00:30:20,024 --> 00:30:23,134
In Ecuador? No, in the United States.

256
00:30:23,224 --> 00:30:29,554
Oh, okay. That'd be cool. Okay. I guess previous global health experience.

257
00:30:29,564 --> 00:30:32,954
I went to Ecuador this summer.

258
00:30:33,344 --> 00:30:38,894
During my undergrad, I worked at an HIV clinic in Mexico in the Yucatan Peninsula.

259
00:30:40,904 --> 00:30:51,464
That was also during COVID. So I got to see a lot of how HIV care was affected by a global pandemic, which is pretty crazy.

260
00:30:54,294 --> 00:31:04,584
Soon. I agree that talking to the alumni is going to be a really cool experience to figure out how our job,

261
00:31:04,644 --> 00:31:08,544
how our knowledge is transferable to the workforce.

262
00:31:09,894 --> 00:31:19,894
Something I'm better about is kicking off the I only like actual analysis and hoping everything works that goes as planned.

263
00:31:22,044 --> 00:31:37,404
I am grateful that my heart continues to staff in this weather and I have not had an amazing class like this was class work.

264
00:31:39,274 --> 00:31:43,353
It's been. It's been a wild ride anyway.

265
00:31:43,354 --> 00:31:49,084
So. Right. And where was your undergraduate degree in rural Iowa?

266
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:55,804
From Illinois. Well, we have people from like Nebraska, Iowa.

267
00:31:55,954 --> 00:32:07,444
My mother grew up in Kansas, so I have certainly been to Midwest flaps, races, a lot of sky open skies.

268
00:32:08,164 --> 00:32:11,224
Great. Thank you so much. I'm ready.

269
00:32:11,614 --> 00:32:18,214
So I'm back over to another. She her hers. I did my undergraduate degree here also in public health.

270
00:32:18,724 --> 00:32:23,374
I'm here for a little bit global health experience and undergrad.

271
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:30,364
I worked remotely with an organization in Kenya to develop pamphlets for HIV prevention.

272
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:36,844
And then this summer I also went to Microbiology and Rashi for my internship.

273
00:32:37,774 --> 00:32:47,524
So my family is related to that. I'm going to look at dengue case incidence in Nicaragua and Dr. Andrew Gordon is also much wiser.

274
00:32:48,984 --> 00:32:52,474
If I you I've done most of the data analysis.

275
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:57,124
I just have to redo it all with the body clean dataset.

276
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:04,334
And then kind of work on the writing. I started the intro, but another long way to go.

277
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:16,474
Post-Graduate plans to apply to some jobs, maybe some global health fellowships, and then go have topics I want to discuss in this class.

278
00:33:16,484 --> 00:33:23,724
I'm definitely interested in how to get approach jobs in global health and how that works.

279
00:33:23,754 --> 00:33:30,104
I'm excited to hear about that and something I'm apprehensive about.

280
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:39,784
There are probably just postgraduate fans as well and so far I'm grateful for was going to Nicaragua with Roshi.

281
00:33:39,794 --> 00:33:45,854
Janet That was a great experience. So yeah, thank you.

282
00:33:47,384 --> 00:33:51,784
Know. So it sounds like maybe three folks are working with Dr. Gordon.

283
00:33:52,284 --> 00:33:56,784
I mean. Yeah. Yeah. Or the team of 15.

284
00:33:56,794 --> 00:34:00,574
Thank you, Doctor. Yes, I. I see.

285
00:34:00,574 --> 00:34:06,154
My friends are also her. My undergraduate nurse was actually at Michigan State.

286
00:34:07,084 --> 00:34:10,924
I was living in a double minor in health promotion.

287
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:15,574
Environmental health. Michigan State run private public health program.

288
00:34:15,584 --> 00:34:23,973
I was there for my Grand Family Limited, which is kind of why I double minored in those kinds of things so I could try to enhance my experience.

289
00:34:23,974 --> 00:34:29,704
But other than that, I went liberal, both of them, and worked for them for every door that I was directly in.

290
00:34:29,714 --> 00:34:40,144
Nikolayev on the ground combat, COVID and influenza, and just doing PCR testing, no matter my topic is not without regard.

291
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:49,144
And I'm working with Lindsay for the last year. I'm doing like mental health and social isolation and measuring like post-pandemic resiliency.

292
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,473
Amanda's over. This is her own personal research.

293
00:34:52,474 --> 00:34:59,523
So I just said I gave them I said I'm from Nicaragua because I was in my day to day stuff rather than working with prior data.

294
00:34:59,524 --> 00:35:07,834
So I love working with Lindsay and this because I didn't have that much global health experience or public health insurance in general.

295
00:35:08,044 --> 00:35:16,144
I kind of wanted to like for all my options to figure out what aspect of the field I like most on working into my I'll

296
00:35:16,294 --> 00:35:24,484
have completed like all of my they are analysis like statistical tables and like couple graphs and all that complete.

297
00:35:24,484 --> 00:35:26,254
But I need to start writing now.

298
00:35:26,254 --> 00:35:38,313
So it really started with that focus on things with the manner that and so if I going along with that was just applying for like fellowships and jobs.

299
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:44,224
So just knowing like a researcher have with an Excel sheet going for this week and holding on to that for now.

300
00:35:45,094 --> 00:35:53,704
So we'll have probably just hearing about like intersections between infectious disease and like social epidemiology because that's kind of where my

301
00:35:53,704 --> 00:35:58,524
research on the line and the one line where they like it's so the next thing

302
00:35:58,534 --> 00:36:03,394
I got something I'm apprehensive about definitely post-grad plans as well.

303
00:36:03,764 --> 00:36:13,844
I don't know how to the bathroom person I, I thought through these like future opportunity so the number of or definitely my family that's another

304
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:28,144
thank you so I was Aaron Britton I got my pronouns I did a health science degree of Indianapolis,

305
00:36:29,524 --> 00:36:33,264
my previous school of Korean school, nontraditional.

306
00:36:33,814 --> 00:36:37,384
Um, when I was in high school, came obtaining an EMT license.

307
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:46,443
So I was working at a firm in our Pico Co clinic where the primary system, primarily patients,

308
00:36:46,444 --> 00:36:56,134
are immigrants and long term visitors and grew as anyone who does not have health insurance is welcome there.

309
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,184
And I was working in like a room and a nurse.

310
00:37:01,414 --> 00:37:08,134
And so my interaction with patients there is kind of my support and interest in will help.

311
00:37:09,424 --> 00:37:16,053
And then I decided that that's really my only experience and then my highly covered is

312
00:37:16,054 --> 00:37:28,494
vaccine hesitancy and Indonesia with Dr. Wagner um to the model building phases and it's,

313
00:37:28,904 --> 00:37:38,164
it's going to spread when maybe it's in a few years.

314
00:37:38,164 --> 00:37:55,594
But I would like to find something for us that's not necessarily global health based and state of Michigan and global health topics and skills.

315
00:37:56,104 --> 00:38:08,354
Yeah, I found that certainly very interesting. I've learned from this with Janet and other folks right now learning MATLAB and yeah.

316
00:38:08,754 --> 00:38:21,184
And I think the way they would be for testing and modeling is both like in a, in a spatial area in a global health context would be very interesting.

317
00:38:22,114 --> 00:38:35,684
Um, and something apprehensive about, I guess like everyone else post-graduation plans kind of scary to have considered their job.

318
00:38:36,724 --> 00:38:43,514
So the main reason for is warm weather is it.

319
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:50,704
I don't know any other words, but he said it.

320
00:38:51,664 --> 00:38:57,274
So tell. You said you were in a class learning guys and not learning.

321
00:38:57,394 --> 00:39:04,414
Yeah. What is with infectious disease? Violent courses in another language in lab different than answers.

322
00:39:05,254 --> 00:39:11,553
And it's my understanding. So my roommates all from last year were all engineers at the program.

323
00:39:11,554 --> 00:39:15,844
We usually use quite a bit different views on like matrices.

324
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:27,183
And you said looking at the data, never does that often see a lot of like a matrix map and different dimensions which in calculus which is a

325
00:39:27,184 --> 00:39:33,514
little different than statistics or the statistics instead of using the actual it's a physical prejudice,

326
00:39:35,464 --> 00:39:38,754
whereas the WHO offers that course. Dr.

327
00:39:40,534 --> 00:39:46,714
Oh, Marissa. Jo. Oh, Jo. That's interesting.

328
00:39:46,924 --> 00:39:51,384
Okay. And then and part of that is also learning.

329
00:39:51,774 --> 00:39:59,844
And that's a different question. That's a different words that I realized in the course for a while observing the vaccine hesitancy.

330
00:40:00,234 --> 00:40:10,704
So it's so hyper specific before it gets involved in more spatial areas and a much better understanding of what's going on, where it's going on.

331
00:40:11,364 --> 00:40:19,804
And I think there's a huge opportunity there is knowing how to like look at maps and learn how to code with maps and be very interested in that.

332
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:24,294
And and who offers the genius? I'm not sure.

333
00:40:25,884 --> 00:40:28,914
That's a 70 seconds. Ms. Larson.

334
00:40:30,174 --> 00:40:34,073
Oh, Pete Larson. Oh, okay. Oh, okay.

335
00:40:34,074 --> 00:40:37,604
So it's a class. You're going. Yeah, okay. Okay. Right, right.

336
00:40:37,614 --> 00:40:40,984
All right. I'm. Anyone else signed up for that?

337
00:40:41,704 --> 00:40:46,284
Oh, quite a few. Okay. Yes, I know.

338
00:40:47,854 --> 00:40:53,494
I think it was it was time to do that and that's good.

339
00:40:54,574 --> 00:40:57,994
The reason I ask, because, you know, traditionally,

340
00:40:57,994 --> 00:41:05,424
like a lot of our public health students have taken gives classes offered at other schools like the School for Environment and Sustainability.

341
00:41:05,434 --> 00:41:09,454
They have a whole spatial analysis lab, the urban planning.

342
00:41:10,654 --> 00:41:15,814
And then I know there's one class that I believe is offered out of the school.

343
00:41:16,834 --> 00:41:25,263
It's I think it's Ritesh Mistry may be but you know the fact the PE course and is offering that

344
00:41:25,264 --> 00:41:34,414
courses it's really good because it's very applied maybe better to take your earlier on in to a

345
00:41:34,654 --> 00:41:43,704
conference last year and pretty much every every presenter was like yeah I just mapped this out and

346
00:41:43,714 --> 00:41:48,304
whereas like sort of COVID was and then we used this to look at like vaccine doesn't seem like data.

347
00:41:48,934 --> 00:41:53,854
So it seems like the plans are probably better. How to do time in school.

348
00:41:53,854 --> 00:41:59,204
We have a basic understanding of how this work. No.

349
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:03,934
That's good. So it's almost sound.

350
00:42:03,984 --> 00:42:12,533
I'm just thinking that in a way, as a global health skill that you want to learn about and you're signing up for it.

351
00:42:12,534 --> 00:42:18,654
But, you know, maybe it would be worth I'm just throwing this out there, like having a classroom.

352
00:42:18,654 --> 00:42:28,494
We kind of talk about some of the spatial techniques and the value of GIs for, you know, some of it is just the visualization of what's going on.

353
00:42:28,494 --> 00:42:41,184
But I'll put that in there because I have. You know, I've worked with folks over at so I'll put that in as a potential topic that we could cover.

354
00:42:43,524 --> 00:42:48,174
All right. Thank you, Aaron. Next.

355
00:42:49,264 --> 00:42:56,844
All right. Hi. My name is where is a hundred years since I got my undergraduate degree at one university in North Carolina.

356
00:42:56,874 --> 00:43:07,024
I know of Iran. Yeah. Nobody knows. Barbara Israel, who is a professor and her daughter Ilana, went to Iran.

357
00:43:07,074 --> 00:43:10,734
And it's just, you know, an L.A. now.

358
00:43:12,394 --> 00:43:15,834
She's probably a few years beyond you.

359
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:19,474
But, you know, I just remember them reading about it.

360
00:43:19,954 --> 00:43:23,374
It's a small. Well, I don't know. Maybe, you know.

361
00:43:23,624 --> 00:43:26,714
Okay. I mean, yeah, we can go to that. Oh.

362
00:43:29,034 --> 00:43:33,264
What's the my global experience this past summer?

363
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:43,444
Actually last summer in Athens and 23. But anyway, so last summer I went to Kenya to work with the African Population Health Research Center.

364
00:43:43,794 --> 00:43:49,074
For about two months, sitting in Nairobi doing some sort of research with them.

365
00:43:50,244 --> 00:44:01,914
However, that has none of it in my elite. I am doing a vaccine hesitancy comparing STI vaccine acceptance between three countries China,

366
00:44:01,914 --> 00:44:08,094
Indonesia and the United States, and also with Dr. Adrian Packer on both sides of the aisle.

367
00:44:08,184 --> 00:44:12,144
We're in the great place, so we've gone through pretty much everything.

368
00:44:13,224 --> 00:44:21,954
I had a lot of planning to do last semester, but it was kind of a no the results writing kind of area right now because there are no plans.

369
00:44:23,304 --> 00:44:27,414
I just want a job. I don't care where.

370
00:44:27,684 --> 00:44:31,314
I don't care. I really do my job.

371
00:44:31,884 --> 00:44:34,494
I'm not really thinking on the bright side.

372
00:44:35,304 --> 00:44:40,644
So I really love learning about health systems and that's something that we really haven't got to dive into on the global scale.

373
00:44:40,674 --> 00:44:46,223
I think we are always really focused on the U.S. side and how we as American researchers can

374
00:44:46,224 --> 00:44:51,984
go into other countries that I would love to know more about the way other countries work,

375
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:56,184
in the way that health and science in different countries it is important to know about.

376
00:44:57,114 --> 00:45:00,534
It also requires opinion because I have no idea how either of the stories really.

377
00:45:01,974 --> 00:45:09,224
And that's not mean. That's like a reference of about yeah.

378
00:45:09,234 --> 00:45:19,294
Really just the job search industry and to have something lined up by the time I graduate because I feel really grateful and also grateful for here.

379
00:45:19,314 --> 00:45:23,693
I really didn't know what to expect being at University of Michigan or being in the Master's program.

380
00:45:23,694 --> 00:45:29,114
So I'm also very grateful for global health cohort. Any other reflections?

381
00:45:31,514 --> 00:45:36,314
Oh, thank you. That's really helpful. Yeah. The health systems on the global scale.

382
00:45:36,434 --> 00:45:39,914
Yes, definitely. Yeah.

383
00:45:39,914 --> 00:45:45,013
Because you do have a requirement to take a health management and policy class.

384
00:45:45,014 --> 00:45:50,084
But is that more domestic focus or doesn't even cover genetics?

385
00:45:50,954 --> 00:45:54,154
Oh, yeah. That Midwest focus, it's mobilized.

386
00:45:54,284 --> 00:45:58,274
Yeah, exactly. It's like one of those.

387
00:45:58,664 --> 00:46:02,893
Oh, I checked. Okay, that's.

388
00:46:02,894 --> 00:46:07,094
That's a great idea, because I.

389
00:46:07,364 --> 00:46:10,664
Yeah. So thank you for that suggestion.

390
00:46:10,664 --> 00:46:21,254
And other people feel similarly not. Not a lot of coverage of health systems on the scale of zero is just precisely zero.

391
00:46:21,374 --> 00:46:25,294
Okay. All right. All right.

392
00:46:25,294 --> 00:46:28,974
Thank you, Maria. And next. Hi, everyone.

393
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:32,464
My name is Ian Smith. I usually have pronouns.

394
00:46:33,034 --> 00:46:41,704
My undergraduate degree was at university and in international health with minors, in biology, in Spanish.

395
00:46:42,724 --> 00:46:47,694
My global experience. So an undergrad, Costa Rica.

396
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:50,854
We did surface water quality analysis there,

397
00:46:52,414 --> 00:47:02,224
also spent a semester working with Rohingya refugees in Chicago primarily on nutrition, but I also English classes there.

398
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:14,834
And then this past summer, this week into my hiring, I did my internship with Dr. Eisenberg in Ecuador, primarily focusing on mosquitoes.

399
00:47:15,344 --> 00:47:23,274
So the topic of my diary is mosquito landed rates for human landing studies in Ecuador.

400
00:47:23,294 --> 00:47:27,194
And Dr. Eisenberg, like number of us in this class.

401
00:47:28,934 --> 00:47:34,244
So the status of my aioli. So we wrote our introductions last semester.

402
00:47:35,124 --> 00:47:41,844
And I've been. So we actually started on my model building and everything during the summer when I was in Ecuador,

403
00:47:42,804 --> 00:47:47,064
but we recently updated the data that our collaborators sent us.

404
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:52,314
Updated one. So I have to clean that up again, which I'm not super excited about.

405
00:47:53,824 --> 00:47:59,074
And they also added another outcome. So I'm not I'm also not so excited about that either.

406
00:48:00,874 --> 00:48:12,334
But generally speaking, is just going to be recruiting the data and then fixing my models for this semester, producing potential and grand plans.

407
00:48:12,334 --> 00:48:21,843
So I applied the programs in the last semester, so that's appropriate for my undergrad.

408
00:48:21,844 --> 00:48:27,874
Or if we're going to have three G as long as those were down or don't work out and just get a job.

409
00:48:27,874 --> 00:48:41,584
I guess to the topic is skills and I want to discuss in so I'm really excited about Dr. Tower for me she was trapped in the car and secret and I left

410
00:48:43,114 --> 00:48:48,603
and we got to talk about one health pretty popular one of the programs I place

411
00:48:48,604 --> 00:48:53,284
we was in one health and I'm really interested in that topic in general.

412
00:48:53,284 --> 00:48:57,034
So I'm excited that we at least get one presentation on it.

413
00:48:57,544 --> 00:49:07,414
You're doing something I'm apprehensive about just kind of like the future in general and the world is scary right now.

414
00:49:07,714 --> 00:49:15,574
I'm so worried that I would never do anything.

415
00:49:15,574 --> 00:49:20,944
So grateful for the friends I've made. Sprint so lovely, you know.

416
00:49:21,544 --> 00:49:26,264
I don't ever know. I don't think those were reflections.

417
00:49:27,814 --> 00:49:39,274
So thank you. Well, that's interesting. So you were trapped in a car with her, but hopefully having a more formal open air presentation.

418
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:42,744
So how did you get trapped in a car with her? I'm just curious.

419
00:49:43,624 --> 00:49:46,834
We're first of all. Yeah.

420
00:49:46,834 --> 00:49:51,634
And we went to Kentucky as part of a community needs assessment down there.

421
00:49:51,724 --> 00:49:58,614
And she was in the car with us. We got to talk to all sorts of other people, too.

422
00:49:59,044 --> 00:50:01,174
I'm sure she was the one talking about the Cedars.

423
00:50:01,504 --> 00:50:17,223
She did know it was just me, is that I think my wife's well, a student I covered by us with a Lexus and I think it went oh different car.

424
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:25,683
So he did that different. He was a driver. He had some interesting observations about that experience.

425
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:28,764
So he's done a number of reasons.

426
00:50:28,794 --> 00:50:36,604
So wonderful that you did that. And that must've been a grueling what was it, a week that you were there?

427
00:50:37,054 --> 00:50:40,664
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well.

428
00:50:40,974 --> 00:50:45,284
Who? Thank you. Um, Hayden.

429
00:50:45,714 --> 00:50:48,744
Yeah, my name is Peter. Yeah, I know.

430
00:50:49,574 --> 00:50:55,114
My undergrad degree was in public health at the Detroit Commission.

431
00:50:56,234 --> 00:51:03,133
My goal from experience is pretty academic. I did a lot of, like, medical anthropology reading, so that was very global based.

432
00:51:03,134 --> 00:51:07,064
And then my internship was remote last summer, so I virtually didn't get to travel.

433
00:51:07,574 --> 00:51:14,714
Um hum. Because my iley, I'm working behind a hospital hiking sport with one.

434
00:51:14,954 --> 00:51:19,784
She's at Rutgers now. So, um, Dr. Jo Eisenberg is like my vision person.

435
00:51:20,474 --> 00:51:30,254
And so I'm really running a ton of regression models to see which variables to include in my overall score.

436
00:51:30,254 --> 00:51:37,694
So that's kind of where I am. We did more introductions that semester, so it's happening in writing as well as writing some regression models,

437
00:51:38,294 --> 00:51:41,953
um, post-grad plans and applying to the fellowships.

438
00:51:41,954 --> 00:51:48,254
And I don't get in, tell you this cycle I'll probably take three, but you know, so for a while the group I've gotten,

439
00:51:50,204 --> 00:51:55,814
I'm really interested in school health surveillance a lot of the and looking at our infectious

440
00:51:55,814 --> 00:52:02,473
disease surveillance is a couple global and parasitic infection surveillance apprehensive

441
00:52:02,474 --> 00:52:08,084
about that and I really it seemed like the first lab finishing I learned writing everything

442
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:12,164
it's it's pretty daunting looking at everything else I still have to do some finishing that.

443
00:52:13,064 --> 00:52:16,894
I'm also grateful for the little meetings that we've done on other outlets.

444
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,154
So I really didn't really think that the.

445
00:52:27,684 --> 00:52:35,394
So Page, I'm just curious you say household hygiene squirtle just you share a little bit more about what that.

446
00:52:35,454 --> 00:52:44,724
Yeah I know it's not uncommon would say in Ecuador and previously like how you was only classified by like hand-washing.

447
00:52:44,724 --> 00:52:53,814
So this girl looks at like general house, like it doesn't read like the kitchen in the bathroom and then hand-washing diligently.

448
00:52:54,834 --> 00:52:58,794
There's one other aspect. There's like five different subtopics of like hygiene.

449
00:52:59,244 --> 00:53:03,834
And so we're creating a score with those five topics in mind.

450
00:53:03,834 --> 00:53:07,973
And then I there's also a separate bacterial hand count.

451
00:53:07,974 --> 00:53:14,544
So I'm looking to see like is bacterial count relationship like overall hygiene score a better hygiene score?

452
00:53:14,814 --> 00:53:20,064
They should technically have like a lower back to your count. So that's okay.

453
00:53:20,064 --> 00:53:23,214
So that's kind of your outcome. It's a little yeah.

454
00:53:23,544 --> 00:53:30,774
So which are you and I imagine you're potentially testing different types of scores to see which are the stronger.

455
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:38,634
Yeah, yeah. That's how we're not now we have a full score, but certainly we're missing a lot of data from specific variables.

456
00:53:38,634 --> 00:53:43,134
So we have like revised scores and we're seeing which one is the best.

457
00:53:43,134 --> 00:53:50,854
So that's why the regression models come and see which questions actually are great.

458
00:53:51,324 --> 00:53:55,094
Thank you very much. Okay.

459
00:53:55,104 --> 00:53:58,914
And then I think I'm just thinking, Adriana, we'll have you be the last.

460
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:04,754
Oh, where do you want to take a break first? I think like earthquake right now.

461
00:54:04,794 --> 00:54:24,604
Okay. All right. So we're going to take 5 minutes and stretch and we will reconvene and clear, you know?

462
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:37,524
All right. To end. To leave about 5 minutes early, and every time we meet us on the other side is, Oh, okay, that's my leg, you know.

463
00:54:37,624 --> 00:54:42,504
Okay. Okay. So typically at 945, so you can get over there.

464
00:54:42,944 --> 00:54:52,164
So that's. There's only three months do that.

465
00:54:52,594 --> 00:55:01,764
Yeah. Okay. It's on the go.

466
00:55:01,764 --> 00:55:05,604
Not my friends. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, that restaurant.

467
00:55:06,444 --> 00:55:16,394
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

468
00:55:16,654 --> 00:55:39,864
The. That was my friends who did the math and they were able to go to that and what was going on.

469
00:55:39,924 --> 00:55:44,874
Why did you avoid any of that?

470
00:55:47,234 --> 00:55:50,543
Oh, yes, I was I was one of the four.

471
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:54,324
That's all right. 11.

472
00:55:55,104 --> 00:56:05,304
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

473
00:56:09,474 --> 00:56:17,494
Oh, my God. I don't know.

474
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:28,064
I feel like there are a lot of people that are.

475
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:44,714
You know, I feel like I'm from Chicago, but.

476
00:56:50,104 --> 00:57:03,154
Well, I think sometimes I feel like.

477
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:24,754
Well, you know, because I was there at the end of the world and I feel like I've learned through watching it 36 hours or so.

478
00:57:24,794 --> 00:57:34,824
But someone is like I was like, Oh, it's okay.

479
00:57:34,824 --> 00:57:47,814
This is a man who's in that way and it's better than nothing.

480
00:57:50,124 --> 00:58:05,964
Yeah, well, looks like you got the whole idea of what to make of it, you know?

481
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:11,544
Oh, that's so important, because you can check out edited out all the.

482
00:58:11,804 --> 00:58:18,934
All the stuff like that. Like, it depends. Well, that doesn't mean me.

483
00:58:20,544 --> 00:58:37,874
Oh. Afternoon activity that you're probably doing compared to what I had in my hands are I just leave it

484
00:58:37,904 --> 00:59:00,734
doesn't look like how do you feel when you don't really know what the [INAUDIBLE] are you doing?

485
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:10,274
Everything. I know how to live under another name.

486
00:59:10,664 --> 00:59:17,293
Whatever you believe me, you're going to put everything to use.

487
00:59:17,294 --> 00:59:22,564
And here it was behind you. And you're doing words.

488
00:59:22,784 --> 00:59:27,204
I do appreciate this. I didn't want our nation born, you know, like I was.

489
00:59:27,784 --> 00:59:32,774
I was like, what is a stakes theology when there's just a lot of honesty?

490
00:59:32,804 --> 00:59:36,734
I never may have had the impression, yeah, I was feeling again.

491
00:59:37,454 --> 00:59:47,894
This is designed for other places like, you know, for me because I think so.

492
00:59:48,644 --> 00:59:56,954
And so we just like I know, I know this is not good anyways.

493
00:59:57,584 --> 01:00:10,124
I always read but why it's more I actually like that feels like an insider woman.

494
01:00:10,574 --> 01:00:18,114
I think some of these old needs are going to be very easily.

495
01:00:18,134 --> 01:00:27,764
How I know it's a member of is that we're going to do some research.

496
01:00:27,884 --> 01:00:44,384
I know some of the 19 year old girls had no idea that there was something like this.

497
01:00:48,594 --> 01:01:08,054
And I know that, you know, I mean, you said it was a year ago.

498
01:01:08,694 --> 01:01:13,304
Oh, know, I'm actually getting ready to.

499
01:01:14,264 --> 01:01:17,834
I know what I think.

500
01:01:17,854 --> 01:01:55,584
The reason for that, I mean, I just you know, you want to I suppose that I know like I mean, I just I just want to be involved with it.

501
01:01:57,954 --> 01:02:03,704
And I just. I was hired by the respective.

502
01:02:05,074 --> 01:02:24,504
I never said I love you. I was like, Mary, or maybe you have to go through your parents.

503
01:02:25,344 --> 01:02:35,804
You know, this whole family who was one of our witnesses that you live 30 minutes away.

504
01:02:35,954 --> 01:02:49,144
She loves you. She wanted to do that for.

505
01:02:52,814 --> 01:02:56,504
Yeah. It's horrible.

506
01:02:57,104 --> 01:03:01,834
You know what you're doing outside of work?

507
01:03:02,864 --> 01:03:09,024
I mean, I don't care how I look like.

508
01:03:09,674 --> 01:03:14,834
I'll pretend that I used to be. I really need to be like this.

509
01:03:17,724 --> 01:03:21,644
You know, she. Are you nuts?

510
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,654
I know, right? Okay.

511
01:03:30,364 --> 01:03:38,434
I just want to show you this.

512
01:03:39,364 --> 01:03:44,994
You're gonna see everything we've all done wrong.

513
01:03:45,844 --> 01:03:50,584
I'm sorry. Oh, my God. I'm not gonna let to do my.

514
01:03:54,044 --> 01:04:02,864
Oh, my gosh. My sister is dead. That sounds like a wonderful person.

515
01:04:03,484 --> 01:04:07,154
It's a dog in a sweater. It's like a dog, winter.

516
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:10,634
I think it's important. The important stuff. I like you.

517
01:04:10,634 --> 01:04:14,264
Sent me some pictures of her dog in a holiday sweater.

518
01:04:14,414 --> 01:04:19,574
You're very lovely. So it's funny if you're into animals.

519
01:04:20,024 --> 01:04:24,884
Not everyone is. Adriana, take it away.

520
01:04:25,694 --> 01:04:29,834
I mean, I use it here and take it from now on.

521
01:04:30,794 --> 01:04:36,524
My undergraduate degree was in public health and I attended California State University.

522
01:04:37,864 --> 01:04:39,914
Required a lot of experience.

523
01:04:41,354 --> 01:04:53,054
Well, during the summer, I worked with immigrant populations in cyber security, and Dr. O'Neil and I both for my internship, added to internships.

524
01:04:54,014 --> 01:05:05,564
So I went to Mexico for the topic of my identity is understanding the relationship between health insurance,

525
01:05:05,564 --> 01:05:09,494
depression and participation among the U.S. population.

526
01:05:09,494 --> 01:05:20,174
In Mexico, which is a subtype of federal health insurance, about 57 million Mexicans are insured by means,

527
01:05:20,174 --> 01:05:23,474
and so it's one of the largest in the Western Hemisphere.

528
01:05:25,274 --> 01:05:31,244
And so that's I'm using that and that's an example, which is a mexican national survey.

529
01:05:32,174 --> 01:05:36,493
And I'm working with Dr. Dunn. That is my only.

530
01:05:36,494 --> 01:05:43,574
I'm currently on proving readiness for the analysis,

531
01:05:45,434 --> 01:05:54,394
although I'm a little worried about the rating part since only postgraduate programs are online right now.

532
01:05:54,404 --> 01:06:01,634
And I was going to go look out, but I'm a little bit worried about that as well.

533
01:06:02,294 --> 01:06:11,224
Many worry, and I think I want to enhance my skills in methods and social analysis.

534
01:06:11,234 --> 01:06:22,394
I'm also taking this class in this a little bit more about coding or, you know, more qualitative because it's not really my strong suit.

535
01:06:22,994 --> 01:06:25,514
Um, something I'm apprehensive about.

536
01:06:27,104 --> 01:06:38,024
As I mentioned, my future plans and many fellowships, something I'm grateful for are the things that I mean here in Miami.

537
01:06:38,924 --> 01:06:45,874
And it's one thing. Do you know?

538
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:50,104
Who did you say was your Ali adviser? Dr. John.

539
01:06:51,604 --> 01:06:54,684
Uh oh. Right, right, right. Okay.

540
01:06:54,704 --> 01:06:58,154
Who worked with you? And I said before you left.

541
01:06:58,154 --> 01:07:05,224
Okay. Okay. Wonderful. And then you also were working with a Ph.D. student.

542
01:07:05,284 --> 01:07:10,824
Yes. Okay. And is he based here in Michigan, ma'am?

543
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:19,674
Okay. Yeah. And remind me you were at the National Institute for Public Health in Mexico.

544
01:07:19,794 --> 01:07:23,824
Yeah, I spent some time in sort of that for myself.

545
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:29,394
So, yeah, I will look forward to your presentation to hear more about that.

546
01:07:29,624 --> 01:07:34,524
These are. All right.

547
01:07:34,824 --> 01:07:45,704
Thank you so much. Next I can use this guidance and I even pronounce my undergraduate degree in statistics heterogeneity.

548
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:54,013
How many global are you going to experience coming into the program? And then an internship was remote working on data from somewhere in Africa.

549
01:07:54,014 --> 01:07:59,624
So some other countries that I've been looking to build on my ideas on

550
01:08:00,194 --> 01:08:04,664
associations between natural disasters and child nutrition in Subsaharan Africa.

551
01:08:04,994 --> 01:08:12,894
My advisors, Dr. Emily Kurland at the Institute for Social Research, which is around three by the Q and then within pages,

552
01:08:12,924 --> 01:08:18,134
Dr. Wagner status just last week finished getting all the data together.

553
01:08:18,764 --> 01:08:23,474
So we're moving on to ready models and then writing after that.

554
01:08:23,924 --> 01:08:34,904
Pretty soon. So it's good plan, still working on it, but it's working somewhere in the view of her and her dogs and then going on topics.

555
01:08:34,914 --> 01:08:41,664
I think a lot of people are going to hear from the alumni because still pretty early in my job search and not sure exactly what I want to be doing it.

556
01:08:41,904 --> 01:08:48,134
But I love to hear about their experiences. Apprehensive about finishing the Iowa cause.

557
01:08:48,194 --> 01:08:52,694
We're kind of we're trying a model that I'm not super familiar with, so that doesn't work.

558
01:08:52,694 --> 01:08:56,204
We'll have to kind of go back and try something else.

559
01:08:57,744 --> 01:09:01,804
And I'm grateful because I guess we made it back from break. Relatively healthy.

560
01:09:01,814 --> 01:09:06,004
I know there was a lot of weather and travel issues, so I don't know if that's easy.

561
01:09:07,674 --> 01:09:21,894
That's great. Yeah. I personally spent some quality time in transit for days with and got to know the Minneapolis airport quite well.

562
01:09:23,574 --> 01:09:28,224
But it was actually cool because, you know, you meet different people.

563
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:34,674
They got to speak Spanish. There was a guy who did not speak English, so I was kind of helping him out.

564
01:09:34,674 --> 01:09:41,674
And it was it just kind of gives you, I don't know, a renewed interest in humanity.

565
01:09:41,694 --> 01:09:46,674
Not to say I wasn't annoyed during that. You know, a certain point.

566
01:09:46,674 --> 01:09:57,763
What can you do? You just have to go. So the fact that you studied statistics at Georgia Tech makes me think you probably also

567
01:09:57,764 --> 01:10:04,514
share the love of coding or the kind of job I've been doing it for a long time now.

568
01:10:04,514 --> 01:10:07,784
So that's probably my favorite. Right. Right.

569
01:10:08,294 --> 01:10:11,674
And then the last thing is, I'm just curious.

570
01:10:11,684 --> 01:10:16,664
We'll hear more. But the the data sets that you're using from sub-Saharan Africa,

571
01:10:16,664 --> 01:10:23,804
are those publicly available or it's data with a sense that often data comes the but it's also available.

572
01:10:24,054 --> 01:10:30,034
Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's that's interesting because in the past I've had.

573
01:10:30,964 --> 01:10:39,904
Students who work with DHS data, but then connected it with climate data and reinforce each other, things like that.

574
01:10:39,914 --> 01:10:50,194
And so it's a really rich data source that, you know, some global health EPI folks, it hasn't been covered in any of your classes.

575
01:10:50,344 --> 01:10:59,604
Yeah. Okay. Which one? It was just covered in 643 with me out of Boston where she just she really went over that other things.

576
01:10:59,674 --> 01:11:04,294
The DHS. Okay. Okay, great. Yeah. Yes.

577
01:11:05,104 --> 01:11:14,944
The other was one of the students at the time who didn't get the start was I think she's great.

578
01:11:15,184 --> 01:11:21,904
All right. Thank you so much. Um, can I can't live on her.

579
01:11:21,904 --> 01:11:33,694
Another she her. I did my undergraduate at Michigan State University and it was biology with a minor in Spanish and global health epidemiology.

580
01:11:34,474 --> 01:11:40,144
I don't really know where the global health came into that minor because we have mostly focused on some epidemiology methods.

581
01:11:42,694 --> 01:11:46,474
Global experience. I spent my summer in Ecuador.

582
01:11:47,764 --> 01:11:53,934
Technically definitely working with an uncommon. Right.

583
01:11:54,094 --> 01:11:57,454
Is it technically Dr. Lee's personal expenses?

584
01:11:57,904 --> 01:12:01,824
Yeah. Yeah. My alias, Dr. Lee as well.

585
01:12:01,834 --> 01:12:08,674
But like officially Dr. Eisenberg, I'm looking at pre and post on depression and breastfeeding.

586
01:12:10,834 --> 01:12:16,834
I have my data sets on set, ready to go in a very, very rough introduction to that.

587
01:12:17,704 --> 01:12:25,414
I'm a little worried about doing the models this semester post-graduate plans, looking for jobs,

588
01:12:25,684 --> 01:12:31,324
not sure what, rather than I'm kind of applying for it because I'm like related ones.

589
01:12:31,324 --> 01:12:37,593
And then some are some governmental ones and all of the board for health topics I agree with.

590
01:12:37,594 --> 01:12:45,364
Whereas like roaming about health systems everywhere is important because it feels very centric here.

591
01:12:47,734 --> 01:12:55,264
I'm apprehensive about live this semester looking for jobs doing I am me and then transferred on top of all of that.

592
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:59,523
I am grateful for my family support for sure.

593
01:12:59,524 --> 01:13:02,644
And I have my very support system as well.

594
01:13:05,884 --> 01:13:10,953
Right. So we do have a couple of MSU alumni, which is wonderful.

595
01:13:10,954 --> 01:13:22,504
I have I had one student who, in addition to the usual things you put on an application, indicated that he was Sparty mascot.

596
01:13:22,504 --> 01:13:27,404
And that was like that was kind of all I wanted to hear about because it is really interesting too.

597
01:13:27,454 --> 01:13:31,404
You know, it's not easy to get a job as a mascot and and in fact,

598
01:13:31,414 --> 01:13:42,584
you can them with a certain hydrangea and stuff to too and the costume is hot and I don't think you can divulge until after.

599
01:13:43,354 --> 01:13:52,924
And then he was even though Lansing loves not just like a baseball team, so he was really into being a mascot.

600
01:13:53,074 --> 01:14:01,773
I think he went on to get a diverse interest.

601
01:14:01,774 --> 01:14:07,764
So anyway, and I heard there are some wonderful folks at MSU and you know,

602
01:14:09,754 --> 01:14:18,484
it's nice to have that cross connection and collaboration, including what is going on.

603
01:14:18,564 --> 01:14:26,244
And there's a big collaboration with the environmental influences on child health outcomes at Cornell,

604
01:14:26,284 --> 01:14:33,964
which is a group of multiple cohorts from across the U.S. and that's led by my daughter Hannah and others.

605
01:14:34,024 --> 01:14:39,544
And so and so that's a real a strong connection between MSU and here.

606
01:14:40,414 --> 01:14:46,354
So great. Thank you. Next.

607
01:14:46,624 --> 01:14:55,834
Uh, hello I'm Janet down my pronouns is she her or any and that my undergraduate degree is from University

608
01:14:55,834 --> 01:15:03,334
of California San Diego in global health and I minored in political science and analytics.

609
01:15:05,164 --> 01:15:11,853
My topic is, uh, food insecurity in relation to food environment.

610
01:15:11,854 --> 01:15:16,444
Nothing in real close to Ecuador and my advisory is officially about that.

611
01:15:16,444 --> 01:15:19,534
I am the unofficially doctor we.

612
01:15:22,594 --> 01:15:26,074
The status of my IOU, I had to make I do with that.

613
01:15:26,084 --> 01:15:29,914
So I started further behind and moved on.

614
01:15:29,974 --> 01:15:41,793
And so my data sets almost complete. Uh, and I have an interaction very, very roughly written postgraduate prints as well.

615
01:15:41,794 --> 01:15:49,804
Big job man. Preferably I would used to do international like a boots on the ground kind of job.

616
01:15:50,274 --> 01:15:55,934
I don't want to sit in a cubicle, but um. At the very any w um.

617
01:15:57,614 --> 01:16:01,004
Under my global health experience when I was an undergrad, I did a.

618
01:16:02,434 --> 01:16:09,214
Uh, I did a research project in that research, and I did a lot of volunteer projects with some students from Yale.

619
01:16:09,334 --> 01:16:19,594
We went to Guatemala. And we're going to Mobile Health Clinic up in the at the Lake Atlanta area, which is very cool and really into me.

620
01:16:20,134 --> 01:16:25,953
And I realized I had no interest in the public sphere of pre-med things.

621
01:16:25,954 --> 01:16:32,494
And I realized that somehow this much more important things I'd like to enhance.

622
01:16:34,384 --> 01:16:42,783
I have a really huge interest in indigenous and rural health and that's often kind of glazed over by health discrimination.

623
01:16:42,784 --> 01:16:46,264
And I'd love to hear more about what's what's out there.

624
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:52,674
The thing I'm apprehensive about is getting a job.

625
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:57,994
That's a big step. Like at I just went straight from undergrad.

626
01:16:58,004 --> 01:17:06,114
So here I am now. Something I'm grateful for that my flight didn't get canceled.

627
01:17:06,164 --> 01:17:11,623
From the bomb cyclone on the West Coast. A tree went down by a huge 150 year old tree.

628
01:17:11,624 --> 01:17:15,914
Went down my yard. But everything's fine.

629
01:17:16,874 --> 01:17:22,394
Everything's good. It hit anything. You're from California originally?

630
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:26,674
Yeah. That was where I was stranded in Irvine.

631
01:17:26,684 --> 01:17:32,444
So I guess there were some places I know, but I really wanted to get to see my father.

632
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:36,624
So it was, you know, it was 75 degrees in Irvine.

633
01:17:36,624 --> 01:17:42,114
And I was hearing about all the cancellations, but it wasn't 75 degrees in Minneapolis.

634
01:17:45,464 --> 01:17:56,144
Well, great. Thank you, John. I just was I wanted to ask I I know a professor at UCSD y0l the one.

635
01:17:57,474 --> 01:18:02,094
I'm probably pronouncing his name correctly, but he's a prince.

636
01:18:02,154 --> 01:18:04,643
Vaguely familiar. Okay. Yeah, he.

637
01:18:04,644 --> 01:18:13,314
He I think he's originally from Lebanon and he just sent me an email recently because he's doing some work on climate change and,

638
01:18:13,764 --> 01:18:19,674
and health in the Middle East and other places. And he just started at UCSD.

639
01:18:19,694 --> 01:18:23,754
He has a really good. Public health program.

640
01:18:25,254 --> 01:18:27,294
The public health program doesn't keep track.

641
01:18:27,834 --> 01:18:38,603
So when I was in the department two years and then I came on, so the global health program is the one that allowed us to increase.

642
01:18:38,604 --> 01:18:43,134
Even though there is differentiation, it's really small at that.

643
01:18:43,134 --> 01:18:47,334
I don't think that's pretty similar, but yeah, interesting.

644
01:18:49,074 --> 01:18:54,433
All right. Thank you, Jenna. I can tell you my name is Audrey.

645
01:18:54,434 --> 01:19:03,044
Go. And she had gone nuts. I went to Bowling Green down in Ohio and studied public health with a concentration in environmental toxins.

646
01:19:03,914 --> 01:19:11,893
And during undergrad I did a couple of global volunteer trips that really opened my eyes to was a global public health problem.

647
01:19:11,894 --> 01:19:16,734
And then my internship, my undergrad internship in Durban, South Africa,

648
01:19:16,734 --> 01:19:22,424
and working with some HIV data and some clinics there and cognitive launched me into

649
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:28,273
working with them because they actually saw I highly recommend one of her projects,

650
01:19:28,274 --> 01:19:34,544
which is food insecurity and her vision cognitive decline, specifically in the healthy cohort in South Africa.

651
01:19:36,024 --> 01:19:42,894
Currently I'd say that I'm pretty open to writing my opinion about how to do, but I'm really worried about the data.

652
01:19:43,284 --> 01:19:46,704
A lot of planning to do that. That's kind of my priority at the moment.

653
01:19:47,934 --> 01:19:53,664
And after I graduated, I actually work for a natural disaster recovery organization currently.

654
01:19:54,384 --> 01:19:59,544
I did my medical term with them and the term under that in grad school, and I've been working with them since.

655
01:19:59,964 --> 01:20:06,894
And they actually just accepted and started in my new job with them and hoping to continue that after graduation.

656
01:20:08,094 --> 01:20:12,504
So that kind of goes into what I'm grateful for. So I'm excited about that.

657
01:20:14,354 --> 01:20:20,054
And then number five, the global hot topic. I'd like I'd like to be a little bit more confident in my field work experience.

658
01:20:20,054 --> 01:20:28,513
I feel like epidemiology, I think we haven't necessarily touched on that in terms of health systems and global health systems and how our agencies,

659
01:20:28,514 --> 01:20:33,464
especially the governmental agencies, can better partner. I think we haven't necessarily talked about that.

660
01:20:33,464 --> 01:20:38,324
It's. Same. A little bit more about that when you do.

661
01:20:38,444 --> 01:20:43,154
Public health agencies can partner with whomever.

662
01:20:43,514 --> 01:20:50,294
So I specifically, I kind of refer to like emergency preparedness because I think that requires a lot of like local,

663
01:20:50,294 --> 01:20:51,914
state and governmental partnerships,

664
01:20:52,334 --> 01:20:58,334
especially thinking about how disasters and becoming more and more international and a lot of those agencies working together,

665
01:20:58,334 --> 01:21:06,913
that's something that I feel like I don't quite understand as much as I would like to, but I know that's very interesting as well.

666
01:21:06,914 --> 01:21:18,524
So understanding that. Well, I I'm interested in that because there's actually a pilot project on emergency preparedness in Detroit and how,

667
01:21:18,554 --> 01:21:24,824
you know, yeah, there are a lot of things between flooding and certain parts of Detroit.

668
01:21:24,824 --> 01:21:36,164
There's a lot of contamination. And so floods come and, you know, heat or various things, it's it's a challenge both internationally and domestically.

669
01:21:36,164 --> 01:21:43,844
So that's one of the components that we're thinking about is how who are the actors

670
01:21:43,994 --> 01:21:49,574
and how can they act together so that the response is timely and effective.

671
01:21:50,354 --> 01:21:53,574
So. Well, thank you.

672
01:21:53,724 --> 01:22:01,944
Yeah. Oh, Jen, I did want to ask you, you you said you're doing food insecurity.

673
01:22:02,874 --> 01:22:05,874
Is are you using maps of, like, food?

674
01:22:06,474 --> 01:22:11,424
Are you using any kind of GIS components, or is it like a little bit?

675
01:22:11,774 --> 01:22:15,334
Um, this summer I did I actually is a student.

676
01:22:15,564 --> 01:22:15,893
I was,

677
01:22:15,894 --> 01:22:25,674
I think my walking around for about like taking down all the locations and the decapitations and then what each store sold and what each vendor.

678
01:22:25,914 --> 01:22:29,424
So, um. So it's a little bit. Yeah.

679
01:22:31,814 --> 01:22:37,244
I'm still trying to clear the air, so I'm going to see if I can go more on it.

680
01:22:39,854 --> 01:22:48,944
There's a lot of information already collected from somewhere in that town that targets adolescent obesity.

681
01:22:48,954 --> 01:22:50,984
So there's a little bit of that.

682
01:22:50,994 --> 01:22:58,064
Also, has the scores in there you're going to see about what's being sold in relation to the food and security location,

683
01:22:58,664 --> 01:23:02,324
like where they're located versus not. It's not what happened.

684
01:23:02,954 --> 01:23:06,044
Thank you. Yeah, it's interesting.

685
01:23:06,044 --> 01:23:13,363
I guess in the rural that, you know, there's there's not as many, you know, food establishments.

686
01:23:13,364 --> 01:23:16,744
So it can actually be done by more so.

687
01:23:17,714 --> 01:23:21,794
All right. Thank you. Yes.

688
01:23:21,884 --> 01:23:28,514
Hello. Sorry. Welcome back from break. And my name is Brooke, where I just heard chromosomes.

689
01:23:28,994 --> 01:23:33,074
The undergraduate degree is in Community Health from CUNY Hunter College.

690
01:23:34,034 --> 01:23:40,273
They're my global hub experience, as you all know, me and also them to come home for the summer.

691
01:23:40,274 --> 01:23:51,074
And we worked out of an HIV clinic at a government hospital along with some side projects are teaching hospital in the months in Ghana it was.

692
01:23:52,714 --> 01:23:57,033
During an exploratory charter review. Ideally would have been an early for me,

693
01:23:57,034 --> 01:24:05,404
but the data just wasn't robust enough and it really turned into a feasibility study about like working and researching

694
01:24:05,404 --> 01:24:11,694
resource settings and how that might play out and different types of barriers and things that we're experience.

695
01:24:12,784 --> 01:24:21,484
So in the same vein of HIV, I'm still doing that as a topic and I'm looking at predictors of different sorts of knowledge,

696
01:24:21,484 --> 01:24:24,574
beliefs and attitudes towards people living with HIV.

697
01:24:24,574 --> 01:24:28,654
And I'm using the DHS data set in Liberia.

698
01:24:30,544 --> 01:24:39,544
My I'll be professor is Dr. Wagner, but we have a mentorship with him and Dr. Sharon White was our contact.

699
01:24:39,934 --> 01:24:43,024
We're gonna have a forum.

700
01:24:43,044 --> 01:24:47,154
I, I, I have a methods draft.

701
01:24:47,674 --> 01:24:54,274
That's about it. But I do have data, so that's promising. So, you know, just sort of on, on that.

702
01:24:56,374 --> 01:24:59,484
I mean, I don't have many post-graduate plans.

703
01:24:59,494 --> 01:25:00,894
I'm just going to move somewhere else.

704
01:25:00,914 --> 01:25:08,224
I'm going to go wherever the wind takes me and find the jobs and fellowships and just like networking and seeing what's out there.

705
01:25:08,944 --> 01:25:20,464
So you can ask me in a few months. We don't have a lot of plans, and I agree that you should learn more about different health care systems.

706
01:25:20,464 --> 01:25:27,543
And like like we're taking some of those or taking your health economics class on a global scale.

707
01:25:27,544 --> 01:25:32,254
And I think that's going to be like very important context added to our degrees.

708
01:25:32,254 --> 01:25:39,574
So I think some more like steerage stuff might be nice on global scale.

709
01:25:43,624 --> 01:25:47,014
To us. What am I apprehensive about?

710
01:25:47,134 --> 01:25:50,734
A lot of things, but public speaking is one of them.

711
01:25:50,734 --> 01:25:55,414
So I'm nervous about the presentation, which is why I signed up for the first week.

712
01:25:55,574 --> 01:25:58,744
So you already signed up, so I don't know.

713
01:25:59,854 --> 01:26:08,494
Um, but I guess I'm also nervous about my idea because it's the first time I've done something like super hands on like that,

714
01:26:08,494 --> 01:26:15,393
and I just hope it goes well. Um, I am grateful to have you all colleagues cause I feel like I learn something

715
01:26:15,394 --> 01:26:19,374
new every time somebody says something in class or at the side conversation.

716
01:26:19,684 --> 01:26:23,284
So I think that's really great just to have.

717
01:26:23,794 --> 01:26:32,584
And reflections. Throughout the two years I've been here, so much has changed and things keep changing.

718
01:26:32,584 --> 01:26:38,204
And that doesn't sound so. Just get used to that.

719
01:26:38,924 --> 01:26:44,323
What do you mean? So much as changed. Just. Well, I mean, in every way.

720
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:52,123
But, like, for my topic, my know you out because I mean, they search me is just not enough.

721
01:26:52,124 --> 01:26:57,974
There are barriers. There are just like unexpected things that we had to turn and change and adjust and, you know.

722
01:26:59,054 --> 01:27:02,494
I just day to day stuff. Yeah. Yes.

723
01:27:02,854 --> 01:27:10,024
The nature and this this health economics plus, is that a public health class or.

724
01:27:10,564 --> 01:27:15,904
Yes, it's all unions and it's good at the department,

725
01:27:15,904 --> 01:27:23,094
but it has a good it has like other undergrads in it as well and some people from HP

726
01:27:23,144 --> 01:27:28,524
generate generated its conference I've been six six is the class number assignments.

727
01:27:29,654 --> 01:27:33,364
Yeah. Yeah yeah. Something like that as well.

728
01:27:33,964 --> 01:27:36,964
It's okay. Yeah.

729
01:27:37,954 --> 01:27:41,074
Oh right. Right. Yes I would say yes. Okay.

730
01:27:43,294 --> 01:27:48,274
Yes, he does. Yeah. Okay, great.

731
01:27:48,484 --> 01:27:51,933
Thank you, brother. Oh, I'm sorry.

732
01:27:51,934 --> 01:27:55,564
I'm not good at public. Oh, no, no worries.

733
01:27:55,954 --> 01:28:02,884
So if I remember just my name is Kennedy.

734
01:28:02,884 --> 01:28:10,474
My pronouns are she heard us. I went here for an interest in public health and this was political.

735
01:28:11,674 --> 01:28:19,743
And I'm studying abroad and I really have like specific global health experience as an undergraduate.

736
01:28:19,744 --> 01:28:27,064
But, um, for my summer internship I was, that is a room where I worked on an internal in child health coverage.

737
01:28:28,234 --> 01:28:34,004
And um, from my only, I'm working with doctors and all this and I, um.

738
01:28:35,474 --> 01:28:45,134
It's kind of hard to describe it, but it's like examining the associations between the demographics and clinical characteristics of.

739
01:28:46,904 --> 01:28:54,594
HIV and TB contracted patients in their HIV treatment, status and HIV treatment.

740
01:28:55,664 --> 01:29:03,944
So I'm pretty much done with the data analysis part and I'm like maybe halfway down on the experience,

741
01:29:04,184 --> 01:29:12,044
but I think I have to redo my data analysis because the narrowed down my dataset to like a certain

742
01:29:12,044 --> 01:29:21,404
amount of people and then like my exclusion criteria were or contracted to get those current plans.

743
01:29:21,854 --> 01:29:27,194
I just want to find a job and I think I want to go more so into data science.

744
01:29:27,194 --> 01:29:36,614
And also for some of the graduates, its inherent in global health topics of skills that I want to discuss and enhance as well.

745
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:39,834
So I'm also looking forward to the panel.

746
01:29:41,284 --> 01:29:51,404
But then that apprehensive about just post-grad plans and um, finding a job that kind of like combines data science and genealogy.

747
01:29:51,404 --> 01:30:00,074
This also, I feel like. I feel like a lot of jobs and probably hopefully not only compensation for your life, your words.

748
01:30:00,464 --> 01:30:08,984
So I really want to find something that's like the word pain and in my soul, something that I'm enjoying and grateful for my friends and family.

749
01:30:11,504 --> 01:30:17,954
Thank you so much. And Ali, I was yeah.

750
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:24,373
I just learned a student who is now in the early tract and a woman went to Israel.

751
01:30:24,374 --> 01:30:27,514
So I think she started in P.A. Yeah.

752
01:30:27,524 --> 01:30:37,814
You know, this is the program. I I'm aware that you need to leave for your class, so I will let you go next.

753
01:30:39,584 --> 01:30:43,724
Yeah. Hello. My name is Eliza Anwar. And she her pronouns.

754
01:30:44,774 --> 01:30:47,894
I undergraduate degrees in anthropology and biology.

755
01:30:49,394 --> 01:30:55,723
I'm a bit older than the average student here in this program, so I'll give the highlights of my global experience.

756
01:30:55,724 --> 01:31:00,884
The main one being I was a community health advisor in rural Madagascar with the Peace Corps for two years,

757
01:31:01,964 --> 01:31:07,394
which has really just been the highlight of everything.

758
01:31:10,634 --> 01:31:17,654
And also was what allowed me to decide that maternal and child health was the avenue that I wanted to go through

759
01:31:19,034 --> 01:31:25,814
and also recognize my own limitations in terms of these other aspects of the field that just aren't for me,

760
01:31:26,174 --> 01:31:32,594
which was really valuable to learn. Number two So the topic of my alley has changed.

761
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:36,824
Near the end of last semester. So I worked with Brooke over the summer in Ghana.

762
01:31:38,204 --> 01:31:43,734
My particular project was working on a stigma survey instrument that specific about us

763
01:31:45,224 --> 01:31:51,404
quantifying experiences in relation to HIV aids experienced by individuals positive status.

764
01:31:53,564 --> 01:31:58,393
Things are going great, but we ran into some issues with the IAB Ghana as approved by IAB.

765
01:31:58,394 --> 01:32:02,084
But the University of Michigan has rejected Ghana's IAB decision.

766
01:32:02,774 --> 01:32:08,484
So we really don't know what's going to happen in terms of any changes that Michigan might ask and how Ghana is going to feel about that.

767
01:32:08,504 --> 01:32:12,644
So it's been a ride. And have they already collected the data?

768
01:32:12,914 --> 01:32:18,223
No, they're still working on it in terms of, well, we have to wait for all of the IAB.

769
01:32:18,224 --> 01:32:19,543
And with that, we were able to start.

770
01:32:19,544 --> 01:32:25,154
The new mission has made it clear that they do not respect Ghana's IAB decision and that we need to go through them.

771
01:32:25,394 --> 01:32:36,103
So yeah, so we're not really sure, especially if they ask for changes, if Ghana is going to accept those changes either.

772
01:32:36,104 --> 01:32:48,014
So that's a huge ordeal. So now we're working with DHS data, with Liberia, working with similar similar data that we would anticipate for Liberia.

773
01:32:49,514 --> 01:32:55,514
Learning about that has been really interesting. I advise all of you to do a quick Google search on Liberia and the history of Liberia,

774
01:32:55,514 --> 01:33:02,234
because it is the deepest, darkest thing I think I've ever read in my life. So and you guys will know more about that.

775
01:33:02,624 --> 01:33:05,984
Everything. I just don't even think.

776
01:33:07,914 --> 01:33:12,683
Yeah, it's man, it's dark. It's really dark.

777
01:33:12,684 --> 01:33:20,334
And I would say I would almost argue that library is probably the most invisible national population in the world just days after during the history.

778
01:33:20,654 --> 01:33:24,084
It's people are not ready to have discussions about the things that happened there.

779
01:33:25,164 --> 01:33:32,754
So just letting you guys know. Um, so the status is, it's very new and that we're working along with that.

780
01:33:32,754 --> 01:33:35,934
But since we're using DHS data, it's nice to have an actual data set.

781
01:33:37,344 --> 01:33:41,094
Post-Graduate plans. The biggest thing is I just want to be a normal person.

782
01:33:42,024 --> 01:33:45,984
I want to have normal work hours. I want to be compensated for my work.

783
01:33:48,804 --> 01:33:58,884
Yeah, that's the biggest thing. Number five, I think the biggest thing about the program.

784
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:06,933
Is that I feel like we could talk a lot more about ethics and and I wish that

785
01:34:06,934 --> 01:34:11,044
every step that we took in the process of ethics was a part of that conversation.

786
01:34:11,464 --> 01:34:14,194
And I think in global health in particular, that's really important,

787
01:34:14,374 --> 01:34:22,353
especially especially having discussions in terms of like what is our role as privileged Americans walking

788
01:34:22,354 --> 01:34:27,964
into other countries and how our identities and our positions change as we walk into other situations.

789
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:35,763
And that's something we really haven't taken a lot of time to discuss, something we can't really do much about in this class.

790
01:34:35,764 --> 01:34:41,014
As I also wish we did more writing because the program has been very examination based and we haven't done a lot of writing.

791
01:34:44,704 --> 01:34:50,284
And young. That's a very important skill. Number six, something I'm apprehensive about is.

792
01:34:53,464 --> 01:35:03,334
My eye is just starting on a new topic and then, of course, transitioning into a new life with a job post-graduation.

793
01:35:04,684 --> 01:35:08,014
As I learned in the Peace Corps and my other job experience, this is in the past.

794
01:35:08,194 --> 01:35:11,314
It's one thing to learn about these things, but it's another thing to work in it,

795
01:35:11,314 --> 01:35:17,373
especially dealing with the bureaucracy and the administrative aspects and even being

796
01:35:17,374 --> 01:35:22,834
pushed to do things that are unethical sometimes and finding ways to navigate around that.

797
01:35:23,404 --> 01:35:28,264
And so that's something I'm a bit fearful of and apprehensive about post-graduation.

798
01:35:28,984 --> 01:35:32,134
Number seven, something I'm thankful for is all of you, for sure.

799
01:35:32,284 --> 01:35:36,424
For my family. And, yeah, that's it.

800
01:35:36,874 --> 01:35:40,414
Thank you. Yeah.

801
01:35:40,564 --> 01:35:45,064
That was something that Alexis brought up was that she felt coverage of ethics.

802
01:35:45,214 --> 01:35:48,904
Yeah, that's something that people seem very interested in.

803
01:35:50,344 --> 01:35:54,064
Yeah. So I think we should definitely talk more about that because it is something.

804
01:35:55,094 --> 01:36:01,204
A theme, but an important theme even in terms of setting up internships and that.

805
01:36:01,354 --> 01:36:06,024
So thank you. Okay. Okay.

806
01:36:07,444 --> 01:36:10,534
So my name is I see this image of Fernando.

807
01:36:10,534 --> 01:36:15,364
She her hers. So I was actually an undergrad student here at Michigan.

808
01:36:16,294 --> 01:36:19,564
I was a double major in biomolecular science and studies.

809
01:36:19,894 --> 01:36:30,384
And then within our office, we have the opportunity to sort of pursue a more specific concentration of mine was global health and environment.

810
01:36:30,394 --> 01:36:34,504
I believe the same GHG initiative. I just can't remember what they mean.

811
01:36:35,914 --> 01:36:39,813
And through undergrad and I think maybe my most recent global health experiences

812
01:36:39,814 --> 01:36:45,124
this past summer I was in India for my internship and I got to work with.

813
01:36:46,354 --> 01:36:50,974
You're kind of like a government adjacent organization called the Indian Institute of Public Health.

814
01:36:51,454 --> 01:36:55,564
So that was really cool. And I'm hoping to continue working with them.

815
01:36:55,564 --> 01:37:01,114
For me at least, I faced a few hurdles. I don't really have access to my data.

816
01:37:03,094 --> 01:37:07,264
So trying to do that. But hopefully once that happens, I will be set.

817
01:37:09,034 --> 01:37:12,904
And I'm working with Dr. Kobayashi here as my official guys are.

818
01:37:12,904 --> 01:37:16,014
And in India, I have different collaborators.

819
01:37:17,344 --> 01:37:21,724
And then on the potential post-graduate plans,

820
01:37:22,444 --> 01:37:28,054
like everyone here I think is hoping to get the job and hoping that like that something works out

821
01:37:28,054 --> 01:37:34,774
in the field in some capacity and the global health topics or skills that I'd want to discuss,

822
01:37:35,764 --> 01:37:41,134
something that I learned from Dr. Eisenberg's class last semester is just I have this urgent interest in climate

823
01:37:41,134 --> 01:37:48,933
change and the environmental changes and their role in exacerbating or perpetuating public health issues,

824
01:37:48,934 --> 01:37:54,834
especially for us. And I'm really interested in continuing that.

825
01:37:55,024 --> 01:38:00,184
I think it's really interesting. I had never really considered it that extent before, so I like to know more about it.

826
01:38:01,684 --> 01:38:06,664
Something I think I'm very, very apprehensive about my. I'm terrified about how it's going to end up.

827
01:38:08,374 --> 01:38:14,474
But, you know, I think a lot of people are, too. And then something I'm grateful for and.

828
01:38:15,824 --> 01:38:22,303
And before that, this is my last semester in academia and I'm going to be like hoping to apply to med school.

829
01:38:22,304 --> 01:38:25,844
But I'm taking a break and I'm excited for that break very much right now.

830
01:38:26,794 --> 01:38:30,074
I yeah. No reflections here. Thank you.

831
01:38:31,244 --> 01:38:33,824
Notes. Last but not least.

832
01:38:34,844 --> 01:38:45,614
Hello, my name's Priya and she her pronouns and I got my bachelors in public health and an environmental science minor at Wayne State in Detroit.

833
01:38:46,304 --> 01:38:56,324
Um, my IOU, I'm looking at the association between indoor air pollution exposure and active TB cases in India,

834
01:38:56,984 --> 01:39:09,704
and my advisor, Dr. Dhar, I did not do my summer internship with this project, so I am still in the very early stages.

835
01:39:10,874 --> 01:39:14,624
I'm doing a few things at the same time I have access to my data,

836
01:39:14,624 --> 01:39:19,933
so I'm just kind of looking through the dataset and identifying like seeing how I

837
01:39:19,934 --> 01:39:28,513
want to define like my outcome and exposure and then potential covariates to test.

838
01:39:28,514 --> 01:39:33,704
And then I'm also working on the introduction and post-graduate plans.

839
01:39:34,254 --> 01:39:46,453
I would love to work for the organization that I interned with during the summer and I'm still interning with them and they they're

840
01:39:46,454 --> 01:39:57,044
like a government organization and they serve indigenous people and like this Great Lakes area called Great Lakes Intertribal.

841
01:39:57,194 --> 01:40:01,544
Okay. Yeah, we have a yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

842
01:40:01,784 --> 01:40:05,294
She's my supervisor. Oh, wonderful. Okay. Um.

843
01:40:07,164 --> 01:40:09,053
A global hot topic that I'm interested.

844
01:40:09,054 --> 01:40:18,294
I'm really excited for, like a one health lecture because I really like that intersection between like environment and health.

845
01:40:19,224 --> 01:40:27,474
And something that I'm apprehensive about is the data analysis from my own doctor Dar's an amazing, amazing advisor.

846
01:40:27,474 --> 01:40:35,544
So like, I'm going to be fine, but I'm just like, this was and then something that I'm grateful for is all of my friends here.

847
01:40:37,824 --> 01:40:43,914
Great. Well, thank you. It's really been great to get to know all of you.

848
01:40:44,084 --> 01:40:51,474
And like I said, we have a two week break and I am going to reflect on.

849
01:40:53,094 --> 01:41:02,474
Your suggestions. And I the next time we meet, you will see the course schedule more populated with some of these things.

850
01:41:02,484 --> 01:41:06,203
Some of them are, you know, I have the line up already,

851
01:41:06,204 --> 01:41:12,494
but I'm going to have to look into this health systems that I want to just bring your attention.

852
01:41:12,504 --> 01:41:19,223
Some of you have already and signed up quickly.

853
01:41:19,224 --> 01:41:26,183
So, you know, just feel free to sign up at your leisure.

854
01:41:26,184 --> 01:41:33,924
And I'm really looking forward to hearing from all of you and that will serve you some other folks.

855
01:41:34,104 --> 01:41:38,274
So thanks. Welcome to class. Happy New Year.

856
01:41:38,274 --> 01:41:51,474
Nice to meet all of you. I thought I thought I looked at all the kids who has nothing last year did not understand.

857
01:41:53,404 --> 01:42:02,054
Internationally as well. So we've got to get some help if we can.

858
01:42:02,494 --> 01:42:05,674
Frances. All right.

859
01:42:06,514 --> 01:42:10,744
All right. I hear that, Marcia.
