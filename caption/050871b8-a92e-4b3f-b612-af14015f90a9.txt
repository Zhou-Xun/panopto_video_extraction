1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,720
Your name before you ask the question. So thank you so much.

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:12,130
I'm going to do an introduction to Commander Garza and then I'm going to start talking.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:21,310
So Commander Elizabeth Garza began her commission corps career with the HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response,

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,829
which now we found out from Dr. BIDDINGER last week,

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:30,250
has renamed itself as a research officer in the Biomedical Advanced Research Development and Development Authority.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,420
There she was able to conduct research on several public health, medical,

7
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:39,940
emergency preparedness and response topics ranging from pandemic influenza to anthrax.

8
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:47,380
In 2008, Commander Garza joined the HHS Office of Global Health Affairs as an international health analyst.

9
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:51,760
In that role, she served as project officer for the Afghanistan Health Initiative,

10
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:57,549
which focused on strengthening maternal and child health, as well as improving outcomes of mothers and newborns.

11
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:05,200
In Kabul in 2009, Commander Garza joined the CDC, NAIA, where she serves as a public health advisor.

12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:12,520
And that's how we know each other. And her focus is on health equity and serving underserved through national partnerships.

13
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:16,870
She works to ensure high level technical science is translated and makes its way

14
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:21,550
to the hands of workers so they can protect their health and safety on the job.

15
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,980
Major Garza also serves as a response leader on the CDC Global Rapid Response Team.

16
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:32,110
She's deployed over 20 times to places in Central and South America,

17
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:37,900
disasters in the U.S., Mozambique, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and many more.

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,100
She earned her MPH in global health from George Washington University.

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,160
Her B.S. is in biology, biology and international relations from the College of William Mary and is

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,940
certified in public health by the National Board of Public Health Examiners.

21
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,400
She also completed a grad certificate in Global Health Management in February 2020 from the Uniformed Services University of Health Science CES,

22
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,470
and is an active member of the Fairfax County Medical Reserve Board.

23
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,900
Check out her full biography because she's done a lot of super cool stuff and all of her accomplishments.

24
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:15,010
I posted that on Candace and Commander Garza.

25
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,669
I will let you take it away from here. Okay, great.

26
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,310
Let me just make sure I am sharing my right screen. So let me try that first and let me know what you see.

27
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:33,220
Yes, I see it. And you just need to put it in shear mode. Or does that put it in share mode?

28
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:39,630
Yes. Okay. All right. Great. So then thank you for the kind intro.

29
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:46,810
And Dr. Lee, I am Commander Garza, and I was asked to present you today on the national capabilities.

30
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:55,300
We have to respond to emergencies and infectious disease outbreaks, including the US, which is the United States Public Health Service.

31
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:02,050
Here is a photo, I think, of a start in our nation's capital. I am behind the flag all day on the right side.

32
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:05,260
But yes, I am in this photo and can see here.

33
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:11,320
These are three of our most common forms that we have in the Public Health Service.

34
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,829
And I'm going to say it like feel free to jump in. Like, I want this to be interactive.

35
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,240
I will talk in the beginning about some of the higher level stuff and then kind of my journey.

36
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:26,060
So as you have questions, you have me, I can't see you, but I've been told that you guys would jump in and ask along the way.

37
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,629
So what I will cover today is what is our national response framework look like?

38
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:37,200
And I know you said you had Dr. BIDDINGER last year, last week.

39
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,900
So trying not to cover what you cover. What are our capabilities to respond nationally?

40
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:49,050
Who usually responds? And then the public health service, who we are, what we do.

41
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,510
I'll finish with kind of my my response story.

42
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,530
I know I was asked to speak on emergencies and infectious disease outbreaks.

43
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,889
I'm going to call this responding to a public health emergency.

44
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,410
And last week you learned this definition from FEMA.

45
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,170
So pretty much what you see is definition really a public health emergency can be almost anything,

46
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,550
anything that impacts lives and protecting public health and safety.

47
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:23,749
So vessels that come with some of that high level national side of things, the PPD,

48
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:30,260
PDA policy directive on national preparedness preparedness depends on efforts at all levels,

49
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:36,349
including individuals and communities, private and nonprofit sectors, faith based organizations,

50
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:42,770
and all levels of government, local, regional, state, tribal, territorial and federal.

51
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,360
So the contributions of all must be integrated into preparedness efforts,

52
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,340
and the needs of all must be addressed in planning for the development of response capabilities.

53
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:57,350
The whole community includes individuals, families, businesses, as I mentioned,

54
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,980
faith and community based organizations, nonprofits, schools, academia, media outlets, all levels of government.

55
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:11,840
When all levels of government become engaged, a response is federally supported, state managed, and locally executed with tribes,

56
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:16,940
territories and what are called insular area governments, often managing the response as well.

57
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:24,169
I know you learned all of this last week, so I'm sure you know everything about it.

58
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:27,380
So put it all on one side. So we're only going to see it here once.

59
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:35,210
But this is kind of the start of the national preparedness. Go all go down to the national preparedness system and the national response framework.

60
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:41,090
So the national response framework is one of five national frameworks within the national preparedness system.

61
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,150
A basic premise of this framework is that incidents are generally handled at the lowest level,

62
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,100
the lowest jurisdictional level possible, and then incidents begin and end locally.

63
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,050
Most are managed at that level. Small number of incidents require federal support,

64
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:05,390
and these national response protocols recognize this and a structure to provide that additional additional three level tiered level of support.

65
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:14,120
The National Response Framework is this guide on how the nation responds to all types of disasters and emergencies and scalable,

66
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,780
flexible, adaptable concepts that are identified in what's called NIMS, the National Incident Management System.

67
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:27,350
The National Response Framework explains how the nation effectively manages this all hazards response.

68
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:35,120
It describes the specific authorities best practices for managing all types of disasters and emergencies from the smallest incidents.

69
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:40,890
Largest catastrophe. It strives to improve coordination among all the response partners.

70
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:45,960
And through these partnerships, we can work together to help save lives and protect America's communities.

71
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:52,650
To better understand how the national response framework fits into their overall national preparedness efforts.

72
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:58,320
We need to look at the national preparedness system and the national preparedness goal, which you see here on this slide.

73
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:02,490
That national preparedness system was developed to provide the approach,

74
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:09,210
resources and tools to aid the whole community in its preparedness activities to achieve this national preparedness goal.

75
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,610
Part of the system involves determining what capabilities are needed, how they should be developed and sustained, and how they should be delivered.

76
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:26,219
The National Preparedness System is an integrated set of guidance, concepts, processes and tools that enable the whole community to meet.

77
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:31,980
This national preparedness goal system is made up of these six components that you see here on a slide that.

78
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,589
So how do we with HHS, the health the US Department of Health and Services.

79
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:44,180
I am the federal level. So how do we respond as far as national response framework?

80
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:52,250
We are the lead federal agency for emergency support function number eight, which is public health and medical services.

81
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,840
We have 15 supporting agencies. Three of them, I think you did here.

82
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:05,280
I think Dr. Benjamin's with the M.S. DMA. We also have we work closely with the Department of Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, with FEMA.

83
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:12,769
And then we also have a key role in supporting BSF eight, which is mass care, emergency assistance,

84
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:19,180
housing and Human Services, because so if you see our name, the US Department of Health and Human Services,

85
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:26,569
so that's why I would do a lot is mass care and it played a big role with ESF eight and then as well as ESF number 12,

86
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:33,790
it's food safety, agriculture, natural resources. I mentioned names.

87
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,060
So names is kind of a standard way for us to kind of all speak the same language from the local and federal level.

88
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,190
It standardized national response doctrine within them that provide this consistent

89
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,690
nationwide template to enable the whole community to work together to prevent,

90
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:58,600
protect against, mitigate, respond to and recover from the effects of incidents regardless of their cost, size, location or complexity.

91
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,670
So this is kind of the only crazy pledge I will have.

92
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:13,080
But it shows how local jurisdiction can enact a request for federal assistance legally.

93
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,300
So you can see here a federal assistance can be provided to local, state territory,

94
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:24,960
and some are just stations as well as other federal departments and agencies through several different mechanisms and authorities.

95
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:32,579
These different federal departments are agencies, lead coordination of the federal government's response actions depending on their express

96
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,350
and implied statutory authorities based on the type and magnitude of the incident.

97
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:45,900
So federal departments and agencies are supported by other agencies who bring those relevant capabilities that support those affected by the incident.

98
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,240
So the federal government can provide assistance in the form of funding resources and services.

99
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:58,739
Federal departments and agencies respect the sovereignty and responsibilities of local, state, tribe, tribal,

100
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:04,110
territorial and insular area governments while rendering assistance that supports the affected those affected areas.

101
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:10,380
They most of the time do not require federal assistance and we tend to honor that.

102
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,540
And so pretty much you have to have someone request our assistance.

103
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,940
You don't just kind of go in there and kind of take over the response.

104
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:25,940
You can see that one of the ways is do a Stafford Act and then the president can also on his own declare a state of emergency.

105
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:32,690
I put you on the on the side. Separately, some of the federal departments on their own have certain statutory authorities.

106
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:40,220
And so, like our secretary, can declare a public health emergency like COVID, and then we can be sent out to respond to that public health emergency.

107
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:50,050
So I mentioned the different ways, like statutory ways that federal government can be put in to respond.

108
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,690
And here you can kind of see some of the examples of what a Stafford Act declarations,

109
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,520
the consequences of incidents that exceed local jurisdictional capabilities,

110
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:07,870
natural manmade public health, medical terrorist events, or infectious disease outbreaks and pandemics.

111
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:16,510
We also do it in our National Disaster Response program, deployed often overseas to support the Department of State or USAID.

112
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:22,570
We also have and being based in D.C., I get pulled in a lot for these what I call national special security,

113
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:28,540
announced for attending different presidential inaugurations or sporting events.

114
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:39,240
So as I mentioned that we are the lead for SFE program effectiveness and we.

115
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:53,190
So ESF emergency support functions provide the structure for coordinating federal interagency support for a federal response to an incident.

116
00:11:53,940 --> 00:12:00,270
They're way to group functions that provide federal support to states and federal to federal support for the Stafford Act,

117
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:04,470
declared disasters and emergencies. And on Stafford Act incidents,

118
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,389
there are emergency support functions that make these are the emergency support functions that

119
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:13,830
make up the national response framework and how these different support functions work together.

120
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,480
There's a lot of interagency operation must take place to support these functions.

121
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:26,490
ESF eight, which I mentioned, is one that really is activated through the Stafford Act or through the Public Health Service Act.

122
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:33,720
And we work closely with the ESF six, and I will show you some examples of it here.

123
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:41,700
Yes. Eight Provide mechanism for coordinating federal assistance to supplement the local jurisdictions.

124
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:44,339
Response in the following areas public health,

125
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:50,450
medical care needs veterinary or animal health issues in coordination with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

126
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,330
Potential actual incidents of national significance. And developing potential health and medical situation.

127
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:04,079
So we believe this involves supplemental assistance to local jurisdiction and meeting their public

128
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:09,870
health and medical needs of victims from major disasters or public health and medical emergencies.

129
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:19,890
I mentioned there's support usually from VA, DOD, DHS and sometimes the Department of Transportation as well.

130
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:28,500
Some of the key functions here. You can see some of the most common functions.

131
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:37,890
Patient care, evacuation. We have assets that can provide medical care during a disaster which otherwise overwhelms local or state EMS functions.

132
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:42,840
A big piece of what we do during response is the movement of health and medical supplies.

133
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:45,810
We move large medical caches and equipment.

134
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:56,250
As you mentioned, I started my career in RCA, which now has a new name administration for strategic preparedness and response.

135
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:03,030
They are elevating aspect kind of to the same level of where I work now, which is CDC and making installing what's called an active.

136
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:09,690
So this is the mission of aspa saving lives protecting Americans from 21st century health security threats.

137
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,690
And you're kind of going under a big reorg right now.

138
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:17,910
I think probably mostly because of the pandemic and monkeypox and just everything else that we're now facing.

139
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:25,560
Prolonged pandemic. Yes. If it is coordinated by the secretary of health services, principally through Aspen.

140
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:35,410
These are different regions and get back to my visions and.

141
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:42,660
The regional chart. So this kind of shows our partnerships with the different state and local areas.

142
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:49,460
We use FEMA's breakdown of the regions to provide support to the different state, local and tribal and territorial governance is,

143
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:55,140
as we detect, an actual potential incident or event with possible health and medical impacts.

144
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:02,399
We will communicate with what are called RECs, the major regional emergency coordinators and each region has one and give them

145
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,210
a heads up and they will also kind of do the same to us at the federal level.

146
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:15,190
These these what I call Asper Wrecks. They work in coordination with the departmental interagency, state, local and tribal counterparts.

147
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:20,800
They work intensely to identify current capabilities, gaps, capacity, community resilience.

148
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,280
They recommend possible courses of action to take during an event,

149
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:31,300
as well as potential uses of federal assets and which federal assets are best suited qualified to provide support during an event.

150
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,040
They act as what's called the Federal Health Funding Official during an event.

151
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:46,309
Public health and medical response. So you know all that and DMS, so I'll cover that too much.

152
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:51,440
But you probably don't know as much about the other federal public health and medical response asset,

153
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,129
which is as we are the United States Public Health Service.

154
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:02,300
And we have over 6000 officers assigned to a lot of different HHS agencies as well as other federal partners,

155
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:08,840
the Department of Defense, Bureau of Prisons. We are commanded by the U.S. surgeon general.

156
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,069
Here is a photo. I don't know if you can see it that way or see what it is,

157
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:22,460
but it's actually me in a military aircraft heading down for what was like a triple hurricane response for Maria, Irma and Harvey.

158
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,910
And that's obviously using the D.O.D. assets to get down there. Quite.

159
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:33,760
Medical resources that we have on hand. I know you learned about the strategic national stockpile.

160
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:41,740
We also have a member of the Medical Reserve Corps, as well as another major asset we have, which are federal medical stations.

161
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:49,750
So as in, as you know, is the national repository of antibiotics, chemical antidotes, anti toxins, life support,

162
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:57,210
medications by the administration, airway maintenance supplies and medical surgical items as it has actually used to be with us at CDC.

163
00:16:57,220 --> 00:17:04,240
Now it has moved to asthma, as in essence designed to supplement and resupply state and local public health agencies in

164
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,430
the event of a national emergency anywhere at any time within the U.S. sports territories.

165
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:17,139
As far as the federal medical station is a deployable health care facility that can provide surge beds to

166
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:22,930
support health care systems anywhere in the U.S. as impacted by a disaster or public health emergency.

167
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,800
They're not local, cannot be relocated once they are established.

168
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:32,070
They come with a three day supply of medical and pharmaceutical resources to sustain from 50

169
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:38,170
to 250 stable primary and chronic care patients who require medical and nursing services.

170
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:44,110
Staffing for and estimates can be provided using displaced local or regional providers,

171
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:49,150
or can be provided by a federal government, primarily federal staff or officers of the Public Health Service.

172
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,939
Intangibles for some items include temporary well-being and care for patients to

173
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,290
decompress a local hospital receiving patients from rising homes and skilled nursing

174
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:03,819
facilities that were forced to evacuate during the disaster or providing low acuity

175
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,950
care for patients with chronic illness whose access and cares impeded due to disaster.

176
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:15,740
The Medical Reserve for you may you may be familiar if you're already in the public health world,

177
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,890
but it's a kind of a local volunteer based group that is part of ASPER and is

178
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:26,030
training and is brought into expert combat comprised of organized medical,

179
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:31,220
public health professionals, service volunteers to respond to natural disasters and emergencies.

180
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,990
The NRC program provides structure necessary to deploy medical and public health personnel in response to an emergency,

181
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:45,080
as it identifies specific, trained, credentialed personnel available and ready to respond.

182
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:52,330
Commander Garza can ask a question. And this is Aurora.

183
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:59,370
I may be getting ahead of your presentation, but, you know, we have a lot of first and second year masters students.

184
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:04,690
So how does one get into the public health service like that?

185
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,200
Did you just sign up for it like you would for the military?

186
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,820
Or like how did you decide that this is what you were going to do and then how you started?

187
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:20,540
Yeah, sure. So how specifically how I got in or how how others are able to join us both, I guess.

188
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:30,290
Yeah, sure. So I started probably right after undergrad because I was really interested, you know, under was biology and I want to do it globally.

189
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:36,079
So I asked doing national relations. But you I don't I'm not a I don't have a clinical background.

190
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,170
So they take all types of volunteer.

191
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:46,490
So if you're interested in like health education, they do a lot of exercise and trainings are kind of helping the local schools with um,

192
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:54,530
I know here in the Virginia like right outside D.C. a lot of like getting, you know, vaccine clinics set up and helping staff them.

193
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,660
So there's a lot of administrative and logistics roles that you can play even if you don't have a political background.

194
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:04,909
They're specifically always looking for people that have another language, too.

195
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:11,180
So that's like, I'm a native Spanish speakers. I'm always getting pinged to deploy and to help with MRC.

196
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:18,320
But yeah, the link I think to just Google Aspirin, MRC, I would just put a screenshot here on how to join a local MRC, you know,

197
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:24,370
but it's great cause they have free training and the kind of our audience kind of like rocks and ready to go,

198
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,650
and you get alerted when they're like local, local needs.

199
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:35,570
Thank you. Sure. So at this point, I'd like all the formal high level stuff.

200
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:41,280
I was going to show a quick video of that. Okay. Okay.

201
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:47,820
See, first, let me. The U.S. was.

202
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:24,860
Transnational. All right, let me know if you can see the screen.

203
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,410
Yep. Yep. All right, cool.

204
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:35,930
So this just a hormone video on the public health service, and then I'll talk about my my story and then answer any questions.

205
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,890
You don't hear the sound that. Now. Okay.

206
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,730
You there? Yeah, I'm all right.

207
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:54,210
I am. There's actually a beat they're doing now.

208
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:29,810
I understand. For a public health approach.

209
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:38,560
All of our other lives. All of our. When you think of some of the most difficult challenges that.

210
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:46,210
Or. Public health challenges that we've experienced over the last several decades.

211
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:52,990
These are the folks who've been here from the start of the United States.

212
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:59,320
Public Health Service was originally created as the main hospital service on July 16, 1798.

213
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:07,180
Its goal was to protect the health of the nation against the invasion of disease from abroad and prevent the spread of disease within our borders.

214
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:13,330
As time went on, the work of the service became increasingly important to the public health of the country.

215
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:20,220
Recognizing the value of mobility and military discipline and an organization that combats epidemic diseases.

216
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:25,200
Congress established the commission called on January 4th, 1889.

217
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:31,510
Nearly 7000 more officers are required by law enforcers.

218
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:36,320
Under the leadership of the. Human Services.

219
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:44,240
Health and safety of our nation by serving in regular.

220
00:23:46,890 --> 00:24:15,210
Right. United regulatory possibilities.

221
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,340
I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us.

222
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:35,230
Any other people or any other generation. Yeah.

223
00:24:42,410 --> 00:25:07,640
Well, I don't really. My fellow Americans am not what your country can do for you and what you can do for your country.

224
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:17,120
We're a better nation. We're a stronger nation. We're a healthier nation because we have the United States Public Health Service Commission.

225
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,860
I am in that chair. And I'm very moved.

226
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:40,350
Yes, you can. All right.

227
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,280
Can you see me in a really fancy dress?

228
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:51,179
Okay, great. All right. So I was asked to talk a little bit about the United States Public Health Service.

229
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,010
And if you are all get an MPH, it is one of the qualifying degrees for the United States Public Health Service.

230
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,640
So I would share my MPH story with that before.

231
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,080
As you can see here, actually, this was just two or three weeks ago.

232
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,230
I was in a University of Nebraska Medical Center Hospital.

233
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:16,860
They have this like a super fancy actually about national quarantine unit there that Asper pays for.

234
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:27,180
It's like a 20 bed unit there. And we do some infectious disease training on how we respond and prepare and others.

235
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:33,300
It's a pilot program that they are looking at for the entire corps. So I was selected to go do that.

236
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:41,430
So I had to learn how to wear one of these and how to communicate with other people that you can't hear anything when you're in these suits.

237
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:46,230
So. So yeah, this is us we are part of.

238
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:49,320
And under the Department of Health and Human Services or one of now,

239
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,880
there are eight uniformed services with the Space Force and the video is a little bit out of date,

240
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:03,540
but five of them are what's called like armed forces. And we are there six now and we are two of the unarmed forces.

241
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:11,309
So we're all in uniform services. So like when I was in Iraq or Afghanistan, we would have to go with another either,

242
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:16,140
you know, like a private security or like in Iraq, we had DOD that would take us around.

243
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:22,950
So we are armed. What we do is our mission statement up top.

244
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,690
This is also part of me somewhere in the middle, in the front, protect,

245
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:31,159
promote in advance the health and safety of our nation providing essential health services.

246
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:36,610
A lot of us are clinical in the really places that a lot of people don't want to work with the Bureau of Prisons.

247
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:43,580
We do all of our health care for inmates. A lot of us are also in the Indian Health Service, providing health for the native populations.

248
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,440
We serve also a lot on the frontlines during deployments and disaster responses.

249
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,829
We lead public health programs in our state. Quote, where they're called day jobs,

250
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:58,670
like I'm at CDC right now and a lot of us are scientists and do some medical innovation and science work as well.

251
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,270
Kind of where we work.

252
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:15,000
Some of the main main agencies that you see here, I mentioned the BOP, Federal Bureau of Prisons and Indian Health Service is under HHS umbrella.

253
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:26,410
So. These are our categories I mentioned for for you are would be like me I'm a health services officer that's a category I fall in.

254
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:31,740
And these are a lot of the other categories I think the most popular not most popular either.

255
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:39,700
The categories are the largest amount of officers are pharmacists, nurses and then us, because we're like the multi-discipline category.

256
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:45,400
We have clinical and clinical specialties in what's called health services.

257
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:55,390
So a little bit about why I chose an MPH and am in federal service right now.

258
00:28:56,050 --> 00:29:01,400
I actually was an MPH appointment as part of the Peace Corps at some of the MBA schools and not sure if you guys has it.

259
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,580
They have our Peace Corps as a practical component.

260
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:14,350
So I was in a master's International Peace Corps and GW here in D.C. Then I had an opportunity to go to Iraq before the U.S. Embassy was set up,

261
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:21,030
was called a CPA. The Coalition Provisional Authority was there. And I was like, when I was, I going to have this opportunity?

262
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:26,170
So I quit my job. I need even know how long it was going to be in Iraq for.

263
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:32,050
And I also was able to get a leave of absence on my exams early for my MPH program.

264
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:39,880
And when I came back, I did not do the Peace Corps about I needed a break from being overseas for what end up being five months?

265
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:50,600
Like two weeks after Saddam was captured. Can I ask you, is this like super competitive, like something you applied for?

266
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:58,160
And then they decide if they want you or like, you know, how how do you go about keeping people?

267
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:04,430
So, like all the when they're recruiting, it's all like on the website, like what categories are recruiting for?

268
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:11,959
But I know because on Monday I have like interviews all day and are open categories and a lot of people

269
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,520
in those other categories I mentioned are also getting them page because it's first and foremost,

270
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:21,649
we're public health officers. You know, everyone can say like, oh, I'm also like a dental hygienist or whatever else,

271
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:25,430
but like you're looked at first and foremost as a public health officer.

272
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:32,540
So you got to know public health as a foundation because when you're deployed, you know such a critical piece of how you support and respond.

273
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:39,730
So I'm saying that to say that like MPH is such a critical degree, not only for my category as a qualifying degree,

274
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:45,510
but other categories are adding that now on top of their degree because for promotion we have to give in to education.

275
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,389
So it's a lot of people doing that, but it's as far as competitive.

276
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:54,709
So I think if you're willing to go anywhere, they will take you.

277
00:30:54,710 --> 00:31:01,760
You know, they're they're not looking for jobs. Well, I want to work at NIH and do specific research on monkeypox.

278
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:04,760
You know, they are looking at places where the greatest needs are.

279
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,799
And then you do like I think it's usually two years.

280
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:13,940
They're like, say, if it's Indian Health Service or Department of Homeland Security with what's called ICE, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement,

281
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:19,880
they have a national health services group that works on that with all of the refugee immigrant population.

282
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:25,130
So you have to kind of be ready to kind of be sent anywhere.

283
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:30,049
So you can't really decide where you want to go, what you want to do.

284
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:33,470
First, you have to be willing to kind of Denise's service, drive it.

285
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:47,130
Thank you. Sure. And so then I started to ask friends, as you heard, and I wanted to do humanitarian work.

286
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,450
That's kind of why I joined.

287
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:55,200
I wanted to I heard that they had these huge, like DOD ships that actually they're most of the time they're those big hospital ships.

288
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,520
I'm not sure if you've seen them. They're like wide with the Red Cross, the comfort and the mercy.

289
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:06,509
And I wanted to deploy and be part of one of those international humanitarian ship AIDS mission.

290
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:13,290
So I started asthma. And then like within a year, I was asked to serve as an executive assistant public information officer.

291
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:23,340
And so I spent two months living on this ship here and then kind of flying flying off of the ship into really remote areas of Central Central America.

292
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,480
El Salvador, Peruvian, Guatemala. So Central South America.

293
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:35,060
So, you know, most of you know, you asked me about national response,

294
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:40,260
but a lot of keeping our borders safe and that diplomacy work is doing a lot of global health work.

295
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,749
So obviously that's my background. So you'll hear some of that.

296
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:51,990
But this is kind of what we did with that ship, how, you know, the impact you able to have when you have the D.O.D. capabilities behind you?

297
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,810
You know, in less than less than a month, we're able to see almost, what,

298
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:04,290
25,000 different medical issues there and mean people that haven't seen doctors in like decades.

299
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:10,680
These are really remote parts and really remote villages. And we also, you know, we have engineering is one of our category.

300
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:18,450
So we were able to kind of build hospitals and build some of our community centers and kind of help with the local infrastructure as well,

301
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:22,649
which kind of leads to more sustainability. After you read then I mentioned the vet component.

302
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:30,299
We Have a duty also has vets too, so we have our vets in their beds and we were able to work with the local locals there to

303
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,720
ensure because that's a big part of their livelihood that they had the food they needed.

304
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,450
So some of our interactions explain our work.

305
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:45,440
They were able to ask for like one medical service, and so they would say kind of in line overnight to see our Western doctors.

306
00:33:46,310 --> 00:33:49,040
And it's a broad range of services that we provided.

307
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:57,690
We also had what I call environmental health officers, and they do a lot of work with like water sanitation and I don't know exactly how to set up,

308
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,850
but you know, like all of us should have that same background to occupational mental health.

309
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:10,460
So we did some assessments of the wherever there was concern from the locals that they want us to kind of do the migration.

310
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:18,139
Of the water supply systems we have the duty has really cool gadgets and instruments that we

311
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:22,610
would use some of their instruments that kind of measures the quality of the air and the water.

312
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:30,040
So we were able to actually do surgeries on the ship.

313
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:38,140
So we were able to identify people. These are people that are coming off of the helicopters from being sent to the ship for surgery.

314
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:44,380
And a lot of it's kind of getting out to the communities. And, you know, a lot of them are scared about for the uniform, but so is explaining.

315
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:51,520
I'm a native Spanish speaker. It's a lot easier to explain in the local language what we're here for, the services that we offer.

316
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:59,169
And you can see here, I think, the role of media in bringing attention to this little girl here with this huge tumor.

317
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:09,069
So kind of connecting with the local politicians, the media, bringing attention to maybe more critical cases that that can be elevated.

318
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:17,590
And optometry and dentists are always areas that get a lot of people that come in for that kind of life,

319
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:20,799
literally life changing experiences for me, for them.

320
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,960
And this helps kind of these countries that are kind of in a lot of like war torn conflict areas see us in a different light,

321
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:35,320
especially see us in uniform. It's not something that they usually trust, but see America in a different lens.

322
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:44,129
I mentioned people kind of stayed in line overnight to kind of see see us working

323
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:49,320
with armed guards because of all of the masses of people that would be here.

324
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,780
And, you know, public health is good for the greatest number of people.

325
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:02,040
I moved to Afghanistan Health Initiative from Aspen know what's called a it was an office of Global Health

326
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:10,019
Affairs under HHS office of the Secretary and I was the project officer for this Afghanistan Health Initiative.

327
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,510
It's actually a secretariat level initiative.

328
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:21,660
And I worked on bringing teams of doctors and public health professionals, a lot of epidemiologists over to Afghanistan.

329
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:27,270
The doctors are mostly pulled from Indian Health Service because they know how to work with like world resource settings,

330
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,130
which is what we needed there in Afghanistan.

331
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:37,739
So we were able to train kind of the midwives there in Afghanistan at one of the maternity hospitals in Kabul to kind

332
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:44,910
of see how we do it with our lower resource setting and train them for improving their not only their medical system,

333
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:54,900
but their public health, the patient outcome assessments, their tracking, their medical records for the whole hospital management.

334
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:08,309
And then more recently, me in the middle of COVID, I've been deployed maybe four or five times for COVID, and then four or five times.

335
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:16,379
Also, speaking of the Afghanistan evacuation that we have deployed to a lot of the facilities

336
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:20,580
where we're bringing in Afghans because there is an infectious disease component.

337
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:28,380
Like, how do you keep when people are living so close together and they may not have had the best health records where they were at?

338
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:32,999
We're like lily pad sites overseas or when they come here and whether or not they've been vaccinated.

339
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:39,600
So there's a lot of outbreaks, measles, lice, a lot of the common infections, other diseases, even COVID.

340
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:45,580
So I was sent to help with work with some of the Afghan populations here in the US.

341
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:54,239
Now of course, Kobane, we were asked to do with CDC a lot of investigations on the new variants and early on with some of the

342
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,920
schools and they're trying to reopen the schools like what is the right size of the desks and like how,

343
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:03,899
how are outbreaks happening in school systems and what recommendations we could give for

344
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,640
elementary schools as part of an elementary school investigation as well as this be b117.

345
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:17,370
There's so many different variants. One of the early variants, I was sent to California to investigate households and do testing inside households

346
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:20,970
are people with this new variant as we try to learn about the infectiousness,

347
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:30,810
as is me here at the airport. When I was working for the Ebola screening that we had set up for the 2014 2016 Ebola response,

348
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,870
we had people that were working in the area come back through,

349
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:39,839
I think it was three airports so we could screen them and try and prevent Ebola from coming to the US,

350
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:43,020
which we did have a few people that came back that were active with Ebola.

351
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:49,429
So that is pretty much my story and I'm happy to kind of answer any questions

352
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,240
you have or I talk more about an infectious disease response that I've been on.

353
00:38:55,970 --> 00:39:04,390
Commander goes or let's give her initial hand. Questions from the audience.

354
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:12,500
Just make sure to read saying in verse. So quiet this morning.

355
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:19,100
Okay. Well, I'll ask you a list so I know your place in the D.C. area.

356
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:22,610
Do you have to be to be part of the public health service?

357
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:30,229
Yeah. No, we are all over. There are a lot of since, you know, the federal government is in this area,

358
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:34,459
there are a lot of us here in the D.C. area, D.C., Richmond, Virginia, Maryland area.

359
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:38,600
But there's also a lot of us in Atlanta. Obviously, CDC is headquarters there.

360
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,549
So there's a large gap there.

361
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:47,720
And then we're also seeing a lot of the state health departments and all those other federal agencies that are kind of all over,

362
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:54,410
like the Indian Health Service, the Bureau of Prisons. And some of us are overseas supporting CDC country offices as well.

363
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,180
So kind of we're all over the place. Okay.

364
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,330
I'll just keep asking questions and someone has come up with one.

365
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:19,860
So. So since you're not unarmed forces like do you periodic, did you have to do like an initial training or like, you know, periodic training?

366
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:26,020
Because I think what you do is really cool. But I, I can do a push up at your dad and can I go that up?

367
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:29,919
So I don't know, this would be like a suitable job for me.

368
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,050
So I, they're like, this is not only like the use of physical training required.

369
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:38,049
Yeah. Yeah. So that's a good question.

370
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:45,490
They both my brothers are in the Navy and my dad was Navy, so they are trying to align us more to our sister services.

371
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:50,470
We are expected to have what's called an annual physical health test.

372
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:57,100
Yeah, yeah. So we're expected to be able to like run a certain distance in a certain time or swim.

373
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:03,440
And then there's like some sit ups or push ups, but there's some different options like side bridge.

374
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,260
So yeah, once a year we, we get another officer to evaluate our physical fitness.

375
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:14,410
But I would say it's definitely not as strict as like, you know, the Department of Defense where they have, you know,

376
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:23,530
like super young people like that need to like lift big amounts of stuff, including equipment and weapons on their back.

377
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:31,030
So we're not as fit maybe as some of our counterparts in other services, but we are public health officers.

378
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:34,959
I feel like it is our mission. We're the first service that went smokefree in uniforms.

379
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:42,590
Yes, I was pretty proud of that. But you hear me on the back end?

380
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:49,400
Yeah, I can hear you back with us.

381
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,810
So I don't know how you, um. Hello. My name is Brian. Thank you for your talk.

382
00:41:54,830 --> 00:42:03,950
I was interested in the shift in the medical ship and how just common that it is in terms of deployment is.

383
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:10,309
That is the reason that you do that. So you don't have to build a medical facility where you travel to and you can

384
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:15,680
be more transient or like why use why these a shift in one instance or not,

385
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:23,960
maybe it's geographic base, but yeah. So I think there's two different uses for those hospital shifts.

386
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,280
They are used for response like I think the Indonesia tsunami,

387
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:37,190
they sent over one of our US Navy hospital ships because of like augmenting the local health system there, like as a hospital.

388
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,440
The, the one I was on wasn't like in response to an emergency or disaster.

389
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:48,200
It was a, what they call them, like diplomacy missions kind of a building that the mindset and.

390
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:58,430
Of other countries and have them see us in a better light kind of building that those relationships so it's global health diplomacy so I think it's

391
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:07,280
like dual purpose like some of us some of them go routinely kind of rotate through like Central South America or Asia and then they're also use,

392
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,510
I know for code it, you know, I'd have to look at to see like how to use for the COVID response.

393
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:18,350
There's a lot of cruise ships that were coming in with, you know, people that outbreaks on board.

394
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:21,950
But I don't think we I don't know. I know. Yes.

395
00:43:21,950 --> 00:43:24,559
I'm not sure exactly how they were used for the COVID response,

396
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,720
but they are used for disaster response and for diplomacy measures, which is the one I was on.

397
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:40,040
The. Also this case in terms of who decides where to go and doesn't need in an emergency.

398
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:49,370
The thing about declaring the emergency on a federal level, but is that is that most of the decisions made at HHS,

399
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:54,110
is that higher or lower, would you say, like the percentage of the distribution of.

400
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:02,860
Decisions on where do we go during the diplomacy mission is like an executive order.

401
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,160
I think for for the military, the Department of Defense, how they decide what countries to go to.

402
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:16,730
I have no idea. I would assume it's countries that maybe have more negatives.

403
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:25,999
I, I think spying on intelligence gathering on which one's like could use a little bit more love of the U.S. You know,

404
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,130
they get more collect more good feelings,

405
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:37,010
goodwill and feelings towards the U.S. That's why I think a lot of the Central America, because of all the conflicts in those areas and a lot of the.

406
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,160
Had until the unaccompanied minor missions, which I did describe.

407
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:47,020
But I've deployed often for the border too, with the unaccompanied kids that are coming over.

408
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:52,510
So I don't know. It was just like a DOD message that's led by them and the decisions are by them.

409
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:57,970
So I don't know how they pick their countries. I think that obviously wherever there's a need,

410
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:07,010
I think the lower income countries have the most need for medical public health because of the capabilities that we lack.

411
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:10,300
But I think there's a lot of politics in those decisions.

412
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,760
Way above my pay grade average. But good question.

413
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:24,100
Questions. I'll ask I'll ask my question.

414
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:31,480
So, you know, like you said, some of these missions are goodwill and stuff and your bilingual is.

415
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:36,639
But I'm assuming like for some places you've been deployed, obviously you're not fluent in the language,

416
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,500
so you probably have, you know, translators on your team and stuff like that.

417
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:52,600
So, you know, I do a lot of community based participatory research really trying to like foster these relationships with, you know, the community.

418
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,940
And this is obviously a very different situation because they're just out of deployment and you're like in and out.

419
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:06,579
So you don't necessarily have that time. So like, I don't know generally how have you been received by communities when you come?

420
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:12,489
They're, they're like generally like, oh my gosh, like they use a lot like this is so exciting.

421
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:21,639
Or you initially like met with some skepticism and you kind of have to be some like relationship building in the first week.

422
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,010
I know it's probably different for every country,

423
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:34,960
but just kind of getting a sense of like I like people and communication skills that go into not only like the technical response, yeah, yeah.

424
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:39,880
This quote soft skills, but yeah, like you said, depends on the mission.

425
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:46,830
I think the ones that are hardest is when we're overseas because we come in for such a short amount,

426
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:51,970
short amount of time relative to like maybe like like local NGOs that are there.

427
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:59,680
And so it is building that trust. Like a lot of times we employ local staff, CDC does in those countries.

428
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:05,440
So it works best when we're like, when I was in DRC, Democratic Republic of the Congo,

429
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:11,919
working on the Ebola response as a border health lead in 2020, they already had a presence there.

430
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,540
You know, CDC did, and which I thought was the first time I'd seen a response.

431
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:21,319
Like, I actually they also brought in people that were from DRC.

432
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:25,330
So they spoke not only like French, but a lot of the local languages, too,

433
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:28,629
because even if you go thinking, all right, great, I speak French or Portuguese,

434
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:33,190
there's always like all these like local native languages that you're not be able to find an

435
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:39,520
officer or find a civilian who speaks the language and dialects that you need when you respond.

436
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:45,790
So that worked really well because, you know, he was able to have more of that in being from there.

437
00:47:46,090 --> 00:47:49,809
None of us are going to be from very, very rare time.

438
00:47:49,810 --> 00:48:00,090
We have an officer. He's actually from that culture. So I think it's building going in with people that are more trusted and setting up kind of

439
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:06,549
the contracts contractor is that can be the longer than like the federal partners can I think

440
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:10,780
worked really well and that's the way I've seen it work the best but it is tough when you

441
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,309
see people you're only here for three weeks like or military deploys a lot longer than us.

442
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:23,690
So when I was deployed, I was the only person from CDC for the Afghan mission earlier this year at New Mexico.

443
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:27,190
Is Airforce Base like, oh, you're only here three weeks.

444
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:32,499
You've been here for like six months. And I'm like, Oh, that's, that's great. But nobody like you guys.

445
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:41,250
It's just completely different culture. So I think in a big like response you'll see like all the different partners and their cultures and you know,

446
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:47,200
they see us in rotating door, but we, we have our no one else is doing my job when I'm gone and deployed versus DOD.

447
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:50,620
Like they're just completely set up in a different, different way.

448
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:55,149
So it is it is hard when you, you know, you you've thrown in.

449
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:59,260
You don't know who's going to be there working with you and like what they see you as and what they

450
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:04,780
think of you and how to build those partnerships and understanding that this is the way we operate.

451
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:12,819
You know, I usually don't go out for six months. I DOD does to a year I'm usually max I think I've deployed is six weeks and it's overseas.

452
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:17,230
And they want you obviously to be able to come home all the time when you go overseas.

453
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:27,830
Questions from the crew. All right, let's give a final.

454
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:40,300
You so much. Commander Garza, again, I'm so sorry. I thought this thing was also video, but apparently not.

455
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,260
Now, I know you mentioned you have like a slightly modified version of slides that you can share with the class.

456
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:52,330
Yeah, I will get that to you. Yeah. Yeah. And thank you so much.

457
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,360
I've learned so much more about you.

458
00:49:55,360 --> 00:50:02,810
And it's so funny that you said you went to Nebraska because I'm sure you actually did the training because I'm contracting with that right now.

459
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:07,930
So the the what PowerPoint you probably looked at on the hierarchy controls and like, yeah.

460
00:50:08,590 --> 00:50:13,460
Yeah. I edited those like go. And they were like, oh my God, they're coming out.

461
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:18,750
But I was like, okay, so Liz, she knows I gained control.

462
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:26,140
She was at Icon. Thank you so much, Commander Garza, and I'll follow up with you.

463
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,390
Sounds good. And I guess finally it's anyone who is interested.

464
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:35,979
I'm happy semiconductor information. You can get it from factory and learning more about public health service or what I did with my page.

465
00:50:35,980 --> 00:50:39,460
I'm happy to talk more with anyone. Okay. Thank you so much.

466
00:50:39,730 --> 00:50:41,410
I think you guys.
