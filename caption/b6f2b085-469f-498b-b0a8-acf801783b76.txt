00:00:02,450 --> 00:00:11,450
In this last section, I will introduce you to a basic evaluation process so that, you know, one way an evaluation can be done.

2
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:18,160
Again, this is a brief introduction, so I encourage you to read more.

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,030
There are many ways that evaluators structure their process.

4
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:29,020
This framework is only one. I selected this particular framework to share for multiple reasons.

5
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,410
One, it includes stakeholder engagement. Two,

6
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:42,430
It comes from the CDC. Three, It has two comprehensive workbooks for implementing an evaluation project.

7
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:51,130
And note that at the end of this, there will be links to those workbooks and other resources.

8
00:00:51,130 --> 00:00:54,790
This particular framework includes six steps.

9
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:08,250
Note that in the center of this framework are the four standards I described earlier utility, feasibility, propriety and accuracy.

10
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,300
The first step in this framework is to engage stakeholders.

11
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:18,690
This is your opportunity to start learning for those invested in the program and organization.

12
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:30,600
These include participants, staff, leaders, funders, as well as other stakeholders who may be interested in the outcomes of this work.

13
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:39,510
The second step is to describe the program. This is where you model the program's resources, activities and outcomes.

14
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,860
It is also helpful to describe the context of the program.

15
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:51,780
So for example, where the program takes place, the problem it address, among other things.

16
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,620
Again, think back to Mary Worth and significance.

17
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:05,230
It's not just the program that you're concerned about, but also the place in which it's taking place.

18
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:15,070
The third step is to focus evaluation design. Here is where you develop research questions and select the methods to gather your data.

19
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:24,780
They help you focus your learning, so developing a set of evaluation research questions is very important.

20
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:34,000
The fourth step is to gather credible evidence. Use multiple methods systematically if at all possible.

21
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,160
For example, whenever I engage in evaluation at a minimum

22
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:46,960
I will try to do a survey as well as some type of qualitative data collection, like an interview or focus group.

23
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:54,170
That way, I'm able to learn about a program from different angles.

24
00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:01,970
The fifth step is justified conclusions, analyze your data and connect results from the multiple methods.

25
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:09,330
For example, take what the survey data tells you about the program and compare it to the focus group data,

26
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:17,880
or interview data. What that teaches you and what you can learn is that there may be particular reasons why

27
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:25,880
participants like our program or why they don't like a program or why they don't respond.

28
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:37,600
The last step is to use and share lessons learned, evaluators place a high emphasis on the materials and the ways that they share back

29
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:48,500
the results from their work. So, for example, an evaluator might write a report that will go to organization staff,

30
00:03:48,500 --> 00:04:00,180
but also develop infographics that will be used on that organization's Web site.

31
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:08,760
One specific tool I want to introduce you to is a logic model, for those who are not familiar with logic models,

32
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,880
a logic model is a planning tool that helps guide the evaluation process.

33
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:20,040
They help evaluators focus on key research questions like what is the program doing,

34
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:31,020
and how is the program doing the right things? Meaning is the program doing the activities that will lead to the outcomes they desire?

35
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,310
Is the program doing what it wanted to do or plan to do?

36
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:45,820
What has changed for participants and what are the larger impacts of the program on community and society?

37
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,800
There are five common components in the logic model.

38
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:57,690
On this slide, I described the components in the top row boxes and provide an example in the lower row.

39
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:08,490
We'll start with resources. Resources are also known as inputs, and they are what organization uses to deliver a program.

40
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:25,410
For example, a program that is designed to promote safer sex may have a grant, staff, and training materials at their disposal.

41
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:33,190
The second component, are activities and the activities are what program staff do to deliver the program.

42
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:40,110
In this case, staff provide three hours of training on safer sex.

43
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:47,970
The third component is outputs, outputs are what services participants receive.

44
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:55,170
So in this case, high school participants receive three hours of training on condom use.

45
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:59,850
You may notice that activities and outputs are very similar

46
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:07,650
and that is indeed the case. They are almost like mirror images of each other, but activities

47
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:16,680
describe what happens from the staff perspective, whereas Output's describe what happened from the participants perspective.

48
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:25,950
And in fact, outputs outcomes as well as impacts focus on what participants experience.

49
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:32,700
The fourth component outputs describe what changes participants experience.

50
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:40,900
In the case of this example program participants learn how to put on condoms.

51
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:48,290
Finally, impacts are what changes a community or population experiences.

52
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:52,940
Note that not all logic models would include impact,

53
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:58,100
and the reason why is because different fields and different disciplines

54
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,180
think about impact in a different way. In public health

55
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,390
because we're concerned about the overall health of the public or population health

56
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,100
we typically will include impacts in our logic model.

57
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:19,380
So for example youth in Ann Arbor, where the University of Michigan is located,

58
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:33,020
experienced a five percent reduction in unplanned pregnancy due to the outcomes experienced by the participants.

59
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:45,730
At this point you may be asking yourself, where do I start? I have taught evaluation basics for a long time, and students always tend the panic.

60
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:52,880
Don't panic. If you're new to this work, you cannot go wrong by doing three things.

61
00:07:52,880 --> 00:08:03,750
One, Ask your client or preceptor or park community partner to articulate their vision for this work.

62
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:14,070
In addition to being a good relationship builder this allows you to get a sense of what direction the client would like to go,

63
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:23,010
and it gives you a sense of what direction to start heading. Two, ask your client, preceptor, our partner,

64
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:28,710
tell me about your program from the perspective of staff and participants.

65
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:37,770
The reason why you leave this question open ended is because it allows the client to be able to start describing to you some of the

66
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:47,340
nuances of a program that they may not necessarily say if you just ask them specific questions about the logic or program logic

67
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:55,780
rather. Even if a client does not need a logic model, I always recommend that based on this question

68
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:02,600
that the evaluator creates a logic model even if for your own purposes.

69
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:11,860
Finally, ask your client, preceptor, or partner, what would you like to learn about your program? Based on that,

70
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:14,390
again thinking about utility,

71
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:25,160
identify some research questions to help guide the project that will not only be interesting to pursue but useful to the client.

72
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:32,190
By this point, you will likely have a sense of what direction you want to follow.

73
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:37,920
Finally, read up. The references and resources I've include here

74
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,050
are a good place to start to learn more about evaluation.

75
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:53,520
As you can see here I have a link to the American Evaluation Association, again which is our national association our professional association,

76
00:09:53,520 --> 00:10:00,720
Better Evaluation, which is a good resource for evaluation related topics,

77
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:08,100
as well as other resources, including a link to the CDC evaluation framework.

78
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:17,600
There is a YouTube video there explaining the framework, as well as a link to the different workbooks that I mentioned earlier.

79
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,690
Finally, I include some logic model resources and templates.

80
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:32,390
One of my favorite logic model templates comes from Innovation Network which is a consulting firm on the East Coast.

81
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:40,500
I also include a link to a public Google Drive folder where I keep logic model resources.

82
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:46,520
So to summarize, conducting an evaluation includes stakeholder engagement,

83
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,840
and facilitating use as well as other steps common to research projects.

84
00:10:51,840 --> 00:11:02,720
A logic model is a planning tool that can be helpful in keeping an evaluation on track. Thanks.
