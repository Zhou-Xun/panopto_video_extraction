1
00:00:06,588 --> 00:00:12,648
So I want to acknowledge right up front that there is direct and indirect ionization,

2
00:00:12,648 --> 00:00:19,278
ionization, again, inducing a charge in an atom that interacts with radiation.

3
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:27,258
So we've got really two options here. Directly ionizing interactions occur from alpha and beta particles.

4
00:00:27,258 --> 00:00:30,918
And this would basically mean that we have an ionizing particle, again,

5
00:00:30,918 --> 00:00:40,518
either an alpha or a beta that actually strikes the electron cloud around the nucleus of an atom and causes ionization.

6
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:49,998
Again, the generation of a negative eye on in this case, we can also have indirectly ionizing interactions and those occur from photons.

7
00:00:49,998 --> 00:00:54,408
So x ray or gamma rays as well as neutrons.

8
00:00:54,408 --> 00:01:01,938
And in this case, we've got a photons, we've got an electromagnetic wave impinging on the electron cloud around this nucleus here.

9
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:09,018
And in striking the electron cloud. This photon is actually going to cause the release of an electron here.

10
00:01:09,018 --> 00:01:14,568
So, again, we've created a charged particle. We've got ionization going on.

11
00:01:14,568 --> 00:01:20,088
So let's talk about direct ionization first. And I'm going to focus in initially on alpha particles.

12
00:01:20,088 --> 00:01:25,668
So alpha particles primarily interact through, again, direct ionization,

13
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:31,938
but they're so massive and can have such an impact that they can actually cause some secondary ionization, too.

14
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:37,008
They can certainly undergo collisions with atoms that they encounter.

15
00:01:37,008 --> 00:01:42,138
And we know that as an alpha particle, Slowes, typically it's slowing because it's encountering matter.

16
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:51,238
And so as it slows the probability of an interaction, that's going to end up resulting in ionization increases.

17
00:01:51,238 --> 00:01:55,888
When we talk about direct ionization from beta particles, we've got two possibilities here.

18
00:01:55,888 --> 00:02:02,278
One is inelastic scattering. The second is elastic scattering in both of those are illustrated on the right here.

19
00:02:02,278 --> 00:02:12,058
So in inelastic scattering, we've got an electron. We've got an electron that comes zooming in through the electron cloud of another atom.

20
00:02:12,058 --> 00:02:18,148
And effectively it's going to knock one of the existing electrons of that target atom out.

21
00:02:18,148 --> 00:02:26,608
So that's going to become a secondary atom. The secondary atom or excuse me, the secondary electron is going to get ejected.

22
00:02:26,608 --> 00:02:35,278
It's going to leave with some energy loss. And this interaction here can result in excitation.

23
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:43,138
So that electron might not completely leave the atom, but it might get kicked to a higher energy level or there might be ionization again,

24
00:02:43,138 --> 00:02:49,708
where that electron gets enough energy that it actually gets completely kicked out of the target atom.

25
00:02:49,708 --> 00:02:52,498
We can also have so-called elastic scattering.

26
00:02:52,498 --> 00:03:01,108
And so this would mean an electron hits an atom and ends up rebadged it, rebounding back out as a back scattered atom.

27
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:10,018
Whereas in inelastic scattering, basically most of the energy is transferred from the first electron to the second in elastic scattering.

28
00:03:10,018 --> 00:03:19,738
There's essentially no energy that gets transferred from the inbound electron to the nucleus at rest.

29
00:03:19,738 --> 00:03:24,388
We can also talk about something that's peculiar debater particles called Brehm Strollin.

30
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:32,038
And so this is a great German word. BRAMS means breaking and Strongs means excuse me, strollin means radiation.

31
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:37,378
And so what happens if an electron, a beta particle approaches a high zie material?

32
00:03:37,378 --> 00:03:45,568
So, again, a Heisey materials a material with a lot of protons. It's going to interact with the electron shell around the atom.

33
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:53,238
And that and that interaction is going to cause this inbound beta particle to slow down or maybe even stop.

34
00:03:53,238 --> 00:03:56,998
And that energy that's getting created from the braking process is going to get

35
00:03:56,998 --> 00:04:03,568
released in the form of x rays emitted from the electron shell of this atom.

36
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:07,198
So on the lower right here, you can see an illustration of this.

37
00:04:07,198 --> 00:04:13,498
So we end up having a beta particle coming in from the left side interacting with the electron shell.

38
00:04:13,498 --> 00:04:19,828
It ends up sling shotting around. And part of that breaking energy gets released in the form of an x ray.

39
00:04:19,828 --> 00:04:29,218
Brehm Stallings, a problem because it means if we, for example, have a radiation source and we're trying to shield people from that radiation source,

40
00:04:29,218 --> 00:04:34,258
but we use the wrong type of shielding material, something with the high Z,

41
00:04:34,258 --> 00:04:39,478
not only we're going to not effectively block the beta particles, but now we're also going to generate x rays.

42
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:47,248
We may be making our exposure problem worse by inducing Brehm Strollo.

43
00:04:47,248 --> 00:04:53,758
Something else that can happen is positron annihilation. So this can occur with beta particles, too.

44
00:04:53,758 --> 00:05:02,368
So when we have beta emission, it can be a positron emission or electron capture.

45
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:11,068
So we can have the creation of a positron or which is essentially an anti electron and with positive charge or the creation of electron.

46
00:05:11,068 --> 00:05:14,878
These things can come together and they interact and annihilate each other.

47
00:05:14,878 --> 00:05:17,758
They destroy each other. And as you can see in the lower right.

48
00:05:17,758 --> 00:05:24,568
When that happens, the positron and the electron again are annihilated and they release to gamma rays,

49
00:05:24,568 --> 00:05:30,478
each with energy and the amount of 511 killer electron volts.

50
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:39,838
And those gammas can go on then and continue to interact with other man matter through two additional mechanisms, which I'll talk about in a minute.

51
00:05:39,838 --> 00:05:49,318
Photoelectric effect in Compton scattering. So one thing I'd like to note about beta particles is there.

52
00:05:49,318 --> 00:05:55,008
They have a limited range and that range is determined both by the initial energy kind of behind them,

53
00:05:55,008 --> 00:05:58,518
but also the density of the medium they're traveling through.

54
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:06,468
So as you can see from the land graph on the right here, electrons, beta particles, electrons can travel a limited range.

55
00:06:06,468 --> 00:06:11,058
But the range that they will travel increases as they are more energetic.

56
00:06:11,058 --> 00:06:16,248
So a two hundred and eighty electron volt beta particle is going to go much further than one.

57
00:06:16,248 --> 00:06:25,068
That's only 40 electron volts. We can also talk about a useful concept called stopping power, and we can apply this to different shielding materials.

58
00:06:25,068 --> 00:06:32,248
This is basically for that material. What is the loss per linear distance traveled by a charged beta particle?

59
00:06:32,248 --> 00:06:37,368
And that's going to vary again by the initial energy level, but also the density of the material.

60
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:41,328
So we can use stopping power to look at different materials and decide which

61
00:06:41,328 --> 00:06:46,768
one is going to be the better shielding agent for a beta particle exposure.

62
00:06:46,768 --> 00:06:52,768
All right, and lastly, we'll talk about how photons interact with matter, photons or electromagnetic waves.

63
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:59,988
So here we're talking about yamas and x rays and the ionization effects here are going to be indirect.

64
00:06:59,988 --> 00:07:03,088
So they're indirectly interacting with matter.

65
00:07:03,088 --> 00:07:08,698
So if we think about a photon impinging on the human body like we got here, there's really three things that can happen.

66
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:12,928
One is it could penetrate and just completely zip right through us.

67
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:20,248
Remember, while we seem solid and dense at a high level, when you get down to the atomic level, we're actually made mostly of empty space.

68
00:07:20,248 --> 00:07:23,428
So that photon can zip right through us.

69
00:07:23,428 --> 00:07:31,918
On the other hand, we could have the so-called photoelectric interaction or effect to where the photon is going to be completely absorbed by the body.

70
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:35,908
Or we could have scatter where part of the energy is going to be imparted on the body.

71
00:07:35,908 --> 00:07:44,248
But the gamma wave or x ray is still going to continue on. So those are our three types of interactions, which I'll describe now in more detail.

72
00:07:44,248 --> 00:07:49,618
These would be great. These three interactions, great things to remember come exam time.

73
00:07:49,618 --> 00:07:54,628
So the photoelectric effect is something that we experience mostly for low energy.

74
00:07:54,628 --> 00:08:02,458
Gamma is an x rays. And basically what happens here is we've got atoms that, you know, constitute, for example, my body.

75
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:06,568
There's going to be some incident photon, either a gamma or an x ray.

76
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:10,708
And that photon is going to interact with the electron cloud here.

77
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:16,528
It's going to collide basically with an electron and it's going to kick that electron out.

78
00:08:16,528 --> 00:08:22,498
And so now we've got essentially the gamma or x ray has been stopped and we've created

79
00:08:22,498 --> 00:08:28,498
now an electron that's loose and that electron is going to have some energy behind it,

80
00:08:28,498 --> 00:08:36,768
but it will lose some of the energy that was imparted onto it from the photon because it takes energy to break free from the ship.

81
00:08:36,768 --> 00:08:45,748
The electron shell of this atom, we can also have Compton scattering more common for a medium energy gamma or x ray.

82
00:08:45,748 --> 00:08:51,088
And this basically means, for example, we've got a gamma ray coming in here.

83
00:08:51,088 --> 00:08:54,808
So that's the incident, Ray. It's going to interact with the electron shell.

84
00:08:54,808 --> 00:09:05,188
It's going to kick out another electron or a beta particle, but it's also going to continue on its merry way with a slightly reduced form of energy.

85
00:09:05,188 --> 00:09:15,808
So whereas photoelectric effect effectively stops the gamma, Compton scattering is going to partially attenuate the gamma, but or the x ray.

86
00:09:15,808 --> 00:09:23,558
But the wave is going to continue to pass through. The person in this case and then the third thing that can happen is power production.

87
00:09:23,558 --> 00:09:26,708
And this happens for high energy gammas and x ray.

88
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:32,728
So in this case, we've got an incident photon that's so powerful that it's able to get near the nucleus.

89
00:09:32,728 --> 00:09:39,178
And just to give you a sense, we've talked about Kila electron volts before, an electron volts to get near the nucleus.

90
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:43,468
We've got to have an energy of greater than one mega electron volt.

91
00:09:43,468 --> 00:09:51,868
And basically what happens is the photon interacts with the nucleus and it ends up kicking an electron and a positron out of the nucleus.

92
00:09:51,868 --> 00:10:01,558
So those are then released and they can go on to interact with other matter as they continue on their merry way.

93
00:10:01,558 --> 00:10:09,238
So power production can lead to annihilation, as I talked about earlier, so again, if we've got a positron, an electron, they can interact.

94
00:10:09,238 --> 00:10:18,868
They can annihilate each other. We're gonna get these two 511 kila electrical electron volts rays that are emitted.

95
00:10:18,868 --> 00:10:28,078
And again, those gammas can continue on to result in either the photoelectric effect or additional Compton scattering.

96
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:32,428
So just to summarize, these, again, photons interacting with matter.

97
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:39,268
We're talking quantum physics here. We can't say with any certainty that a photon is going to interact with matter.

98
00:10:39,268 --> 00:10:46,438
But we could talk about the probabilities of a photon, an x ray or a gamma ray interacting with matter.

99
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,478
But again, keep in mind, we're mostly empty space.

100
00:10:48,478 --> 00:10:56,278
So that photon could possibly pass right through us or shielding or anything else without losing any energy or interacting with anything.

101
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:01,498
So, again, we talk about the probability of there being interaction and the type of interaction depends

102
00:11:01,498 --> 00:11:07,738
on the energy of the photon as well as the atomic number of the matter it's interacting with.

103
00:11:07,738 --> 00:11:12,808
So on the graph here on the Y axis, we have the atomic number from very low.

104
00:11:12,808 --> 00:11:17,578
So, Lou, losea number at the bottom to a hazy number at the top.

105
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:21,838
And on the x axis, we're talking about the energy and mega electron volts.

106
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:32,558
So if we have sorry, twitching mouse, if we have low energy photons interacting with a low atomic number type of matter,

107
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:37,648
we're going to get mostly the photoelectric effect. That gamma is effectively going to be extinguished.

108
00:11:37,648 --> 00:11:48,878
If we've got a medium energy photon interacting with, for example, relatively low Xen, no, we're gonna get the Compton effect.

109
00:11:48,878 --> 00:11:55,378
So there's going to be some attenuation of the wave. But it's going to continue on through and with very high photon of energy.

110
00:11:55,378 --> 00:12:00,958
We're going to end up with that photon penetrating to the nucleus and causing peer production,

111
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:07,858
some creating positrons and electrons that can then go on to annihilate each other.

112
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:13,918
So just to bring this back to reality, because I know some of this is pretty darn esoteric.

113
00:12:13,918 --> 00:12:15,568
Why do we care about this? Well, again,

114
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:23,098
the type of radiation we're talking about is going to determine the type of interaction that radiation has with whatever it comes into contact with.

115
00:12:23,098 --> 00:12:30,418
So something we'll talk about at length in a subsequent lecture is how we might actually go about blocking

116
00:12:30,418 --> 00:12:35,908
different types of radiation or how different types of radiation can penetrate certain materials.

117
00:12:35,908 --> 00:12:40,168
So I've already talked about alpha particles, very large, very energetic.

118
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:44,818
They can cause massive amounts of damage, but they don't travel very far.

119
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:52,288
And so in reality, you could block an alpha particle with something as simple as a piece of paper, a beta particle, an electron.

120
00:12:52,288 --> 00:12:59,348
We'll zip right through that paper, but it's going to get stopped by a thin plate, for example, of wood or aluminum and x ray.

121
00:12:59,348 --> 00:13:08,338
A photon is going to zip right through paper and a thin plate, but it's probably going to get stopped by something very dense, like led or iron.

122
00:13:08,338 --> 00:13:15,688
Ditto for a gamma ray. And then a neutron will actually zip through all of those things.

123
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:25,918
Paper thin plate of wood or metal led or iron, but it will be stopped for all intents and purposes by water or concrete.

124
00:13:25,918 --> 00:13:30,778
So, again, the type of radiation and the energy involved is going to dictate, well,

125
00:13:30,778 --> 00:13:38,098
how do we actually control people's exposures and doses of radiation down to safe levels?

126
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:40,618
So I just want to highlight that by next week.

127
00:13:40,618 --> 00:13:48,898
Those of you who didn't make it to class need to submit your case study topic so you can go to canvass two assignments and submit this.

128
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:57,118
It's just a text entry. I'm really just looking for a few words. You describing to me what radiation exposure event.

129
00:13:57,118 --> 00:14:03,868
Are you going to describe in your case study? And finally, I'll leave you with a preview of next class where we're going to shift away from the

130
00:14:03,868 --> 00:14:08,518
map that we focused on today and talk more about the biological effects of radiation,

131
00:14:08,518 --> 00:14:13,528
but also about the instruments that we can use to measure radiation.

132
00:14:13,528 --> 00:14:13,580
So that's the end of lecture to have a great day.
