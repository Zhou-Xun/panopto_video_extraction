1
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,490
After watching this video,

2
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:14,160
you will be able to
use PROC GENMOD to run

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,110
a log-binomial model in

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,260
the context of a
cross-sectional study.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,080
So we are once more back to

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,375
our old example of
abdominal obesity.

7
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:26,025
Sounds familiar, right?

8
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:28,650
Well, we'll look at
this same example

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,420
when we saw logistic regression.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,540
Now, we're going to use it
for log-binomial relation.

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,775
Remember that the
outcome is binary,

12
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,695
abdominal obesity as yes or no,

13
00:00:39,695 --> 00:00:42,580
depending on a sex
specific cutoff

14
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,930
of waist circumference,

15
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,625
they came from the metabolic
syndrome definition.

16
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:50,405
For this example, we're going
to use the variable Sex,

17
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:53,375
were males recorded as
zero and females as one.

18
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,940
Our hypothesis is that
females would have

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,840
a higher prevalence of
abdominal obesity than males.

20
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,705
Why do we say prevalence and
we don't say odds or risks?

21
00:01:04,705 --> 00:01:08,295
Why? Because this is not going
to be logistic regression,

22
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:10,295
so no odds here.

23
00:01:10,295 --> 00:01:13,055
Even though this is
log-binomial regression,

24
00:01:13,055 --> 00:01:14,540
we are no longer in

25
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,410
the context of a cohort
study where we can see risk.

26
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,840
We are now in the context
of a cross-sectional study.

27
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,670
Therefore, the proportion we

28
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,080
get from counting people with

29
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,825
abdominal obesity over the
whole study population

30
00:01:26,825 --> 00:01:28,900
is now a prevalence.

31
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,040
In any case, we're
going to do the

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,920
same as we did for
the cohort study.

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:34,280
We're going to calculate

34
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,510
both the odds ratio
and prevalence ratio,

35
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:38,365
so you can see the differences.

36
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,970
Here are males using
the two by two table to

37
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,195
estimate both my odds ratio
and my prevalence ratio.

38
00:01:44,195 --> 00:01:46,640
You can clearly see that
they are different.

39
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,995
The odds ratio is 4.99 and
the prevalence ratio is 3.52.

40
00:01:51,995 --> 00:01:54,710
Once more, remember
that we can also use

41
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,095
PROC GENMOD to run
logistic regression.

42
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:59,255
We used to do it
with PROC LOGISTIC

43
00:01:59,255 --> 00:02:01,670
and we should keep
using PROC LOGISTIC.

44
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,245
But using PROC GENMOD,

45
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:05,330
will illustrate once more

46
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,470
the differences between the

47
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,845
logistic and the
log-binomial model.

48
00:02:08,845 --> 00:02:11,390
Remember the unit is specified

49
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,880
the proper distribution
and the proper link,

50
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,410
which for logistic regression is

51
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:18,650
binomial and logit respectively.

52
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:21,330
We get exactly the same as

53
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:23,790
ratio as we got in
our two by two table.

54
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:26,150
Interpretation is
that the odds of

55
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,205
abdominal obesity is almost

56
00:02:28,205 --> 00:02:31,345
five times higher in
females than males.

57
00:02:31,345 --> 00:02:35,370
Now, let's change in the
link from logit to log,

58
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:39,350
we will be doing a log-binomial
model with PROC GENMOD.

59
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,370
We run it and we get

60
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,990
the same prevalence ratio that we

61
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:46,370
got when we did our
two by two table.

62
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,260
Note that interpretation now
is that the prevalence of

63
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:52,450
abdominal obesity is 3.5

64
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:55,640
times higher among females
compared with males.

65
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,080
Now, we talk about prevalence
and the risk because

66
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,490
we are in the context of

67
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,960
a cross-sectional
study, remember.

68
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,950
Finally, there are
some controversies

69
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,405
in the literature about

70
00:03:07,405 --> 00:03:09,040
using odds ratios or

71
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,915
prevalent ratios in
cross-sectional studies.

72
00:03:11,915 --> 00:03:15,000
In a way, and this
is my personal bias,

73
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,900
it makes more sense to report

74
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:19,645
a prevalence ratio in a
cross-sectional study,

75
00:03:19,645 --> 00:03:22,475
because after all, you are
calculating prevalence.

76
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:25,455
But as long as you
interpret it correctly,

77
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:27,345
you can use either.

78
00:03:27,345 --> 00:03:29,490
In summary, in this video,

79
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,035
we use PROC GENMOD run

80
00:03:31,035 --> 00:03:32,570
a log-binomial model in

81
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,745
the context of a
cross-sectional study.

82
00:03:34,745 --> 00:03:37,250
In the next video, we
will finally get a

83
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:41,184
little deeper into the
estimated statement.
