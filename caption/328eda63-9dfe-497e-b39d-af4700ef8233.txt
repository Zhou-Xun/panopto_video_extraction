1
00:00:03,430 --> 00:00:06,969
Okay. All right.

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:14,300
So screaming is the use of a test that classifies apparently healthy people as likely having or not likely having the disease.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,350
So this is important, right? So is it's healthy people.

4
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:25,770
Screening is only in healthy people. So some some of you guys have been looking at some of these tests are also used for diagnosis.

5
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:33,040
Right. Like so PSA for prostate cancer is used to screen asymptomatic people in whom there's no suspicion of prostate cancer.

6
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:40,690
But it's also given as like a diagnostic test to men who maybe have an abnormal physical exam or something like that.

7
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,760
Right. So just keep in your head.

8
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:48,669
Kind of the difference between screening is when you're doing it, you don't suspect disease, you're doing it in healthy people.

9
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:54,380
It's kind of like classify them as likely out of here. Like you're not having the disease and then testing.

10
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:01,479
Diagnostic testing is like if you have some reason to suspect, you might also use this test just to see likely having or not likely having.

11
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,510
We'll talk about that. Screening tests always require more workup.

12
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:14,160
Right. And generally for cancer, what if you have like a suspicious mammogram or a high PSA?

13
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:20,380
Like what would the next thing be that you would do? What's like the diagnostic test biopsy?

14
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:28,000
That's right, the biopsy. So that's why we don't just do biopsies on everybody because that's kind of invasive or not.

15
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:39,729
Right. Okay. So we have screening for these cancers for cervix and colorectal cancer.

16
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,060
I think we've talked about this quite a bit before. We can actually prevent cancer by removing pre-cancerous lesions.

17
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,780
So we're hopefully screening ideally, we're screening for the precancerous lesions for those cancers.

18
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:56,360
So for those cancers, successful cancer screening will decrease mortality, but also incidence of the cancer.

19
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:06,100
Right. We also have cancer screening tests where we hope to detect the cancer early and then with treatment, reduce the mortality.

20
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:10,450
Right. And those are, of course, breast and lung, but also cervix and colorectal.

21
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:14,020
Right. We may not catch the precancerous lesion, but we can certainly catch the cancer early.

22
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:20,860
If we are able to do that, then we have oral skin and prostate cancer screening.

23
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:29,770
Prostate. We're going to talk a bit about the the issue is that the benefit to harms ratio may not be optimal for PSA screening.

24
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:37,690
And we'll talk about that. Oral and skin. I would say the issue here is that the mortality reduction is unclear.

25
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:43,690
What is oral cancer screening? Anybody now? You've all probably had it.

26
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:51,220
Yeah. Anybody when they go to the dentist, do they do that weird thing where they like kind of take the gauze and put it around your

27
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:55,840
tongue and they kind of like move your tongue around and they poke at the bottom of your mouth. That's oral cancer screening.

28
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:03,360
And so when you get when you get to the end and you see how we evaluate screening programs, you'll see why the mortality reduction is unclear.

29
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:09,720
Right. There's not it's not clear that that's doing any good, but it's also not doing any harm.

30
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:15,820
Right. Like if they don't see something weird because have you two, you know, Dr. Chan and he can actually figure out what's going on.

31
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:21,340
Right. So there's nothing really terrible about that. And then skin cancer screening, what what do we do for skin cancer screening?

32
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:38,620
Look like you just kind of look for weird stuff, right? Like and, you know, dermatologist might actually do like a mole chat, right?

33
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,469
Where they're like, okay, you've got a mole here. We'll watch that and see if it gets bigger next year, that kind of thing.

34
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,790
Like they might make like you about your body and moles that they want to die.

35
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:55,469
So look at it. It's not it's not clear that that's really doing anything to reduce like melanoma mortality.

36
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:59,040
But why not? Right. Okay.

37
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,629
So there are a few authoritative sources for cancer screening recommendations.

38
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,570
Kind of the number one with the bullet is the US Preventive Services Task Force,

39
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,120
and that's the website that we're going to go to to kind of see if there's updates today. Also called the USPSTF.

40
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,630
Have anybody heard this? Yes. Okay, good.

41
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:22,260
So the reason that these guys are really important and one of the number one resources, because if they recommend it with an A or B rating,

42
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,709
which we're going to talk about what their scale is, then it is required to be covered by health insurance plans under the Affordable Care Act.

43
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:37,740
Right. So like Medicare, Medicaid, all of that. So health insurance plans will basically just cover it if it's recommended by rating other groups.

44
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:43,260
The American Cancer Society has their own. Sometimes they don't perfectly align, and we'll talk about that.

45
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,920
And then other groups have ones as well. We'll talk about, okay, so this is the USPSTF grading system.

46
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:58,800
So grade eight or B means A is the USPSTF recommends that high certainty that the net benefit is substantial.

47
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,060
B is that it recommends and there's high certainty that the net benefit is moderate

48
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:06,830
or there's moderate certainty that the net benefit is moderate to substantial,

49
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,920
right? So I mean, A or B basically means like, yeah, this seems to work, right?

50
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:17,130
To be is to help and the recommendation is to offer or provide this service C rating is like the wishy washy one.

51
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:24,480
C is like we recommend selectively offering or providing it to people based on professional judgment and patient preferences.

52
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,120
There's moderate certainty. The net benefit is small, so you can go ahead and do it if you want.

53
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:41,489
Kind of the thing D is actually we recommend against this don't do this thing and then I is just we don't know because there's not a lot of evidence,

54
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:48,780
insufficient evidence. Right. Okay. So that's kind of the rating system, cervical cancer screening.

55
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,270
This is recommended with an A rating for women 21 to 65.

56
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,000
The USPSTF recommends screening for cervical cancer every three years, cervical cytology alone.

57
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,930
So that's a pap smear. So every three years with Pap smear alone for women, 21 to 29 for women, 30 to 65,

58
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:15,540
they recommend every three years with pap smear alone or every five years with high risk HPV testing or five years with the two together.

59
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:22,110
Right. And we've talked a bit about this before where like pap smear is less sensitive.

60
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,660
You're more likely to miss it.

61
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:31,860
So that's why you do it more frequently, because if you miss it, then you have another chance in a shorter period of time to catch it again.

62
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:38,489
It's more sensitive if you couple it or if you do the high risk HPV, DNA testing,

63
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:42,360
which is why if you get a negative on that, then you don't have to come back for five years.

64
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,650
Right.

65
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:51,690
The reason they don't recommend the DNA testing for women 21 to 30 is because often women in that age range will have a high risk HPV infection,

66
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,850
but they clear it, right.

67
00:06:54,030 --> 00:07:00,690
So having a positive and in the 21 to 30 age range does not mean that you have the persistent infection that's likely to lead to cancer.

68
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:05,940
So you would get a ton of false positives if you used that test in younger women.

69
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,680
If a woman is 30 or older and she has a high risk HPV, DNA positive,

70
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:17,280
that probably means is more indicative of a chronic infection that might or a persistent infection that might lead to cancer.

71
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,650
Right. Okay.

72
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,230
We don't do it in women under 21.

73
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:29,890
We would do an experiment with a hysterectomy because they don't have a cervix and we don't do it in women older than 65,

74
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,270
there's often an upper age range at which we stop doing these tests,

75
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,140
because if you've had a clean test up to a negative screening test up to that point,

76
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:48,909
it's sort of unlikely that you're suddenly going to get positive or in some of the cases like colorectal cancer,

77
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:56,350
if you've had a negative screening like you're expected, lifespan is little enough passed that the cancer probably couldn't develop.

78
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:04,180
Or perhaps if you're in poor health it might actually be dangerous to undergo has to be right so at some point you kind of stop.

79
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,580
So let's look real quick at the website and see if there has been an update.

80
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:20,860
So this is USPSTF. I just Googled USPSTF and it takes you to U.S. Preventative Services, Preventive Services, Task Workforce.

81
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:33,129
So if we just do cervical cancer, it's going to come up with published screening recommendations.

82
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:37,690
So this is going to be the same, right? So this is it was updated in 2018.

83
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,810
But you can also see when you go to the website, it'll often have this yellow bar and it'll say it's being updated.

84
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:51,219
This is almost always happening, right, because there's almost always more evidence coming out and they're always like collating and

85
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,129
bringing together and keeping their eye on evidence to make sure that they should be updating.

86
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:59,170
Right. So almost always there's like an update coming.

87
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,970
So right now the recommendations are the same as what we just went through.

88
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:08,470
But you can click update in progress and this is kind of like.

89
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,120
What's happening in terms of this update, right.

90
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,750
That the current recommendation that's being used for clinical practice is this one from 2018, which is about from a slide.

91
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:25,659
Does that make sense? No, I don't care about Microsoft teams.

92
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,930
No, please don't go to Microsoft. You know that. Okay.

93
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,330
All right. So let's go back here.

94
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:43,600
And so, you know, trends and recent Pap test problems, this is a bit old, but I think it definitely shows you that insurance status matters a lot.

95
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:52,390
Right. And this is true even after, you know, even even in live in more recent years.

96
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:55,690
Right. So the total is, you know, an 80% prevalence.

97
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,800
Right. That women have had a pap test within the past three years, which is the recommendation.

98
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,740
But uninsured women are much less likely to have that right. So insurance status matters a lot.

99
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,799
Let's talk about mammography. So this is the main screening modality.

100
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,300
So when I say modality, do you know what that means? Like, it's the the the the test, the kind of test that you do.

101
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,150
So there are a few different screening modalities for breast cancer.

102
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:29,440
There's biography, but there's also breast MRI, which might be used for women with dense breasts or very strong BMI history.

103
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:36,520
But this is the most common screening modality. The most commonly recommended for average risk women is mammography.

104
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,159
Okay, so it's accurate for women of the population,

105
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,170
average risk and for women at increased risk detect 80 to 90% of breast cancer is some asymptomatic women.

106
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,750
But the majority of women with an abnormal mammogram do not have breast cancer on follow up biopsy.

107
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:56,470
So a lot of women will get a call back from their mammogram like, oh, we found something weird, you should come back.

108
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,860
And of course, this creates a huge amount. I think we talked about it in one of the news articles and I mentioned I had a friend who had

109
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:07,150
multiple friends who've had this happen creates a huge amount of like worry and concern,

110
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,980
but the vast majority of the women who are fall back end up being negative.

111
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,209
Right. So they see something funky on a map. So it's very, very sensitive.

112
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,810
They're seeing all kinds of things that they don't know exactly what it is. Could be cancer and then they double check out, oh, you're fine.

113
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:25,810
That's okay. Not everybody, obviously, but many, many of the women who get a callback are that.

114
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,920
So there's kind of this. That is one of the downsides, right?

115
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,450
That's one of the risks that should be considered for women.

116
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:40,870
High lifetime risk. They start earlier starting at age 30, and they do both MRI and mammography, like I mentioned.

117
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:47,110
So this is released in 2016. Let's double check and see if we've got something newer.

118
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,970
Now this is medication, but screening. The last one was 2016. So we're up to date here.

119
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,680
Okay. So it's a B rating for women, 50 to 74.

120
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,000
And then there's this long thing about women, 40 to 49.

121
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:16,200
But the decision is is is an individual one woman.

122
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,700
You place a higher value on potential benefit and potential harms making may choose to begin

123
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,659
screening but did a really really long like talk to your doctor and all these ifs caveats.

124
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:39,300
Right so why is this a thing? So there's this huge controversy, controversy about about breast cancer screening for average risk women 40 to 49.

125
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:45,090
So the arguments against are that the number needed to treat to avoid one death is high.

126
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:51,750
So there's a high cost to benefit ratio. There's a higher number of false positives in unnecessary biopsies than in older women.

127
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:55,890
Right. So the younger women are the ones who are more likely to get this call back and ends up being nothing.

128
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:04,140
There's a greater possibility for overdiagnosis and overtreatment. So there's this balance of benefits to harms improves as women age.

129
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:12,930
The arguments for screening is that maybe the relevant measure is the cost per life here saved,

130
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:19,170
which is actually lower because more life years are saved in younger women if they actually do have breast cancer.

131
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:25,739
Dr. Otis Brawley used to be with the American Cancer Society, and he had this.

132
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,990
There are a lot of these quotes from people in the news.

133
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:33,660
This one says with its new recommendation that the task force is essentially telling women that mammography at age 40 to 49 saves lives,

134
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:40,290
just not enough of them. And then three speakers that and the Anderson said we disagree with their conclusions you have to

135
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:45,000
screen more women is the value we put on zero women dying so there is this big argument right?

136
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:50,880
People do not like cost benefit arguments about things that will kill younger women.

137
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,390
Right.

138
00:13:52,700 --> 00:14:02,930
But if you are like trying to if you have a limited pot of money and like people who are interested in kind of that health policy management path,

139
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:08,600
if you have a limited pot of money, you have to decide what to spend it on to save the most people.

140
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,760
Maybe your bang for your buck is not breast cancer screening of women 4049.

141
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:23,359
Right. I mean, so that's kind of the if you have a limited resources, limited health care resources in terms of like people's time, physicians,

142
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,360
time and all the money that the health insurance companies are spending, like maybe it's not the best place to spend the money.

143
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,620
But again, nobody likes that argument. Right?

144
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:39,320
Because if there's a woman, 40 to 49, who got a mammogram and had her life saved, that is a much more compelling argument to people.

145
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:44,930
Right. So there were all kinds of news articles that came out,

146
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:53,960
the previous versions of these recommendations from 2000 to 2002 said B recommendation for 40 and older.

147
00:14:54,620 --> 00:15:02,060
And then after this new study came out, big screening trial came out in 2009 that influenced this change.

148
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,980
Then they started recommending at a C level for before 50.

149
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:15,260
So the ax still says that.

150
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:21,770
So they they're different. This is one of those examples where the American Cancer Society has a different recommendation than the USPSTF.

151
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:28,880
They say 40 to 44 should have the choice. 40 to 54 should get them every year and 55 and older should do it every two years.

152
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:40,870
And it should continue. They don't actually put an age limit, whereas I believe USPSTF suggests stopping at 75.

153
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,490
They say it should continue as long as a woman is in good health and is expected to live ten more years or longer.

154
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,770
Okay. So very similar, but, you know, slight differences.

155
00:15:51,220 --> 00:16:02,110
I will tell you, though, that screening that the insurance companies still, no question, cover screening for women younger than 50.

156
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:09,460
I mean, how I know, you know, if your doctor says you should get it, they recommended that they cover their problem.

157
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:17,530
Right. So so the the C recommendation, the change to the key recommendation did not actually change like insurance companies policy about covering.

158
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:26,580
Okay. Colorectal cancer screening. Let's double check this one because I know it was changed recently, but that looks like it might be the new one.

159
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:41,280
Yeah. 2021. Okay, good. All right.

160
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,200
So this was very recently updated to include recommending it.

161
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:53,850
It used to be adults 50 to 75. Now it goes down to 45 because we have had an increase in younger onset colorectal cancer.

162
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:58,350
That has been increasing over time. The last ten years, maybe something like that.

163
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,700
So they have now actually reduced the the beginning age.

164
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:11,970
Right. As my husband is thrilled about this, let me tell you, as a person who is 45, I was like, oh, you're married to a cancer epidemiologist.

165
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,950
That's what you get to do. Ask your doctor. Yeah.

166
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,620
There's there's some downsides, it turns out, to being married to cancer after the allergies.

167
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,400
All right. And then they say, see rating for older people, right?

168
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,139
Because if you're in really if you're in poor health in your seventies, there's no point in, you know,

169
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:37,260
if you're not expected to live that much longer, which is a weird and kind of uncomfortable conversation to have with a patient.

170
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,930
I imagine, like, oh, we don't need to bother doing colorectal cancer screening because something else is going to kill you before that ever does.

171
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:49,080
You know, but I mean, that is kind of the logic of that, cutting it off at the older ages.

172
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:54,000
Right. So I'm sure that there is a much more sensitive way to have that conversation with an individual than what I just said.

173
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,410
But yes, that is kind of that idea, right?

174
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,260
That we don't continue to screen people who might be at higher risk from the screening test itself and really don't need it.

175
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:07,810
Right. Okay.

176
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:14,530
So the rates of colorectal cancer incidence have been decreasing for the past 20 years due to

177
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:21,099
that increased screening and removal of these pre-cancerous lesions among 50 plus year olds.

178
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,930
Rates are declining in all people, right?

179
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:32,110
But among people younger than 50 in whom screening until recently was not recommended, if you are at average risk, the rates were increasing.

180
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:40,809
Right. So screening is part of the answer. But primary prevention still remains very important for this and for other cancers.

181
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:47,350
Right. That make sense. All right.

182
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,850
Screening increased really kind of plateaued in the 20 tens.

183
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:58,060
I will tell you, it's a hard sell getting people to do colorectal cancer screening.

184
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:03,040
A lot of research in colorectal cancer is trying to come up with a better screening

185
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,360
test in the sense that it's a more palatable and easier to implement screening test.

186
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:12,390
Right. Colonoscopies work amazingly. But there's the day of I think I went through this before.

187
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:17,190
Right. Did I tell you guys about the prep and everything? Yeah. So there's the whole day of prep.

188
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,620
You have to take time off work. You have to have someone else take time off work to drive you.

189
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:25,150
You have to you're off for two more days between the press and the anesthesia for the procedure.

190
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:32,110
It's not nothing, right? And it's not something you're going to pay for out of pocket if you don't have insurance.

191
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:38,350
Right. So this is a tougher one than, you know, mammography or a cervical cancer screening.

192
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:45,970
But you can kind of do like on your way to work if you had to write. All right.

193
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,250
There are there are important disparities here.

194
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:55,510
Obviously, there's a big gap between uninsured and insured because colonoscopy is one of those things.

195
00:19:55,510 --> 00:20:01,000
So it's expensive, right? It's an outpatient surgery sort of thing.

196
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:07,730
Right. You have to have the it's not like full on anesthesia like you were having a surgery, but it's you're asleep, right.

197
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:14,299
So you have to have somebody to administer that. It's done in a hospital, you know, so it's a little bit more involved.

198
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,170
And certainly if you were to pay for it out of pocket, much more expensive than something else.

199
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:25,399
Right. So big insurance gaps and big racial disparities here even within insurance status.

200
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:32,330
Right. You can see the Hispanic people have some of the lowest rates, non-Hispanic white, and that has been a black or white,

201
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:35,030
non-Hispanic black actually has a slightly higher rate,

202
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,340
which is maybe not what you would expect given some of the conversations we've had in this class before.

203
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,430
And then Asian are a little bit lower as well.

204
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:53,860
So some some strides to be made and some opportunities for interventions, perhaps, that are a little bit more culturally tailored.

205
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:03,440
Okay. Prostate cancer screening. This is a fun one. Let's double check that there aren't updates here.

206
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:19,950
Okay. 2018. So this is the most updated one. I didn't even have to confess my lack my lack of preparedness to you guys could have just gone with it.

207
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,230
Okay, so this was updated on my birthday in 2018.

208
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,210
Happy birthday to me. So okay.

209
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,709
Upgraded. It was changed my c rating for men 55 to 69 years.

210
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,420
But this long thing about, you know, should be an individual choice.

211
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,909
Before deciding whether to be screened,

212
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:46,830
men should discuss the potential benefits and harms with their clinician and incorporate their values and preferences into the decision.

213
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,120
And they recommend against PSA screening for men 70 and older.

214
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:57,690
The issue with this is this issue of overtreatment.

215
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:57,990
Right.

216
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:06,360
That is really the only issue with PSA screening is that we are catching cancers that we know some of them are indolent and don't need treatment.

217
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,450
So we're over treating men and that has a lot of potential negative consequences.

218
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:15,990
So the harms of screening and over treating are somewhat high.

219
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:24,660
And in 2012, which is, you know, six years before this, they actually recommended against PSA screening with a D rating.

220
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:31,850
And you can actually see the like a slight uptick in prostate cancer mortality started to happen after this.

221
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,600
The this D rating came out because men stopped giving screened.

222
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:46,290
Before that it was, I believe, a B rating. So went from B to D and then they're like, ooh, actually, let's course correct,

223
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:50,820
because this is increasing mortality, but let's go back to a C, everybody can decide for themselves.

224
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,530
It's a bit of a mess,

225
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:07,560
but X has never changed their recommendation that men at 50 should start getting PSA screening 45 for men at high risk and 44 men at even higher risk.

226
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,400
And they're including in the high risk people, African-Americans,

227
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:15,930
because they have a 2 to 3 times higher risk of both getting and dying of prostate cancer.

228
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:20,550
So this is another example of where their recommendation differs.

229
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:30,509
Part of the reason that there was this big controversy and that they reversed it to a D rating was this evidence from the placebo trial?

230
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:37,920
So there were two big trials. We're going to talk again a little bit later about how we conduct these trials and how we avoid biases in these trials.

231
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:45,600
But the number one way, the correct way to evaluate a screening test is to do a randomized controlled trial

232
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,630
where you randomized some people to get the screening test and some people not,

233
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,750
and you compare mortality from that cancer in the screened people and then on screen people.

234
00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:01,440
And if your screening test works, you should see lower in this case, prostate cancer mortality in your screened group over time.

235
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,620
Right. That indicates that your screening test is working.

236
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,059
So what you see here, there were two big trials.

237
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:14,820
One was done in the U.S. That was the PSA trial and one was done in Europe with various sites in Europe.

238
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,210
And that was the e r p e r s PC trial.

239
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:24,290
PLSA found no associations, so no benefit, right?

240
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,590
Relative risk close to one and the confidence level crosses one.

241
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:34,350
So there's no statistically significant difference in prostate cancer mortality between those who got PSA and those who didn't.

242
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:43,290
Here we see a pretty, pretty good reduction in prostate cancer mortality in the people who got the screening.

243
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,209
So why is this different? Well, I think I've mentioned this trial before.

244
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:54,540
PALKOT There are differences in the world in who has implemented population based PSA screening.

245
00:24:55,320 --> 00:25:02,010
Really, the only two places that have really implemented PSA screening for prostate cancer are the U.S., Australia.

246
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:08,670
Most places in Europe do not do it. I mean, some men will go in and say, I really want this test and they'll pay for it out of pocket.

247
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:12,600
But like their national health care systems do not pay for population based PSA screening.

248
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:22,649
They don't use it there. So when these trials were happening in the nineties, PSA trials done in the US began in like 1992,

249
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:25,830
94 or something like that, right around the time that the PSA test came out.

250
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:33,090
So they randomized people to either get the PSA test from the trial or to get the usual standard of care from their doctor,

251
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:38,160
which very quickly became getting PSA screening.

252
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:45,149
So over time, they were comparing men who got PSA screening from the trial to men who got PSA screening from their doctor.

253
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:52,530
And I know you'll be shocked to know that they found no difference. It didn't matter who gave you the PSA test, it was the same.

254
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,530
So if you compare your people who are randomized to screening to other people who get screening, you don't see a difference.

255
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:06,600
Whereas in Europe, the men not randomized to screening were not getting PSA screening by their doctor because they didn't implement population.

256
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:13,020
So people came to the site, but who actually knows? Possible result is not right.

257
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:20,490
This is this is the result of a lot of contamination. The European trial is probably closer to correct.

258
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:26,639
So there actually is a benefit. So even though there's over treatment, there is still a benefit.

259
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,800
And maybe that's why they moved back to the sea. Does that make sense to everybody?

260
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:37,560
So there's been a lot of sort of controversy and back and forth about PSA screening, but we've landed on this wishy washy sea recommendation.

261
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:48,680
All right. So effective in September of 2010 under the US Affordable Care Act.

262
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,540
These are the things that are covered. Colorectal cancer screening for people over 50.

263
00:26:53,990 --> 00:26:59,120
Breast cancer mammography for women over 40. They went with that old recommendation.

264
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,209
Right? Cervical cancer and HPV.

265
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:08,690
DNA test for people 31, 30 and older. No co-pays, no current co-insurance.

266
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,230
Just got it for free. Here's another one that is interesting.

267
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:19,190
One cancer screening. So this is kind of the newest one for which we have a screening test.

268
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,820
So the 24 recommendation was basically I there's insufficient evidence.

269
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:37,660
But in 2011, the results of the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

270
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:42,580
You know, just that old rag. No one's ever heard of that, right?

271
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:47,110
During the journal Super Procedure.

272
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:53,469
Okay. So lung cancer mortality rates were actually 20% lower in the low dose ETR than the comparison arm,

273
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:59,180
which was regular chest X-ray, which has kind of been shown to be ineffective with one of those people things that people did.

274
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:04,720
But it wasn't really doing any good. Okay.

275
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,629
So they did demonstrate this lower lung cancer mortality rate,

276
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:17,980
but they actually had a fairly high positive screen rate, of which a lot were false positives.

277
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:26,260
So we're kind of in that same place that we're at with mammography, right, where a lot of people end up having something that looks funny.

278
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:31,480
They get called back for a biopsy. And I will tell you, a lung biopsy is even less fun than a breast biopsy.

279
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:35,200
Right. Or it's it's it's more invasive.

280
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,640
It entails more potential risk to the patient. Right. So this is a potential issue.

281
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:47,950
But we do it right now recommended with a B rating for people with a profound attack here.

282
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,150
It's not in history. Right.

283
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,000
All right.

284
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:02,980
Any questions about the existing screening test recommendations before we kind of go into this discussion of how we evaluate screening programs?

285
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:15,030
Okay. So as we said, screening is a test as applied to an asymptomatic population to try to separate people into people,

286
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:19,020
people into groups of people who likely have or likely do not have the disease.

287
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:23,250
Right. So some of these people will screen negative. Some will screen positive.

288
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:28,440
Of those who screened positive, they go on to have some sort of more invasive diagnostic test.

289
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:37,710
In the case of cancer, generally, that's a biopsy. And then those people will be separated into disease negative and disease positive.

290
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:46,350
But there's probably some people who end up getting screened negative who actually did have the disease.

291
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:50,400
Right. Which is why you then continue to screen people over time.

292
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,530
Right. Also, people could develop the disease over time.

293
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:58,930
They could have been negative at the screening and they may be screened again later because they could develop it in the interim.

294
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,460
But you could also just be missing people. No, no test is perfect.

295
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:12,640
Right. So the goal of screening is to identify apparently healthy people who have early asymptomatic disease so that their disease may be treated.

296
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:17,800
And because of that, early treatment still is going to have lower morbidity and a greater probability of survival.

297
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:24,340
So we also called screening early detection. But then when is early and when is it too late?

298
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,210
So these are some you're going to see a lot of these timelines.

299
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,470
Right. So this is the natural history of some sort of cancer.

300
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:38,620
All right. So you have biological onset, which is honestly, no one knows when that is.

301
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,540
Right. What is the moment? Someone who has cancer, no one knows that.

302
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:47,410
Right. What we know is when they get diagnosed or maybe when they have symptoms.

303
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:54,730
Right. But they had some biological onset of cancer long before that probably.

304
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,210
Right. So this is sort of a theoretical moment.

305
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,090
And then if they weren't screened, there would be some point in which they would develop symptoms.

306
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,319
They would then be diagnosed and treated and there would be some outcome.

307
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,900
Either they recovered or they died. Right.

308
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:19,120
This is what we call the clinical phase, the time between onset of symptoms and kind of the rest of the disease process.

309
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:27,030
This is the total preclinical phase from the moment of biological onset until they get symptoms.

310
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:34,230
Does that make sense? Okay. Also, we can call that the asymptomatic and the symptomatic phases.

311
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:47,930
All right. So imagine that there is some portion of this total preclinical phase where you could detect your disease by a screening test.

312
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:57,370
That's the detectable preclinical phase. Okay. So the detectable preclinical phase begins.

313
00:31:57,910 --> 00:32:05,080
So when that detectable preclinical phase begins depends both on the natural history of the disease and on your testis characteristics.

314
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,729
Right. Imagine there are two tests and one of them is better at detecting earlier.

315
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:15,790
Right. So that the detectable preclinical phase is longer with that test than it is with a different test.

316
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:24,970
Right. So it's both it's the disease itself, but also the test. So the disease being in that detectable preclinical phase is what we mean by early.

317
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:30,639
That's early detection. There is some theoretical point.

318
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,210
This is another kind of theoretical point that we can't know exactly when this is right.

319
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:39,159
But theoretically, there's a point in the natural history of the disease before which treatment

320
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:43,240
is less difficult or more effective if the disease is potentially curable.

321
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:47,710
It may be possible before that clinical point, but not after.

322
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:52,840
Right. For screening to be effective. It must occur before the critical point.

323
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:57,130
So if that critical point is during the clinical phase, screening may not be needed.

324
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:05,080
Let's look at a picture to make this more clear. So we talked about this kind of theoretical moment of biological onset.

325
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,890
Before this, you don't have cancer. And after this moment, you do. Right.

326
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:15,940
This is that first point in the detectable preclinical phase. This is that moment when you're screening test can start detecting the cancer.

327
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:21,549
This is when you would have gotten symptoms and this is when you would have usually been diagnosed.

328
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:26,560
And this is that final outcome. Pathologic changes are occurring all through here.

329
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:34,150
So let's imagine three different critical points. So if the critical point is here, after, you would have developed symptoms.

330
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:43,990
It doesn't matter. Right. You're still catching the disease early enough to be successful at treating it even without a screening test.

331
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:48,340
So you may not need screening if the critical point of the disease is here.

332
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:51,880
Right. Catching it earlier may not change everything. Right.

333
00:33:52,420 --> 00:34:01,180
Does that make sense? If the critical point is here before you can even detect it with your test screening isn't going to work.

334
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:09,250
Right. Because the the the moment has passed before, which you could actually make a difference by the time you can detect it with your test.

335
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,630
So that's another way that screening might not actually do any good.

336
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:22,879
But if your critical point is here, kind of beef between that first point and the detectable preclinical phase and symptoms.

337
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:29,380
So during that detectable preclinical phase, that's when that's the sweet spot, right?

338
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:33,520
If your critical point is in there, that's when you're going to do some good with screening.

339
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:41,870
That makes sense. Okay. So what diseases are appropriate for screening?

340
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:49,600
Well, I have to be pretty serious, right? The disease has to have an established treatment or at least something that you would do about it.

341
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:54,100
Can anybody think of a disease that doesn't really have a treatment that we screen for anyway?

342
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,690
We actually don't screen for pancreatic cancer only. It's not one of those that we screen for.

343
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:10,260
But yeah. Yeah.

344
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,310
We don't really screen people, right? So we test them if they have symptoms, but we're not really screening disease free people.

345
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:28,220
Anybody else? Think of anything. I'm thinking about like genetic maybe genetic testing for Huntington's disease, which is kind of uniformly fatal.

346
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:37,340
But people may want to know that they have it before they become sick so that they can make some plans for end of life care and things like that.

347
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:45,800
Sometimes we screen for like prenatal things that are going to be fatal or that aren't curable.

348
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:53,860
So, for example, we might screen for Down's syndrome, and there are people who would choose to terminate the pregnancy based on that.

349
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:57,470
Right. But many people don't. And they still might want to know that.

350
00:35:57,470 --> 00:36:04,010
So they can maybe get on the list for a special preschool or, you know, make plans for how they're going to you know,

351
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:09,380
you might have a different plan for care for that child than a child who wasn't who didn't have Down syndrome.

352
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:09,680
Right.

353
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:18,469
So some of those kinds of things where there's not really a cure for the disease and maybe nothing you could actually do about the condition itself.

354
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:26,360
But knowing about it helps you make plans. But generally, we screen for things, especially in the cancer setting that we're talking about.

355
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:30,710
We screen for things that have an established treatment. Okay.

356
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:38,000
You if early detection coupled with treatment leads to a better outcome, that would be an appropriate disease for screening.

357
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,929
That's really what we're testing when we're doing these these trials.

358
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,370
Right. We're testing to see if that's true.

359
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:52,220
You want a disease that has a detectable preclinical phase, so you want to be able to detect it in people who are asymptomatic.

360
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:57,380
This has to be adequately along. Right. So that's why cancer is a pretty good one.

361
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:06,230
Cancer generally does have a fairly long preclinical phase and a very detectable preclinical phase.

362
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:12,050
Right. And the prevalence of disease has to be high in the population to be screened.

363
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:20,240
That's one where a lot of cancers fail. Right. Because cancer, even common cancers, are a fairly rare disease in the general population.

364
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:26,299
Right. That's why we restrict to older ages for a lot of these screening tests,

365
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:33,410
because you're bumping up the prevalence of the disease in the population by by by restricting to older people.

366
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,580
Does that make sense? Okay.

367
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:44,780
So we have some important screening assumptions. One is that most clinical cases pass through a detectable preclinical phase.

368
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:51,620
Right. You just jump from biological onset straight to like symptoms and without treatment.

369
00:37:51,650 --> 00:37:55,020
Most cases in that preclinical phase would progress to a clinical phase.

370
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,240
So we're kind of assuming that they all kind of move along that natural history timeline.

371
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,880
Okay. What about appropriate screening tests?

372
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:13,520
They have to be fairly inexpensive, easy to administer, minimal risk of discomfort and injury because you're doing this to healthy people.

373
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:18,970
Right. You don't want to take healthy people and do something to them that's going to be worse than the disease you're screening for.

374
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:25,080
Right. This has to be pretty minimally invasive. What's wrong way valid and reliable.

375
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:29,410
We're going to talk about what that means. Meaning it has a high sensitivity and specificity for the disease.

376
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:37,950
These are the probability statements for sensitivity and specificity, which if you haven't seen that before, don't worry about it.

377
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:43,630
It's okay. They have to have high precision, meaning they're repeatable and reliable.

378
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:51,870
Okay. So let's talk now about what we mean by sensitivity and specificity.

379
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:54,940
So how many people have seen this mathematically in a class before?

380
00:38:55,330 --> 00:39:01,490
And a few of you. What class did you take that talked about that figure?

381
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:10,270
383, 83, 83. So is that one that like only the best people take, or is it an elective acquired by all students?

382
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:15,200
Oh, okay. So some of you are taking it now.

383
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,880
No, no. Next time. So you'll take as I see. So people who are juniors.

384
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,740
It's the fall. It's not winner. Sorry, I'm a mess.

385
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:29,970
Okay, so people who are juniors will take it next time. That's probably the most of you who have not seen it.

386
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:34,700
Right. Okay. Got it. Was the preview then rolling up my sleeves?

387
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,849
Because we're going to talk about sensitivity. Specificity. All right.

388
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,240
So if you have a two by two table where you have disease status and test status,

389
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:49,270
this is the truth according to some gold standard, which would probably be a biopsy in the case of cancer.

390
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,469
Right. So these are people who really have cancer and really don't have cancer, and this is their result on the test.

391
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:58,820
So people who are here who test positive and are positive, those are your true positives.

392
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:03,590
People who test positive but don't really have the disease are false positives.

393
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:08,940
People who test negative and truly do not have the disease are true negatives.

394
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,620
People who test negative but do have a disease are false negatives.

395
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,760
Makes sense to everybody how we set up this table. Okay.

396
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:24,630
So the sensitivity of a screening test is the probability that you test positive given that you truly have the disease.

397
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:35,240
So in mathematically it is a over A-plus C in this table probability that you test positive given that you truly have a disease.

398
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:45,830
Specificity is the kind of the opposite is the probability that you test negative given that you truly do not have the disease.

399
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:52,490
Mathematically in this table that is D over B plus D. Okay.

400
00:40:52,730 --> 00:41:00,650
Not going to ask you guys to calculate this. If the math is stressing you out and the concept makes sense, that's fine.

401
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:07,570
Okay. So we will offer visa.

402
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:12,680
They often are like on a seesaw.

403
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:21,030
Often, if you have a test with a better, higher sensitivity, you're going to give up some specificity for that, right?

404
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:27,230
So if you're going to try to catch all of the true disease people, you're going to end up with some false positives.

405
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:31,490
And how a lower sensitivity specificity, sorry,

406
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,890
high sensitivity will probably give you a lower specificity because you're going to get some false positives.

407
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:43,760
Okay. If you really want good specificity, you're going to miss some true positives.

408
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:48,740
So you're going to have a lower sensitivity often. Does that make sense?

409
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:56,630
It's a give and take a little bit. Few tests have fantastic sensitivity and specificity.

410
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:03,369
In the case of cancer screening, which would you want to do?

411
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:10,750
Would you want to make sure that you don't call somebody positive when they truly aren't?

412
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:16,750
Or would you want to make sure that you catch everybody who might have the cancer and send them for a biopsy?

413
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:29,330
We tend to err on the side of having a more sensitive test versus a more specific test.

414
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:37,760
PSA is very sensitive, catches a lot of things that are not actually cancer, that mammography is very sensitive.

415
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:43,040
A lot of people get called back for a biopsy who don't end up having cancer.

416
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:53,510
It's not very specific. You end up with a lot of false positives that make sense and kind of intuitively why we do it that way.

417
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:56,520
Right. We're not subjecting the whole population to a biopsy.

418
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:59,780
We get these people who might have cancer and then we do a biopsy on them.

419
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,330
Yeah. Okay.

420
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:11,710
So when we evaluate screening programs, many screening tests are valid and reliable.

421
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,580
They detect the presence of disease in that detectable preclinical phase.

422
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:21,670
But the question is, does the use of these tests actually beneficially influence the natural history of the disease?

423
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:27,640
So to answer these questions, we have to evaluate the effective effectiveness of a screening program using that test.

424
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,690
What is the influence of the screening program on the disease outcome?

425
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:39,070
That's what we really want to know is a screening program is the combination of the application of the screening test,

426
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:44,499
the diagnostic workup of the people who test positive, and then the treatment of people who are diagnosed.

427
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:49,960
Right. I think we think of this piece as a screening program, but the screening program is all of the right.

428
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:56,740
Remember, we have to have a treatment that works in order for the screening test to actually

429
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:03,340
be useful and to to to actually have a beneficial impact on the outcome.

430
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:09,240
Right. So the screening program has kind of all of this together. All right.

431
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,690
So why do you have to evaluate? Well,

432
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:16,509
some risk is incurred directly to the screening of the subsequent diagnostic workup and treatment so there can be individual

433
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:21,460
harm from undergoing the treat the screening test that you don't want to subject people to if it's not actually do anything.

434
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:31,750
And then large scale screening programs are really expensive, it would maybe unnecessarily reduce resources available for other things, right?

435
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:38,100
So you don't want to do a screening program that's not going to do anything right.

436
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,760
All right. So when we evaluate this, we have to consider epidemiologic methods,

437
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,060
measures of screening program effectiveness and potential sources of bias in these studies.

438
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:57,600
Okay. So we're going to talk about that now. So there's a few different ways that you can evaluate screening programs.

439
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:02,850
You could use an observational study we talked about some would be designed like a cohort study or a case control study.

440
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:08,520
Right. The investigators just observing the screening status of each member of a study population

441
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:13,320
and comparing the cancer mortality of those that didn't didn't get the screening test.

442
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:20,550
So this is much faster and cheaper than a randomized trial. You might be able to use existing data, but it's prone to a lot of bias.

443
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:29,160
The right way to do it is to do a trial where you assign the screening test or no screening to members of the study population randomly.

444
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:37,410
But this is very expensive. But I will tell you, it's way less expensive than instituting a cancer screening program that doesn't work.

445
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:48,070
Probably, which is why they do them. All right, optimal epidemiologic design.

446
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:52,720
You've got screened and non screened and you randomize people.

447
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:57,130
Okay, so what do you want to measure?

448
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:04,900
What is the measure? What is your outcome that you're going to measure in your two groups, people who are randomized to screening those that weren't?

449
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:09,610
What do you want to know to evaluate whether this was effective?

450
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,470
Gasoline mortality rates. That's from what? That's right.

451
00:46:16,500 --> 00:46:20,340
Cancer specific mortality rates is the answer. Did you guys have something else you were going to mention?

452
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:24,960
All right. Cause specific mortality rate.

453
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,670
If you remember nothing else, I'm going to put it in red like every time, because this is a thing to remember.

454
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:36,809
If you want to evaluate a screening program, the measure of effectiveness is whether or not the cause specific mortality rate

455
00:46:36,810 --> 00:46:45,450
is lower in the people who got the screening test than the people who did not. You can also look at other things they are.

456
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:53,090
Supplementary information. None of this is giving you the answer to your question.

457
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:57,650
You want to look at the incidence rate. You want to look at stage shifts.

458
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:01,159
You want to look at the number of years to survive post diagnosis.

459
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:05,480
And we're going to talk about why and how those all produce biased answers in a minute.

460
00:47:07,070 --> 00:47:15,500
Screening is only effective if the cause specific mortality rate declines have either prevented or delayed deaths from the cancer.

461
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:22,160
Let's talk about what that means. If you have this is under the no screening.

462
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:27,950
This is the natural history line under no screening. There's some moment, a biological onset.

463
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:32,540
You would usually be diagnosed here and you would die. That is the normal way.

464
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:38,760
If you didn't screen, there's two ways that screening can be effective.

465
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:47,350
You diagnose it earlier and either you prevent death from the disease entirely because the person doesn't die from the disease here.

466
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:54,350
They died from something else later. And so these are some life years gained or they do die from the disease.

467
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:57,870
But later. So you have delayed death from disease, right?

468
00:47:57,890 --> 00:48:04,520
So you can either completely prevent it by them dying of something else or you can delay if they died of the disease, just not what they would have.

469
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:10,150
Does that make sense? Okay.

470
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,510
So death from the disease is the end point for screening program effectiveness.

471
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,730
We've got our study population.

472
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:22,090
We've randomized them to screening or no screening, and then we count up how many people do and do not die from the disease in each group.

473
00:48:24,460 --> 00:48:28,660
All right. Supportive, only a shift in stage and cancer diagnosis.

474
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:32,860
So a distribution to an earlier moment in the natural history of disease at diagnosis,

475
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,890
a lower case fatality proportion or increased five year survival.

476
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:45,190
We're going to talk about why all of these are wrong. They can be supportive, but they do not provide you the answer you're looking for.

477
00:48:46,030 --> 00:48:52,179
Okay. We told you that these are sources of bias.

478
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:56,740
We're going to go over each of these in more detail. So volunteer bias is a concern only in observational studies.

479
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,350
It's essentially confounding, right?

480
00:48:59,350 --> 00:49:05,020
People who you're if you are not randomizing people, you're comparing people who chose to be screened to people who didn't.

481
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,370
People who choose to screening may have health seeking behaviors in general. Maybe they're healthier people, right?

482
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:15,460
They go to the doctor more often for checkups.

483
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:19,959
Their overall health is better. Maybe they eat healthier, maybe they work out, maybe they take vitamins.

484
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,340
I don't know. But generally this would make the bias toward screening appearing more beneficial.

485
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,920
I think that's the direction that most people immediately think of with volunteer bias.

486
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:36,280
Could be the other way though, right? What if a person has a really strong family history?

487
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,730
That person's going to be really motivated to make sure they get their screening.

488
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:45,490
So if people who have a very strong family history are the ones who are going to get screened more frequently,

489
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:49,600
then you could have a bias towards screening appearing.

490
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:54,370
Not beneficial, right? Because those people might actually who are getting screened might actually have a higher risk of the disease.

491
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,840
So it can go either way. You're not going to know which way it's going.

492
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:02,469
So that's why doing an observational study isn't really the right answer.

493
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:06,160
It's much more difficult to deal with these potential sources of bias.

494
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,450
So randomized studies are the right answer for evaluating screening programs.

495
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:15,220
Okay. Now you can also have something called lead time.

496
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:18,670
This isn't a problem. This is also a problem in randomized studies.

497
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,700
This is a problem in all studies. So now we're talking about problems.

498
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,810
We kind of got volunteer bias out of the way, which is a specific problem to observational studies.

499
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,650
The rest of these are all possibly sources of bias, even in trials.

500
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:33,130
Okay, so let's talk about lead time.

501
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:38,300
Here's our nice little natural history line. We have our moment of biological onset here.

502
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:45,100
It's detectable by screening. This is when you would have had symptoms and this is when you would have gotten treatment and gotten the outcome.

503
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:52,620
Okay. So this is the usual time of diagnosis. This is when you actually got detected by screening.

504
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,890
This is the lead time. All right.

505
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:07,770
Imagine you have under no screening program.

506
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:14,790
You usually got diagnosed here and this is what you usually would have died in an ineffective screening program.

507
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,400
The person died at the same moment, but they got diagnosed earlier.

508
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,190
If you had this happen.

509
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:37,620
And I said people in the screening arm live seven years after diagnosis, whereas people in the non screening are only lived five years.

510
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:43,500
That sounds good, right? Well people have the screening arm live longer,

511
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:53,370
but you have no idea if they lived longer because you actually moved their death date back or only because you moved their diagnosis date forward.

512
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:00,860
That's lead time bias. Here's an effective screening program.

513
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,989
Usual time of diagnosis. Usual time of death. You move their death back.

514
00:52:05,990 --> 00:52:09,980
So they got some gained time, but they were also diagnosed earlier.

515
00:52:10,910 --> 00:52:14,280
Okay. So this is the usual survival time.

516
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:28,470
This is lead time. So your survival time in any screening program is going to be survival time, plus lead time in an effective screening program.

517
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:31,740
It's going to be survival time plus lead time plus gains time.

518
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:38,530
You cannot separate that out. You only know the time, right?

519
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:42,549
Because you don't know for each person. This is theoretical.

520
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:47,560
When what a person you have usually been diagnosed, if they hadn't been screened, you don't know that, right?

521
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:58,870
You cannot pass out what the survival time would have been versus what of the total survival time you're observing in your screened people.

522
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:04,230
Which piece of that survival time they would have had anyway versus what lead time versus what's gained time?

523
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:07,480
You only know that it's more. It should always be more.

524
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:11,800
Even if the screening whether the screening program is effective or ineffective,

525
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:16,060
your survival time should be longer in the screened people because they're getting diagnosed earlier.

526
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:21,430
What you care about is whether they're dying more or not. Right.

527
00:53:21,610 --> 00:53:24,760
And you cannot tell that by looking at the amount of time they survived.

528
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:29,980
It should be longer. Even if your screening test is doing nothing.

529
00:53:32,190 --> 00:53:41,700
Does that make sense? Okay, so lead time biases when survival appears longer to screen just because their diagnosis was advanced in time,

530
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:45,690
not only because early detection improved outcome if the screening is effective.

531
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,760
This is a concern in both observational studies and randomized trials.

532
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:56,370
So the answer here is you do not look at survival time as your outcome.

533
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:05,250
You look at what is your outcome, and then what kind of mortality could cause specific mortality.

534
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:09,270
That's right. Mortality from the cancer that you're that you're screening for.

535
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,460
That's the only thing you really want to look at. Let's look at length bias.

536
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:20,070
The idea here is that you have cancers that are biologically different.

537
00:54:20,850 --> 00:54:24,960
Right. Some of them will progress more slowly. Some will progress more quickly.

538
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:30,480
It's just a normal thing. Some are more aggressive inherently and some are less aggressive.

539
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,400
So with a faster progressing cancer, all of the phases are shorter.

540
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:41,670
Right. Imagine you have five different people.

541
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:47,940
Person one is a slow progress or a person who is a slow progress are three is medium, four is medium, five is fast.

542
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:53,470
Now imagine that you have screening intervals at one one year and say, okay,

543
00:54:54,870 --> 00:55:04,320
if that's the case, remember that this pre-clinical phase is our opportunity to catch people.

544
00:55:04,950 --> 00:55:10,709
Right. The clinical phase is when they start having symptoms. If you're catching them with your screening test in the clinical phase,

545
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:14,870
you're too late and you can't catch them in the blue because they're well at that point.

546
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,760
The purple is the only chance you have to catch them with your screening test.

547
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:22,350
So for a slow progresser person one, you know, if they missed this screening,

548
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:29,580
you got two more two more years to catch up in that preclinical phase before they become critical.

549
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:33,809
You know, you've got two chances here with person two. These medium progress hours.

550
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:39,540
You've got one chance, right? They were clean here.

551
00:55:40,590 --> 00:55:44,100
If they missed the screening, they would be symptomatic by the time they would have their next one.

552
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:51,540
You got kind. A one screening interval where they could be called fast progressed was clean and almost,

553
00:55:51,540 --> 00:55:55,200
almost had a death outcome by the time the next screening in a football ground.

554
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:59,110
This looks impossible. I will tell you, I had a friend my age to have it.

555
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:05,459
She went for a mammogram in November. Clean, negative mammogram.

556
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:12,630
Great. That summer, she started having, like, ringing in her ears and, like, headaches and weird neurologic symptoms.

557
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:20,070
And she went in. She had brain cancer. Breast cancer that it metastasized to her brain between November and June.

558
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,480
And she was in her forties. So it's not common, but it happens.

559
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:31,729
She's doing okay now. She was no evidence of disease for many years, but it actually came back recently.

560
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:35,970
So we're all kind of worried. Okay.

561
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:41,460
So not the norm, which is why we have like screening intervals set up as they are.

562
00:56:41,850 --> 00:56:46,920
But there are cases that will progress so quickly that they skip a screening interval like that.

563
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:51,450
Right. Okay. The issue here.

564
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:57,670
So these are going to be your these fast progresses are definitely going to be symptom detecting cases.

565
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:03,930
Right. Because they're going to not get screened. They're going to progress between that screening interval.

566
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:11,850
Right. From well to set. So the issue here is that your screen detected cases are more likely to be those slower medium

567
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:16,830
professors and the symptoms detected are more likely to be those fast or medium progressed hours.

568
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:21,030
Right. So the prognosis is different in those.

569
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:26,040
Right. Those faster professors are generally more aggressive tumors that have a worse prognosis.

570
00:57:27,450 --> 00:57:33,120
So you're more likely to detect cases with a better prognosis with your screening test.

571
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:36,840
Does that make sense? Which is going to make it look like.

572
00:57:36,850 --> 00:57:42,690
So you're more likely to screen detect cases with a longer rather than a shorter bull, detect shorter detectable preclinical phase.

573
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:46,650
And those cases of a long detectable preclinical phase are likely those that are

574
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:50,100
more slowly progressing and have a better prognosis just sort of inherently.

575
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:58,230
So screening will appear more beneficial than it actually is. If, for example, you can't compare the case fatality rate for the five year survival.

576
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:03,450
The only way to get around this is to evaluate cause specific mortality.

577
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:07,620
You will not experience linked bias if you use cause specific mortality as you're up.

578
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:13,510
Overdiagnosis bias is an extreme form of linked bias.

579
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:22,749
It's the same idea. Except rather than catching real cancers that are less aggressive with your screening test,

580
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:27,370
you're actually capturing the things that didn't need treatment at all that are completely overdiagnosed.

581
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:33,759
This is the issue with, for example, prostate cancer. So we're going to go through this.

582
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:42,100
And I think this might help make it clearer why some of those other measures would produce overdiagnosis or like bias,

583
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:46,750
whereas the case the cause specific mortality rate will not.

584
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:53,950
Okay, so imagine you have on the bottom, you have your unscreened group.

585
00:58:56,100 --> 00:59:01,830
Okay. So you have five people unscreened.

586
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,370
Three of them have preclinical disease.

587
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:11,640
One of them will progress to symptoms and have their diagnosis confirmed.

588
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:16,500
And that patient will die. Four of them will die of something else.

589
00:59:16,770 --> 00:59:23,430
Two of them with that disease that was never detected because they did not progressed to symptoms.

590
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:31,530
Okay. Imagine in some alternate universe, you have these same five people, but they got screened.

591
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:36,990
Now all three of those have a confirmed diagnosis of cancer.

592
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:42,270
Still, only one of them dies. The other four die of something else.

593
00:59:44,940 --> 00:59:48,240
Same outcome in the screening or an on screen group. Right.

594
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:51,450
Screening did not actually result in a benefit.

595
00:59:52,200 --> 01:00:02,990
But if you calculate the case fatality proportion, you end up with 33% in the screened group and 100% in the on screen group.

596
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,360
The case fatality proportion is the percentage of cases that died.

597
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:15,580
So in the unscreened group, you have one case diagnosed, one case died, one divided by one is 100%.

598
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:20,360
All of the cases diagnosed died in the in the screened group.

599
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:23,820
You had three cases diagnosed and one died.

600
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:30,330
All you've done is increase your denominator, but suddenly the case fatality proportion is 33%.

601
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:34,580
One third of the cases diagnosed died. That looks better, right?

602
01:00:35,190 --> 01:00:38,730
But we know we can actually see in this example it's the same.

603
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:49,650
However, if you calculate the cause specific mortality rate, how would you calculate that you've got five people in?

604
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:54,060
Let's do it for the unscreened group. You've got five people.

605
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:57,750
How many died of your cancer in your in your unscreened group?

606
01:01:02,070 --> 01:01:08,910
One. Let's create. One out of five.

607
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:13,200
20%. That's your specific mortality rate.

608
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:18,180
What's your cause? Specific mortality rate in the screened group? How many total people did you screen?

609
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,680
Five. How many people died of the cancer? One.

610
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:37,750
It's the same using the cause specific mortality rate shows you that screening does not have a benefit here.

611
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:41,560
But if you use the case fatality proportion, it looks like it does.

612
01:01:43,190 --> 01:01:47,940
Does that make sense to everybody? Do not get those confused.

613
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:54,450
That is a common mistake. Case fatality proportion is the proportion of people diagnosed with the disease who die.

614
01:01:56,310 --> 01:02:06,300
Because the specific mortality rate where that is the number is the rate of death among everybody who is in that's in that arm screened or unscreened.

615
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:11,760
Yeah. Exactly.

616
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:20,600
SS Okay, so you want to use the cause specific mortality rate, some other things.

617
01:02:20,610 --> 01:02:25,350
So we talked about evaluating whether it works to protect that, but there's other things that must be considered, right?

618
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:29,489
Is it suitable for the target population? Is it feasible?

619
01:02:29,490 --> 01:02:39,060
Is it acceptable to screenings? Right. Can anybody think of one of our screening tests that we have that where this is an issue?

620
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:48,720
Yeah. Yeah. Some people don't want to do it right because they think it's gross or they don't want to do the prep.

621
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:55,980
Sure. And having a more an easier to do test might make it more acceptable to some screening.

622
01:02:56,040 --> 01:03:01,380
How about cervical cancer screening? I told you about self sample.

623
01:03:01,500 --> 01:03:07,720
Right. That is a way to make screening potentially more acceptable to trainees and the screenings.

624
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:18,880
Okay. So training screenings, right? Allowing them to take their own cervical sample so that they don't have to go undergo a pelvic exam.

625
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:24,070
Why make it more acceptable in some cultures more acceptable, perhaps, to trans men in the U.S.?

626
01:03:24,580 --> 01:03:29,680
Right. We talked about that. So you have to think about making the test acceptable.

627
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:35,820
It also has to be cost effective. Right. You can't have something that is so expensive that it's unfeasible to them.

628
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:42,250
Okay. So these aspects of evaluation don't actually indicate whether screenings will benefit from the screening program.

629
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:48,130
This is the argument, this cost effectiveness is the argument against screening people between 40 to 49 for breast cancer.

630
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:56,820
It does benefit women. It's just that the cost effectiveness and the benefits to harms ratio may not be ideal in younger women.

631
01:03:56,890 --> 01:04:04,980
Right. But it does prevent breast cancer. Okay.

632
01:04:04,990 --> 01:04:07,510
You also have to think about the process or operational measures.

633
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:16,420
So the number of people screened, the proportion of your target population that's going to get screened one, two and number of times your yield rate,

634
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:24,160
the detected prevalence, the number or proportion of people who screened positive, the people who are accurately identified by the screening test.

635
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:27,300
You have to think about the proportion of those who screened positive.

636
01:04:27,310 --> 01:04:33,550
We're going to have to go on to have diagnostic workup and treatment if you can't afford that in your health care system.

637
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:41,530
That's an issue, right? Remember that this screening program does not just include the screening test.

638
01:04:41,530 --> 01:04:46,239
It includes all of this. This was a concern when we instituted lung cancer screening.

639
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,469
Do we have the capacity? Remember, we had a lot of false positives on the screen.

640
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:52,210
So we're going to have to go in for a lung biopsy.

641
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:57,910
Did we have the capacity to screen all those people and then get them through all the diagnostic workup?

642
01:05:00,890 --> 01:05:04,160
And then the positive predictive value. So we're going to talk about this.

643
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:10,170
This is where a lot of screening tests for rare cancers fail.

644
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,329
So we talked about sensitivity and specificity. This is that same two by two table.

645
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:17,790
When we were talking about sensitivity and specificity,

646
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:24,299
we were talking about the probability of testing positive given that you have a disease or the probability of testing negative,

647
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:29,770
given that you have the disease. Now, we're talking about given that you tested positive.

648
01:05:29,790 --> 01:05:34,709
What's the probability that you actually have the disease? Right. That's a question that most people want to know.

649
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:38,100
We're kind of going this way on the table now. Right.

650
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:44,490
That's the question that people who get the test result won't know. So I got a positive result was the probability that I actually have cancer.

651
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:51,060
And I will tell you, the negative predictive value is the opposite.

652
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:54,690
You know, I just tested negative. What is the probability that I don't have the disease?

653
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:58,640
Right. The positive.

654
01:05:59,210 --> 01:06:02,840
So sensitivity and specificity are characteristics of the test.

655
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:08,840
No matter what population we use them in, those are going to be the same characteristics of the test.

656
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:16,969
Positive predictive value. A high sensitivity and specificity are not going to guarantee you a high positive predictive value

657
01:06:16,970 --> 01:06:22,090
because it is a function of the prevalence of the disease in the population undergoing screening.

658
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:29,089
This is some math. If you like math, this may help you, but understand that even a very good test with high sensitivity and specificity,

659
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:35,630
if you apply it in a population with a very low prevalence of the disease, the positive predictive value is in the toilet.

660
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:43,700
Right? So even a really good test if you're applying it in a low prevalence setting, you're going to get a lot of false positives.

661
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:55,080
Okay. So this is why even very good screening tests are a hard sell for rare cancers because the positive predictive value is very bad.

662
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:57,640
Because they're rare.

663
01:06:59,500 --> 01:07:07,840
You almost have to have a perfect screening test for ovarian cancer for it to really kind of pass this positive predictive value test, if you will.

664
01:07:08,970 --> 01:07:13,380
Check that box. Okay.

665
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:21,570
Cost effectiveness. You have to think about the total program cost, not just the screening test, but also diagnostic workup and the treatment.

666
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:28,410
There's this idea of cost per case, which is the screening cost plus diagnostic costs for the false positives.

667
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:31,860
Right balance, the screening program costs against the guild.

668
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:36,960
And you also have to consider kind of the non-monetary costs of anxiety and inconvenience.

669
01:07:37,290 --> 01:07:42,540
Right. No one likes to talk about cost with these things.

670
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:45,810
We want to you know, we all want to save people. Right.

671
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:53,909
But these big programs, I mean, you have to think about like even if you use these big screening programs and you save a few people from cancer,

672
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:57,210
you could have spent that money somewhere else and maybe saved more people from something else.

673
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:01,170
Right. So it feels very cold and uncaring.

674
01:08:01,170 --> 01:08:03,899
But this is a very important we all I mean,

675
01:08:03,900 --> 01:08:08,670
we have a lot of health care resources in this country compared to some more developing settings, for example.

676
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:19,430
But they're not infinite. Right. So unfortunately, this is a piece that needs to be considered as much as it feels a little bit icky.

677
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,440
Right. All right.

678
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,400
So you have to weigh the benefits against the harms. You have to individualize the benefit.

679
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,620
The harm ratio may change over a person's life.

680
01:08:32,150 --> 01:08:37,430
You have to revisit screening guidelines regularly as the science advances, which the USPSTF does, as we saw.

681
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:42,830
And we need to educate the public, but also providers about what to expect from cancer screening.

682
01:08:45,020 --> 01:08:48,650
And that is the end of my presentation.

683
01:08:50,450 --> 01:08:54,400
You guys have any questions? It's a lot.

684
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:58,390
This is one that we often have questions about, like on the review session.

685
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:10,920
Or. Plus screening for breast cancer.

686
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,590
So when we actually. So the question is about PSA screening over overdiagnosis.

687
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:30,170
I will tell you that people. I don't think it's necessarily that we shouldn't be doing PSA screening because when we completely stopped.

688
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:37,140
If you look at let's do, let's go to Sear.

689
01:09:39,280 --> 01:09:45,430
Uh. Now.

690
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:53,330
Where do I go to find the. Oh, maybe this series for This is what I.

691
01:09:53,870 --> 01:09:57,400
I feel like they change this website, like, every 5 minutes and I can never find the button I want.

692
01:09:57,410 --> 01:10:03,620
Maybe I'm just old. That's entirely possible. All right, let's go to long term trends.

693
01:10:05,090 --> 01:10:10,670
We want mortality. Here we go.

694
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:19,760
U.S. mortality and we want prostate, right? Okay.

695
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:23,339
So you see how it actually started to kind of like flatten out.

696
01:10:23,340 --> 01:10:27,120
It was coming down, down, down, and it actually started to sort of tick back up here at the end.

697
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:33,000
That was after they got rid of they they made that D recommendation for screening.

698
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:39,630
So there have been there are I think that the RSPCA certainly shows that there's a benefit to it.

699
01:10:39,730 --> 01:10:46,440
I think the trick with prostate cancer screening and how we've learned to use it, we've learned to use it better.

700
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:54,170
Right. So the issue is if you screen a guy and he screens positive, that doesn't necessarily mean he treatment, right?

701
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:59,610
Some prostate cancers are indolent and would not become clinically relevant in that man's lifetime.

702
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:09,930
We have learned and I think clinicians have learned to present these results to patients a little bit differently so that they use,

703
01:11:09,930 --> 01:11:12,930
um, active surveillance, what used to be called watchful waiting,

704
01:11:12,930 --> 01:11:17,160
a lot more so like if you have certain, like if you have a low grade, low stage tumor,

705
01:11:18,030 --> 01:11:22,439
they actually do some genetic testing of the tumor genes from the biopsy specimen.

706
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:28,469
Now to look at how aggressive, if there's markers of aggressiveness, they'll use all of that information to say,

707
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:33,990
okay, you have got low stage, low grade tumor and you don't have these genetic markers of aggressiveness.

708
01:11:34,770 --> 01:11:41,070
We're going to put you on active surveillance, which means that we're just going to check your PSA every few months to see if it's going up.

709
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:46,310
And if it doesn't go up, we're not going to treat you. But if it starts to spike up,

710
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:51,330
that indicates that the tumor is growing and we're going to go ahead and do definitive treatment, which is prostatectomy.

711
01:11:51,330 --> 01:11:55,870
Right. So I think that is the way to make peers.

712
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,729
I think there are ways to make PSA screening more useful.

713
01:11:59,730 --> 01:12:03,690
I think it is useful because if you don't do it at all, you start to get more prostate cancer death.

714
01:12:04,230 --> 01:12:07,880
If you use it kind of indiscriminately, you're over treating men.

715
01:12:07,890 --> 01:12:11,490
So there's like this sweet spot that I think we're honing in on that, if that makes sense.

716
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:16,679
I think it can be used intelligently, but it is not a simple, straightforward test.

717
01:12:16,680 --> 01:12:20,249
Like, Oh, I saw a spot on man exam and we poked it and it has cancer cells.

718
01:12:20,250 --> 01:12:23,430
So you have cancer, right? It's not it's not that simple.

719
01:12:25,020 --> 01:12:30,180
And I think we're learning that. So I don't know that it's as simple as just not doing that and adding it to.

720
01:12:31,500 --> 01:12:37,430
Does that make sense? Yeah. Yes.

721
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:48,980
Based on experiences reading over time, I think there has been some improvement and this is hard.

722
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:56,510
So some screening tests do have important racial disparities in terms of who's getting them, and it's really hard to know.

723
01:12:56,510 --> 01:13:00,230
You know, it really depends on the test and it depends on which groups cause.

724
01:13:01,070 --> 01:13:03,410
Like, for example, I think it was a colonoscopy that I showed.

725
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:06,950
The results were actually black people are having a higher rate slightly than white people.

726
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:12,919
And it's like the Hispanic and Asian groups that are a little bit lower. So it's different for every test, right?

727
01:13:12,920 --> 01:13:18,770
It's not always exactly what you would expect, but there's also these insurance differences, too, right.

728
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:23,090
So you have to think about like, what is it? Why is there a racial disparity? Is it.

729
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:36,950
Socioeconomics. This is like the overlap of the intersection of race with socioeconomic status and insurance that is there for us.

730
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:40,650
Or is it like a cultural thing, right,

731
01:13:40,650 --> 01:13:46,320
where like this culture does not then it's not acceptable to people in this culture to have this particular test done.

732
01:13:46,650 --> 01:13:56,190
It's hard, right? It's very hard. So I don't know how to answer your question as a blanket because it's different for every test.

733
01:13:56,190 --> 01:14:03,540
But I will tell you for sure that there are important studies going on to try to address these individual,

734
01:14:03,930 --> 01:14:10,440
racial and other kinds of disparities for each screening test and try to figure out like, why does this disparity exist for this test?

735
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:14,670
And therefore, what can we do to fix it? Colorectal cancer screening in particular.

736
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,330
But Native American populations have super low rates.

737
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:26,780
Part of it was just the availability of like a screening venue close to the reservation, for example.

738
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:32,690
And so we've been trying to do more there. We didn't talk a lot about it.

739
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:37,579
But, you know, colonoscopy is kind of one of the modalities of colon cancer screening.

740
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:39,620
There is also a people called blood testing,

741
01:14:40,730 --> 01:14:47,150
which is where you do like a little fecal sample and it tests for blood, doesn't tend to catch it as early.

742
01:14:47,150 --> 01:14:52,090
And if you're positive, what's the next step? Colonoscopy.

743
01:14:52,090 --> 01:15:01,479
Exactly right. So a lot of people just skip that. But if you're in a very low resource setting, equity is a pretty good, pretty good start.

744
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:06,670
Right. So there have been efforts to kind of like mail I can mail those kids out to people and have them be able to back.

745
01:15:06,670 --> 01:15:12,340
Right. So you have to figure out it's not an across the board thing.

746
01:15:12,340 --> 01:15:17,260
You have to figure out why disparity exists and then try to address that issue in that group.

747
01:15:17,470 --> 01:15:22,470
Right. So it's tough, but that is definitely an ongoing area of work.

748
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:34,530
The questions. Okay.

749
01:15:35,910 --> 01:15:40,290
I will see you guys. Don't forget to sign in if you didn't. And I will see you guys Thursday.

750
01:15:40,290 --> 01:15:42,090
And we'll have a work day for your projects.
