1
00:00:00,367 --> 00:00:09,917
So in this module talking about what to do when you're feeling overwhelmed, overloaded and having a really difficult time.

2
00:00:09,917 --> 00:00:21,187
Remember, our continuum. And so this is primarily for times where you're really starting to notice significant shifts or extremes in your eating,

3
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:29,887
sleeping, mood, energy level, motivation, and the way that you're connecting with family and friends.

4
00:00:29,887 --> 00:00:35,327
If you're noticing just persistent feelings like worry, sadness,

5
00:00:35,327 --> 00:00:41,247
irritability or even this kind of a persistent, even euphoric state, on top of the world,

6
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:49,057
hard to slow down. You want to pay attention to that. Difficulty concentrating or getting things done.

7
00:00:49,057 --> 00:00:54,177
Really having a hard time with intrusive thoughts.

8
00:00:54,177 --> 00:01:03,887
That's just going really fast or kind of feeling weird or incoherent. If you're having a hard time reeling in guilt and shame.

9
00:01:03,887 --> 00:01:14,677
If you're getting really preoccupied with food or restricting food or really negative body image.

10
00:01:14,677 --> 00:01:24,357
If you're having a lot of difficulty in your relationships, difficulty getting your work done and just kind of managing day-to-day life. Getting out of bed,

11
00:01:24,357 --> 00:01:30,437
showering, all of that. Or if you're just seeing behavior that concerns you.

12
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:38,417
Substance use, gambling, things that don't seem like you or don't seem like they are taking a direction that you want to go.

13
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:45,327
Also, physical symptoms like headaches, body aches, getting sick, lots of upset stomach,

14
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:50,327
lots of tension in your body. These are all things that could be related to physical health,

15
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:55,087
they could also be related to mental health and things, so you want to get more input.

16
00:01:55,087 --> 00:02:01,697
And especially like we talked about before, if you find yourself having thoughts, a lot of thoughts about death, suicide or self-harm.

17
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:07,657
These would all be in this struggling category. And this will be where you want to get more help and

18
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:14,137
support. And when you have that like, aha moment, this is one of those moments.

19
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:20,767
Even if it's just even like I just feel overwhelmed and overloaded and I don't feel like I can really handle this moment very well.

20
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:27,177
This is what we're gonna be talking about and kind of move through.

21
00:02:27,177 --> 00:02:34,687
Now, I don't know if people still have fire drills when they talk about stop, drop and roll, but this is kind of our stop, breathe, and assess.

22
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:40,207
That's what we're going to be doing in these moments. And you want, this is kind of

23
00:02:40,207 --> 00:02:46,327
also where, I don't know if you've ever gone to like a dance class and they teach you a step and they're like, okay, now we're gonna put them all together,

24
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:50,857
that always raises my anxiety. But that's kinda what we're doing with mental health stuff.

25
00:02:50,857 --> 00:02:57,627
So we've talked about how to use some of these different skills now and hopefully,

26
00:02:57,627 --> 00:02:59,817
this is alerting you to practice them,

27
00:02:59,817 --> 00:03:07,587
kind of like you do a fire drill, so that in the moments where you're having the most difficulty, you know how to use them, and you know how to use them together,

28
00:03:07,587 --> 00:03:15,957
so let's talk about what that looks like. Just the stop in and of itself, like sometimes

29
00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:23,367
a lot is going on, and so we just keep going, we think if we just keep moving, it'll get better, and sometimes we notice that's not happening.

30
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:27,537
And so literally, if it's a five minute stop, a 30 minute stop, half of a day off,

31
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:34,757
like just sit down somewhere so that you can take inventory and get common-grounded again.

32
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:44,867
If you're having a hard time stopping and the breathing, this can sometimes happen when we're having a panic attack, which is important to know,

33
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:55,637
it feels scary, but it's actually not physically harming you, your body is kind of going into fight or flight and having a hard time calming it down.

34
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:59,737
That can be a good time just to breathe. Breathe

35
00:03:59,737 --> 00:04:05,197
slow, like we talked about, like you're trying to bring it all the way down to your feet. Then take the time to

36
00:04:05,197 --> 00:04:11,457
just kind of rub your hands or rest your hands on your chest,

37
00:04:11,457 --> 00:04:16,387
and breathe. And it can be a good time to kind of like go back to

38
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:23,537
that tool kit that we have on the body and the breathing exercises, some like using your five senses to kind of ground in the moment,

39
00:04:23,537 --> 00:04:29,247
the glitter ball. You can also Google leaves on a stream, that's a really good meditation.

40
00:04:29,247 --> 00:04:33,687
Kind of watching your thoughts and breathing.

41
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:42,427
So you want to be able to use the tools in the tool box to slow yourself down and stop,

42
00:04:42,427 --> 00:04:49,687
and then you're going to move into assessing. But I will literally tell you, stay in this stop and breathe place for as long as you need to.

43
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:54,577
If we think about that glitter bottle example, you want your glitter bottle to kind of settle,

44
00:04:54,577 --> 00:05:07,017
before you move into assess. You may even want to get a friend or some social support and try to move into assessing the situation and what's next.

45
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:09,387
So what we want to do when we assess often,

46
00:05:09,387 --> 00:05:20,027
we're kind of like deer in headlights zoomed in so up-close on the problem and on the intensity of what we're feeling, that it can be hard to kind of

47
00:05:20,027 --> 00:05:27,027
makes sense of all of what's happening and what's next. So what we want to do, once we're calm enough, is kind of zoom out,

48
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:35,127
helicopter view and check-in and ask ourselves, what's bothering you. You can write this down,

49
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:40,757
you can talk it out with somebody like I'm having a hard time figuring it out.

50
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:45,177
You can just kind of journal, or you can just kind of think. You want to see if you can

51
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:52,157
think, in a sentence or two, what's bothering you, it might need to be kind of like a brain dump, like

52
00:05:52,157 --> 00:06:00,347
here's all the things. That's fine too. You just you want to kind of identify what it is. Do you need more information or another perspective?

53
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:03,227
So sometimes, like, I think I'm about to fail this class,

54
00:06:03,227 --> 00:06:13,217
I think that I might be about to miss a deadline and you or I think that I'm just way further behind than everybody else,

55
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:23,677
I don't know enough. So sometimes we need to get some more information from instructors, mentors, whoever the organization is.

56
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:32,077
Or sometimes we need a friend to just give us a different perspective than the one that we have right now. What information are my feelings, my body,

57
00:06:32,077 --> 00:06:38,907
my intuition? So your body may be telling you you desperately need sleep,

58
00:06:38,907 --> 00:06:43,167
even though you have a deadline. You're not going to be in a decent emotional place.

59
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:48,157
You may actually send yourself into a crisis trying to push through.

60
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:55,567
Your feelings may be telling you that you're being mistreated and you need to get help to figure out how to address it.

61
00:06:55,567 --> 00:07:02,257
You want to just notice what feelings are coming up, what sensations are coming up,

62
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:11,107
and gather the information that's there. And then the last one in this section, is what's important to me

63
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:12,907
that I need to attend to?

64
00:07:12,907 --> 00:07:22,037
So as we move into the other sections, you're going to have to kind of figure out what's most important to you in this moment, because you can't do all the things.

65
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:28,867
And so if it's, you know, maybe an email needs to be sent to ask for

66
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:35,597
an extension, or maybe you just need to stay at a friend's house to get some support,

67
00:07:35,597 --> 00:07:45,967
to breathe or calm down, but we want to identify what's most important. Then we want to do self-care.

68
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:51,497
And again, we have talked about this before, but now we're talking about how to do it in these really difficult moments.

69
00:07:51,497 --> 00:07:59,567
Maybe you already filled out, hopefully this little tart or had some ideas about this, out it on a three by five card or somewhere in your phone.

70
00:07:59,567 --> 00:08:07,517
What do you need in that moment? And what could help you move through or improve the moment just a little?

71
00:08:07,517 --> 00:08:08,917
So if you've thought about these things in advance,

72
00:08:08,917 --> 00:08:14,217
it kind of helps, because it kind of gives you in a moment where I don't know if you're, I don't know if you like me, when you're most is hungry,

73
00:08:14,217 --> 00:08:20,367
it's the hardest to think of what you want to eat. When you're most stressed sometimes it's the hardest to figure out what to do next.

74
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:27,327
So having some thoughts about a few things that help calm me down a little bit, a few things that help improve your mood a little bit,

75
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:32,057
and a few people that you can reach out to when you're having a difficult time.

76
00:08:32,057 --> 00:08:35,967
And so then you'll just kind of choose from these things,

77
00:08:35,967 --> 00:08:41,847
a few things to do to kind of help in the moment. We'll also give you some resources,

78
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:49,067
the list, there's two lists, and there's some overlap on them, of a hundred things that you can do to get through a difficult moment. And so you

79
00:08:49,067 --> 00:09:00,607
can kind of go over and highlight what's the favorite ones, or some ones to try. Here's where we're going to pull in self-coaching.

80
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:06,997
You're going to say, okay, if this was my friend or my younger sibling, what would I say to them?

81
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:09,957
How would I support them through it?

82
00:09:09,957 --> 00:09:18,007
Because we're often going to be much more warm, much we're understanding, much more helpful to them, then we are to ourselves.

83
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,587
What do I need to keep afloat right now?

84
00:09:20,587 --> 00:09:26,677
Sometimes, for example, we may have lost a family member, or have a really difficult situation going on in our family.

85
00:09:26,677 --> 00:09:33,127
But there are certain things that we need to kind of keep going, because we might be going through a difficult time for an extended period.

86
00:09:33,127 --> 00:09:39,367
What's what are the essentials that I need to get done? Who do I need to let know?

87
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:46,717
How do I move through this situation that maintains myself safety, well-being and my dignity and the dignity of others?

88
00:09:46,717 --> 00:09:53,497
Sometimes things will have happened within your academics that upset you or even within your relationships that upset you,

89
00:09:53,497 --> 00:09:59,717
and it can be tempting at times to do things are drastic, say things that are drastic.

90
00:09:59,717 --> 00:10:05,507
And this is just a question, that reminder, that check-in to say like,

91
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:11,147
let me not spend money that I'm going to need later. Let me not do unsafe things that I'm going to regret later,

92
00:10:11,147 --> 00:10:15,107
let me not do things that harm myself or say things that harm other people in this moment,

93
00:10:15,107 --> 00:10:21,827
because two weeks from now, two months from now, I'm going to not want to have made the situation worse

94
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:27,557
than it has. So this can be a good thing to check-in and think about.

95
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:31,757
What small step or steps can I take towards what's important to me,

96
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:37,017
even if it's difficult or uncomfortable? So sometimes letting people know that you're going through

97
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:41,267
a hard time is uncomfortable, but it is maybe the most important.

98
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:47,537
Sometimes it is important to say, like, okay, I'm gonna finish this assignment and then I'm gonna take a break.

99
00:10:47,537 --> 00:10:53,357
So just kind of sometimes we need help figuring this out, but this is an important thing to ask, also.

100
00:10:53,357 --> 00:10:59,807
And then kind of like our permission slip, so we've talked about what do I need to let go of until later? I can't do all of the things.

101
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:07,277
So maybe the dishes or the laundry or, you know, any number of things you want to identify.

102
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:15,727
What can you take off your plate during the time that you're having a difficult time? Think of it a little bit like when you get sick,

103
00:11:15,727 --> 00:11:19,937
I mean, some of us push through, even then. But when we get sick enough, we kind of know, like, okay,

104
00:11:19,937 --> 00:11:25,507
I need soup, I need juice, I need rest. I might send an email to let people know that I'm sick,

105
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:35,407
I might need to take care of the one last little task. But it's kind of coming up with a game plan to get yourself through this time, that emotionally, is not the best.

106
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:40,327
And then lastly, this can be a time where if you have an already connected with a therapist,

107
00:11:40,327 --> 00:11:45,937
having a therapist to kind of sort things through can be helpful.

108
00:11:45,937 --> 00:11:49,327
In the supplemental materials, we'll have a link in there that helps you know

109
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:54,307
how to find a culturally competent therapist, somebody that you feel like is a good fit for you.

110
00:11:54,307 --> 00:12:01,777
And some of the different directories where you can find therapists in different areas or have different identities.

111
00:12:01,777 --> 00:12:09,037
This is also a time to really utilize your social support. And so you want to, when we try to go through things alone,

112
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:13,957
we typically feel more shame, we feel more alienated, it doesn't help us in the moment.

113
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:18,827
And we're in a culture that isn't great at asking for help, and it can be hard to know how.

114
00:12:18,827 --> 00:12:29,067
We've also going to give you a link and the supplemental materials that gives you an array of different ways of asking for help.

115
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:35,327
Can I just hang out with you right now, I need a distraction, let's go do something fun.

116
00:12:35,327 --> 00:12:41,177
There's a variety of different ways, so you can kind of find your own language, what would feel most comfortable for you?

117
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:45,607
And again, practice it, so that when it's hard, you'll use the words.

118
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:53,107
And the last one is just having these crisis numbers. And in the supplemental materials, there will be

119
00:12:53,107 --> 00:13:01,627
bigger lists for specific entities, specific situations. But these are probably the two most important to have,

120
00:13:01,627 --> 00:13:06,067
the crisis text line that you can use and also the national suicide hotline.

121
00:13:06,067 --> 00:13:12,777
Just knowing that having suicidal thoughts is not uncommon

122
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:16,137
talking about it is hard, but talking about it,

123
00:13:16,137 --> 00:13:20,527
makes a world of difference. So if it's happening,

124
00:13:20,527 --> 00:13:35,317
you want to be able to utilize these resources, therapists, social support lines in order to get the help and support to get through those moments.
