1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Injury part two, motor vehicle injuries.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The first segment of this lecture, we defined intentional and unintentional injuries and looked at the major causes of such injuries.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:35,000
In this segment, we'll focus on motor vehicles as a major cause of unintentional injuries.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:45,000
As noted in the first segment of this lecture, motor vehicle deaths were the leading category of unintentional injury deaths in the United States.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
For many decades until being overtaken by poisonings in 2009, as can be seen in the graph,

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:01,000
the rate of motor vehicle deaths has declined almost five fold since 1966.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This reduction is a huge success. Many lives have been saved as a result.

8
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
But there were still over thirty seven thousand motor vehicle deaths in 2015.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Motor vehicle crashes are also the leading cause of death among children and young adults.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
So there was. So there is still much work to be done.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Many factors have contributed to the successful reduction of motor vehicle deaths, both before and after 1966.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But 1966 was a pivotal year.

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It was in 1966 that Ralph Nader published his famous book, Unsafe at Any Speed, designed in dangers of American Automobiles.

14
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The uproar and controversy generated by his book ultimately prompted the U.S.

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Congress to pass the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This law did a number of things. It created the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA,

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:16,000
which was empowered to set safety standards for cars such as requirements for seatbelts and energy absorbing steering columns.

18
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Nizza was also required to collect data and to conduct research such as crash

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
tests to better understand safety problems in cars and to develop interventions.

20
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The history of motor vehicle safety is a good example of how government intervention in this case the

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:47,000
creation and empowerment of Nizza has helped to focus and sustain attention on a major public health issue.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I think it is worth examining more closely the data that underlie the graph on the preceding slide.

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The population in the US in 1966 was one hundred and ninety seven million.

24
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The population of the US in 2016 was three hundred and twenty three million.

25
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Over 60 percent increase. Yet the number of motor vehicle deaths declined by 26 percent.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,000
When expressed as a fatality rate per 100000 population, the decline is even greater.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Fifty five percent versus 26 percent.

28
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Finally, if expressed as the number of deaths per hundred million vehicle miles driven, the fatality rate has declined by almost 80 percent.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,000
A remarkable public health achievement. This is despite the fact that the number of vehicles per capita has increased 88 percent.

30
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,000
In addition, the average number of miles driven annually per vehicle has increased by over 100 percent.

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If the fatality rate per hundred million vehicle miles were the same in 2016 as it had been in 1966,

32
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:17,000
the number of motor vehicle deaths in 2016 would have been one hundred and seventy five thousand versus thirty seven thousand overall.

33
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
In order to properly understand problems and public health, we need to be careful about the data.

34
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Each public health challenge can have its own set of risk factors that need to be taken into account.

35
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Driver error is the overwhelming factor in the cause of motor vehicle crashes.

36
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
As we will see, there are many types and causes of driver error.

37
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But even though vehicles are an infrequent cause of crashes,

38
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:56,000
there is a lot that can and has been done to make cars safer and more survivable in the event of a crash.

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Overall, there are many approaches to enhancing motor vehicle safety.

40
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Alcohol is a leading cause of driver impairment and therefore a major cause of vehicle crashes and fatalities, elevated blood alcohol is still common.

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But over the last 60 to 70 years, there have been numerous efforts to reduce drinking and driving.

42
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It is also important to keep in mind that we know more about the impact of alcohol on motor vehicle

43
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:37,000
fatalities because we routinely test drivers and vehicle occupants for alcohol after a crash.

44
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:45,000
But there are many other drugs that can contribute to driver impairment, such as opioids or even over-the-counter drugs.

45
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:56,000
As an example, after alcohol, one of the most common drugs that contributes to impaired driving is Benadryl or diphenhydramine,

46
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:03,000
a common sedating antihistamine drug that is very inexpensive and available over the counter.

47
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Another important category of behavioral risk factors is driver distraction, which can take many forms,

48
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:18,000
while in many jurisdictions there are laws governing how or whether it is permissible to use a cell phone while driving.

49
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There are many other common activities that can cause distraction of drivers but that are not addressed by such laws.

50
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Just being sleepy is also a significant issue. It is also also worth commenting on driver age.

51
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Young drivers have some advantages since they are generally healthier and have faster reaction times.

52
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
However, they usually lack experience, particularly new drivers and driver experience is very important.

53
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Young drivers are also more likely to drive in a riskier manner.

54
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Overall, young and new drivers between the ages of 16 and 24 have much higher accident and fatality rates than drivers of other ages.

55
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,000
There are many programs that have been shown to be effective in reducing the driving risks of new and young drivers,

56
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:23,000
such as restrictions when newer young drivers are allowed to drive by time of day, for example, and requirements for taking driver education classes.

57
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Fatality rates also start to increase with advanced age, particularly over the age of 75.

58
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Such older drivers usually have considerable experience, which is an important advantage.

59
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But age related physical impairments sometimes begin to have an impact,

60
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:52,000
such as slower reaction time, poor vision, reduced hearing, use of medications and or dementia.

61
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,000
There have been many recommendations about assessing older drivers fitness to drive, but overall,

62
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:11,000
the risk of crashes and fatal injuries among young new drivers is far greater than the risk among older drivers.

63
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Over the last 40 years or so, the proportion of traffic deaths related to drunk driving has gone down substantially.

64
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
This is a success. But as can be seen from the graph.

65
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
More progress is needed. Also, as already mentioned, there are many other drugs, including prescription drugs,

66
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:40,000
over-the-counter drugs and illegal drugs that can also impair driving and cause fatal crashes.

67
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The success in prevention of motor vehicle crashes and or reduction of fatalities has been multifactorial.

68
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Cars being built today have numerous engineered features that make them much safer and more survivable in a crash.

69
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
A well-known example is seatbelts. But even the seatbelts today are vastly improved,

70
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:11,000
such as automatic retraction or tightening with a crash over the original seat belt from 50 years ago.

71
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Other safety engineering features include headrests shatter resistant glass padded dashboards and energy absorbing steering columns.

72
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,000
All of these are excellent examples of secondary prevention.

73
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:34,000
That is, they reduce the risk of injury or death in the event of a crash, even if they do not prevent the crash itself from happening.

74
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
There have also been engineering features of cars that fall into the category of primary prevention.

75
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Examples include anti-lock brakes and electronic stability control features designed to

76
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,000
give drivers better control of their vehicle and to thereby avoid crashes altogether.

77
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
There have been many other policies, practices and laws that have contributed to the reduction in motor vehicle deaths.

78
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Highways are built better so as to reduce the risk of crashes. Many policies and laws are in place to enhance safety, for example,

79
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:18,000
is one thing to require automakers to put seatbelts in cars, but it is another to actually get people to use them.

80
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
The federal government has used has used the power of the purse,

81
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,000
specifically the threat of withdrawing federal highway construction funds from states to

82
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,000
induce states to pass their own laws requiring drivers and passengers to wear seat belts.

83
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:46,000
As a result, seatbelt use in the US has gone from just 11 percent in 1981 to over 90 percent today.

84
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
We've already discussed the impact of policies to reduce drunk driving. But in this context,

85
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,000
it is worth noting that the original study that documented and quantified the adverse

86
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,000
impact of alcohol on motor vehicle crashes and fatalities was conducted in Grand Rapids,

87
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Michigan, in the late 1950s.

88
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So far, we've been talking about motor vehicle fatalities involving all types of vehicles, including cars, trucks, busses and motorcycles.

89
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But I want to point out something about motorcycles that makes them a particularly dangerous and extreme outlier in this context.

90
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You may recall from the second slide in this segment of the lecture that the overall

91
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,000
motor vehicle fatality rate has declined significantly over the last 50 years.

92
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
As can be seen here, the fatality rate for motorcycles has also declined in recent decades.

93
00:11:49,000 --> 00:12:01,000
However, in 2016, the overall fatality rate for passenger cars in the United States was just under one death per 100 million vehicle miles.

94
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:09,000
While the fatality rate for motorcycles in 2016 was over twenty five deaths per hundred million vehicle miles.

95
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:20,000
In other words, for each mile, driven motorcycle riders are more than twenty five times more likely to die than occupants of passenger cars.

96
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Even wearing a helmet while riding a motorcycle is far more dangerous compared to riding in a car.

97
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:40,000
The reduction in motor vehicle injuries and deaths over the last 50 years has been a major public health success story.

98
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
There is no one thing that led to this outcome.

99
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Rather, it has been the result of multiple sustained efforts on many levels,

100
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:57,000
including improved engineering of cars and highways, education and training of drivers and a variety of government policies.

101
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:04,000
However, it should not be forgotten that there were still more than 37000 motor vehicle deaths in 2016.

102
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Motor vehicle deaths are still a major cause of unintentional injuries in the United States,

103
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and there is more work to be done to further reduce the numbers.

104
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:28,033
In the next segment of this lecture, we will focus on another category of unintentional injury, deaths, poisonings.
