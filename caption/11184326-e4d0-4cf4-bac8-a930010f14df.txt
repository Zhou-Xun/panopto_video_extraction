1
00:00:05,787 --> 00:00:10,415
In this letter from
the American Public Health Association to

2
00:00:10,415 --> 00:00:15,488
the EPA administrator, the goal is
to try to communicate a series of

3
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:21,860
recommendations for managing toxic
substances and risk management steps.

4
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:26,010
And what's interesting about this letter
is that instead of taking an ABT kind of

5
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:32,170
an approach, what it does is it uses
the inverted triangle structure to try and

6
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,260
clearly identify each of
the recommendations that

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,510
they're advocating for, and to provide
a little bit of evidence for each one.

8
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:44,400
And you can see that structure in the way
that they laid out in the letter but

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,060
also the way they use selective
bolding in the letter to highlight

10
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,200
the core central messages
that they want to get across.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,130
So if we look at this letter, you see so
you've got this introductory paragraph

12
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:59,830
up here, you know I appreciate
the opportunity to comment on this, etc.

13
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:01,370
And then it sets up the problem, right?

14
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:06,930
APHA has called for restructuring and
we urge the EPA to seize this opportunity

15
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,080
to strengthen risk evaluations conducted
by the agency and risk management steps.

16
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,470
And so they've got recommendations
listed below and we want the EPA,

17
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,040
or at least they want the EPA to be
considering each of these recommendations.

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,820
Now this paragraph here is
a little bit more background.

19
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,910
I'm gonna sort of skip over it.

20
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:31,440
But I wanna focus your attention on
each of sort of core body paragraphs.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,490
And what you see here is that each one
of them is an inverted triangle where

22
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,130
the main central message is not only
the first sentence in the paragraph but

23
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:42,300
it's been bolded.

24
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:45,060
So in this paragraph we see up here.

25
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,690
The EPA should **** aggregate
exposures within and

26
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,650
across all populations
resulting from all current and

27
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:56,185
legacy uses of chemical substance
to avoid underestimating risk.

28
00:01:56,185 --> 00:02:01,180
And all of the rest of the paragraph
is about supporting this idea.

29
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:05,660
So you've got an example
here with asbestos.

30
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,697
You've got another example here in
terms of workers being exposed, etc.

31
00:02:10,697 --> 00:02:15,208
These are all supporting facts backing
up the core idea of why aggregate

32
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:19,646
exposures should be assessed related
from both currently current and

33
00:02:19,646 --> 00:02:23,150
legacy uses of a chemical substance.

34
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,120
In the next paragraph, same structure.

35
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,750
Right, so here's our main point.

36
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,860
The EPA should conduct hazard
identification by following

37
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:37,320
systematic review processes that integrate
animal, human and mechanistic evidence.

38
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:41,960
And again the basic idea
here is to provide support.

39
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,590
So what do we have here?

40
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,020
We have the National Academy of Science
recommendation that backs this up.

41
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,800
Same thing in the next one.

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,310
EPA should follow recommendations from
the National Academy of Scientists

43
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,820
to identify vulnerable sub-populations,

44
00:02:55,820 --> 00:03:00,550
based upon established risk factors that
increase susceptibility or exposure.

45
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,340
What do we need from that?

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,750
Well, maybe the ideas of
the vulnerable sub-populations.

47
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:12,011
Okay, what we've got, children,
we've got pregnant women, etc.

48
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:15,024
Again, providing
the background information,

49
00:03:15,024 --> 00:03:17,469
the supporting facts for the core idea.

50
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:20,528
But again, each of these paragraphs
is following this inverted triangle

51
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,230
structure.

52
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:24,600
Couple more, same thing happening.

53
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,490
Here we go, in bold.

54
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:32,020
EPA should use health protective defaults
if the agency lacks information, etc.

55
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,370
So what do we have?

56
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:39,777
Another for example, EPA routinely applies
safety or uncertainty factors of 10, etc.

57
00:03:39,777 --> 00:03:45,080
The idea here is to go within
current EPA practice to again,

58
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,067
provide the supporting idea
behind the recommendation

59
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:53,110
that they are putting forth.

60
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,485
>> Last one down here,
EPA should require that claims of

61
00:03:56,485 --> 00:04:01,285
confidential business information be
fully substantiated by industry and

62
00:04:01,285 --> 00:04:05,037
not used to conceal critical
information from the public.

63
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,990
And again, same idea,
why do we need to do this?

64
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,900
We need the background.

65
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,800
Well, let's see.

66
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,440
If a risk evaluation relies upon
information withheld from the public,

67
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,710
you're gonna have a problem, and

68
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,100
that's the supporting
evidence behind all of this.

69
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,580
Notice that they wrap up by simply saying,
look,

70
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:25,160
the recommendations outlined
above will help ensure

71
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,400
that the agency conducts risk
evaluations that fulfill this mandate.

72
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,070
Right, this is why should you
pay attention to this close.

73
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,290
But the core idea here
has already been stated.

74
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,130
So this whole letter is basically
an inverted triangle structure

75
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:44,100
with each sub paragraph also
following that inverted triangle.
