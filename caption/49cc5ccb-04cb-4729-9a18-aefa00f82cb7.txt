1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,520
I think we want to say something.

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:09,630
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:22,920
Okay. So. This is not really how I know Jamal's.

4
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:30,450
Yeah. This reminds me of a.

5
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,960
I have an office with you last year. I think you should be due for Christmas or something.

6
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:45,110
I'm sorry. This is all your fault. But his favorite story going?

7
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:49,810
It was the Friday before summer break and I went to professional development and there were like five.

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:55,100
I think I want you to enjoy this idea so much. Yeah, that's right.

9
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,760
Yeah, it was like. You mean Abby interviewed me.

10
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:08,500
I saw your page on a story.

11
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,830
I believed in you. I knew you were going somewhere. I knew it had to be Friday.

12
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:17,360
How did you get involved? Took me to the Cosmo. You're being held?

13
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:27,190
Oh 620. Oh, that's crazy.

14
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:42,430
That's for everybody. Look, I don't think everybody knows when people are in our conversation about, you know,

15
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:58,299
blue is where we call the state of Medicare claims and how many employees they need to use.

16
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:11,650
We need to hide it because we have experience and we need to release work for a year.

17
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:18,709
And then they become experience admissions and we have certain constraints

18
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,170
and we need to meet the number of claims and there are these invading claims.

19
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:34,510
So the objective function was to minimize the total number of trained we hired.

20
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:55,080
We have a certain of these is doing what we have asked you that we know why either believe that I was convinced.

21
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:12,040
Okay maybe in the there's an employee's training for a year or four months and then

22
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,730
they need to be a level and experience in the year and then they might be compensated.

23
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:28,130
So I'm not going to call only for individual thing, but also we have this is all in once.

24
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:35,510
This was data. And these is a number of events that are needed.

25
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:46,040
I have its meetings and plays and previews to handle these claims and people's claims.

26
00:03:46,040 --> 00:04:00,760
Right. You know the we start in seven the experience and implement and guides data to the.

27
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,710
This is going on. What else do we have here?

28
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:14,560
The beginning is in theory and easy heart.

29
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:20,460
I think that was the one and is or.

30
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:36,660
And so those two work even was. That's that's the data that we from.

31
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:42,240
And what we need to do is put some constraints and minimize.

32
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:49,300
We need all the computation to figure out the number of amendments that we have.

33
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:57,460
So we we we have the amendments that we use and the means available and, you know,

34
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,390
the means available because we multiply the number of people times they mean exactly.

35
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,690
Kind of word from home. And then we've got use these numbers.

36
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:18,720
Right. And they are so beautiful as just as many as we can.

37
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:27,330
And we are going to first solve these as a linear program, making sure that these numbers,

38
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:36,510
then in a little beginning experience so they know of three means higher they have to be in the years and

39
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:49,590
the then the number of the number of experience right they need to be able to do because those are people.

40
00:05:49,890 --> 00:06:00,390
But if we do that that will impose a lot of constraints in these is the problem.

41
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:08,040
And because those are not decision variables, it's going to be more difficult to do so.

42
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,820
But, you know, it can't be solved as the problem, but it's going to be more difficult.

43
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,889
So what I'm going to do is is need to leave that floating, right?

44
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:30,060
So right now we have formatted those as a not to show decimals, but that doesn't mean that there are no decimals there.

45
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:37,560
We are showing no decimal system. This might increase the number of decimals that I can show here.

46
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,009
Like one more decimal. You see that we have 30, 73.7, 77.2.

47
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:59,370
So I was just, you know, rounding with format. Okay, so let's solve this first with in fractions of beginning at fractions of of experience works.

48
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:13,280
All right now the so let's let's let's look at this and.

49
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:33,070
So it is cold sober. Before I continue, any questions about this, this goes forward.

50
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:50,940
And if you remember last time we with you part of these we minimized and I actually can do this again so it's clear.

51
00:07:51,390 --> 00:08:01,560
So I'm going to reset everything and then let's start again and put the constraints.

52
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:09,450
So I want to minimize the total number of trainees hired, right?

53
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:17,670
By changing the decision variables. And the decision variables are the number of trainees higher.

54
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,150
Homa And these block here,

55
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:31,830
which is how many claims are going to be easy and the part are going to be processed by employee

56
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:41,459
and trainees and experienced employees which are goes here and know they should be integer too.

57
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,520
But we are not going to know right now.

58
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,840
We are not going to be you're going to solve that problem.

59
00:08:49,890 --> 00:09:03,810
And then I am going to subject everything to the on screen and I'm going to do first case training is going to be among the trainees hired.

60
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:12,400
They have to be less than equal than ten in each moment.

61
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:27,720
Right. So I'm going to at least now you also know that the methods used by experienced and trainees.

62
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:37,480
It has to be based on equal than the means available.

63
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,570
Experience and memory. So depending on the number. Right.

64
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,690
And then to add to that, that's my second set of constraints.

65
00:09:49,890 --> 00:10:02,550
Then I want to know, of course, I need the inventory, the ending inventory to here from 2 to 7.

66
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:14,700
They have to be less than or equal each one of the early middle and high end to be less than or equal to all the opportunities.

67
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:22,080
50,000. Right. So those numbers have to be less than or equal to 50,000 B the actual ending inventory.

68
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:27,990
I also know that the final inventory.

69
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,090
Has to be equal to zero. We're able to see.

70
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:43,240
Okay. So that's what we had before.

71
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,650
We are missing a string and we are going to find out what we're missing pretty soon.

72
00:10:50,680 --> 00:11:02,799
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to solve everything without putting any integer constraints first as a linear program.

73
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:16,570
So we're going to do all approximations. Then I went to solve these as a linear, simple simplex LP and no negativity constraints.

74
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:26,229
That means that employees that I hired and the number of assignments, the number of claims, they cannot be negative.

75
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:29,350
So I'm going to solve that and see what happened.

76
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:44,700
So I have this a and I have let's see, is this that I need to hire ten hands for 91 and then zero.

77
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:51,700
This is pretty much zero. I'm -8.8 times 1016 and 000.

78
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:58,419
So it's used. So let's see what happens.

79
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:04,990
So and it says, okay, we need to hire 25 employees and 25 new friends.

80
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,799
What would happen here is that these numbers, you see, they're negative eight.

81
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,700
So we end up having negative ending inventory, right?

82
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:26,800
So this is why we have negative ending inventory, weapons training that we need in order to do that well.

83
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:35,790
And the easy constraint to see is, well, the ending inventory has to be greater than or equal to 091.

84
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,470
What we didn't we take into account.

85
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:55,870
So what happens here is that we might be assigning your claims to experience and work or that we have here than what we have in in claims to process.

86
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:58,240
So that's what happened, right?

87
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:09,280
So we would even put a constraint that we can not assign to employees more than the number of claims that we have available.

88
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,770
You know, we put the constraint in the number of members, but, you know, not in anything else.

89
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:21,849
So what we what we need to do is make sure that the ending inventory is the and

90
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:29,440
ha they have to be the ending inventory that we make sure that that happened,

91
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,450
that indeed an inventory has to be greater than or equal to zero and that we satisfy that.

92
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:42,219
Okay. So for you, if you have the total number of claims,

93
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:49,590
the process must be the same thing less than or equal to the sum of the number

94
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:58,190
of or the sum of the number of easy and hard claims that I assign for this.

95
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,250
So let's add that constraint.

96
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:14,260
So I'm going to look at this whole word game and the only constraint that I have side that they.

97
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:22,430
Ending inventory has to be greater than or equal to zero.

98
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:31,420
So because those are not decision variables, those are not unconstrained variables.

99
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:38,110
Then silver lining, you know. You know, and the non negativity constrain doesn't apply.

100
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,060
Right. I think I'm going to say.

101
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:47,520
Okay, and we do so is.

102
00:14:50,390 --> 00:15:09,860
And now I have to be with the 8.88 that we can follow 2.9 And what he says here is that not being able to march but if I.

103
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,320
Would Dad let me format that?

104
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,440
Maybe one day I could have elected it.

105
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:41,540
Maybe one decimal. So we have zeros and we have a lot of fractions here and here.

106
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:53,660
What it means is that we are two and and five zero and 1.7 or just two and then 010.

107
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,560
Let me let's make this a little bit more strict.

108
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,830
And we are going to put the string that these numbers must be zero.

109
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:09,950
Now, one must be in the right. And that would complicate a little bit the problem,

110
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:17,120
because it cannot be solved by the simplest algorithm, but something is going to use the same thing.

111
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:21,469
So it's still a linear problem, but it's not continuous.

112
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:31,340
So you now have to say length for those number integers that may not be at the core of both the feasible re-opening side, the feasible rate.

113
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:39,170
But, you know, is there sufficiently close to the borders that we kind of start from the borders and coming down?

114
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,220
So I'm going to add the constraint that.

115
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:56,840
Oh. I'm going to add the constraint that the number of.

116
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,170
New employees hired. Must be integer.

117
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:15,110
So a lot easier is, I think.

118
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:25,490
So I'm going to say. Okay. And again, this is this is this we are going to say linear problem.

119
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:31,010
So we are going to solve that using the Sardinia problem.

120
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:34,110
It is not exactly the same places when I'm using,

121
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:39,390
but it's going to have to solve a lot of linear programing with this implement and is going to be copying,

122
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:49,220
you know, the feasible region to the region. You got things and that integer no.

123
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:52,980
So it's not really, you know,

124
00:17:52,980 --> 00:18:03,450
the theory is not important now is just to put the constraints and and you know that is going to make the program run you

125
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:11,250
know longer into your programing right now is going to be solved very quickly because there are just a few variable.

126
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:16,920
But when you do that, at least a hundred of variables that have to be done takes a lot of time.

127
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,919
So I am going to solve that. Now.

128
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:30,570
I know we have in three needs higher 110 and 71000.

129
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:34,320
And it says here that we have 29.

130
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:43,050
So these number of claims, because they are so large, we cannot approximate that.

131
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:50,370
So lets me put that format in the better.

132
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:09,049
Just want this, you know. And so if you see 1,371.48, it doesn't matter that you put 1371.

133
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:22,610
Right. It's not going to be you affecting the program so much with the numbers or large fractions of of claims done, you know,

134
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:29,840
you can round up it doesn't matter that much what would matter if you have these fractions here

135
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:37,510
a little bit mundane and you don't know when to have either zero or one employee the first year

136
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:48,260
of if you don't know if you hired a if suppose this is 9.5 or 9.6 is really better to hire and

137
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:55,940
or is it better to hire nine think those fractions with a small number make a lot of difference.

138
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:04,490
All right. So I think this is you know, this is good enough as a solution.

139
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:15,260
I'm really not good at we. And if you want to put constraints here, you're going to pretty much get the same thing, but it's going to be close.

140
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:26,330
Right. So the the idea is that we are going to hire the total number of trainees hired are going to be 29.

141
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,710
Right. And then how is that going to be distributed?

142
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,700
Well, we're going to be distributed in the following week.

143
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:49,700
So we get one employee hire in the first month, then ten and got ten in the second and third month, then seven and the fourth month in one.

144
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:57,920
And we hire in the fifth month and then 0000.

145
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,360
Right. You don't hire any any new employees. Come on.

146
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:10,879
And six, seven and eight one. And this is the assignment of each month to the employees.

147
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:19,910
So this is the number this is the number of easy claims that are going to be solved by experience.

148
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:27,230
So this is the number of easy claims that are going to be. So they're going to be processed by by like three knees.

149
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:38,299
And then that is going to, you know, this is going to use all the available minutes that those employees,

150
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:48,020
the experienced employees and the and the and and three out and for example,

151
00:21:48,020 --> 00:22:02,060
the hard claims are going to be handled from all the experience that Israelis are going to be handling any of the are in for the first month or so.

152
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:10,940
So that is a good solution and you can actually implement that with no problem.

153
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:30,310
There is another you have to see here that we are working on fractions of experience or fractions of experience work which is not we

154
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:38,180
are using in the computations which is not real and those are sufficient to the small numbers to make a little bit of a difference.

155
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:46,159
So we can specify the or we can ask that these numbers be inaccurate.

156
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:57,740
And the suggestion is that we format actually we put a formula that truncates the pink the decimal out

157
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:07,120
of those numbers is no doubt formatted so we can see how one is actually just to make the number in.

158
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:24,530
Right. And so we are going to do and use the wrong information in Excel before we do is equal to.

159
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:38,940
Brown. Round and then open parentheses.

160
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:48,420
And then we get the expression and whatever the expression is, we are going to take all the symbols out.

161
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,460
So it's going to be over zero. That means take this marks out.

162
00:23:53,670 --> 00:24:06,090
So when when we get the computation, when we get the number, there is not going to be like 72.5 even and we're going to see 73.

163
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:15,350
It is what's going to happen. It's going to be a real in the 72 or 73 because we made that so okay.

164
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:21,660
So I can look that way and I'm going to copy.

165
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,220
All right. So all these numbers are.

166
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:38,590
Now air. So if you see the total number of trainees within the total number of trainees hiring didn't change.

167
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,490
Right. Let's see if we have all the constraints satisfied.

168
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:51,020
Maybe. Yes, maybe now. 300.

169
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,800
It is very likely that we still have.

170
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,020
But let's let's solve this again to make sure that we have all the constraints on this time.

171
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:13,070
But this time we cannot use the simplex linear program because when we put the round function, the problem became nonlinear.

172
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:21,809
And what we're going to do is ask solver to use are another the algorithm.

173
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:29,280
So something that we can use in and nonlinear problems in order to to find the solution.

174
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:35,010
So if I go here and I'm going into indeed solver.

175
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:44,310
Then I'm going to I cannot do this using symbols of P.

176
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:52,050
I could try and let me see solved. And you said they needed the conditions required for the LP.

177
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:58,470
Silverado's on his side to say I knew that. So I'm going to say, okay, so let's cancel this.

178
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:09,870
So let's go ahead and say silver and then I'm going to change that to g, r, g, nonlinear.

179
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:18,630
So this is a, you know, general nonlinear optimization that's when you remember that we're minimizing the MSE

180
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:23,099
goes somewhere nonlinear problems that when you lose then you're indeed nonlinear

181
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:29,610
to minimize the losses that that is that is the same thing is that inefficient

182
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:37,900
though but that's the way we need to solve is and we find this reasonable solution.

183
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:43,080
So you get 29 points.

184
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:47,420
I mean, so that, again, you don't.

185
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:05,430
2541 used to be theater.

186
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:14,310
You start shooting. This.

187
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:25,290
Three years. And then the Soviets again.

188
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:35,280
Yeah. I'll just stay here. And then things got bigger.

189
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:44,270
And the problem with nonlinear optimization is that it just can get lost.

190
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:49,520
Right. And then you have to say, yeah, no, I mean, try again and you can get lost again.

191
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:57,980
And right now is just meandering through that feasible region and it's not going to find the solution pretty quickly.

192
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:04,220
So you may be is not even worth that.

193
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:09,440
So I think the routing function also.

194
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:47,150
We're going to take these from function and solve it as a linear form.

195
00:28:51,110 --> 00:29:02,420
And as we did before, if you are going to use silver now in do so that seemed flexible.

196
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:09,490
That's what we had before. And we have our 2019.

197
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:22,910
And those all of these are feasible. I mean, so and we have to accept these these numbers 767 and around them.

198
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:29,430
So we're going to be close to them to the optimal solution because look what this.

199
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:41,950
There is another way which is put constraints and say all these constraints or all these numbers must be to,

200
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:47,889
but then it will take a while to solve that.

201
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,920
So these is our facilitation.

202
00:29:50,920 --> 00:30:05,020
We can live with stage 78.1, 78, 75, 75, 71.3 and this is 68.

203
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:09,820
And so so that's. That's the story.

204
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:20,830
And if you actually let's say that I think to die here and if I take the decimals out,

205
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:28,660
this is going to be still the 29 is going to be still some green.

206
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:35,530
So we can look at better than that and all of the constraints which are going to be satisfied, as we saw before.

207
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:44,770
So that's in here. You'll see that all these numbers and we carry zero inventory.

208
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:53,399
Everything is less than 50,000 and the end in 2000.

209
00:30:53,400 --> 00:31:02,320
So we just satisfy all going to start. And we can, if you want to make sure that we have.

210
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:08,500
So if we put more constraints, right is going to be better than 29.

211
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,970
So he's going to be he's going to try to go farther.

212
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,760
It's going to be more difficult. So he's going to be on 30 or 31 in employees years.

213
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:26,380
But it didn't happen this time. And so I think we are in there in good shape.

214
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:32,950
So what I mean is now I solved that so I don't have to sell that again if I put a round.

215
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:45,610
To think that this email account. And then Coleman you.

216
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:56,430
Okay. So now all these numbers are reading. These numbers are going to be read in your.

217
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:07,710
Then the question is, are we satisfied that all the constraints in the way you can shape that?

218
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:20,740
The format that is so helpful is.

219
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:36,639
So I came to. It's sad to be fighting because there some big numbers.

220
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,110
I'm going to see more. So these numbers are so is fine.

221
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:45,340
These numbers are so is five is numbers that are satisfied.

222
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:54,100
These also. So we got everything that we need and we satisfy all the obvious constraints.

223
00:32:55,150 --> 00:33:07,050
And you can allow these little numbers are not bad at all in terms of employment.

224
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:11,830
So we can get the decimals out now.

225
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:21,910
Right. And then you see if these numbers are satisfied and they are.

226
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:30,759
And the ending you mean it is greater than zero and ending inventory from 2 to 7?

227
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:35,320
This is less than 50,000. So we cannot do better than that.

228
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:46,270
Right. So that's but they you know, the optimal assignment and the number of employees that you are looking to hire,

229
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:54,280
you can get better than 29 and satisfy all the constraints of that minimum that you've got.

230
00:33:55,450 --> 00:34:00,629
So some of you may have a different distribution, but in number,

231
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:18,700
if you truly believe this is one of the things that it would be nice to see is in your

232
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:30,450
programing model and I'm not going to ask you to do something like that in the final exam,

233
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:35,460
but in. You know, but but, you know,

234
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:42,930
they they demonstrated that you need to know that you need to put in some you something similar to this

235
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:51,170
you know that goes there so it's not may not be exactly the same beginning inventory in so many and

236
00:34:51,180 --> 00:35:00,749
an inventory and the number of workers and so so so many of these decision variables but you will you

237
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:08,460
can have assignments you can have a problem in which you have to take care of what happened yesterday.

238
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:14,460
Right. And that was the beginning, even with the ending of yesterday's the beginning of today.

239
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:22,540
And so. So it kind of big time, right?

240
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:33,690
So it was. I didn't say that.

241
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:48,420
And now. We are going to start a new topic today and it is Monte Carlo simulation and data.

242
00:35:48,490 --> 00:36:02,969
First, I am trying to solve a problem using Monte Carlo simulation without any aid, without any extra assistance to excel.

243
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:11,610
So using purely Excel. So you have an idea that if you don't have any official support for simulation,

244
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:22,890
then you can solve know simulation problem and you have you have an idea what the policy relation is, which is nothing complicated.

245
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:30,089
The most important part of a simulation problem is to is to build a model.

246
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:36,180
Then after that, then running the simulations is not a big deal.

247
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:40,940
So I am going to move over.

248
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:48,870
Our campus site on assignments.

249
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,660
Do you? We can't ask.

250
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:08,710
Former Number ten. I'm going to I'm going to change it.

251
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:15,379
And the deadline to the following Thursday, because we don't have class on Thursday.

252
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,550
So we want to start with one over here.

253
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,550
And I'm going to solve this problem, problem in 11.

254
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:31,470
And so this ongoing problem and.

255
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:56,600
And this goes Let's suppose that you own an expensive car and purchased own insurance.

256
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:08,270
They insurance as a 1000 deductible so that if you have an accident and the damage is less than 1000, you pay for it out of your pocket.

257
00:38:09,110 --> 00:38:19,340
However, if the damage is greater than 8000, you pay good $4,000 and the insurance pays the rent in the current year.

258
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:25,670
In the current year. There is a probability of 2.5% that you will have an accident.

259
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:35,210
If you have an accident, the damage amount is normally distributed with means 3000 at least, and that would be, you know, 750.

260
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:42,350
And then it goes to simulate the amount you have to pay for damages to your car.

261
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:53,380
This should be a one line simulation. So run 5000 iterations, copy it down, then find the average amount you pay,

262
00:38:53,390 --> 00:39:00,410
the standard deviation of the amount you pay, and 95% confidence interval for the average amount you pay.

263
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,910
Note that many of the amount you pay will be zero because you have that nuance.

264
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:08,570
So what does it mean that this to.

265
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:19,070
So this is a template that is going to be helpful for you. And we are going to now just focus on the first part.

266
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:26,040
So we. Of the templates.

267
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:43,180
I'm going to make it little be. So we've known that we have and these are going to be our these day.

268
00:39:43,210 --> 00:40:01,910
The the wall is $1,000. Right. And then the probability of an accident in any year is 2.5%, equal to 30%.

269
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:09,750
20 zero zero. And the damage amount.

270
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:22,170
If something happens, if you have an accident, then is going to be the damage is going to be normally distributed with a mean of 3000.

271
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:31,470
It's a mean of 3000 and a standard deviation of seven 53,000.

272
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:41,070
And it's not a relation of 70. So what?

273
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:57,930
What this means is that. What we what we want to do is figured out that in a given year, in any given year, if you have these characteristics,

274
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:05,700
you know what is going to be the expected value of the amount that you're going to pay out of pocket.

275
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:10,530
If you have that kind of insured, well, what is expected value?

276
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:18,839
Some. Most of the time you pay nothing. But sometimes you have an accident and the accident happens to be, let's say,

277
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:26,610
$3,000 and you pay them the first thousand and the insurance will pay $2,000.

278
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:37,890
Right. You pay up to 10,000. So in any in any circumstance, you are willing to pay the maximum and you're going to pay $1,000.

279
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:48,479
But even, you know, you have an accident and the the damage is less than $1,000.

280
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,500
Then you're going to pay that money. It $100. You pay $100.

281
00:41:52,620 --> 00:42:03,360
So so what we are going to do is pretend like, you know, we examined these and they say, what is a typical year?

282
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:07,350
Okay, what is this year? Let me let me put different scenarios.

283
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:13,900
And at random, you know, you can this year or I have an accident or this year.

284
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,329
No, I didn't have an accident. And oh, yes, I have an accident.

285
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:28,170
And it cost me that much. So I based on that information that I have here and that information that I have here,

286
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:35,370
that is going to give me the characteristics of the scenarios that I'm going to be looking at.

287
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:44,520
So I am going to have scenarios and I'm going to do thousands of scenarios.

288
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:59,880
In this case, probably, you know, 1000 to 5000, the scenarios in which 2.5% of them approximately I'm going to have an accident.

289
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:07,320
And if I have an accident, I am going to get a random value from this distribution.

290
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:13,140
So the normal distribution, just remember the like this.

291
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:29,850
And then this is going to be the thing they mean, oh, the damage is going to be $30,000 and the standard deviation is going to be 7050.

292
00:43:29,850 --> 00:43:36,930
The standard deviation, you know, tells you how spread out that distribution is right down here.

293
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:55,740
It's going to be long sentences to me and then here is going to be to a standard elevation and then that's going to be 1530 thousand, 1500.

294
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:03,860
And this is going to be now they're going to be three.

295
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:21,150
You know, minus three is standard deviation from this is theoretically the the the normal distribution goes from plus infinity to minus infinity.

296
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:31,290
Right. But we know that in practice between one and the one and minus one is standard deviation.

297
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:36,629
We have approximately how much? Two thirds of the distribution range.

298
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:46,200
So most of the distributions are between the one and minus two, plus one and minus one.

299
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,570
The standard deviation between this is what it is.

300
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,300
This is what the sigma minus one thing is two sigma.

301
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:02,580
And this is nothing to do with that.

302
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,090
And then between two and minus two is standard aviation.

303
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:12,840
You have 95% of the distribution at 85%.

304
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,730
And between three minus three is standard deviation.

305
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:33,520
You have 99.8 something percent of.

306
00:45:34,430 --> 00:45:37,990
That mean almost all almost all the.

307
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,390
So I'm going to be sampling, by the way.

308
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:51,290
Oh, you know, I explain these with much more details in the videos that I'm going to assign to you for the week.

309
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:59,050
So you can you can get that from from there, but that's from your statistics class.

310
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:11,510
And what I'm going to do that is okay from one scenario, I'm going to pick a number at random to see whether that is me.

311
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:18,010
Do 95, 99, 97.5% of the time says no accident.

312
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:24,580
And and 2.5% of the times this accident.

313
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:31,330
If it says accident that number, then I'm going to pick a number randomly from this distribution.

314
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:40,910
Right. According to and according to the being in probabilities, the distribution of values according to this density.

315
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:54,400
Right. So I'm going to be picking values more around here because you have more density here and more more mass higher probability in this area than,

316
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:58,900
you know, in this area or descending. But it's going to be according right.

317
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:04,870
So and so I went to simulate my year.

318
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:08,750
I began with a random victim that tells me yes or no.

319
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:14,380
And then say, yes, I'd be going over a random that tells me what the damage is.

320
00:47:15,610 --> 00:47:19,180
So that's it. That's going to be how we're going to do this.

321
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,770
How they do that, that is.

322
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:21,220
And I used to think instead of one time in the following days.

323
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:28,030
So first, let's figure out the logic of this simulation.

324
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:32,800
And then this is the with the random numbers right there.

325
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:40,970
So this let's go here. And here I'm going to have our in.

326
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:45,750
It is sale that is not going to be the same all the time.

327
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:49,950
Sometimes is going to say why. Yes. And sometimes you're going to say and no.

328
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:58,910
And it's been to say yes. If I do this many times, people are going to say yes 2.5% of the time.

329
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:04,050
And he's going to say no, you know, 97.5% of the time.

330
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:08,150
Right. The more sample and their baby, baby.

331
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:14,040
But the longer the sample, the closer to that proportion is going to be because they're around.

332
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:21,360
And then so let's pretend, for example, that I have an accident here.

333
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:29,740
So I'm going to build a Y. So this is going to be why here?

334
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:44,470
Okay. So if there's a why here, then it should be a damage right on in this in this sale.

335
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:52,790
I went to say, well, if there is a damage, then if this isn't why, you know,

336
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:00,100
you know, you need to figure out what the damage is from a normal distribution.

337
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:03,700
If there's no way why there's a no, then put a zero.

338
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:09,639
Right? There's no damage. And so in this case, there is a damage.

339
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:19,180
And they have a logic that's going to say, well, there is a damage here and I am going to put out the damage.

340
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:24,500
And they say. Winning.

341
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:35,940
500. Don't. So then you you consider here the amount you pay.

342
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,650
So what is the amount you pay in that in that situation?

343
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:51,190
You are going to pay if you are going to pay the amount you pay for this house.

344
00:50:51,410 --> 00:50:54,970
Right. That's the maximum you pay. Right. So the result.

345
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:01,230
So the insurance is if you're if you exceed any doctor.

346
00:51:01,270 --> 00:51:06,780
All right. They insure and pay for things that they they see the end of their deductible.

347
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:13,000
But you pay up to the deductible. So the maximum that you pay that's out and the insurance pay for the rest.

348
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:24,640
If you, for example, get an accident, at least $800, depending on, you know, what is an accident is, you know, 20,000, you just pay.

349
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:29,770
So in this case, we are going to be paying 8000.

350
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:40,750
You know, how do we generate these numbers and these not to get these low?

351
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,980
You can get these on the list. Let's do that.

352
00:51:46,700 --> 00:51:57,430
Well, I'm going to be there and I'm going to show you two things being in excess.

353
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:03,010
So in Excel, Excel can generate to help one get around number.

354
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:10,020
Excel only can generate the only function.

355
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:21,519
That random function that Excel has is a function that is called a run that that will, you know,

356
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:27,580
every time you recalculate, Excel is going to show you a number between zero and one.

357
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:31,989
Okay. And this all the numbers are going to be equally likely.

358
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:34,990
So it's uniformly distributed between zero and one.

359
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:43,890
So so is, for example, you get equal to Rand and no arguments.

360
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:49,059
Rand and then close parentheses and close brackets.

361
00:52:49,060 --> 00:53:02,230
Right. And then you press that recalculation key in Excel we use it name every time they present and nine that number is going up.

362
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:10,950
Every time you recalculate excel this number is going to increase. I don't you know, you kind of go ahead.

363
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:21,730
I, I don't want to do that now because when I present mine is going to interrupt my recording so I can because that's,

364
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:28,300
you know, is, is linked to that and then he is linked to my recording.

365
00:53:28,310 --> 00:53:40,800
But I can do something else to recalculate excel. Let's put a one here and for example and then 1.999 or I can change the note the

366
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:51,850
zero here now we have 168 and then in confusion over here is something that I,

367
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:58,120
I want excel to recalculate anything I do accelerate calculates the expression and

368
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:03,100
every time it does it activate this function and you get a number between zero and one,

369
00:54:03,250 --> 00:54:08,250
right? So you can just click F9 and you can see all these numbers.

370
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:16,060
Take this number here changing randomly between zero four.

371
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,820
So if I had not followed the numbers that come from Excel,

372
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:30,850
every time I press function nine and I pick the number and do a histogram, I am going to find that is something like this.

373
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,750
This is hero and this is one.

374
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:50,510
And then the density of intensity from the heat is going to be something that is uniformly streamed between zero and one.

375
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:58,150
Because this is is that rectangle okay, between zero and oh,

376
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:07,580
everything is equally likely any point in between and the same likelihood of a brace, right.

377
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:15,940
I'm using the same probability of I'm here because that is not accurate, right?

378
00:55:15,950 --> 00:55:21,860
So the probability that you get a certain number between zero and one is always zero.

379
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,910
That's I believe that you get between three, three, three, three three, 3.33.

380
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:33,920
Exactly is zero. Right. But it can happen with probability zero.

381
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,200
But that's for another classic is that this would be right.

382
00:55:39,530 --> 00:55:43,700
So the point is you can have those numbers with this same likelihood.

383
00:55:44,990 --> 00:55:50,900
Yeah. When we talk about probabilities is when you can measure something like, oh, what is the norm,

384
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:58,520
how what's the probability that I get that number between point five, I'm point six and then you get to get your microphone isn't working.

385
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:15,370
Well, thank you. Did the battery go out?

386
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,860
Oh, but a three year battery out.

387
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:39,820
Yeah. It's that kind of. All right.

388
00:56:39,890 --> 00:56:43,510
I am going to be louder because.

389
00:56:52,760 --> 00:57:10,990
Which is. Just make sure they don't have global AIDS.

390
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:16,050
We are just trying to take both the aid from global.

391
00:57:20,450 --> 00:57:43,970
That's too soon. Today she's wearing business.

392
00:57:48,650 --> 00:57:52,760
Thank you. Okay. Sounds good.

393
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:59,330
So now I was.

394
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:04,340
I was saying you that I was telling you that we.

395
00:58:04,610 --> 00:58:17,570
The only way to generate a random number here is in Excel is to derive these numbers in order between zero and one.

396
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:26,000
So how? So if that's the only way, if that's the only random function that Excel has,

397
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:32,090
I need to use that random function to construct only random numbers that I want.

398
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:41,270
In this case, I want to build with the run function some other variable.

399
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:50,299
Use that in a computation that tell me why 2.5% of the time and in 97.5% of the time.

400
00:58:50,300 --> 00:59:04,520
So how do I do that? I can use an if function right and say if you know this number is less than or equal to 2.5%.

401
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,180
0.025. Why otherwise?

402
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:13,070
Wouldn't know. Right. So it's going to happen if I put.

403
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,610
The market at 2.5% 1025.

404
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:27,460
So I'm dividing this range into two parts.

405
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:36,130
And then I get a run. And if this number folds here, I'm going to say, no, you didn't have an accident.

406
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:41,620
If I get another run and if this number falls here, I'm going to say, no, you didn't have an accident.

407
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:50,200
But if it falls here in this, you know, between zero and 2.5, then I'm going to say, yes, you have an accident.

408
00:59:50,950 --> 00:59:58,150
And that, you know, it's a way to generate a variable that is going to be, yes, 2.5% of the time.

409
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:02,040
And no, no, 75% of the time it's the same thing.

410
01:00:02,050 --> 01:00:05,890
And same is going to be yes. With probability 2.5.

411
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:19,180
I know a person and I know it's probably 95, so I am going to put this formula here and this is going to be equal to if.

412
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:29,210
Run. Is less than or equal.

413
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:40,310
I can put it less than. It doesn't matter because this is what is continuous probability is continuous of random number.

414
01:00:40,350 --> 01:00:49,240
So equal less than or equal or equal to the same thing because this no the no mass in the number of people, right?

415
01:00:49,690 --> 01:01:08,140
So is the same area. So 2.0 to 5 if run is less than from point 0 to 5, then why?

416
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:13,730
Yeah. Well, then why would.

417
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:21,720
No, you're right. That should do it.

418
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,380
So I think okay in there and I have it no.

419
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:40,179
Right. And every time I change my mind, my random variable or recalculating sale, then I'm going to have another random variable and I know there are.

420
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:44,680
No, they're not. You press function nine. You'll see that from time to time.

421
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:49,680
You see a white look that's happening at 2.2. 5% of it.

422
01:01:50,710 --> 01:02:21,380
And it means now. Okay.

423
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:27,710
So now that I don't need these anymore.

424
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:43,130
And then he didn't know very much. But I know I have this logic here is the random number between zero and one is less than 2.5%.

425
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:47,170
Then put it. Yes. Otherwise, put it. No, no.

426
01:02:47,450 --> 01:02:52,670
How about the damage? They did the damage.

427
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:59,450
There should be a on the damage that says something like this is.

428
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:13,340
Accidents. Equal to, you know, not an accident.

429
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:17,440
Right? The accident is just the same bs16.

430
01:03:18,250 --> 01:03:22,510
Or if you want to be more explicit, I can say.

431
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:36,500
Union case is going to be is the 16.

432
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:59,650
Equal to now. And right now, what is zero?

433
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:03,670
There's no damage. There is no accident. Otherwise.

434
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:13,030
Well, what a random number would you say. Normally distribute a random number here in between.

435
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:23,770
I don't know between is but it can go from minus infinity to plus infinity, but with mean 3000 standard deviation or 758.

436
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:31,630
So that's going to be a random number here. So I need to generate a number that is distributed like this.

437
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:37,960
Right. With Mean 3000.

438
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:44,590
And it's not motivational. 750. So how the way that these.

439
01:04:49,520 --> 01:05:17,450
Well. Well, there is a way to generate random numbers in Excel.

440
01:05:18,260 --> 01:05:27,830
Just using the random function an is from a theory of probability that you know,

441
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:33,830
a lot of you went through that and some of you didn't, so you didn't have to, you know, remember that.

442
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:43,550
But if you use the inverse of it of a random variable.

443
01:05:44,180 --> 01:05:50,350
So let's say normally if you use the inverse of the normal and evaluate that,

444
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:55,070
that the inverse of the normal with a random variable between zero and one,

445
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:05,240
the answer, the numbers, the probability that you can are going to be those numbers are going to be distributed or the numbers.

446
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:12,290
So the numbers that you get that correspond to the percentile of that random variable

447
01:06:12,620 --> 01:06:19,610
are they they are going to be distributed as the random variable that you want.

448
01:06:19,910 --> 01:06:25,049
So exactly what I mean. And you don't have to memorize that.

449
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:42,260
I do that. So if I have an sample, the normal distribution and the normal distribution, they say if it's here, you have 3000, right?

450
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:46,550
This is zero, 33,000.

451
01:06:50,070 --> 01:06:57,510
We use this theory more and we are going to put here is the cumulative probability distribution.

452
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:15,030
So it comes from minus infinity, which goes here and changes direction and then goes to almost one and goes to infinity almost approaching one.

453
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:24,510
Right? So that then this is the cumulative distribution from a normal distribution, right?

454
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:30,780
So, so if is like if you have your normal distribution here.

455
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:37,770
I mean, you start assuming that that area from here to here, right?

456
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:41,970
This is the probability of that of getting in over less than so.

457
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,489
And that is what you get here.

458
01:07:45,490 --> 01:07:50,010
Here, here. Here. By. By this number.

459
01:07:50,430 --> 01:07:54,930
By the mean. You should get 50% of the distribution by 3000.

460
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:58,860
In this case, we have 2.5.

461
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:05,600
And then from infinity that you get to want, right?

462
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,140
Because that is the area below that number.

463
01:08:09,500 --> 01:08:20,420
So the point is that if you evaluate that this is a cumulative distribution, but it seems that you use the inverse of that community needs to use.

464
01:08:20,430 --> 01:08:33,320
And so you evaluate the function, these function pulling values here in the Y axis and figure out what what numbers they correspond to.

465
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:41,090
So you get a number here then that that's a number and you get a01 variable and then

466
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:46,070
between zero and one and you get pinch over here and then you get another number.

467
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:55,610
So those numbers, if you put a 0 to 1 variable and you start evaluating these numbers with the inverse,

468
01:08:55,970 --> 01:09:03,690
then the numbers that you get are going to be distributed normally with mean 3000 standard deviation of seven, right?

469
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:28,580
So if you that's the issue is that I have, let's say 3500 and what is the probability of getting a number, if any, 500 damage or less?

470
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,250
Then you go the 35 number, 25, 3500 or less.

471
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:38,660
Okay. This is a probability of as 8.8.

472
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:47,060
Okay. That's how you use normally the cumulative distribution and cumulative probability distribution,

473
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:56,419
but is instead of using the cumulative distribution like that, you will start generating a random number between zero and one.

474
01:09:56,420 --> 01:10:07,670
And you say, okay, I got one 2501 25 correspond to what number of point 25 correspond to then say 2000.

475
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:14,510
Okay. Oh I go that on a random number and these random number and correspond to.

476
01:10:17,470 --> 01:10:31,890
This one, right? And instead of these random numbers point 25, they say 0.3, 0.3 correspond to 2500 something.

477
01:10:33,550 --> 01:10:38,110
So if you start evaluating a lot of numbers between zero and one.

478
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:50,470
Right. And the answers that you get are going to be distributed normally with mean 3000 standard deviation as an infrastructure.

479
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:56,670
So that's the property of. So.

480
01:10:58,620 --> 01:11:17,449
Yeah, I'm going to. I'm going to I'm going to use the inverse of they know the normal and I am going to generate these.

481
01:11:17,450 --> 01:11:27,640
Right? No, no. I'm going to use the.

482
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:35,410
I'm going to use. I'm going to I need to create these for a here.

483
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:47,530
And that's going to be equal to if there is no damage, if they see them here is equal to no.

484
01:11:52,190 --> 01:11:56,930
Then what's the damage? Zero.

485
01:11:58,720 --> 01:12:07,440
Weather wise, it's going to be a damage and the damage is going to be in the inverse of their normal,

486
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:17,130
even weighted in some random between zero and one in some uniform between zero and the run and the inverse of the normal.

487
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:17,700
You know,

488
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:31,440
Excel has all these inverse functions for probably distributions that we have norm done in or inverse of the normal of the upper parentheses.

489
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:42,480
And then we have three arguments. First, the probability of the person that we want to evaluate, which is that number between zero and one.

490
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:58,860
And that is going to be my friend. Then it's going to be the mean of the probability that the normal is going to be, in this case, 3000.

491
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:08,540
So I'm going to love that. And finally, the standard deviation, which is going to be 750,

492
01:13:10,190 --> 01:13:24,080
and that's also I went to block and then I can close parentheses for the norm and norm in and then close parentheses for the if statement.

493
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:29,290
And then I get my damage equals zero, right?

494
01:13:29,330 --> 01:13:38,810
Because if they don't, if I start pressing on this number, if I, if I start pressing the F nine,

495
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:48,170
you're going to see sometimes 2.5% of the time you are going to see a Y appearing with some damage and the damage is going to be distributed,

496
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:55,110
you know, normally with 3000 understanding deviation, 2.7 feet.

497
01:13:55,910 --> 01:14:04,190
Now finally, let's compute the amount you pay the equation for the damages.

498
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:18,880
Again, the damage here. So it's as if.

499
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:29,170
There is no accident. Then I think you see there is an accident.

500
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:38,560
You are going to generate the damage from a normal distribution with 3000 and a standard deviation of seven feet.

501
01:14:39,130 --> 01:14:42,520
And in order to generate that run the number,

502
01:14:42,520 --> 01:14:56,200
we are using a probability known fact that if you if you evaluate the inverse of a random function

503
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:06,580
with a01 variable range with a with a uniformly distributed variable between zero and one.

504
01:15:07,150 --> 01:15:14,110
The answer, the output is going to be distributed with the distribution that you do being

505
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:18,040
very strong and the parameters that you that you would in that distribution.

506
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:34,030
So that's how Monte Carlo simulation works, is your sampling between, you know, these numbers and using these these known fact.

507
01:15:34,220 --> 01:15:48,400
Right. And but, you know, some programs that have that probe and that has already been in invented in in their in the function,

508
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:52,530
they have function explicitly to say, oh, I want to generate a normal let's do this.

509
01:15:52,810 --> 01:15:58,060
Oh, I want to generate a uniform and you need to put the parameters but excel by itself.

510
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:02,580
You need to build that. And that's the way to build a.

511
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:08,409
So please enter. And then what is the amount you pay?

512
01:16:08,410 --> 01:16:18,590
What is to give me a formula for the amount you pay? If if one.

513
01:16:22,150 --> 01:16:28,200
Damages are greater than 1000. You paint a thousand zero.

514
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,590
Okay. Exactly. So if these number.

515
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:40,350
What you have here is greater than or equal the same thing, right?

516
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:48,630
So if is greater than the greater or equal, which is going to be the same thing, right?

517
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:55,780
So it doesn't matter that that the doctor will write you, then damage is greater than the to one.

518
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:59,490
Then you fail. Then in the right.

519
01:17:02,820 --> 01:17:10,350
Otherwise you pay the damage and the damage is C-16.

520
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:15,140
So this. In 2016.

521
01:17:17,180 --> 01:17:26,610
We just did that. So. If the damage is greater than the deductible, you pay the deductible.

522
01:17:27,090 --> 01:17:31,110
Otherwise, you pay for the damage. That's why we set.

523
01:17:33,610 --> 01:17:38,330
Okay. So the amount you pay is zero.

524
01:17:39,170 --> 01:17:47,270
So now what I want to do is just replicate that four wheeler, I think 5000 times.

525
01:17:48,380 --> 01:17:56,270
So I want to create 5000 different scenarios with these formula and see how,

526
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:01,640
you know, what is the, the, the, the numbers that gets into the amount I pay.

527
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:06,940
What the numbers that I have on accident. What then what how many times that have an accident happened,

528
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:15,650
you know what are the different damages and and figure figured out and then the average value for the amount I pay, for example.

529
01:18:16,250 --> 01:18:22,460
So the amount I pay. What does that mean? Okay, I'm gonna pay with the standard deviation that they might pay.

530
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:26,540
All right, so how do we do this?

531
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:31,910
We say 5000 times. Yeah, 5000 iterations.

532
01:18:32,390 --> 01:18:35,510
So how do I generate these cells on the duration?

533
01:18:35,510 --> 01:18:44,209
So I'm going to do a first, you know, created table that will list those 5000 iterations here.

534
01:18:44,210 --> 01:18:52,670
So I'm going to number the duration from one to 1 to 5000.

535
01:18:52,790 --> 01:18:59,090
So you put your course or whatever you want, even one or the two,

536
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:16,430
and then we going to hum and I'm going to go in to fill in this item here and I'm going to fill a series.

537
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:26,630
This series is going to be in. So this is series is going to be in columns, at least from from this moment.

538
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:32,510
And that number is a type is going to be linear.

539
01:19:32,930 --> 01:19:37,700
Right? There is the value is going to be one.

540
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:43,790
So he's going to increase the numbers by one and it's going to call 5000.

541
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:57,170
And then if I click, okay, I have all my numbers from 1 to 5000, which I'll have to try and see whether I can get 5000 or so.

542
01:19:57,170 --> 01:20:00,620
We got 5000 over from 1 to 5000.

543
01:20:00,860 --> 01:20:03,770
And if you want to make sure that you have that,

544
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:16,300
so you go down in a row and you see that you have some space up in here and then Cairo and then you have the inverse.

545
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:26,030
And now we are going to make we are going to replicate these row in to this table.

546
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:40,070
And every time when we replicate that row, Excel is going to bring a new random number because those numbers are here random.

547
01:20:40,070 --> 01:20:46,430
They're independent of each other. So for each cell, you're going to have a new random number.

548
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:50,389
And this is going to be a new situation.

549
01:20:50,390 --> 01:20:58,490
Either you have an accident or not. And if you have an accident, you have a what's a damage or not.

550
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:07,220
And at the very end, all we're going to do is take the amount you pay and get the average and the standard deviation and evaluate those numbers.

551
01:21:07,430 --> 01:21:10,520
And so we're going to do that next Tuesday.

552
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:18,650
I'm going to put give you some readings or, you know, videos for you to watch.

553
01:21:19,250 --> 01:21:24,020
You have the whole that we haven't done too much for you and their homework.

554
01:21:24,020 --> 01:21:30,079
So enjoy your Thanksgiving break and we will follow it on Thursday.

555
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:41,030
And then I will give you more time to put this over, maybe not before you can do it by the middle of next year.

556
01:21:42,110 --> 01:21:46,850
All right. Thank you so much. I will see you soon.

557
01:21:50,700 --> 01:21:54,200
All that everyone will be.

558
01:21:59,570 --> 01:22:22,440
Well, I want you to know that no one wants to kill me.

559
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:31,469
Well, that's like saying I was so and so.

560
01:22:31,470 --> 01:22:37,710
I'm trying to figure out the truth, and. Yeah, that's all right.

561
01:22:37,800 --> 01:22:42,330
But I don't want to lose all the magic.

562
01:22:42,360 --> 01:22:48,880
You have. I think you should know. And like I said to.

563
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:55,430
And so I feel bad that I remember. I don't know what happened to her.

564
01:22:56,130 --> 01:23:07,460
Oh, really? It was probably like. I'm going to like her, like.

565
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:12,920
Or maybe it's like I was right.

566
01:23:14,450 --> 01:23:23,350
Yeah. Like I would be like. Oh, yeah.

567
01:23:23,610 --> 01:23:28,640
Okay. Right. Yeah, that's right.

568
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:51,480
I'll post a series of square miles to apply for, like, this whole thing is against the whole.

569
01:23:51,510 --> 01:23:55,160
Like, you guys make stuff up, but I'll do it.

570
01:23:55,470 --> 01:24:02,370
And I really do this for you.

571
01:24:05,220 --> 01:24:08,760
Oh, around the corner in the other parking garage.

572
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:15,390
Okay. I'll go find when I see you.

573
01:24:20,730 --> 01:24:31,530
So your calls all rumble goes there, and then you have to enjoy office hours.

574
01:24:31,890 --> 01:24:38,700
Thank you. Thank you. Sydney, how are you feeling?

575
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:48,630
Exhausted. I'm exhausted. I know you stayed up last night at the same time.

576
01:24:50,190 --> 01:24:59,290
She hasn't. It's kind of like. You don't have to do.
