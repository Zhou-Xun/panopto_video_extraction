1
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:32,000
hey good afternoon unless

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I give everyone a few minutes to settle in before I begin the lecture

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
but I do wanna start out by um announcing a summer internship opportunity.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
this is the topic is particularly timely given the conversation that we had last Thursday

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and I likes today. um this is an eight week page is a summer internship

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
opportunities for undergraduate students were interested in the health care

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
and specifically inventing health equity in the health care system.

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:11,000
so um I get it easy internships here in the school of public house

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
in addition to a housing costs are that there's a food

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
allowance or the GRE prep course. um weekly meetings

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
with other people in the program and then in in internship opportunities um.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
so the information is on the side about where to get some more information. on many slides

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
earliest who said him on Arkansas. so um. so

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
please do read about that. um there are some other programs um

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
for those of you who are interested in in the health equity but it's less of a health care focus.

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
the future public health leaders program run it for your for your for three or four

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
different universities over the summer is another summer internship program similar

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
to this weather only without the focus on the health care system specifically.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
if you have questions about that. please feel free to send me an e-mail. I'm not an expert in the program

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:19,000
but I can put you in touch with the people who run the program. so wanted to share that.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
okay so today we are talking about the affordable care act also known as Obamacare. I

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
use that term very lovingly I think the use of the term Obamacare has just been a little

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
bit over the years I think it was originally kind and did they turns or mess be

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
kind of a slight um but I think it's also kind of I think President Obama himself is really adopted

25
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the term and so I'll use that um it's like she was um. previous versions

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,000
were given by a computer for individuals including our guest speaker for the Thursday

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,000
um and there's also building on the great work of a couple of artsy if I'd wanna make sure to give them

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
so the structure of today's lecture. I mean I spend a lot of time talking about that little bit sometime in

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
the purpose of the affordable care act what it was meant to do kind of it's goal

30
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
that I'm gonna go through and talk about different components of the affordable care act what

31
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
it what it actually did or what it was written to do the original form

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
that was passed that I mean to talk about some of the challenges to the affordable

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
care act. um why you did or what have been some ways that they it shifted

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
over the last um almost a decade and then and by talking about where the

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
affordable care act is today. and so you just wanted and then again

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I know they do you reckon in preparation for class today for discussion texture and

37
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
later in the week. um but I will stop in a couple appointment times to take some questions. um

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
one of our little boxes is back there with a G S I Emily who's getting her PhD in house management

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
policy. even studying affordable care act um and it's implications during her

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
time here and when she was a student at Harvard um she has a lot of wisdom to share as well

41
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:13,000
so I might be calling on Emily I'm doing a lecture.

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,000
okay so my name that has to be put away your phone. put away. honestly ready to focus

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
on phosphorus. okay. so talk a little bit about

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
the purpose of the affordable care act during the lecture

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
on Thursday. I mention these is kind of four of the biggest problems with the health care

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
system. we talked about the cost of care both for the nation and kinda looking at per capita

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
spending spending those breast cost around health care rep is about eighteen

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
percent of our gross domestic product. so most one out of every five dollars is

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
spent on health care. we talked about access to care. I

50
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
mean health insurance coverage how those are not things that everyone in the united

51
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
states um how their limits I mean especially for those who are low

52
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
homelands have been to correctly franchise they have trouble accessing food quality care

53
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and the phone with the health care system is the quality and the care that is delivered um and who's accountable

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,000
for it we talk about how fragmented the health care system is um and how accountability

55
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,000
is the challenge. we also reflect a little bit on racial and economic

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:34,000
disparities here reflecting on that in your papers that are due a week from today.

57
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
so we talked about the four main problems with the health care system. you

58
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
reading about the affordable care act. um this really and just focus on fixing one of these problems

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
those other ones are great out. are less the focus of the whereabouts are actually affordable

60
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:59,000
characters really focus on addressing insurance coverage and access to care

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
that's the primary focus of the affordable care act insurance coverage. after I

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,000
think our thinking about for your papers there are some components of the affordable care act didn't

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
feel with quality of care that started to address some of the disparities that

64
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
we see by race ethnicity socioeconomic status and other folks â€¦ or

65
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
if we disenfranchise something there for an upturn doesn't do

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
so the primary focus on it is really no insurance coverage and access to care

67
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
with some holes that I am addressing those things will start to think um to send the cocker

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:45,000
to control costs related here

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,000
um I think that's Thursday are large number of Americans are uninsured. so

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
um um access act axes so here has um year

71
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
starting in the mid nineteen nineties and going to two thousand and fifteen. um. I'll

72
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
be able to um why actually. the number in the millions of individuals were uninsured.

73
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
that's represented in the yellow line and over here on this him on this is class

74
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
a percentage of the population that is uninsured to be see that he's um somewhere

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
around to me it looks like around two thousand thirteen. um with almost

76
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
forty eight million individuals um for you million individual uninsured.

77
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
um for about seventeen somewhere between seventeen and eighteen percent of the population.

78
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
so the large number and a large percentage of Americans are uninsured prior

79
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
to world care that was the primary thing the important character trying

80
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,000
to address this number of individuals who are uninsured

81
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
so they easy it was really designed to expand insurance. so prior to the affordable

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
care act and I were talking up before two thousand and ten. when some of the components

83
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:07,000
of the affordable care act against being cemented the following group barriers to insurance coverage.

84
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:12,000
so if you were denied myself as many of you in the real are you are excluded

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
from your parents insurance. after nineteen years old. we're twenty two years old if you were a

86
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:23,000
student. so when you graduate from college and you were twenty two. you're no longer eligible to stay

87
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:28,000
on your parents health insurance plan. if

88
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
you are someone who had a pre-existing condition. you could be denied health insurance.

89
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
if you had a condition that was prior to the start of a new insurance you

90
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
were someone did receive health care coverage through your employer you

91
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
were trying to just purchase a health insurance. you could be denied today being

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
able to purchase that because of your current. house if you had a pre-existing condition. is

93
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:01,000
a language that with you. you can be barred from buying insurance

94
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
childless adults people who um were um uh who didn't have

95
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
kids no matter how much were little really money they made. if you

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
were an adult who didn't have children. even if you are very very low in common.

97
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
you did not have access to Medicaid. so we talk about medicated that program and to

98
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
be role model for those who are low income but it's only certain types of low

99
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
income people there's a bit different categories and if the category that you were in the with childless

100
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,000
adults. you didn't have access to Medicaid privacy affordable care act

101
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
and again before the affordable care act if you were very sick you might have health insurance

102
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
but there could be a limit. either her year or over your lifetime about

103
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
how much coverage or how much reimbursement you can read the room limit. they're usually

104
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
over your lifetime on the reimbursement that you would receive if you are married.

105
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
are these and the primary. um the some of the group it really face barriers to insurance

106
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
coverage of the two insurance and take the ferry or something. I guess is before

107
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:21,000
two thousand ten before the affordable care.

108
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
um. again if it's about how um that little condescending was really fine. I'm

109
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
gonna even for individuals who have insurance even if you were if you were

110
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:37,000
insured for many individuals the cost of care especially out of pocket

111
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
cost we're still very hot so even if you had insurance it might not have been a great

112
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
insurance is still it's costing you a lot of money especially if you're someone who has buy a

113
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
healthcare plan on the private market. so you didn't get employer sponsored care that

114
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
you were in on a government program if you were someone who just trying to buy a health insurance plan I can be

115
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
really expensive. I mean the quality of those plans when they hard. my

116
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
guess that is another problem before this off before the affordable care.

117
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
um. and again we talked about on Thursday. um this is American to put up medical treatment.

118
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
um we really do that. affording caring affording good quality care with the challenge.

119
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm procedurally for those individuals who are working class. who's so made more. me just

120
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
enough that they work on Medicaid or other historically disenfranchised individuals.

121
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
so even if you have hot here been able to afford care what the challenge has

122
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:44,000
entirely changed that somebody was there for the affordable care act. I'm started to it to us

123
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
okay. I also wanted to know the affordable care act the buildings existing mall

124
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
coverage. um. so uh it's a little blurbs occurred June and I think your

125
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
changes finally says Mitt Romney unto too I've had knew about. um it's

126
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
funny because these guys are twins. um. so um I

127
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
wasn't just getting you know I am in a lighthearted way with the safety uh that um

128
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Obamacare or the affordable care act really bill. I am former

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
governor Romney 's health care plan in Massachusetts. governor running with the

130
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
um the governor in Massachusetts in the early two thousand and um and the

131
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
republican governor and a very blue state. he passed a health care

132
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
um health care legislation for helps her to sign healthcare legislation. um

133
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,000
that was really forms the foundation of the affordable care

134
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
so the Republican plan um prior to him. Governor Romney. I am

135
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
contacting us and it had been opposed by people who are working

136
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
more of a conservative or a rainy season changes um it

137
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
feels uh and um. 's that they're planning in Massachusetts and then this plan was

138
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
built on the affordable care of herself to Governor Romney 's really had conservative

139
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I have yet um and I wanted to know that

140
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
if build on the existing plan and and the affordable care of really performs the health in

141
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
just the health care industry in the United States the health insurance industry unless it's fundamental

142
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
structure and place. I know what I mean by that is the affordable care

143
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:35,000
act to move uh to some people are to universal health care coverage.

144
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
it's not Medicare for all. it's not a socialist plan despite

145
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
some of the red areas and conversations at the time. I didn't really build on the existing

146
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,000
models that we have a best employee sponsored care. I'm supplemented

147
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,000
by government programs and a lot of venture and the majority of individual still

148
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:01,000
being insured on the um through private.

149
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:06,000
um so it's it's a little bit of a nuance matches message because it

150
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
again was built in these conservative principles. I fun because of what he did it is a

151
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
storage piece of legislation um that really meant a lot of um hold

152
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
that um democratic administrations tennis for a lot of years. on expanding health insurance

153
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
coverage too many individuals um particularly low income individuals objects

154
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
text. okay. before Amazon on

155
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:38,000
questions about the purpose of the affordable care act or what I mean about it's really

156
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:48,000
bills on in the system structure. we have

157
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
so far. okay. talk about the components of the ACA.

158
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
um before I sign and I just want you to know that there's a lotta stuff in the portable

159
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
character that I'm not talking about. um I'm really focusing on the news I think her mood

160
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
important either because they've been very controversial for for the components of the affordable

161
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
care act that really increased insurance coverage the most I'm brought in the most people

162
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
um. or has specific relevance for public

163
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
um so uh you I haven't heard him haven't downloaded

164
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:31,000
to be affordable care act I mean writing your papers you're crazy. um because it's

165
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:36,000
really low um. there are very few individuals uh including myself

166
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
who have read the whole thing. I'm not on the whole thing um and um

167
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
over twelve hundred pages long you can organized into ten titles or ten sections

168
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
um they each talk about it different component of the health care system and

169
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
it's important to know that it's um dead in the act he created hundreds

170
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
of regulations that has implications for a number of different federal agencies. um

171
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Hinkley the food and drug administration and the Centers for Disease Control off the sensor Medicaid

172
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:15,000
American Medicaid and Medicare services. um. so it's it's it's really up

173
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
six piece of legislation. okay. so here is

174
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
the tenant I am in they again they each cover address a different

175
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
part of the um health care system. you will not be asked to repeat

176
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
the title you don't have to memorize them they will not be on any man. um but I do

177
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
wanna just kinda let you know that they're out there and if working on your papers.

178
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,000
um there maybe some might see one of the sales and think oh that idea somewhere I can go and look at you look

179
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,000
at that. I don't specifically um dressy my manager my

180
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
favorite topics. um. so the first two titles that are around the quality. um

181
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
title quality affordable health care for all Americans and the role of problem public programs.

182
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
those are the title really contain the provisions that have been most controversial have I

183
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
gotten the most intentions will spend a lot of time on these two titles also

184
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
just give a little bit of a nod to see you that titles on because I think they have sons specifically additional

185
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
components of public health importance um. we talked about the healthcare workforce

186
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and some of the challenges to the healthcare workforce. um that we're facing today. um

187
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
the affordable care who is designed to address some of those challenges. so much you know.

188
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
okay. um. so that's terrific about kinda one. um which focuses on

189
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
an employer mandate system requirements for employers.

190
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:51,000
um we'll talk about some of the um reforms to the insurance industry.

191
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
talk about the individual Mandy and then also about those insurance subsidies

192
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,000
that are gonna help people um to um to purchase insurance

193
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:07,000
meet the individual mandate okay. and before we know I'm just

194
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
a reminder. again that the Sistine 's from two ten two thousand fifteen.

195
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I think numbers have not shifted significantly unsuccessful time um

196
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
and then what I wanted to really drive home is that for the majority of Americans still get

197
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
their insurance pretty affordable care act post affordable care act. the majority of Americans

198
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,000
get their insurance through their flair.

199
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
okay. so they were not care and at they don't never perform specifically focused

200
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
on employers that that proves that is responsible for ensuring most of us in

201
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:51,000
the United States or the majority of us I mean I think um here are some of those reforms

202
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
dependents can stay on their parents insurance in the top until twenty six years old uh

203
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:02,000
that was one of the least controversial provisions of the affordable care act then and now

204
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
there's a lot of young people to stay insured um democrat or republican red blue

205
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
donkeys republican there's all elements everybody likes this one. um keeping keeping the young

206
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:20,000
adults insured under reform form focus on employer specifically

207
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
uh and the affordable care act mandated that there would be penalties for companies that had

208
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
over fifty employees who don't provide insurance. so if it is required

209
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
they have to provide insurance for their employees. they don't have to. if you're a big

210
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
employer or fifty employees to provide insurance. but there are significant

211
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:45,000
tax penalties. if you don't. again this wasn't

212
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
extremely controversial on them because the majority of businesses in America

213
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
were up there where this size were already doing that and

214
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
the majority of the companies in the United States are smaller than that have fifty or fewer employees.

215
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:07,000
so it's it's um the ones who end up like if you were already doing it and the ones who

216
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,000
weren't doing that this didn't apply to him so again pretty I'm controversial. um the

217
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:19,000
tell these were significant for those companies who who chose not to provide such

218
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
an incentive not a for if your company has fewer than fifty employees under a tax

219
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
credit. if you are an employer you know offer your employees. so you

220
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
didn't talk to it with the requirements. if you if if you're fewer employees but there'll be tax credits

221
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:41,000
available to your business. if you did provide insurance to your employees.

222
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
hang in terms of how the affordable care act um draft employer

223
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
sponsored coverage that allow dependents to stay on their parents employee and sponsored insurance up

224
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,000
to twenty six year or penalize large companies who did provide

225
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
insurance information and options for their employees. I'm in the first only businesses they gave

226
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,000
them tax credits if he did provide coverage. I mean chuckles insurance coverage for.

227
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,000
okay. see form America possibly in the reform for the health

228
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
insurance industry is a lot of um. both have a kind of buzz words on here

229
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:26,000
that you might've read and look up for you might read and wonder what they meant.

230
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,000
um I so the support what Eric dressy. the constitution guaranteed

231
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
issue. um so it made sure that um health insurance companies

232
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,000
couldn't exclude people who had pre-existing condition

233
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,000
so the problem that I talked about before where you if had a pre-existing condition you were trying to purchase

234
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:54,000
a health insurance plan. easy wife that our insurance companies can't exclude

235
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
you because you have a pre-existing conditions.

236
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,000
it's also eliminated the problem of rescission or keeping people off

237
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:10,000
of their plans um because they were saying can't pay people off their place

238
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,000
because they're sick that's not an option anymore used to happen in some instances before the affordable

239
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:21,000
for you know

240
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
the affordable care. also um um mandated that health insurance companies couldn't

241
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:32,000
put in your lifetime cap on care coverage. so we couldn't say oh you know you've

242
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
we said three hundred thousand dollars on your care this year. you can't have healthcare

243
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,000
again till next year or oh you cost of two million dollars. what we're asking for your charity

244
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,000
more no more that was issued before the affordable care act before look miss

245
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
the health insurance companies couldn't do that anymore. they couldn't they couldn't cash the amount of money that was

246
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
spent on your care.

247
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
so if you if insurance companies had provided insurance companies to ensure that

248
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
you people regardless of their house. if they couldn't pay if they couldn't take sick people off

249
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
their plans and if they couldn't limit the cost of care anymore. we

250
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
think is gonna have an insurance company. what's the what's the affect here.

251
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,000
yeah mhm so why

252
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:36,000
are they gonna increase the ratings.

253
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:41,000
this is gonna drive a lot more distinct people to the market gonna be more

254
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:46,000
people who are buying health insurance and maybe sicker how much turns him

255
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:52,000
he's gonna have to um have the commentator have to deal with that house. um.

256
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
so this is the these said features are designed an insurance company 's efforts to avoid

257
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,000
adverse selection adverse selection is this idea that insurance

258
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,000
companies except people who are in greater risk for house. they don't wanna do

259
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,000
that. they would have an adverse affect on insurance company bottom line because the premium

260
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,000
when you pay a premium for health care costs when you figure out how much insurance health insurance the person

261
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:23,000
is going to pay what the reason that assumes the people are gonna have

262
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,000
a normal average health cost some people be more the people in the last um

263
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,000
but that is going to uh but this is going to be you're gonna this is easy for Missus

264
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:39,000
and there's more been sick people in the pool. that's the problem.

265
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:44,000
good talk about a little bit more in the discussion section about risk pools and adverse selection

266
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,000
um but these men and these of aspect the easy were meant to go to Boyd and

267
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:54,000
um because the any home and the companies I first interest I mean efforts to avoid adverse

268
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,000
selection or sticker Peter insurance people.

269
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:12,000
yeah

270
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
super cheap more. um

271
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I thought about that. just couldn't pull them back. yeah

272
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:35,000
they're working for of it is with cell phone care. um mostly but focus on house the.

273
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
so I my friend that and then actually. statement okay. alright she said yes.

274
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,000
um sorry so the affordable care. also mandated um

275
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
had had consequences for individuals for all Americans and that really came

276
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,000
in the form the of individual mandate which said that everyone

277
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
everyone must have health insurance or pay a penalty so

278
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
for many people again for your employer. you might be on a public

279
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,000
on a government program like Medicare or Medicaid you might be covered through him.

280
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,000
try care to the veterans administration. um but if you weren't

281
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,000
if you didn't fall under one of those government programs. you can kind of employer sponsored.

282
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,000
here you would need to purchase health care insurance

283
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
the individual mandate. the requirement to purchase health care insurance. if you did

284
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,000
it happen through government programs or through your employer.

285
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
and this is far and away the most controversial component of the affordable. on

286
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:51,000
the requirements to buy health insurance and if you don't pay to pay up

287
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
um. so to him to help those individuals are

288
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:01,000
gonna have to buy insurance you didn't get it otherwise there were some government government assistance on the

289
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:06,000
through um the marketplace or health care exchanges. um

290
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,000
so that was the place where you could purchase um private insurance.

291
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I'm um we'll talk more about the changes in the second. um

292
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,000
but just also know that they're requiring everyone to have health insurance. offset

293
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:28,000
the cost uh on the dimension of the previous page um around um.

294
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:34,000
this is a um elimination of pop I'm letting people in the pre-existing condition

295
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
not been able to keep six because their plan give a individual mandate is gonna bring a lot of

296
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
healthy people into the insurance. just like bringing in all those

297
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
twenty nineteen to twenty six rules the twenty two just twenty six rolls previously have

298
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,000
health insurance. bringing those individual on the people 's plans

299
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
on the front more healthy people into the system. so more healthy people pain health

300
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,000
insurance or having health insurance is gonna offset some of those cost to insurers.

301
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,000
um the day. um we'll get having requiring him by and by

302
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
the requirements of the ACA man.

303
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:21,000
individual mandate or requirement the people have health insurance or pay check so I mean I guess far

304
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,000
away in the most controversial component of the affordable care

305
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,000
um I don't have an answer because there were some minor exceptions that again

306
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,000
you know because I mean just one she didn't know um there are some um

307
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
that everyone didn't include people who had either for display financial hardship on them through

308
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,000
a number of mechanisms. those who didn't had to Social Security for religious reasons. members

309
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:52,000
up a native American tribes. I document it in a grand um and people

310
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,000
who are uninsured for less than three months. so if you work out a job where you have

311
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:03,000
um insurance and then you lost your job or into to another job if it was just for a really

312
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,000
brief. uh that was a low I mean the affordable care act.

313
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,000
okay. I don't that's what the little bit more about these insurance marketplaces

314
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,000
for exchange. um. again he's places where individual

315
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:27,000
um and small employee groups could purchase private insurance plan

316
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,000
through an insurance so it's hard market it's hard

317
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:37,000
and exchange what it really is it's a website the and website where you can log

318
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:42,000
on and look at difference private insurance plans. then you can purchase

319
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
you could compare what they cover you compare their possible. you can get information about

320
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
that even see what the deductibles would be like with out of pocket cost work. I also think

321
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
they're really websites where you couldn't compare and contrast different help with

322
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,000
him. there is three different types of exchanges some states elected

323
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,000
she said up their own exchanges are. um the federal government

324
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:14,000
set up um in the exchange. um healthcare .gov. um and

325
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,000
then there are some that have a state and federal surfers the.

326
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,000
affordable care act. also provide in subsidies and tax credit offsets in the

327
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
hospital so for these individuals who have never had health insurance before

328
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,000
they had from their employer and now to go and purchase it or pay a penalty

329
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
because of the individual mandate. the affordable care act offers the subsidies and tax credits

330
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:46,000
offset these costs um and then tax

331
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,000
credits or the subsidies are available for individuals are who making up to four hundred percent of the

332
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,000
federal poverty level. sometimes abbreviated SPL um which is two

333
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,000
thousand nineteen. is up to almost fifty thousand dollars a year for an individual

334
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,000
superior individual. you're so twenty seven years old. you're working full-time

335
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,000
but you're working for a small business it doesn't happen as fewer than fifty people doesn't offer health care insurance.

336
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,000
you have to go into the marketplace. you have to go to buy private health insurance plan.

337
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:24,000
you're gonna get some either the subsidies or tax credits to help you to purchase that

338
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,000
private insurance because of the affordable care.

339
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:37,000
um. this is the amount that should you have a. I said there's a different kind of exchanges

340
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,000
a Federal and one of the state age ones in the partnership. I still see that most of

341
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
the states went with a federally facilitated far if you live in those days

342
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:53,000
you'll go to hold him to look at difference the plans are available to you.

343
00:31:53,000 --> 00:32:00,000
um but there are some um savings programs and some that are in that partnership.

344
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
um. okay. so before I move on and any of our

345
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:17,000
individual mandate exchanges. yes

346
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
the best. so the government sets or rates I'm

347
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,000
every year. um they consider the poverty the poverty line.

348
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,000
I'm so if you are a single individual. if they

349
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
said line the that says if you make this amount of money per year for

350
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,000
last you're below this is that they caught the poverty line. the federal poverty

351
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:48,000
line. um and that um that amount of money

352
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
per year. based on a number of factors. um the most significant factors.

353
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:59,000
we're um in how many people are in your family. um. so um. if you

354
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,000
have if you're a single individual. the Gerald how are you writing or how

355
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,000
much you can make per year and consider below that line um

356
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,000
is much lower than if you have four people in your family or five people in your family or six people in your family

357
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,000
in the future so also to the difference between an individual and a family of course you can kinda get us

358
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,000
killed him. so that's another and then the line is it is perfect every

359
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:31,000
year by the federal government. um to be over the four hundred

360
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,000
percent of bob. mean you could be so many degrees over make so much more than the federal

361
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,000
poverty line and still get a subsidy. so they said the line

362
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
is four hundred percent would be solved that line. a degree of some injuries above that

363
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,000
line versus making less. so if you're

364
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,000
in individual. again twenty nineteen. who made a four hundred and forty

365
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,000
thousand dollars forty eight thousand dollars a year. you're not a poverty you're not

366
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,000
below the poverty line but that's the line up said that much more you can get the hell cares

367
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:14,000
if you Google Federal poverty line they'll probably give you much work. I just tell FedEx collision than I did

368
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:19,000
um but it but it is just the wind up kinda differentiates who's out of different income levels and then different

369
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,000
social programs are available to you if you're a books below the line or certain percentage

370
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,000
of below the line have a little bit um

371
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
one thing and then they said probably like does not take into account um. believe I this is

372
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,000
still true. 's geography right. so they said this line of like

373
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
if you make you know fourteen thousand if you if

374
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,000
you're if you're below the five whole time line if you make twelve thousand dollars a year. that's the case whether you live

375
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,000
in Detroit and Ann Arbor in Manhattan in San Francisco or Tulsa Oklahoma.

376
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
so even though the cost of living is really different in those places. the Federal hobby line is the same so

377
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
it's not impacted by geography which is pretty wack. okay

378
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:20,000
other questions. yes

379
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
yeah this is the seventies and the tax credits are supposed to pop that that's what costs are making

380
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,000
sure I insurance plan more affordable. so I get any individual mandate you have to

381
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
have insurance or you pay check a totally um that

382
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:41,000
tax penalty. that's how when formal characters pass that was how it was

383
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,000
passed that you had to purchase insurance. if depending on how much money you made in the federal

384
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:51,000
government would help you purchase that would give you some money or tax credits to do that. if you choose not to do

385
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,000
that you pay a tax on sexy the idea of the individual.

386
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:17,000
okay question yes

387
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:23,000
yes yes and it's those who kind of cut up the marketplace who's running that website

388
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and then if you had um. if you have a state if you have a state needs exchange states

389
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,000
can um put more restrictions um and like.

390
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:39,000
so if your estimate exchange and you can may have requirements that are

391
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:44,000
over and above kind of what the Federal requirements are for your for health

392
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
insurers in your state to be listed on that chain. I I think I have a slide in

393
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:56,000
a minute else just tell you a little bit more about that

394
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:01,000
there for us. okay. greatly move forward.

395
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:07,000
um okay. so um ask you um talked about the

396
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
um the role of public programs entitled to excuse me I thought the role of public programs

397
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
where we're not gonna talk about um the um what do you promote characters

398
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:22,000
about the Indian health service or community health centers. we're gonna focus specifically on watch this

399
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:28,000
channel. looking for is barbaric that around Medicaid

400
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Medicaid expansion is the central component of the affordable care for

401
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,000
those people who have who have heard about the affordable character then another set you probably heard about the individual

402
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:44,000
mandate and you might've heard about the Medicaid expansion. um.

403
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,000
so again um before the affordable care act.

404
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,000
granddaughter she didn't have children. you were not eligible for Medicaid. no matter

405
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,000
how old or you were doing a follow here come November what percent

406
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,000
below the federal poverty line you were if you were in Charlotte adults weren't eligible for Medicaid

407
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:12,000
um. and again before you for both care the amount of hot bridge um

408
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,000
so how much um you were reading how much coverage you got with based on various

409
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:23,000
other categories or in different categories of coverage. if you were um

410
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:28,000
if you were an adult you had a child that was on Medicaid or the children's health

411
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,000
insurance plan. you got some Medicaid coverage but only about twenty five percent coverage.

412
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:39,000
um Benny on the pattern where are you and you got some coverage for Medicaid but

413
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:44,000
not very much before the affordable care. after

414
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,000
the affordable care act so as easy a Medicaid will cover everyone under

415
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:55,000
a hundred thirty three percent of the federal poverty since

416
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
twenty nineteen. the Federal hobby line for an individual with the round of sixteen thousand dollars

417
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,000
for a family of four it was just over thirty three so so were

418
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,000
you are an individual in twenty nineteen and you make fifteen thousand dollars

419
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,000
a year for. life you're eligible.

420
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,000
so I mean friend my family here. so

421
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
all floors. I don't

422
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:41,000
care how they were having to

423
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:54,000
move all my hair

424
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,000
so there were so many special categories if you had been sick he's been sick for a long time. if

425
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:05,000
you live in specific states Medicaid maybe more generous in that state. I mean the statue

426
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,000
class last week Medicaid is that partnership between the states and the federal government.

427
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,000
so it is generally true that childless adults were covered under Medicaid and true in

428
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:20,000
most states. um but not and all that. but after the affordable

429
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,000
care act. I mean affordable care act requires him that Medicaid

430
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,000
be expanded and everyone Allstate. um under a hundred thirty

431
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:37,000
percent of the federal poverty line. would have access to.

432
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
again this is how the affordable care act was was written and was passed

433
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:50,000
and and then I had to tell you why is it really true anymore but this is how it was an accident or Missus

434
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,000
okay. questions about this concept the Medicaid expansion

435
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,000
so that they feel was that it it really brought in on the availability you know they paid

436
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:16,000
people that were previously not able to receive help and he's

437
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,000
a message to families and yes I am interested and live the in Visa without the member

438
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,000
family talked about these categories of individuals. so if you were

439
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:32,000
um. hey. for someone who had been and on the long

440
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:38,000
term disability. you had a Medicaid coverage but it only

441
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,000
covered about fifty percent of your care for seventy five percent of your care

442
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:49,000
versus a hundred percent of your care if you were a parent who had a child

443
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:54,000
who was on Medicaid or on on a ship

444
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,000
you got Medicaid but only covered twice one eight five percent a year else. so if you had

445
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:04,000
if you were in these special categories. I'm got some Medicaid

446
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:09,000
coverage but then after the affordable care act. there's this there's no

447
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,000
event you're in category but not in this category here this kind of on that category it's

448
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:19,000
everyone who meets the income qualification. has Medicaid

449
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:33,000
and get a hundred percent coverage under Medicaid. 's that clarified

450
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:38,000
the specific reason other than just like not really feeling

451
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,000
like like there wouldn't I didn't here then you should be working right and that it it if you didn't

452
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
have kids and you were um and you were healthy

453
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:54,000
long-term disability categories um you are under age sixty five didn't qualify

454
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,000
for Medicare. you should be working that mostly

455
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:14,000
true.

456
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:32,000
those

457
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,000
people who just feel bad like you know you're not deserving otherwise.

458
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:46,000
okay. other questions

459
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:51,000
okay. other features of the affordable care act that I want to know beyond okay.

460
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,000
and the better reforms for employers for individuals for the insurance companies in the Medicaid

461
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,000
expansion. I wanted to mention the essential health benefits package.

462
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,000
on the citizens of Service uh and set up ten kind of categories

463
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:12,000
of services that health insurance plans must holler. I mean if you wanna

464
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,000
give your health insurance plan he wants to be on those marketplaces are on these exchanges.

465
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:23,000
you have to cover these types of services. um.

466
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,000
so that's the essential health benefits package. um that was something that didn't exist before a health

467
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
insurance company. um could offer you know they can say it's you know we offer emergency

468
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,000
services and we offer care for television care.

469
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:43,000
so we're not gonna cover. we're not gonna cover care for mom or we were maybe

470
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:49,000
or we're not gonna cover prescription drugs or we're not gonna talk we're gonna gonna do a lot of services

471
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:54,000
so well talking for needing the nice evening. not allowed after

472
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,000
the affordable care act. because of all of the services are now part of the essential benefits package.

473
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:06,000
um another feature. the fireworks tracked on that the limit you and want out of

474
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,000
pocket spending on that account on up for individuals but

475
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:17,000
if you have insurance. everyone pay the deductible or deductible in the amount of money

476
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,000
you paid each month to have your health care insurance. people also have

477
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,000
copayments which is how much money that you have to pay when you go to the

478
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:32,000
doctors office or a hospital. so um for example um.

479
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:38,000
um I you know I had my health insurance to the University of Michigan.

480
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,000
I had a a money small amount of money each month um to

481
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,000
uh to um go towards the cost of make here

482
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
hi. go see what they kids get sick and I take them to the pediatrician.

483
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
most of that pops up here paid for by my health insurance but I have to

484
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:05,000
pay twenty five dollars each visit with my sister that's

485
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:13,000
payment twenty five dollars to see their pediatrician. my kids are sick and

486
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,000
my kids are sick and I take them to the emergency room that whole payment is a

487
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,000
hot. I have to pay a hundred dollars and take my kids to the emergency room still

488
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:29,000
where some of these emergency to raise the legs um. I have to pay more that copayment is

489
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:34,000
higher. so it would be affordable care act to do is they accounts put

490
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,000
on the amount of money for people would have to pay out of pocket each

491
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,000
year. so for the individual health plan. people would

492
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,000
have to pay more than fifty thousand dollars a year. 's. family.

493
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:55,000
you know those numbers are still hot having

494
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:00,000
to pay. if I had to pay up to sixteen thousand dollars a year between deductibles could and payments

495
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:06,000
are some people insurance. that's a lot of money but it's the feeling that it's

496
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,000
hard affordable care act or whether the count people who have to keep paying the

497
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:17,000
deductible. does have to pay higher deductibles or a large kind came

498
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:22,000
is um crazy affordable care act verbal the character with discount. I'm out of pocket spending

499
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:29,000
how much I have to spend when I go to see a

500
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
city they're just chewing additional features of the affordable care act to improvements in health care

501
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:39,000
and hope you're spending um that were enacted by any

502
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:46,000
questions about.

503
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,000
okay. so the form of care. also have some things that I wanna just mention

504
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:57,000
around the house like house. um the affordable care act mandated insurance

505
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:02,000
plans cover and made preventive services. um there's a number of

506
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:07,000
those types of services. looking for food things like you need is they should smoking

507
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,000
cessation counseling cancer screams um. so insurance plans if if

508
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,000
there's good evidence. um well except the scientific evidence of preventive services.

509
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,000
we care about prevention in half in public health. if there's good evidence

510
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:28,000
runs that many insurance plans have to come

511
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,000
the for what character also lets the create a mandated um provided for the creation of

512
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:39,000
the prevention and public health fund and that was really the nation first

513
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:44,000
dedicated federal federal funding that's focused on prevention research around preventing

514
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,000
research around prevention hundred dollars on prevention I am too that's another

515
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
positive thing and it also created the national prevention health promotion

516
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
and public health consults um which is charged with promoting healthy

517
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:06,000
policies and establishing a national prevention and health promotion stress

518
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,000
you can go on the Department of Health and Human Services website and see with that strategy is.

519
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:16,000
so that that counseling is it. they published a strategy. I mean you can read about it

520
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:21,000
online. because these are just a few of the ways that the affordable care

521
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:34,000
act um draft the prevention and in some of the tools that we have in public

522
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:41,000
questions about any of that before I move. on

523
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:46,000
okay. so many comic in the near they have accomplishing a little bit of what I can hold you um because

524
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I don't you know there's been some challenges to the affordable care act at multiple levels.

525
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:56,000
I see a moral military character has been controversial and politically divisive.

526
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:01,000
um there have been efforts at sea level the federal level.

527
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:06,000
um trying to challenge different components the requirements of

528
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,000
the affordable care. um and it's been controversial before was passed in that

529
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:17,000
kind of in the conversations around it. um it was been times original after it passed

530
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:25,000
the written media and legal challenges. um and those are ongoing

531
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:30,000
um so the first challenge that really made it to up the Supreme Court

532
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:35,000
um uh with a rule from two thousand and twelve. um

533
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,000
and it address to choose most controversial components of the affordable cartridges the individual

534
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:46,000
mandate in the Medicare. um in this case on the supreme court

535
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,000
ruled in a five to four decision I'm so very split decision. um that the penalties

536
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,000
and pose with the individual mandate where I am they were attacked

537
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:03,000
and so we were allowed well under there. I got government authorities to

538
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,000
um to Texas to â€¦ to tax so um individual

539
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:14,000
mandate penalties the individuals were required to take if they don't purchase health insurance.

540
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,000
um that was considered a attack and then when the loan um. so

541
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:25,000
it's just part of that's the preferred decision. um was reaffirmed

542
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:30,000
kind of what President Obama and the Democrat members of congress have been saying

543
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,000
um that Medicaid the expansion was um was within the constitutional

544
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,000
authority but um I and also

545
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:46,000
um rules requiring Medicaid expansion was unconstitutional. um

546
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,000
because um as the affordable care act was written um if the states did

547
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:57,000
not expand Medicaid then they would lose their existing Medicaid funding

548
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:03,000
right so medicated funded in partnership state funding and federal

549
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
funding and the way the affordable care act was written. if you don't

550
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:14,000
expand Medicaid. if you don't get rid of those categories if you don't expanded to childless adults.

551
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,000
if you notice and Medicaid. the federal government is taking away funds

552
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:25,000
um. so I'm as a result of so that's up in course of that was um

553
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:31,000
that was course that was unconstitutional um and so they got rid of the requirements

554
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:36,000
the states expanded Medicaid they made a choice to follow

555
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:45,000
the Supreme Court ruling states are allowed to choose whether or not.

556
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,000
's is really a complicated decision I again I I'm one hand held in the

557
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:56,000
legality or the constitutionality of the uh the individual Mandy. but

558
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:03,000
it struck down the requirement to the states expands Medicare

559
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:11,000
questions about that leaner were kind of the locations and that yeah

560
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:16,000
I've got slide a a second but it's a thirty seven thirty eight. thank you depending

561
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:25,000
on whether you have a easy as a state.

562
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:30,000
I believe they were my idea they were there for the same date they were kinda got

563
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,000
in another the same case. yes president.

564
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:40,000
yes there have um and another other challenge to be

565
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,000
more like you're actually another one that has stuff the are gone to the Supreme Court. I was keen versus

566
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Burwell in twenty fifteen. um where the supreme court rules and eleven

567
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,000
divided decisions that people more eligible for subsidies or tax credit. whether or

568
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:01,000
not they bought their insurance on the state for a Federal exchange um and

569
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,000
so um the people who were arguing um against the

570
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:12,000
affordable character in this case. um said because of the spirit any specific language

571
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,000
in the affordable care act in their twenty four hundred page document. they focus on basically two sentences

572
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,000
and the argumentative a while this base on those two sentences

573
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:29,000
people who lost their insurance policies via the Federal exchange

574
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:34,000
which I think obvious most states those individuals wouldn't be eligible for

575
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
a tax subsidy or a tax credit. that's three parts I

576
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:44,000
don't know if we're not I had to be able to everyone in regards to State Farm.

577
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:49,000
but if they would have if they would've made a decision the other way they would've said that you could only

578
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:55,000
get assessed to your tax credit. if your state. if you had a state base exchange that would have further

579
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,000
eroded people ability to purchase health insurance plan um

580
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,000
on that on the individual marketplace. so this is this is a win again for the affordable care

581
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:12,000
act and supporters of the federal of the affordable care.

582
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:19,000
so this is the news channels on our topic is

583
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:25,000
how many options the people have on the um uh city changes.

584
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:30,000
I think so in some states it varies by state and has buried over

585
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:36,000
the ten years of the affordable care act how many different insurance companies are offering plans

586
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:41,000
and how many different stations are offering. so there are some states where there

587
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:46,000
are now what insurance for my friend one way undermine change a so there isn't much.

588
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:55,000
um but there are other things with many more insurance companies and insurance plans are available

589
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
okay. so this is the other challenge demeaning to the Supreme Court level um. there have been dozens

590
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
of other efforts um to repeal or to repeal and replace

591
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
Obamacare um when I was preparing for the lecture us and like many other and

592
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:16,000
um there was one thing they told me there but fifty before there was another the say the sixties is not

593
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
as an over seventy um. so I just um the dozens of others

594
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:27,000
to repeal larger in appeal a place Obamacare. many of these so

595
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:32,000
my comrades were having when um. President Obama was in office. so

596
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:37,000
they were largely symbolic he clearly was going to be tell anything we came to him. um

597
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:42,000
but um after President Trump came his office there were a lot more concerns about

598
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:47,000
him and there was a near Mass. um where

599
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:52,000
is that the last time zone on this I think was it was the decision was forty nine fifty one.

600
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,000
um fever and and they wanted not to repeal it um

601
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:02,000
but it was closed to him and some of the Republicans who voted for affordable

602
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:08,000
care act based a lot of political pressure because a lot of of the big local pressure um

603
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:15,000
some of those have had challenges the center around you. bye.

604
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:20,000
um so a lot of challenges to the affordable care act um because it has been

605
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:25,000
place

606
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:31,000
pretty good except for him and then we'll see what I have for us.

607
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,000
okay. so we're in our military today. I was to be aware of alternative to the successful

608
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
in reducing the number of uninsured American um and the exact

609
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:48,000
number of Americans has kinda shifted depending what you read um and had

610
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:53,000
changed over time but we're gonna go with the round thirty million individuals have skinny

611
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:58,000
because insurance of the affordable care most of those received insurance

612
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,000
um because of the Medicaid expansion because they've been allowed

613
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:09,000
to have purchase privacy or plan. um with the help of those necessities

614
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:14,000
um for the men able to stay on their parents until and their twenties and this and this graph

615
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,000
shows how the number um and a raise uninsured

616
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,000
individuals is going down from two thousand and eight. um

617
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:31,000
two two thousand. um the number has the

618
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:36,000
the number of people the percentage of people who are uninsured and for you to go off a little bit more.

619
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:42,000
I mean see that between twenty sixteen and twenty seventeen and when have to finish. um

620
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:47,000
it's got a bit more and I'll talk about why didn't a minute. um but overall

621
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:52,000
if the school and the affordable care act was to expand insurance coverage is

622
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:59,000
access to care. um the portal charges the successful you know

623
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:05,000
um but the majority of the state um do choose to expand Medicaid

624
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:10,000
um the basic stretch expanded our um

625
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:18,000
and the states sure not to expand um are in Orange.

626
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:24,000
anyone wanna file the gas and some similarities between those not the delicacy

627
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:31,000
besides geography

628
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:37,000
republican daughter republican governors have a um

629
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:42,000
have been unwilling in almost all cases um to to expand

630
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:47,000
Medicaid um Kentucky is a little bit of an interesting situation

631
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:52,000
um when the affordable care our um with how they had a democratic

632
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:58,000
governor and they have policies on January

633
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:03,000
they'll have a democratic governor again so they switch back and forth around there than a lot of the second in

634
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:08,000
dynamic space in terms of um anything around the Medicaid expansion.

635
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:14,000
I mean Kentucky. um but for the most part states where

636
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:21,000
there have been republican governors have not been

637
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,000
um millions more people covered in those states

638
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:31,000
with republican governors association. side if they chose to expand Medicaid and this is a

639
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:37,000
slide. I'm taking from the Kaiser family foundation shows the seventy percent

640
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:42,000
of uninsured adults um could be eligible for Medicaid um

641
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:47,000
if just for the state of Texas Florida Georgia and North Carolina

642
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:52,000
so of they've course expanded Medicaid um over four

643
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:58,000
point five million the people be who could receiving healthcare coverage that are correct.

644
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:03,000
um. so who are those uninsured individuals so we know that there are some people

645
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:09,000
who enjoy some insurance or low income individuals can for medical expanded.

646
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:15,000
those were unable to afford coverage in the marketplace still undocumented

647
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,000
immigrants and documented immigrants who've been living in the United States for less than five years.

648
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:26,000
they're not they are many of them are still insured insurance.

649
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:31,000
um. so certainly the extent of the affordable care act. if it would have been

650
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:39,000
rolled out as originally intended to have the Supreme Court or not um

651
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:44,000
uh it had be before and not allowed to take to choose

652
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I involved in or opt out of the Medicaid coverage um many more million Americans

653
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:54,000
would have helped. so the Supreme Court um

654
01:01:54,000 --> 01:02:00,000
but also she could still be covered even with keeping part out for the spring course really um

655
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:07,000
governors in the states just such a

656
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:12,000
and this is in the absence pulling data from about the last I you know ten in

657
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:17,000
two thousand and nineteen. um around a kind

658
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:22,000
of public use this of affordable care act. um so do you generally have a favorable

659
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,000
or unfavorable opinions. up with the affordable care act.

660
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,000
um so you can see kind of house support has changed

661
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:38,000
over time. um but in general supports are favorable opinions

662
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:43,000
to the moral card has increased um. as of today. um there is

663
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:48,000
there's more support for it today. when it was originally passed um there last

664
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:54,000
um. I'm sorry. well sorry here way. I'm

665
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:59,000
a sorry read um. I don't be here I think the role of unions

666
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:04,000
um and then there's a number of individuals in Philadelphia.

667
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,000
um. also interesting than most Americans and that

668
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:14,000
is kinda mean to say I like I go I don't know. yes. um part of

669
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,000
the whole really looks at their opinions on American opinions on specific provisions and

670
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,000
the specific things I talked about. and and break this out if. I am political

671
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:30,000
party. um and so these are the percentage of individuals in each political party.

672
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:36,000
have a favorable opinion. so the top line. um a lot of

673
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:41,000
young adults to standard parents insurance plans until twenty sixteen so overall

674
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:46,000
each percent of Americans have of those surveyed have a favorable opinion of that ninety

675
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:51,000
percent Democrat eighty two percent of independent sixty percent fifty

676
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:57,000
six percent can respond um. so still see

677
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,000
America 's even your friend affiliation but overall most Americans have

678
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:07,000
a very positive impression. a favorable opinion of that provision the of law. um.

679
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:13,000
you can look at he's on your own. um but um all of the provisions they talked about

680
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,000
with the exception but increasing the Medicare payroll tax for any for

681
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:23,000
upper-income Americans um that was not popular among Republicans. everything

682
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:29,000
else has done the majority of Republicans surveyed in this opinion

683
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:34,000
pool had a favorable impression of us permission. so if overtime

684
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,000
or support for the bill overall. and when you look at least see specific provision

685
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:45,000
the favorable opinion from Americans as possible

686
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:50,000
verify party but the majority some people uh

687
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:55,000
my friend in town. um see spewing in and had significantly

688
01:04:55,000 --> 01:05:00,000
weakens the affordable here. um I I

689
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:05,000
walk a little bit of my wording on this but he's effectively eliminated the individual mandate and

690
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:11,000
I say that because um if you size of I said in the is in the middle management

691
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:16,000
that you had to be insured. purchases or household insurance

692
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:22,000
okay I house that penalty no longer exists

693
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:28,000
there is no longer a Federal half penalty for not having insurance.

694
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,000
some states I have a penalty but there's no more no longer if federal tax

695
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:38,000
penalty for not having health care insurance. so

696
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:44,000
he's effectively eliminate the individual mandate um

697
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:49,000
President Trump is a support um work requirement for many many various

698
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:54,000
beneficiaries for Medicaid benefit um you have to

699
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,000
work to work so many hours you had to be in school. um not been the case

700
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:06,000
in previous administrations that something that President Trump supports

701
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:11,000
um he's ended subsidies to ensure and participating in the exchanges so you have to question

702
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:17,000
about how many uh how what kinda lost if you know how far the release plan

703
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:23,000
the federal government is providing some incentive in the form of subsidies to health insurance companies

704
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:28,000
to get ahead participating in the marketplace to get them to see um she just the people wouldn't

705
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:33,000
have choice there would be options you're used to be some federal government support

706
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:40,000
for that whereas insurance care company. so this insurance companies present has illuminated that

707
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:46,000
um. he also has list a um I eliminated assistance to navigate

708
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:51,000
those marketplaces of the top care changes to the used to be a number of things so they're used to

709
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:56,000
be when President Obama was in office. um there was a lot of federal government um

710
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:01,000
support financial support for advertising when people to sign up for in the health insurance

711
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:06,000
plans you can sign up now to make changes to your plans now. if the specific. it's called open

712
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:12,000
enrollment federal government no longer advertises for that report other and funding

713
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,000
having cut so people don't know that when when they have an opportunity if you make us to

714
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,000
their health care um in the original version of the affordable care act also provided

715
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:27,000
funding for something called healthcare navigator. so they were people um like

716
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:33,000
basically a hotline one eight hundred number that you can call and say hi my family.

717
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:38,000
I need to purchase a health insurance plan the state Michigan of if you help me figure out when I home and figure

718
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:43,000
out how it was cost. can you tell me if you're would be best for me. cities versus these are

719
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
positions that people had available upon hearing that would be and out of people 's job to help

720
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,000
people figure out how to navigate their are options for the health insurance. there's

721
