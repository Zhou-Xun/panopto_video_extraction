1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,100
Here. We're going to try a lot of different things.

2
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:33,080
Okay. Let's go over to this number eight. So the first question asked to the following individuals would be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome.

3
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:40,670
And I had to put a note here and I looked all over for recommendations in terms of the metabolic syndrome

4
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:47,209
criteria for non-binary and transgender individuals in regards to waist circumference thresholds.

5
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:57,350
And I could not find this information. So you should also know that there are some modest differences in regard to

6
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,990
thresholds that are used in the United States and those that are used elsewhere.

7
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:08,570
Following recommendations from the International Diabetes Federation, slightly different.

8
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:15,529
The main difference is the threshold for weight circumference for ethnic populations,

9
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:21,979
Asians in particular, where the threshold for waist circumference is a little bit lower.

10
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,720
For men, it's like 90. For women, it's less than eight centimeters.

11
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:29,300
So those are some differences.

12
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:40,850
But I gave you the excuse the United States and I gave you the five different criteria for metabolic syndrome, and I gave you four different examples.

13
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:49,370
And the correct answer was, A, we had a male with a waist circumference of 1.5.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,750
So one or two is the threshold. And you had fasting blood glucose, you had a 101.

15
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:07,610
If we put them in the prediabetes range, which would put them in that which is another syndrome and a box and no risk factor of HDL cholesterol.

16
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,739
38 This is below the threshold of 40. And then they have a normal blood pressure.

17
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,340
So they have it satisfied.

18
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:26,270
In this particular example, three or more criteria for metabolic syndrome on the other three, not three.

19
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:36,649
And then the second question that asks the differences is a function of visceral adipose tissue and

20
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:43,010
subcutaneous adipose tissue adipose in regards to their function in storing triglycerides and expansion.

21
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,620
What changes would you expect to see in women after the menopause transition?

22
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:56,630
Remember, after menopause transition, you see a significant reduction in circulating estrogen.

23
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:06,770
And this affects the ability of the adipose tissue now to take up triglycerides in the subcutaneous compartment.

24
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:18,380
So the correct answer here is D see an increase in adipocyte hypertrophy, hypoxia and fibrosis within the visceral adipose tissue compartment.

25
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:24,140
Okay. Last example.

26
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:30,700
With regard to the stability of being metabolically healthy with obesity, which of the following statement this is true?

27
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:41,930
And so here you have four different answers results from the Whitehall study clear demonstration that about be healthy obese is stable.

28
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:52,250
No, that's not true. People with a BMI of 30 or greater are likely to have one or less metabolic syndrome components.

29
00:03:53,030 --> 00:04:05,540
And I remember this example where the majority have more than one in terms of metabolic syndrome components.

30
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:18,320
That's why that's not correct. Answer But you have three people with a BMI of 35 and are more likely to have more than one metabolic syndrome.

31
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,880
That was the correct answer. Okay.

32
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:30,409
Are there any questions about who is number eight? Yeah, I'm just a little confused on the last one.

33
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,739
I think I kind of look at the slide to make an ask after class if there was

34
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:40,100
a slide that talked about having less than two metabolic or any components.

35
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,790
So that's why I was confused between C and D.

36
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:50,710
So yeah, I can I don't remember right now where it was in the slide, but I was very confused on that one.

37
00:04:50,840 --> 00:05:03,740
Yeah, the confusion comes into part in that in terms of the number of components and I talked about here one or less and in this particular example.

38
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:08,209
Right, and that the slide had less than three were not less than or equal to two.

39
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:11,320
So I think that would have been one. I see what you're talking about.

40
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:17,360
You're talking about this. I don't think it was the items.

41
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,140
I don't remember the one that you held, which was to one person.

42
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:31,430
Yeah. And Charterhouse and BMI. Metabolic health and BMI is the title.

43
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,469
20. It was slide 23 of lecture 50 and.

44
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,420
Oh yeah. Different, different papers use different part.

45
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,719
Yeah. It said metabolically and healthy, metabolically healthy.

46
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,050
Their BMI greater than or equal to 30 and then less than two like.

47
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:04,020
So in this particular example, they said either one or less or zero.

48
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:14,370
And then there's one example for this one paper was two or less or two greater than or equal to less than two to be considered healthy.

49
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,760
And that one particular example that would be the abnormal, that metabolically healthy with less food scales,

50
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:32,070
not less than our right or left and promote about healthy or I'm looking at a different again of a I 23 eat a lecture 15 though.

51
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,690
Oh, lecture 15. Sorry, we lecture 15.

52
00:06:55,930 --> 00:07:06,260
Culture. Yes, I'm 23.

53
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:18,290
It's like a really small print on the right. That one.

54
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:25,910
Yeah, this on the very bottom where it says obese, metabolically healthy BMI greater than 30 and less than two.

55
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:33,930
In this particular paper. Yeah. So this is a criteria for this particular example.

56
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,780
So that's why you have it? Yes. Okay. I know what you mean.

57
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,780
Like why the other one might be right, but it's just that part.

58
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:55,080
Right? That's right. The problem with this term, metabolically healthy obesity in terms of and metabolic health have to do with how we define it.

59
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,510
You know, what are we is there a standard definition?

60
00:07:57,990 --> 00:08:07,590
And it appears that there's some confusion in terms of what the value really means in terms of the number of metabolic syndrome components.

61
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:16,980
Okay. Talk about type two diabetes now.

62
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:27,809
So today the learning objectives are to you should be able to explain the differences between the different types of diabetes,

63
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:37,500
type one, type two and gestational diabetes. And then there's this category that has been added on relatively recently called pre-diabetes.

64
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,520
And it's a risk factor for for type two diabetes.

65
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:47,580
You should be able to describe the tests that are used to diagnose diabetes.

66
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,890
You should describe the prevalence symptoms and complications of diabetes,

67
00:08:53,580 --> 00:09:02,430
and then describe the mechanisms by which excess adiposity impairs insulin secretion and increases insulin resistance in muscle and liver.

68
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:12,180
And then finally, in a multiple choice questions, you should be able to identify the drugs used to treat Type two diabetes.

69
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:21,689
Many graduates of our program become diabetes educators and are working with people who are on various drugs to treat type two diabetes.

70
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:28,350
So this is something that you will learn a great deal about if you decide that this is your career path.

71
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,680
So there's a long history of diabetes mellitus going back to ancient history.

72
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,270
Diabetes comes from the Greek meaning to siphon or to pass through,

73
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:51,240
and colitis has to do with the sensory characteristics of in this case, it's urine.

74
00:09:51,270 --> 00:10:03,690
This is gross. But in antiquity and in the Roman era, after Roman times, people used to keep urns of urine on the streets.

75
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:08,880
Like people would like empty their chamber pots with urine and people would use it to whiten their teeth.

76
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:13,530
And it was noticed that certain people had sweet taste in urine.

77
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:24,390
And this discovery is how people learned about diabetes from the presence of glucose.

78
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:31,530
And as in in India, in ancient India,

79
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:37,679
it made a diagnosis on whether or not somebody had diabetes based on whether

80
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,280
or not ants were attracted to the urine of the individual who was affected.

81
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:48,600
So if ants were attracted to the urine, it usually meant that there was a high level of glucose in that urine.

82
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,970
And that was something that was used as as a diagnostic tool in ancient times.

83
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:07,020
So in terms of the seriousness of conditions, the leading cause of death in the United States and I posted a video on diabetes in Samoa.

84
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,160
Did you watch that movie? A few of you did.

85
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:18,450
It's the leading cause of death in Samoa now, and this is a very serious condition.

86
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:31,590
Let's stop that right there. So here are the different categorizations based on the different diagnostic tools.

87
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:41,820
So the one that is used clinically as a long term test and I'll revisit this is the hemoglobin A-1 C test.

88
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:52,409
So to be diagnosed with diabetes based on this test, you'd have to have a 6.5% value or above for prediabetes.

89
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:57,719
You're kind of in the range in between normal and prediabetic diabetes.

90
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:03,120
So the hemoglobin A1 C would be 5.7 to 6.4%.

91
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:12,210
And then if you are below 5.7%, you would be considered having normal applied glucose based on this diagnostic criteria.

92
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:21,929
Yeah. So as far as it goes before you say diabetes mellitus, but so is it are in the leading cause of death in the US?

93
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:27,810
Does that include both type one and type two or all cases that obese and in Samoa.

94
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,350
Same thing. So it's all one. Yeah.

95
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:34,139
I'll show you I'll show you a slide in a minute here.

96
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:41,360
That breaks down the number of people with type one versus type two autoimmune and not related to obesity at all.

97
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,270
Yes. I hope we'll get to that here in a minute. Okay.

98
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:51,300
There's another test that's been used and this is a little more straightforward.

99
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,500
This was done before we had a hemoglobin A-1 C test.

100
00:12:56,190 --> 00:13:02,700
So the hemoglobin A1 C test was for long term glucose homeostasis is an indicator of fasting.

101
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:07,520
Blood glucose is the night before you go to see your primary care physician for a checkup.

102
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:16,430
They tell you to not eat anything. For at least 12 hours before your visit and the morning you arrive.

103
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:25,560
They do a blood sample, and if your fasting blood glucose exceeds this threshold, it's 126 milligrams per deciliter.

104
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,810
You would have the diagnosis. Now, they wouldn't just base it on that one particular visit.

105
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:39,270
They would have to go back and redo it again. They would want to make sure if it was truly a fasting blood glucose sample and if on repeated

106
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,650
tests that they found this high level of fasting blood glucose might receive this diagnosis,

107
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:55,770
pre-diabetes in that in between that 100 to 125 milligrams per deciliter and then in the normal range would be 99 milligrams per deciliter or below.

108
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:02,120
And if you mentioned, I apologize, but so do they have to meet all three of these criteria in order to be diagnosed?

109
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:12,240
Just one, which is, I believe, just one. The biggest one of the most important ways that they diagnose in a follow up is this glucose tolerance test.

110
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,290
Okay. So some of these are screening tests.

111
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:23,490
And the glucose tolerance test is a way to test for our insulin sensitivity.

112
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:34,590
And in this case, they give you a bolus of glucose or you drink a high glucose containing actually dextrose containing liquid,

113
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:45,090
and you wait 2 hours and they measure your blood glucose and you're looking for a value that is above 200 for diabetes.

114
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:48,180
Prediabetes would be 140 to 199.

115
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:56,490
And if it's below 140 during this glucose tolerance test, you would be considered to have a normal blood glucose tolerance basis.

116
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,420
Okay. So let's look at these individually.

117
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:09,960
If you fasting blood glucose or measuring glucose after a 12 hour fasting hemoglobin, anyone seeing you're looking at location of hemoglobin.

118
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:17,760
Now, if you have a high level of circulating glucose, that glucose can be stuck to proteins.

119
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:27,090
In this case, it's hemoglobin. And I'll talk about a little bit about the advanced glycation products we talk about.

120
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,780
Consequences in terms of neuropathy and vascular issues.

121
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,330
So the hemoglobin A1 C is like the 3 to 6 month indicator.

122
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:49,140
In other words, if somebody has blood glucose was elevated during a long period of time, it will show up in the hemoglobin A1 C test.

123
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:59,470
It might not show up in the fast food blood glucose. So it's a measure of the average blood glucose during the last 2 to 3 months.

124
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:10,480
And this one is used as a more sensitive indicator of glucose homeostasis over the long term.

125
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:21,280
And if you have diabetes and you're being treated with a drug lifestyle program, this is something that's going to be monitored regularly.

126
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:28,930
So you would come in on a regular basis and have this measurement made up to see how effective the treatment program is.

127
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:38,380
Yeah. She was useful. Really quickly about this guy collusion in product.

128
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:44,320
So was this sugar is combined with protein and all of that.

129
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,250
Then will these still detect that chemicals?

130
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,540
So I don't understand your question.

131
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:58,910
So with the Glycation products advance and. The Age or the advanced glycation products.

132
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:07,880
This is something that happens when you have elevated circulating blood glucose and it's the protein that associates with.

133
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:13,430
In this case, it's it's the glucose itself is a glycated protein.

134
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:23,630
And so addressing the question about type one diabetes.

135
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,170
So here you have an illustration of what happens with type one diabetes.

136
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:40,370
So this is insulin dependent diabetes. And in this particular case, you have an autoimmune response that occurs in the pancreas.

137
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:46,639
And in this scenario, here you have islets of Langerhans.

138
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,860
You have several different types of cells secreting distinct types of hormones.

139
00:17:52,520 --> 00:18:01,130
We have the alpha cells secreting glucagon beta cells secreting insulin and the delta cells secreting somatic state.

140
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:08,760
If you were to take a section of these islets, Langerhans explain them for us.

141
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:13,210
It's like you'd find something that looks like this. Yes.

142
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:21,760
Listen, I let you have a lot of these cells here that are producing insulin in somebody who has type one diabetes.

143
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:27,050
It's an autoimmune response. In other words, their immune system attacks the island.

144
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:39,680
And here you have a cytotoxic T cell that for some reason recognizes the cell and kills it for reasons that are incompletely understood.

145
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:44,030
Exactly why this happens is not normal.

146
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:56,209
So there's some kind of antigen presentation that occurs that gets the cytotoxic T cell to recognize the cell as being problematic.

147
00:18:56,210 --> 00:19:02,780
So it eliminates and as a consequence, you have fewer and fewer cells that can produce insulin.

148
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:07,940
The other cells, the alpha cells in adults delta continue to produce their hormones.

149
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:18,770
But it's the lack of the beta cells now that occurs through this autoimmune destruction of it's not producing cells.

150
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:29,540
So here is a slide which has a cross section of the islets Langerhans And now you see many fewer cells that are capable of producing insulin.

151
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,360
So the stain here is for the BROWNSTEIN is here is for the insulin producing cells.

152
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:47,390
So it used to be referred to as juvenile diabetes and it would most commonly arises during childhood.

153
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:54,800
However, it can occur at any age. So you can have somebody who's who gets type one diabetes as an adult.

154
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,050
And again,

155
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:08,120
what distinguishes it from other types of diabetes is that it's an autoimmune destruction of the beta cells within the islands of Langerhans.

156
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,360
So you can't make insulin dependent on exorbitant insulin.

157
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:27,250
After this reaction occurs, the people can take injections of insulin or and if their insurance will cover it,

158
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:35,980
they have an indwelling insulin pump that monitors their blood glucose and secretes a certain level

159
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:45,670
of insulin into their blood throughout the day to carefully moderate their glucose homeostasis.

160
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:53,820
You know, in the fatty tissues for a reason.

161
00:20:55,440 --> 00:21:05,310
So you inject it in a tissue where you have a lot of tissue to to do the injection.

162
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,990
And that's typically done in the thigh. Yes. Some people do it at the time.

163
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:15,870
They can do it. You can do it here as well. It's it's a personal preference.

164
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:23,190
You want to do it in a tissue where there's a low expression or a lower expression of pain receptors.

165
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:28,650
So it's kind of in the hands, of course, you would want to do in an area where there's lots of tissue damage.

166
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,300
That's what can be done here. It can be done in your thigh, whatever your preferences.

167
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:40,530
So type one diabetes is rare in obesity, but it does it does occur.

168
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,740
Yeah. What was I know the alpha beta cell. What was the yellow one?

169
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:49,530
It's a it's a delta cell. Somatic fat and producing cells.

170
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:04,129
So prediabetes, the levels of blood glucose in a fasting blood glucose test don't reach that threshold.

171
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:10,400
But you're kind of in between having normal and an elevated blood glucose levels.

172
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:25,310
So here are the different values between 125 for fasting, blood glucose for hemoglobin, A1 C between 5.7 and 6.4%.

173
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:35,020
The important note here is that. Pre-diabetes almost always precedes the diabetes diagnosis.

174
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,320
So this is why every time you get a checkup,

175
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:46,059
they're going to check you for your glucose levels through one of the two to fasting hemoglobin

176
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,610
A1 C test to determine whether or not you're at risk of developing type two diabetes.

177
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:02,400
And here's an estimate. It's estimated that there are 80 million cases of prediabetes in the United States.

178
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:08,120
Some people know it, and a lot of people do not know that they are at risk based on this assessment.

179
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:16,280
So type two diabetes is an insulin resistant form of diabetes.

180
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:24,500
It's the most common. It accounts for 90 to 95% of all cases of diabetes.

181
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:36,860
So in this case, the ability of developing muscle, liver and adipose tissue to sense insulin declines.

182
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,390
And as a consequence,

183
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:51,170
there is an impaired ability for the skeletal muscle to take up because there's actually the liver actually produces or still goes into circulation.

184
00:23:51,170 --> 00:24:03,050
And this can aggravate the condition. And I'm sorry, I need to turn that off and then to post tissue.

185
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:11,330
There's also insulin insensitivity. And in this case, you have a condition in which there's inflammation within the adipose tissue,

186
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:13,970
particularly in the visceral adipose tissue compartment.

187
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:22,940
And there's more lipolysis, which compares the ability of the adipocytes now to take up circulating lipids.

188
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:28,310
And so these tissues become insulin resistant.

189
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:38,000
And you also have a long term effect occurring within the pancreas where there's an islet failure.

190
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:47,899
In other words, the beta cells within the pancreas can't keep up with producing enough insulin to make those tissues respond to the insulin.

191
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:54,260
So that produces more and more. And as a consequence, the function of the beta cells starts to decline,

192
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:02,360
the beta some mass starts to decline, and this is a product of insulin resistance.

193
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,900
The other thing that happens within the islets,

194
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:13,850
remember I told you they were the alpha cells and these are the cells that produce glucagon and glucagon increases blood through those levels.

195
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:22,430
And I think in the liver and these cells, their function is actually enhanced in this particular state.

196
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:31,280
So you have reduced glucose uptake, muscle liver deficits as a consequence of this insulin resistance state,

197
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,970
and you have increased hepatic glucose output.

198
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:45,410
You have increased adipocyte lipolysis and that the ability of these sites now to take up lipids in your meal in particular is impaired.

199
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:52,159
And then you have the pancreatic islet cell failure in sufficient insulin produced by the

200
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:58,550
beta cells and at the same time you have increased glucagon output from the alpha cells.

201
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:06,970
Okay. The third and last one I'm going to talk about is gestational diabetes.

202
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:18,490
This one develops during pregnancy. This stuff usually develops in 20 weeks during pregnancy.

203
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:29,890
There are all kinds of numbers in terms of the percentage of pregnancies that result in gestational diabetes.

204
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:42,390
So in the U.S., estimates range from 2 to 10%. After delivery, the diabetes and the person who's getting more results.

205
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:50,880
There are a number there are a number of risk factors. If you've had gestational diabetes in a previous birth, that's a risk factor.

206
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,990
If you've given birth to a baby who's a weight over £9, it's also a risk factor.

207
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:08,620
If you're overweight, if that's a risk factor and you're more than 25 years of age, that's a risk factor.

208
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:14,950
And if you have a family history of type two diabetes, that's another risk factor for gestational diabetes.

209
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:24,760
People who have polycystic ovary syndrome also have a greater risk of gestational diabetes.

210
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:39,880
And then there are risk factors associated with race and ethnicity, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans and Hispanic population.

211
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:50,920
These individuals would have a greater risk of diabetes and increase the risk of the infants infected on diabetes in life.

212
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:58,870
Can you say that against mother as having diabetes during pregnancy increase the risk of developing diabetes later in life?

213
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:04,200
Yes, that's the next slide. So what are the complications?

214
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:09,150
There are complications that it may affect the baby, an early preterm birth.

215
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:16,480
These are more common respiratory distress syndrome as a consequence of the preterm birth.

216
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:24,130
The lungs haven't developed completely so in preterm birth in regard to respiratory distress.

217
00:28:24,150 --> 00:28:28,230
You have lungs now that aren't producing enough surfactant.

218
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:38,190
And as a consequence, this impairs the ability of the alveoli within the baby to remain open after birth,

219
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:41,910
and they have a tendency to collapse or stick together.

220
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:45,570
And this is treated with surfactant.

221
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:51,120
So these preterm infants are given this surfactant and improves their gas exchange.

222
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,200
But this is a complication of of gestational diabetes.

223
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,370
After birth, right after birth,

224
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:11,290
the baby will experience hypoglycemia as a consequence of being exposed to a hyperglycemic environment during gestation.

225
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,840
So this is a conflict. Another complication to the baby after its work.

226
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:28,270
Perhaps they developed some insensitivity and problems with glucose homeostasis as a consequence of being in that environment during gestation.

227
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:34,690
And then they're at a greater risk of having obesity and type two diabetes later in life.

228
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:40,989
Yes, this was just across the percent of that.

229
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,820
Again, the blood sugar of the mother has presented to the baby.

230
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:50,680
The blood sugar. Yes. Can get into the placenta and pass into the baby circulation.

231
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,830
Yes. Which is point is. It is all of a sudden.

232
00:29:54,160 --> 00:30:04,900
Yes. And stillbirth is another complication of gestational diabetes mellitus.

233
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,590
So whether the complications to the person just giving birth on high blood pressure and pre

234
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:21,340
eclampsia because are serious elevated blood pressure levels that can be life threatening.

235
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:32,169
It will increase your your chances of needing to have a delivery by C-section and women who have

236
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:41,800
gestational diabetes have a 50% increase in their risk of developing type two diabetes later in life.

237
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:57,650
So let's say you show up to your primary care physician and they take a look at them

238
00:30:57,650 --> 00:31:01,550
and do a blood fasting blood glucose measurement and it comes back a little bit high.

239
00:31:02,990 --> 00:31:11,770
I mean, my high is that it exceeds the threshold for the level that would indicate diabetes.

240
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:17,390
They would call you back and they would ask you to take this or a bogus tolerance test.

241
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:23,510
This may also be done with women now are people who are pregnant, I should say.

242
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:37,390
And so this oral glucose tolerance test is a way to assess glucose or insulin sensitivity after you've taken a bolus of glucose.

243
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:42,410
So here's the drink. It's a 75 milliliters of the glucose.

244
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:48,020
You wait 2 hours and then you take a blood test.

245
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:57,320
And it was measured level, measured by an individual who has just one and sensitive will have elevated glucose over a longer period of time.

246
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,320
For people who have diabetes,

247
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:12,200
the plasma blood glucose after this consuming this high glucose drink remains elevated rates above 200 milligrams per deciliter after 2 hours.

248
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,570
It's somebody who has normal glucose homeostasis.

249
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:22,610
Their value for blood glucose or plasma glucose would go up.

250
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:32,750
We're after this particular challenge, but it would go down and it would go back into the normal range after 2 hours.

251
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:41,570
If it's less than 140, that would be said to have normal glucose levels after this particular challenge.

252
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:46,069
Yeah, I mean, they do like a one hour two first test.

253
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,790
You could do a three hour and fail the one hour. You know why?

254
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,940
It's what you would want to do. Different time. I think what they're looking for.

255
00:32:54,710 --> 00:33:01,670
So in terms of how many times they sampled. No, just like while one hour is done for some pregnant women versus a two hour.

256
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,600
You're getting a better value for the 100. Yeah, I don't know.

257
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:12,950
I don't know. I can't give you an accent. What I found is the case.

258
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:24,780
More samples are taken. You know, I think the question so the example here was with women who have suspected gestational diabetes.

259
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:29,120
The blood sampling occurs not at 2 hours, but earlier at a one hour time point.

260
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:33,500
Oh, yeah. So that has to do with the postprandial blood sugar.

261
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:38,030
So you see the peak at 1 to 2 hours.

262
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:44,420
So that's why there is a range there. So you may see a peak in some people one hour to 2 hours.

263
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,760
The other thing is that a lot of times you could have random blood sugar that is above 200.

264
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,060
And that can be enough for a diagnosis.

265
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:02,810
And then in combination with an emergency that you can get from a blood sample, from a CBC, a blood count.

266
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:12,050
You have yourself a diagnosed who nearly always goes with the oral glucose tolerance test, but it is the standard.

267
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:24,000
Thank you. So what are the trends and the diagnosis for diabetes?

268
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:33,870
So this is the number of the percentage of the US population diagnosed with diabetes between 1958 and 2015.

269
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:42,569
I tried to find the most recent trend and I could not find something more recent studies terms of it showing

270
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:48,540
this relationship between the percentage with diabetes and the year and the number with diabetes in millions.

271
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:59,760
As you can see, we have this dramatic increase in the percentage of individuals with diabetes and the number of people with diabetes.

272
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:18,370
So this is increasing. So the most recent national data Diabetes Statistical report that I found was 2020, while 2022 just came out.

273
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:24,610
And they're just filling in the data right now in the Centers for Disease Control website.

274
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:29,290
So the most recent data is from 2019.

275
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:38,760
So right now in 2019, the United States, there are 37 million people with diabetes.

276
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:42,420
This is now 11% of the U.S. population.

277
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:53,340
So there are 28.7 million people that have been diagnosed, including a 28.5 million adults.

278
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,230
So this is mostly the adult population. You will see this in children.

279
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:03,330
And a part of this estimate includes people who aren't diagnosed.

280
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:11,790
So this is an estimate, not eight and a half million people or 23% of adults are undiagnosed.

281
00:36:12,330 --> 00:36:18,330
It's expected that they would happen. In terms of numbers for pre-diabetes.

282
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:28,860
The number now is now 96 million people aged 18 years and older are thought to have pre-diabetes, which is about 38% of the U.S. population.

283
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,690
And when you look at people who are 65 years and older,

284
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:45,330
you find that about 26.4 million have prediabetes, or about 46%, 48% of this particular population.

285
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,060
And what number have type one diabetes?

286
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:58,470
It's a relative minority, about one in 1.6 million Americans who have type one diabetes.

287
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:06,570
So this dramatic increase that we've seen over the years is due to the increase in type two diabetes.

288
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:15,210
So the number is more than double the number of cases.

289
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:23,280
So this is a county level prevalence among adults between 2004 and 2019.

290
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:27,090
And this is again in U.S. adults 20 years and older.

291
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,960
Adjusted for age. County level data.

292
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:37,170
So we get a range between 4% and 20 17%.

293
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:48,900
And the median county prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased from 6.3% in 2004 to 8.4% in 2019 two.

294
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:53,669
And if you look at the populations now in which this occurs,

295
00:37:53,670 --> 00:38:04,710
and we're looking at the Mid-South region or the Deep South region here in the southwest and some here in the northeast as well,

296
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:11,630
where we're seeing a darker color indicating a greater prevalence of type two diabetes.

297
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,930
And this would be the Appalachian region here that's that's showing it really dark.

298
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:18,960
And here have this is North and South Carolina.

299
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:26,320
We're showing hotspots as well for the higher prevalence of type two diabetes or diabetes.

300
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:45,180
General at the at the county. So if we look at race and ethnicity, that that ethnic group that has the highest age adjusted percentage of diabetes.

301
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:53,330
So this is age adjusted estimated prevalence of diagnosis, diabetes by race and sex for adults age 18 years and older.

302
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:58,590
And this is the latest information I can find 2018 to 2019.

303
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,360
So American-Indian, Alaska Native.

304
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:06,449
And you would also put into this group of Pacific Islanders,

305
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:19,920
they're going to have the highest age adjusted percentage of of diabetes, less so in the Asian non-Hispanic population.

306
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:28,590
And here are the white non-Hispanic individuals having the lowest prevalence of diagnosed diabetes.

307
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,870
And then you have black,

308
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:42,120
non-Hispanic and Hispanic populations having similar levels in terms of age adjusted percentage of having this having diabetes.

309
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:49,790
So we'll talk about why that is here in a minute.

310
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,020
So there are genetic risk factors. There are cultural risk factors as well.

311
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:05,540
Let's look at children now and again, try to find a more up to date treatment for this.

312
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:15,590
And I, I couldn't find one up trends from going back as far as finding out probably if they just for next year once I can

313
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:22,100
find one any way this breaks down this is trends in an incidence of type one and type two diabetes and youth.

314
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:29,690
So you're talking about ages 0 to 19 years of age and it's type one and type two diabetes.

315
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,340
The lines indicate race and ethnic groups.

316
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:46,670
So here's white non-Hispanic having the highest incidence of type one diabetes and it's the prevalence has gone up a little bit.

317
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,730
Incidence I should say has gone up a little bit. The dash line represents everyone.

318
00:40:53,270 --> 00:41:03,499
It's gone up a little bit. And then here we have a black non Hispanic in this turquoise like color purple would indicate

319
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:09,320
that Hispanic and then Asian Pacific Islander non-Hispanic would be in this darker line.

320
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:21,350
When we look at type two diabetes, we see now the incidence between 2003 and 2015 and that all going up.

321
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:28,340
So the incidence has increased for all is indicated by the increase in the dashed line.

322
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:36,590
The group with the highest increase here is the black non-Hispanic, followed by Hispanic children.

323
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:41,630
And then you have the Asian Pacific Islander increasing as well.

324
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:51,050
And then there you have white non-Hispanic group here showing a flat trend in terms of an increase in type two diabetes.

325
00:41:55,870 --> 00:42:04,630
Okay. So, you know, you have diabetes without having a rigorous test for your symptoms.

326
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:14,920
There may be no symptoms, but there are a number of symptoms that are associated with having type two diabetes and diabetes in general.

327
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:24,460
This would be relevant to diabetes in general. So blurred vision, having elevated blood glucose can affect your vision.

328
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:31,929
It can cause a reaction that the formation of these advanced glycation products

329
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:38,200
can interrupt the profusion of tissues within the eye affecting vision.

330
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:44,620
You can have you can experience fatigue if you have diabetes.

331
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:52,910
What a classic sign has this slow wound healing. You have chronically elevated blood glucose levels.

332
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:57,969
This is going to interrupt the healing process, a tissue healing in itself.

333
00:42:57,970 --> 00:43:06,730
It's going to have a negative impact on the immune cell populations within the wound that can disrupt this process as well.

334
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,080
And as a consequence of that, there were there was going to be frequent infections.

335
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:28,960
And this can lead to serious illness, sepsis, which is a leading cause of death in people who have type two diabetes.

336
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:36,010
You can experience an increase of appetite when you have diabetes.

337
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,270
And another classic symptom is increased thirst.

338
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:47,620
People can't get enough water. And as a consequence of drinking more water, they have frequent urination.

339
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:56,830
So a high level of glucose can affect the Osma receptors, indicating an increase in solid concentration in your blood.

340
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:01,000
In this case, it's glucose and that activates this thirst response.

341
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:05,590
So people drink a lot of fluids and they urinate frequently.

342
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,820
And this these are all this is a symptom of having diabetes.

343
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:21,510
So what are some complications? Cardiovascular disease in particular.

344
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:30,910
Coronary artery disease. So your risk? If you have diabetes, your risk for cardiovascular disease increases substantially.

345
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:39,990
For cardiovascular disease, where you have had a buildup of lipids within the artery walls.

346
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,940
Coronary artery disease. Your risk for stroke increases.

347
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:55,320
And your risk for peripheral vascular disease increases as well due to poor perfusion of distal tissues, in particular the feet.

348
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:09,930
Kidney chronic kidney disease is. Another consequence of type two diabetes specifically, especially if it's not treated.

349
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:21,930
So the number of individual the prevalence of chronic kidney disease is also increasing, and it's a significant complication of diabetes.

350
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:34,330
Another complication is neuropathy. So this affects your sensation of tissues, disco in particular, your feet.

351
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:40,420
And I'll talk about this as being a problem with foot infections here in a moment.

352
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:55,570
As I mentioned, there are problems with eyesight after you've gotten diabetes, and it can result in retinopathy, cataracts, glaucoma and blindness.

353
00:45:57,100 --> 00:46:08,530
Hyperlipidemia is another complication of type two diabetes, hypertension and in particular infections of the skin, the urinary tract, the lungs.

354
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:19,570
COVID 19 was an example of something that we've seen more recently and then infections of the gastrointestinal tract and and the liver as well.

355
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:24,520
So all of these are complications of of type two diabetes.

356
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:28,090
Yeah. I mean, for the link hyperlipidemia and hypertension,

357
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:36,250
are those things like related to being in a higher weight or is it related to the insulin production?

358
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:40,570
I didn't know if it was all related to the diabetes or if some of them were.

359
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:49,500
So in terms of the function of the adipocytes to take up excess lipids, that's going to be impaired now.

360
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:50,499
And as a consequence,

361
00:46:50,500 --> 00:47:00,310
you have increased circulating lipids that is impaired because of the body being larger or because of its the function of the adipocytes.

362
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,950
It's usually associated with having a higher BMI that's a higher visceral, adipose tissue.

363
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:13,780
It's a function here that's a problem. So you can have somebody who has a normal BMI, but their adipocytes aren't functioning as they should.

364
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:19,680
You can have hyperlipidemia as a consequence. In terms of hypertension.

365
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:32,430
So type two diabetes affects the metabolism of hormones that control veins of constriction.

366
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:40,080
So the angiotensin converting enzyme two now is affected by diabetes.

367
00:47:40,530 --> 00:47:45,570
And I'll talk about that mechanism in more detail on Wednesday when we talk about hypertension.

368
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:51,070
Yeah. Just to provide a clarification about what I said before.

369
00:47:51,490 --> 00:48:00,850
So when I mentioned the A1, SI and the random glucose, I was referring to general diabetes diagnosis for GDM.

370
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:04,690
Yes, we do have a false glucose tolerance test at the 2 hours.

371
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:10,300
The 1 hours typically get the glucose challenge.

372
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,750
So it's a slightly different test.

373
00:48:14,110 --> 00:48:22,780
And another thing for chronic kidney disease, just because a lot of times we often have a patient, one thing to remember for a diagnosis,

374
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:33,390
the A1 C is that you have a shorter life span of the red blood cells, so you may see a lower A1 C than what you would truly seen.

375
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,040
Of course that would have actually increased.

376
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:44,830
All right. Now let's talk about diabetes and foot infections.

377
00:48:45,970 --> 00:48:52,180
So how many of you that saw the video and similar diabetes saw this?

378
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:59,350
You may have skipped through the more gruesome pictures. This is a serious issue of people with diabetes, especially uncontrolled diabetes.

379
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:08,290
So what happens? Why does this occur? Why are there more foot infections and amputations below the knee as a consequence of this?

380
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:16,810
So there are problems with peripheral neuropathy and vascular function in the extremities.

381
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:27,370
So with diabetes, there's actual damage that occurs to the blood vessels, the vasculature itself.

382
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,320
And I have a slide subsequently that describes a proposed mechanism for this.

383
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:42,180
So there's poor tissue perfusion and cell death as a consequence of this compromised vascular function in the peripheral tissues,

384
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,860
the feet in particular. All right. So that's what happens.

385
00:49:46,970 --> 00:49:54,000
Then there's peripheral neuropathy. So the peripheral neuropathy nerves function poorly.

386
00:49:54,030 --> 00:50:07,650
In other words, if you have somebody who can't sense whether or not they have injured their foot, somehow walking around barefoot, stepping on things.

387
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:22,470
This is a problem with people who get diabetes and then the wound healing is impaired and which makes them more susceptible to infection and sepsis.

388
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:34,409
So they don't may not know that they have injured their feet and the wound doesn't heal appropriately and there is an increased risk of infection.

389
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:42,060
But that route not closing as it should, and the bacteria that can cause that infection circulate in the blood,

390
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:46,080
causing a more severe infection as a consequence of this.

391
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:52,710
So in 2010, haven't found a more recent number.

392
00:50:53,220 --> 00:51:06,720
There were over in the United States alone, 73,000 amputations with people who have diabetes, who have who've required this surgical procedure.

393
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:15,299
So this is very serious in terms of catching this condition and treating people

394
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,170
and treating them in a way that helps them control their blood glucose.

395
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:20,310
So this does not happen.

396
00:51:22,770 --> 00:51:30,240
Another sad fact here that I've listed is that after you had the amputation, people who have had this amputation are in poor health in general.

397
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:35,190
Now you've compromised their mobility, which has all kinds of negative consequences.

398
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:45,420
So people who have had lower extremity amputation, their life expectancy now is less than three years after that in general.

399
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:51,870
Okay, so this so people who have diabetes mellitus and have had a below the knee amputation,

400
00:51:52,650 --> 00:52:02,129
this is associated with a probably low life expectancy now limited their mobility and this has significant consequences in their health,

401
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:05,300
their mobility and social interactions.

402
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:08,220
All kinds of negative consequences. Yes.

403
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:18,239
Do you have any information as far as because with that amount of amputations and plus the susceptibility to infection and sepsis,

404
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:28,080
like how many people die as a result of infection due to the implications, not as a consequence of the medication or.

405
00:52:28,470 --> 00:52:33,840
Well, like because they're getting an amputation because they have diabetes,

406
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:40,790
they also have this low ability for an immune response and amputations or any other good.

407
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:47,130
I mean, especially because a lot I think a lot of people might who get to this point

408
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,600
might have not enough health care to allow them to get proper monitoring after.

409
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:58,920
I just feel like the amputations, although they may be necessary, there would be a high risk of infection and sepsis and then death.

410
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:12,000
That would be in part due to the amputation. So what happens is the tissue itself becomes gangrenous and so it's beyond the point of saving.

411
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:15,360
Well, I mean, I know I know it's like you can't avoid the amputations.

412
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,590
But do you have any information as far as how many deaths might occur due to infection?

413
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:26,969
Due to an amputation. So due to the amputation, no, I don't have that value.

414
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:34,260
But there's a large number of people who die from sepsis because of poor wound healing in general.

415
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:48,680
Yeah. Is that less than three years? Life expectancy after the amputation has to do with the patients who get the amputations just being older?

416
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:52,760
Or does it have to do with the actual amputation? All of the above.

417
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,860
Yeah. So everything changes after you've had an amputation?

418
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:05,450
Yes. These people could be elevated to begin with. But even if they're not, everything's going to change after that procedure.

419
00:54:11,630 --> 00:54:18,170
Okay. I mentioned that there is a compromise and tissue perfusion.

420
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:19,490
Why does that occur?

421
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:29,000
Well, one of the mechanisms that is being proposed is this advanced glycation products are age in the diabetic vascular complications.

422
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,090
So here you have a condition.

423
00:54:34,270 --> 00:54:45,250
Diabetes, you have elevated levels of glucose. There's glucose isolation, there's elevated glucose from diets that are high in simple carbohydrates.

424
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:50,860
And this increases these and that advanced glycation products for ages.

425
00:54:51,610 --> 00:54:58,420
And then you have receptors that can recognize these molecules.

426
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,110
These are these are proteins now that are linked to carbohydrate.

427
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:07,599
And they can activate after this occurs.

428
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:14,829
This the receptor now signals downstream of this receptor the rage the receptor for advanced glycation products can

429
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:23,920
activate an inflammatory response through the cascade of the the transcription factor nuclear factor capital B.

430
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:33,879
So the amount of these transcription factors increases and they go to the nucleus and they can activate a number of specific responses.

431
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:45,490
They can increase oxidative stress. They can increase pro-inflammatory cytokines production and within the vascular now vasculature.

432
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:54,870
Now you have the field of dysfunction and there's a greater tendency now for coagulation to occur in the

433
00:55:54,870 --> 00:56:05,129
vasculature as a consequence of activating this cascade and and other in the tissues throughout the body,

434
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:09,360
you have this atherosclerotic process occurring.

435
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:16,290
So this is a buildup of fatty plaque within the arteries and within the arterial wall.

436
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,550
And this compromises vascular function.

437
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:26,459
And people are treated with a number of drugs to lower blood glucose.

438
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:31,290
And we'll talk about the different types of drugs that are used to treat diabetes here at the very end.

439
00:56:35,670 --> 00:56:46,110
Okay. Risk factors for type two diabetes, obesity, 85% of people with type two diabetes are overweight or have obesity.

440
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:51,390
And in particular, it's visceral. Adiposity increases the risk.

441
00:56:53,040 --> 00:57:00,690
If you have a condition in which the adipose tissue doesn't function normally, you might have somebody who has overweight.

442
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,040
This would increase the risk.

443
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:09,450
If you have somebody who has a normal BMI and they have greater visceral adiposity, that can increase your risk of type two diabetes.

444
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:15,330
The point that I'm trying to make here is it's the function of the adipose tissue that's more important than anything else.

445
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:25,930
There's also a strong genetic predisposition for type two diabetes and Native Americans.

446
00:57:25,930 --> 00:57:31,299
Pacific Islanders, Indian Ocean Islanders have a greater risk for this condition.

447
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:36,130
You also have a greater risk in African-American and Hispanic populations.

448
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:46,020
And as I mentioned earlier there, say in terms of these genetic risk factors, there is a gene environment interaction.

449
00:57:46,900 --> 00:58:03,100
And if you remember that the Pima, where they had people living in Mexico, they had a BMI that was lower than the Pima living in Arizona and Arizona.

450
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:13,959
There's this environmental effect of people not being able to sustain themselves on traditional foods, the removal of their water.

451
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:21,160
Right. So they couldn't grow their traditional foods. And this is in the video that was posted earlier in the semester consequence.

452
00:58:21,160 --> 00:58:26,140
They became dependent on government subsidies, government food programs,

453
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:32,740
which consisted of foods that promote and increase caloric intake and an increase

454
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:40,970
in and weight gain during the dependent on this particular food source and and

455
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:48,250
Samoa as you if you watch the video the importation of foods that are high sugar and

456
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:54,760
fat dramatically increased in type two diabetes and that particular population,

457
00:58:55,210 --> 00:58:57,460
they already had a genetic susceptibility.

458
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:03,910
But as you as you watch the video, they said that it was very rare to see somebody with diabetes in that population.

459
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:09,610
After the importation of those types of foods, you saw a dramatic increase in diabetes.

460
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:12,790
Yeah. Maria, you had a comment or question? Yeah, I had a question.

461
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:22,870
So you did mention about the on the salmon that they did already have a genetic predisposition, but it became worse with the nutritional transition.

462
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:28,180
Was that the case for like the other races you have listed that there?

463
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:33,540
So whenever you use it just the nutritional transition and then that created like.

464
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:39,250
Genetic basis for generation after generation.

465
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:46,540
So in terms of the prevalence of diabetes in these populations,

466
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:53,890
prior to the introduction of the Western diet, America produces a positive energy balance.

467
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:58,510
So the number of people that have low would get diabetes is very low.

468
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:09,879
It was after the transition, after the adaptation of that Western style diet that led to an increase in this energy balance,

469
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:17,650
leading to increased weight, gaining and resulting in impaired adipocyte function leading to type two diabetes.

470
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:22,060
Did we have that genetic susceptibility that you mentioned increases your risk?

471
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:29,710
Okay. You can have an increased genetic susceptibility, but if you don't have the other part, you won't get it.

472
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:34,930
But my question is. Exactly, was that fair for those other races?

473
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:41,050
Oh, okay. Are you are you talking about the African-American and Hispanic populations or Native Americans?

474
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:44,560
Okay. I didn't put in a table showing you.

475
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:52,870
Live in different categories and terms, just race and ethnicity.

476
01:00:53,410 --> 01:01:07,090
But with with what I remember, with blacks and Hispanics, there's already a higher level of type two diabetes, even in the 20 to 25 range of BMI.

477
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:11,320
Yeah. Like that have to do with healthcare access.

478
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:24,100
So you're going to see an association between socioeconomic status, access to health care and an increased risk of diabetes.

479
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:33,910
So, yes, those factors can come into play. So these rates might this be factors might not necessarily be a genetic predisposition.

480
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:40,570
I mean, I'm just wondering, like, what it's like, there's something about their genes that all of the above it's a risk factor.

481
01:01:40,720 --> 01:01:43,980
It's not the only thing in play here. Thank.

482
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:53,720
So a sedentary lifestyle is also a risk factor for type two diabetes.

483
01:01:54,530 --> 01:02:03,660
An unhealthy diet. Diets rich in simple sugars, meat, low fiber and whole grains are a risk factor.

484
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:07,440
And as you get older, your risk increases.

485
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:12,710
So go ahead. Sorry. I just. So about, like, the simple sugars.

486
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:19,049
I'm just wondering about the terminology. There would have to do more with refined carbohydrates and simple sugars, because fruits are simple sugars.

487
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:24,120
And it's true in perfectly fine carbohydrates would be a better description.

488
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:32,370
I'm pulling off this verbiage from the CDC website to have a very condensed language for bullet point for.

489
01:02:33,350 --> 01:02:37,010
But all of these factors contribute. There isn't one single thing.

490
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:43,390
That's the point I'm trying to make. You can have these underlying risk factors and then you add another thing to it and add it.

491
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:48,620
And it has a substantially additive effect of of having a type two diabetes.

492
01:02:51,950 --> 01:03:04,970
So if we take the county level increase in diabetes and we overlay that with the percent obesity in this particular county, that in 2009,

493
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:11,870
you find that the purple represents the increase in the percentage of the

494
01:03:11,870 --> 01:03:16,250
percentage of people with diabetes and the percentage of people with obesity.

495
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:25,160
And so this is in 2009. So the blue would indicate the darker blue color would indicate when you would have a greater prevalence

496
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:31,160
of obesity and the darker red would indicate where you have a greater prevalence of diabetes.

497
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:37,910
Okay. And then from 2009 to 2019,

498
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:48,649
you're getting more purple in this particular county map indicating that where you're seeing an increase in prevalence and obesity,

499
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:56,480
you're seeing an increase in the prevalence of diabetes between this ten year period of time, 2009 to 2019.

500
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:08,700
So there was a paper published long ago, 2007, looking at in this case its BMI.

501
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,790
And you can find a better relationship with weight circumference.

502
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:20,820
And in this particular paper, they looked at the lifetime risk of having type two diabetes by BMI.

503
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:26,040
So in this particular report, there were 240,000 subjects.

504
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:34,829
And there they're looking at men and women. And this is a sample, a large sample, a sample population within the United States.

505
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:40,200
And they're looking at the time at which you have a measurement for.

506
01:04:41,460 --> 01:04:46,320
In this case, it's different thresholds for BMI, less than 18.

507
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:51,120
So this is the hatch bar. The open bar here is 18 to 25.

508
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:58,050
The next bar is 25 to 30. And then that black bars 30 to 35.

509
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:01,980
And then the last bars here is a 35 plus.

510
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:13,590
If you have a higher BMI at a younger age, your lifetime probability of having diabetes increases substantially.

511
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:22,930
As you age, if you have these different levels of BMI, your risk isn't as great.

512
01:05:23,290 --> 01:05:32,290
And if you achieve a higher BMI at an older age, your risk of lifetime risk of developing diabetes is less.

513
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:42,240
So having a higher level or higher being that for a longer period of time increases your risk of having diabetes.

514
01:05:45,090 --> 01:05:55,050
Okay. Why? Why does this happen? Well, in this particular diagram shows you the different tissues that are effective.

515
01:05:55,080 --> 01:06:01,440
And the issue here is the function of the adipose tissue is kind of the place to start.

516
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:09,570
But the way this particular illustration starts here in the gut.

517
01:06:09,750 --> 01:06:14,070
So under normal circumstances, the release of the ingredients,

518
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:25,889
the hormones now GIP and GLP one may increase your sensitivity and increase chance by increasing beta cell function.

519
01:06:25,890 --> 01:06:36,840
Right? And this should decrease food intake. But if you have a higher BMI, obesity, there's some hypothalamic inflammation.

520
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:48,120
I showed you some examples of that. In mice and humans, you have insulin resistance in the adipocytes, particularly in the visceral compartment.

521
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:56,580
You have more lipolysis occurring and you have this an accumulation of macrophages and adipose tissue.

522
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:01,230
And this leads to a greater levels of lipids within the blood.

523
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:11,790
And this can contribute to insulin resistance by affecting other tissues, in particular the liver, where their glucose greater glucose output.

524
01:07:13,110 --> 01:07:17,849
And that's caused by triglyceride accumulation and nonalcoholic fatty liver

525
01:07:17,850 --> 01:07:23,310
disease and greater inflammation within the liver as well within the muscle,

526
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:29,490
there's less efficient glucose uptake, there's a decrease in insulin sensitivity.

527
01:07:30,390 --> 01:07:33,870
And I'll talk about each of these examples here in a minute.

528
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:43,470
But then in the in the pancreas, there's over time a reduction in insulin secretion and a decline in beta cell function.

529
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:55,980
And this is as a consequence of inflammation within the islets that causes the cells to undergo the process of ptosis and eventual cell death.

530
01:07:56,250 --> 01:08:02,040
And we have fewer and fewer beta cells that can produce insulin. So let's go over these one at a time.

531
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:09,630
So here you have a situation where you have insulin release and insulin sensitivity.

532
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:15,269
And under normal circumstances, you're more insulin sensitive.

533
01:08:15,270 --> 01:08:22,800
You are you're going to need less insulin release.

534
01:08:22,980 --> 01:08:25,980
So if you are, here's the normal range.

535
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:31,560
So here's insulin sensitivity. As it increases, you need to have less insulin produced.

536
01:08:32,070 --> 01:08:42,870
Okay. Now, as you say, your glucose tolerance goes down and here in the yellow range is impaired glucose tolerance.

537
01:08:43,710 --> 01:08:48,000
The shape of this relationship changes a little bit.

538
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:55,660
So as you become less insulin sensitive, it's start.

539
01:08:55,820 --> 01:09:01,070
You need to have more insulin released so that you can take up blood glucose.

540
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:11,030
And when you get down to this level of having type two diabetes, now we have a state in which you're much less sensitive to insulin.

541
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:17,780
So it takes a much greater amount of insulin release to get your cells to take up that glucose.

542
01:09:22,030 --> 01:09:30,250
So what happens in different tissues? So this is an illustration that looks at what's going on within the beta cells.

543
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:40,319
So glucose level toxicity has been described as a mechanism that can come that leads to this impairment and function of these cells.

544
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:46,560
And in this case, you have here a beta cell, an insulin producing cell.

545
01:09:47,970 --> 01:09:53,520
You have increased circulating levels of lipids and it stands for palmitic acid.

546
01:09:53,930 --> 01:10:04,589
This that most of the lipid that's in the highest concentration in your blood and it can act on these free fatty acid receptors.

547
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:09,120
So there's a higher level of circulating free fatty acids, mostly in the form of acid.

548
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:20,880
And this activates these g protein coupled receptors, and this can lead to impaired insulin secretion and programed cell death in these cells.

549
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:27,710
And the mechanism is thought to occur through this increase in the levels of Sarah Mind.

550
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:34,440
Now Sarah Mind is a lipid now that increases in these cells and in response to this,

551
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:37,740
higher levels of these free fatty acids in the form of palmitic acid.

552
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:43,260
So another receptor that can mediate the uptake of lipids is cd36.

553
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:49,800
So you've got an increase in lipids that can be stored in this lipid droplet.

554
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,480
So lipid droplet formation increases, you have an increase in ceramide,

555
01:10:54,480 --> 01:11:02,460
which is a metabolite of acid and other types of fatty acids that are taken up inside the cell.

556
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:11,670
And the accumulation of ceramide can lead to endoplasmic reticulum, stress and this function of mitochondria.

557
01:11:12,900 --> 01:11:21,240
And under normal circumstances, cells try to conserve these intracellular organelles for the process of autophagy.

558
01:11:22,190 --> 01:11:26,960
And within the beta cell. Now this process is defective.

559
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:31,580
And as a consequence, you have now greater shell.

560
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:38,030
I've been told this as a consequence of being exposed to these higher levels of free fatty acids.

561
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:48,680
And there's also some effects of the downregulation of the P part receptor and alpha as a consequence of having higher levels of lipids in the cells.

562
01:11:50,210 --> 01:11:59,330
So this is a theory as to why the beta cells undergo hepatocytes as a consequence of liver toxic conditions.

563
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:10,210
What goes on in the muscle. So within the muscle you have under normal circumstances, typical circumstances.

564
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:16,780
We have cells within the muscle that have the capacity to take up glucose under the influence of insulin.

565
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:24,880
And circulating fatty acids can be metabolized to form ATP for muscle contraction.

566
01:12:25,330 --> 01:12:28,810
And you have the formation of CO2 water as a consequence.

567
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:34,840
But as the adipose tissue expands now.

568
01:12:36,500 --> 01:12:41,270
This process, you start to see some impairment in this process.

569
01:12:41,810 --> 01:12:44,410
So the adipocyte size is increasing here.

570
01:12:44,420 --> 01:12:53,210
You get larger adipocytes and you get some adipocyte inflammation that results in a pro-inflammatory state in the adipose tissue.

571
01:12:54,080 --> 01:13:01,340
And here you have under the local influence of these pro-inflammatory cytokines and impairment for these cells to take up that lipid,

572
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:12,710
it gets into circulation and it deposits within the muscle itself, this ectopic lipids and that the ceremonies would be relevant here as well.

573
01:13:13,810 --> 01:13:24,310
The accumulation of lipids now in lipid metabolites impair the ability of the muscle cells to take up glucose in response to insulin.

574
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:29,680
The next dive is a simplification of this process.

575
01:13:30,820 --> 01:13:38,710
So in this particular example you have here, normal glucose responsiveness.

576
01:13:38,950 --> 01:13:44,460
Well, insulin responsiveness here. So here is a muscle cell.

577
01:13:44,970 --> 01:13:50,270
Here's a plasma and here's a different transporter platform.

578
01:13:51,570 --> 01:13:55,350
And here you have an insulin receptor cell.

579
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,080
The muscle cell has these insulin receptors.

580
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:10,370
And it binds to insulin in the cabinet is activation of this insulin receptors response element and this activates PI3 kinase

581
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:21,860
which phosphorylated and activates the good for which can translocate to the plasma membrane and facilitate glucose transport.

582
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:31,340
You can also and if you don't need to have glucose, you can store this excess glucose in the form of glycogen.

583
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:40,850
In the case where you have excess free fatty acids, this process is disrupted.

584
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:51,470
So in this case, you have here's the insulin receptor, advanced insulin, but you don't get an association with iris one here.

585
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:59,110
The insulin response substrate, it does not become activated.

586
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:03,270
You have an accumulation of niacin glycerol.

587
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,210
This is a lipid now that forms within these cells.

588
01:15:07,870 --> 01:15:14,410
And then you have activation of these PKC isoforms that disrupt this intracellular signaling process.

589
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:22,480
And as a consequence, you don't get it for fusion with a membrane that facilitates glucose uptake.

590
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:39,410
So as someone becomes less and less sensitive, less and less sensitive, you have less and less glucose uptake into the previous slide.

591
01:15:39,600 --> 01:15:42,850
So weight gain is depicted as hypertrophy.

592
01:15:42,860 --> 01:15:54,580
So would this be. Do this not occur occur at a lower degree was a great pleasure supposed to never occur with hyperplasia.

593
01:15:55,820 --> 01:15:59,420
So again, it relates to the function of the adipose tissue.

594
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:09,260
So if you had more smaller adipocytes expanding through the process of the hyperplasia, you wouldn't get that localized inflammatory response.

595
01:16:09,710 --> 01:16:11,000
And as a consequence,

596
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:19,670
you wouldn't get you would still have the ability to take up exotic this lipids and prevent this free fatty acid spill over into the blood.

597
01:16:20,060 --> 01:16:24,810
So this would be a risk for visceral, adipose tissue.

598
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:29,120
Yes, but probably less so. Less so in the subcutaneous.

599
01:16:29,450 --> 01:16:37,969
It can occur in the subcutaneous, but less so. That depends on a number of factors that affect the type of genesis in that tissue.

600
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:42,230
It's a lot. Okay, so that's the muscle.

601
01:16:42,920 --> 01:16:51,230
What happens in the liver when the liver there's the signaling process, it's a little bit different, but very similar.

602
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:56,580
In this particular scenario, here's normal glucose homeostasis.

603
01:16:56,730 --> 01:17:01,740
Here's the insulin receptor binding to insulin activating.

604
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:09,810
In this case, it's the iris one two molecule that activates peak three Jaffrey kinase and eight Katy

605
01:17:10,620 --> 01:17:16,380
And Katy plays a regulatory role in terms of your ability to store glycogen here.

606
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:27,120
So Fox one and Fox. So a two are transcription factors now that influence of higher pyruvate conversion to glucose,

607
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:33,870
six phosphate and then storage in the form of like a chanter plated syntax.

608
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:41,970
So in this scenario, the liver cell can take up glucose and stored in the form of glycogen.

609
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:56,460
The act here is inhibiting these transcription factors and it's inhibiting GSK three, which regulates glucose glycogen syntax.

610
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:06,630
In the liver you have the same process of training where you have lipid metabolites building up within the parasites.

611
01:18:07,560 --> 01:18:13,860
And here's a PKC Isoform and these interfere with insulin receptor signaling.

612
01:18:14,780 --> 01:18:22,380
And as a consequence now we don't have this iris one or two associating with the insulin receptor.

613
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:30,600
We get an increase in these transcription factors that favor pyruvate conversion to phosphate.

614
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,810
And we don't have activation of the HKT.

615
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:38,190
So this is too that would inhibit this process.

616
01:18:39,030 --> 01:18:55,440
You also now don't have the signals that affect this GSK three molecule now that regulates the like it's incented so this process to store from this

617
01:18:55,710 --> 01:19:05,280
glucose six phosphate now is impaired and as a consequence the liver now is putting out glucose which causes this instant insulin insensitivity.

618
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:14,479
So this is what's occurring in the liver in terms of it becoming less sensitive to insulin

619
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:19,160
as a consequence of this accumulation of lipid metabolites within the hepatocytes.

620
01:19:22,890 --> 01:19:26,700
So the genetic risk factors include a number of things and here are some of that.

621
01:19:27,780 --> 01:19:31,950
So you have genetic risk factors that increase your risk of getting type two

622
01:19:31,950 --> 01:19:40,740
diabetes that would occur and muscle within adipose tissue within the liver.

623
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:52,290
And if you have the gene you had a you're at a greater risk of having obesity and the distribution of adipose tissue can be affected by genetic risk.

624
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:56,790
So here's a the TBC one five.

625
01:19:56,790 --> 01:19:58,860
This is something that I talked about.
