1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:06,180
So today we're just going to do like an intro of how to do our policy lab.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:10,740
The first policy lab will be next week, but next week will just be a practice session.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,720
And then two weeks from now, we will actually get started. All right.

4
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:24,880
So we're just going to start off by kind of like introducing ourselves and then do a brief overview of the canvas site.

5
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,530
And then after that, I'll just introduce kind of like how the policy labs work.

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,370
Michelle Hey, how's it going? Good. And you? Pretty good.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,240
Just making sure everything's up and running. Okay? Yeah, things are going well.

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:44,590
Person I am sure can be welcome in office hours after class.

9
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,270
If you want to stop by or make an appointment, I'd love to meet your.

10
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,500
So thank you, all of you, for stopping by. Thanks for stopping by.

11
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,730
Oh, absolutely. Got everything all right? Will be here.

12
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,480
Yeah. And then we're just going to talk about, like,

13
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,310
some of the group assignments we have other than the policy labs and then just kind of go over any questions you guys have.

14
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,970
All right. So my name's Assad Kimani. I am a second year law student at the University of Michigan.

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,890
The reason I'm teaching a public health course is because I have previous experience in health care consulting,

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,220
and I've also done other business related things in health care.

17
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,410
So if you have any questions about any of those things or anything else, feel free to reach out to me.

18
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:34,770
And we're just going to go around real quick. And if you guys just want to say your names, your pronouns and your department.

19
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:42,120
And then also just kind of what you're hoping to learn from this class and what you expect from the semester.

20
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:47,999
So we can start here. And the name is great.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,540
So you see my pronouns at the department.

22
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:59,160
Second here, I know nothing about policy, so I guess that's what I'm hoping to learn.

23
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:06,570
And the places that I'm looking at working also does some work in legislation, so maybe I'm a little help with that.

24
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,430
Hi. My name is Scarlett.

25
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:24,139
I brought lb ah she her and from the apartment I also know nothing about policy so excited to so my knowledge and yeah and Supriya a she her

26
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:34,879
pronouns I'm in the global health department um and that I also know nothing of policy at one of my internship projects involves policy change.

27
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:42,500
So I'm hoping that something will happen. That was Erin under my program.

28
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:51,230
Also, I'm a global health news program. Um, I guess the work that I do because of the invitation thing itself is kind of interesting.

29
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,910
Um, this was when I was doing all.

30
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,890
You know, my name is Jamie. Is she her pronouns?

31
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:13,260
I'm in the epidemiology program and I'm just hoping to see how I can tighten policy to whatever epidemiology positions in the future.

32
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,940
Exactly. And pronouns. Um. I'm also in acting allergy.

33
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:23,040
Um. Basically the same. I don't know much about policy, especially with, like, the United States.

34
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,840
I think, uh, my name is Jessica Yu.

35
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:31,560
She's an immigration.

36
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,800
I learned from this class how to better navigate policy in healthcare.

37
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:42,300
Um, I work in health care policy and a lot of what I can do.

38
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,360
Hi. Um, and I use your pronouns on in the APA department.

39
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:56,210
I also don't know anything about policies or just learning anything elsewhere.

40
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:59,910
So here she's her pronouns. Um.

41
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:04,320
I don't plan to ever work in policy positions required forever, so.

42
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,940
Okay. Fair enough, guy.

43
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,270
And now you can go in and say to your general evidence,

44
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:25,270
you also remember my policy center and Hannah she her pronouns, since I know nothing about policy.

45
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,650
So the difference that I'm Maria, I keep her pronouns.

46
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:34,530
I like a lot of people, but I don't know anything about policy.

47
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:40,450
So. Yeah. Hi.

48
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:44,040
I'm Maddie. She her pronouns and also the medical department.

49
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,110
And also, I'm Anastasia.

50
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:54,340
She her pronouns. Each of me and the other department first don't know anything.

51
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,400
My policy on Madeline.

52
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:06,339
I'm in the I'm a first year update track on my you her release and I would say I'm Jordan are you

53
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,799
she her pronouns I'm in the department and I'll echo Audrey and say that we have to take the class.

54
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:17,350
But I hadn't come in with an open mind and I'm excited to share her pronouns.

55
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:24,100
I'm the second year genealogy student and I don't know anything about policy.

56
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:31,030
So excited to learn something. This address she her pronouns at the department as well.

57
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,830
I'm kind of excited that I need to learn about how this policy guides our governmental agencies.

58
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:41,420
So she's not our public. Sorry.

59
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:49,030
My name is Kennedy. Are you sure? Pronouns in every department and I'm not sure what.

60
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:53,560
I don't know. So I want to learn what I don't know.

61
00:05:55,050 --> 00:06:01,700
I'm American, he pronouns. I'm an emergency department and no one ever.

62
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,469
So my name is somebody general at the department. He, him.

63
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,910
And I hope to learn the role of government public health.

64
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,720
Okay. Hi, my name is Ariana. I'm also in General Shepperd.

65
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:22,060
And apparently I must know something about policy because I took a class on it last year, but that was a whole year ago, so.

66
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,410
Oh, good. Oh, cool. So. All right.

67
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:36,730
So when you're emailing, I'm just use this for this and the subject line, Public Health 513 and U.S. expect 24 to 48 hours for response.

68
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,980
You can email me or you can email the professor.

69
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:46,360
Um, and then for any general questions, we actually prefer that you post them to the canvas discussion board,

70
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,189
which I'll show you in a minute just because like the question you might have, someone else might have it too.

71
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:57,729
And it's just better for everyone to be able to get it answered and then come to policy that's prepared and on time.

72
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,150
I guess that's a given, but all.

73
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,750
And now to show you the canvas site real quick. I'm going to.

74
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:17,390
I make this work? I. Okay.

75
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:23,960
So. This is the home page of the Kansas site.

76
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:33,110
The course syllabus. There's no PDF or word copy of it, so you just have to kind of click here and then.

77
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,580
Go down and it's all written here. And then.

78
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,330
There's course goals and competencies.

79
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:52,930
If you want to know, like how you're graded, which is probably the most important thing for a lot of people, this is how you're going to be graded.

80
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:58,240
There's going to be weekly policy labs and then also some other assignments, which I'll go through in a minute.

81
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:04,770
And then, of course, policies. And the course schedule.

82
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:15,920
Um, yeah. So we're not going to have class next Monday because of Martin Luther King Day and our first practice policy.

83
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,540
That will be next week. It's just a practice. So, you know, don't be too stressed about it.

84
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:26,330
You're going to come in and kind of run through a policy lab with your group and we'll let you know, like how you did.

85
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:35,280
Okay? Yes. Yes. I have an email about the course and purchase in the course.

86
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,420
Yes. Yes, we can. So I'm going to run through that later, too.

87
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:43,870
But basically the course pack is also available on canvas if you go under.

88
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:49,470
Course syllabus, it's available there and there's a link. So if you click that, you can buy that through Harvard Business Publishing.

89
00:08:53,510 --> 00:09:00,960
You know that pretty much it. Well, I mean, you know, so click here to access the quarterback.

90
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:06,430
You just go there, you'll be able to buy it. What's in there? It's just like the cases for the semester.

91
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:17,510
Oh, yeah. So there's no textbook. The cases are all in the course back. Or can you clarify who wants to buy this record?

92
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,790
It's you need to buy it through. So canvas is where the link to buy it is.

93
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:28,099
Sorry, I should have clarified that better. You need to individually buy it.

94
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,490
Or if we have a friend that buys it, can we split the cost between?

95
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:37,010
I'm supposed to tell you to individually buy it, but I don't care what you doing because we don't.

96
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:41,570
So it doesn't matter. So, hypothetically speaking, I already bought the course pack.

97
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:52,340
So, hypothetically speaking, if I like hypothetically, you know, I didn't hear that, but we'll work something out for you.

98
00:09:52,760 --> 00:10:00,979
Yeah, but nothing else comes with each of us.

99
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,719
And it was 50 bucks. Just. Just make sure you could actually share it with you.

100
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:19,580
Because I know this hypothetically, hypothetically, hypothetically speaking, your data collection bikes are also we are being recorded right now.

101
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:23,389
So I said I didn't think it's all hypothetical.

102
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:29,620
I didn't approach anything. No. All right.

103
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:36,740
Yeah. So. Just like expectations during discussions.

104
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,680
Make sure you're respectful of each other whenever someone's talking.

105
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:44,550
Make sure that you assume the best and that they're not coming from a malicious place.

106
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:50,360
And if you are offended by something, make sure you just point that out respectfully and have a discussion about it.

107
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,370
You know, just basic rules. I feel like we're all adults. Like we know this stuff.

108
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,360
Or we should at least. Yeah. Any questions about any of this?

109
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:12,640
I'll just give you a minute to read through it. We couldn't.

110
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:20,400
All right. So, overview of canvas.

111
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:24,190
I literally just did this. There's no PDF syllabus.

112
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:27,500
I'll just go over the topics though that we're supposed to do during the semester.

113
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:32,790
So. I'm going back to the canvas page.

114
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,820
There's three main topics. Then we're going to go over.

115
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:50,890
The. I caught gold and Kabul.

116
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:05,850
Yeah. So the first topic is the structure and function of public health.

117
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,670
And that's going to take up the first four weeks.

118
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:14,890
After that, we're going to talk about the role of government in public health, which will be the next.

119
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:20,160
Two weeks. For the next week. We're just one one week on that.

120
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,710
And then we're going to talk about comparative health systems on February 13 to 17.

121
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,970
And Week seven is going to be the struction structure and functions of health care and regulatory systems.

122
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,790
Honestly, a lot of these topics are pretty similar and they all kind of build on each other.

123
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:45,419
So as the course goes on, you'll just keep learning more about how public health functions, how government implements public health,

124
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:52,020
and then how the government and other systems kind of interact to build the public health infrastructure.

125
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:59,390
Yeah. And then we have a second unit after spring break.

126
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,730
On policymaking, advocacy and negotiation.

127
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:08,170
So a lot of this will just be around kind of like how policies are made.

128
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:12,490
And then you'll also have like a negotiation exercise that you do. Um.

129
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:18,149
Again, this will all kind of like build on what you initially learned. So if you have any questions about it, let me know.

130
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:23,330
But that's still a while away. And then the next like.

131
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,580
Weeks, nine through 15 will be mostly focused around that topic.

132
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,969
Okay. And now we're going to go over some of the assignments that we have,

133
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:37,110
because other than like the weekly policy lab discussion, that there are some other assignments.

134
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:45,150
And. Yes.

135
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:50,250
So there's a health systems assignment, which is the first one that's going to be due is coming up February 24th.

136
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:55,410
I wouldn't be too stressed about that right now, but you'll be working on that with their groups,

137
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:03,120
and it'll kind of be like the culmination of this initial unit that we're learning about, just like public health systems.

138
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:08,100
And then there's another exercise on financial management that you'll turn in.

139
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,100
There's another exercise on negotiation, which will come later in the semester after the spring break.

140
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:21,000
So don't worry about that now then. It's a self reflection on negotiation, which is based on the exercise you did.

141
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:31,010
And there's also an advocacy assignment and a policy lab that will be coming up, or the policy that sorry, that's a weekly post.

142
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,460
That's what you're going to be doing every week. And then participation.

143
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:42,390
Just make sure to participate in class. Speak up like one or two times in the discussion section if you have any questions.

144
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,720
Always feel free to ask them. Don't hesitate to do so.

145
00:14:46,170 --> 00:14:49,559
And as long as you do those things, you should get full points of participation.

146
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,310
And also just being here is important. And if there's any time that you're not here,

147
00:14:53,310 --> 00:15:04,710
just letting us know and we're going to go over kind of like the policies for absences and also for late work in a bit, but doing more on that later.

148
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:15,550
All right. Any questions about any of the assignments that I just talked about?

149
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:21,750
I mean, it's all kind of far down the road, but. No.

150
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:33,210
All right. So for case analysis, this is kind of what we're going to be doing every week in the discussion sections.

151
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:42,570
Each week you'll have around 40 to 50 minute to work on a case or the case that you read prior to the section with your teammates.

152
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:47,730
All of the work will be done during the section. We don't expect you to do any work outside.

153
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:54,960
We also don't expect you to do any outside research and the slides will be due at the end of the discussion section.

154
00:15:56,050 --> 00:16:04,600
So the first 15, 20 minutes, I'm kind of just going to like give you a brief overview of the case without giving away too much information.

155
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,450
And then for 40, 50 minutes, you guys are all just going to kind of discuss it amongst yourselves.

156
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:17,780
And at the end of the section you're going to turn it in. And then usually I think within a week will have agreed.

157
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:23,680
I'm not going to promise that right now because I don't know exactly what the grading policy is,

158
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,910
but you should have the turn around relatively quickly.

159
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,520
Also the site slides are turned in a way without prior approval.

160
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:36,970
You will be. Marked points off for that.

161
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,799
How many points off will depend on how many days later it is?

162
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:52,060
I think we're going to go through that a little bit later. And there's one session this semester per team where you can ask for an extension without

163
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:57,370
needing like some emergency situation excuse and we'll give you a three day extension.

164
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,999
So more on that in a bit. Yeah.

165
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,879
And like, if you can never not attend the session, just talk to me, send me an email, let me know why.

166
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,870
And we can work through that. Also don't um.

167
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,120
For your slide next to your classmates were on here on Friday so don't you.

168
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,590
All right. So the case analysis will basically have.

169
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:30,390
Five different sections. And I'm just going to walk you through kind of what each of those sections will look like,

170
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:36,240
because the slide deck that you're going to be turning in from week to week will have to have this structure.

171
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,250
So the first section is the situation.

172
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:45,780
So for this situation, you just have to identify what the issue is that you're dealing with.

173
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:50,700
Right. So after you read the case, there are three different types of situations.

174
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:54,420
There are problems, there are decisions and there are evaluations.

175
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:59,940
Problems are basically situations in which something important has happened.

176
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,790
For example, like the opioid epidemic is a problem, right?

177
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:10,140
So when you identify a problem, you have to kind of just state what the problem is and then describe why it's a problem.

178
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:16,630
And you shouldn't spend too much time on this just because it's only worth one point on your overall slide deck.

179
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,430
That's just one point out of 14 to 15 points.

180
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,510
But it's important that you just have the right problem down.

181
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:29,040
You can also have a decision or an evaluation as your situations.

182
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:41,010
So a decision is like when you read a case, the underlying objective of that case will be to come to a decision about a specific scenario.

183
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,460
So you would already already know the problem in that situation. You just kind of.

184
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:49,849
Figuring out what to do about it. And then there's also evaluations.

185
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:58,250
So evaluations would be if a problem has already happened and there's already been a solution proposed to it that's also been implemented.

186
00:18:58,790 --> 00:19:01,820
You'd be evaluating the effectiveness of that. So depending on the case,

187
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:08,240
you're going to have one of these three situations and you just have to identify it and kind of state like why it's important.

188
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:16,700
Any questions about this? Yeah.

189
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:21,200
Just don't spend too much time here. All right.

190
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:28,310
So, for example, one example of a situation is a problem, which is the opioid opioid epidemic.

191
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,450
So when you're identifying this problem,

192
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:37,670
you have to talk about the magnitude of the problem and then also whether or not you're

193
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:42,050
trying to account for like a failure or a success or something that's more ambiguous.

194
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,410
So if you're saying that the opioid epidemic is a problem, you would be saying that.

195
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,910
The magnitude of the problem is that 400,000 people died from it.

196
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,960
Right. Because that just shows that it's an issue that's pressing that needs to be dealt with.

197
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:02,270
And then you also have to talk about why it's an epidemic.

198
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:12,620
And despite the fact that the knowledge of the problem exists, it's still persisting and there's still increased deaths from overdose.

199
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:21,190
And also there's things like that. All right.

200
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,549
So after that, you're going to be going through your required questions and supporting context.

201
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:32,120
So this is kind of what questions you need to address in order to adequately solve the situation that you've identified.

202
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,100
Right. So if it's a problem, then what? What is the problem and what?

203
00:20:38,270 --> 00:20:41,600
Who is responsible? How should it be addressed? Questions like that.

204
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:48,770
And then if it's a decision, you have to outline the different decision options and what's at stake with each of those options.

205
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:58,460
Right. And then for an evaluation, you have to identify kind of who is responsible for the intervention that was taken.

206
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:02,810
And then also, what are the criteria for the evaluation?

207
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:07,100
And on what basis will that intervention be evaluated?

208
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:15,750
Right. And also you have to talk about whether or not there are issues related to systemic racism or health equity that need to be addressed.

209
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:21,710
This this portion of this is not optional because in public health,

210
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,879
you're ultimately trying to ensure health equity like that is the goal of public health.

211
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:30,500
So you kind of have to talk about if there are any really issues related to systemic racism,

212
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:36,710
if marginalized groups are being left out of an intervention, how can they be let in, things like that?

213
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:46,580
Any questions about this? All right.

214
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:53,720
So examples of questions. So, for example, if it's a problem, you have to identify what the problem is you're trying to address.

215
00:21:54,920 --> 00:22:03,860
In the example of the opioid epidemic, it would be an increase in overdose deaths in fentanyl and then also other synthetic opioids.

216
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,240
And then another question would be kind of who is responsible for the problem?

217
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,830
So there's various parties with the opioid epidemic from changing attitudes towards pain management,

218
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:22,830
marketing campaigns, lobbying from drug manufacturers, and also physicians who overprescribe.

219
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,180
So just making sure to ask those questions and kind of identify the responsible parties.

220
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:38,180
And then health equity. So when it comes to. When it comes to the opioid epidemic, it would be something like.

221
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:47,250
When it comes to solutions to it, how can we best reach marginalized communities, including minorities or rural areas?

222
00:22:48,790 --> 00:22:53,740
But also, how can we ensure that the opioid epidemic doesn't disproportionately impact a marginalized community?

223
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:02,050
Also another thing I should note is that I just went through three slides worth of questions.

224
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:08,379
Ideally, you want to keep each of these subsections just to one slide, right?

225
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:13,660
So you want to have six slides total. If you really want to have like more than that, you can.

226
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:20,260
But I would prefer that you don't just because it's easier, you just have like six quick slides that are short and to the point.

227
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,080
And I would definitely encourage you guys to stick to that and not kind of overdo things.

228
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:36,160
And then the hypothesis or the hypothesis is the biggest section of the assignment basically is identifying

229
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:42,760
how to solve the situation that you've identified and how to answer the questions that you just posed.

230
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:50,320
And it's a potential explanation that explains the set of facts in the case and also how to address them.

231
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:57,880
Right. And a good hypothesis is one that can be tested empirically through the collection of data, through experimentation, whatever.

232
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,820
All right. And also is part of your hypothesis and recommendation.

233
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:09,900
Again, I'd just like to emphasize that you really you really should be addressing any issues related to health equity and systemic racism.

234
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:18,420
And if that is an important part of that case, which for the majority of cases there will be, that's something that you should try to drive home.

235
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:30,130
All right. So I'm going to run through some examples of hypotheses when you're actually writing hypotheses down on your slides.

236
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:35,290
There are several different hypotheses that you can identify, but I want you to only focus on one.

237
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:43,089
So like for any situation, like the opioid epidemic, for example, there could be three or four different ways to address it.

238
00:24:43,090 --> 00:24:46,240
But we really only want you to focus on one intervention.

239
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:51,340
So, for example, you could say that you want to improve physicians pain management training,

240
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:56,350
and that would be your hypothesis, and then you can list how you'd like to achieve that.

241
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:07,210
So whether that's through giving powerful pain medications in priority to people, whether it's through administering pain medication a systematic way,

242
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:17,290
or whether it's through training physicians to recognize addiction to opioids so that they can help patients manage their withdrawal symptoms.

243
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:24,120
Right. And then another example of a hypothesis could be increasing transparency in the prescription process.

244
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:32,100
Right. That would be physicians disclosing their financial ties to different drug manufacturers or pharmaceutical companies.

245
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:39,350
And there's also modifying patient reimbursement schemes.

246
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:46,170
So making it so that physician payments are not linked to the number of prescriptions that they're making,

247
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:52,440
so that so that there's not as much of an incentive to overprescribe and there's no financial incentive for it.

248
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:57,810
Right. So all three of those are potential hypotheses, but we would really like you to only pick one and focus on it.

249
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:05,659
Okay. Any question. Was going to stop there because that was the biggest kind of like the most complex section.

250
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:11,360
So let me know if there's anything you want to ask about hypotheses or how to draft them.

251
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:19,170
No. Yes. It's like, should your hypothesis be?

252
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,829
No. I mean, you know, it should be as close to accurate as you can get.

253
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:28,120
Right. But should it be based on something, something that's already been done or something that's.

254
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:32,500
Or should we just use our imaginations to come up with? So whatever.

255
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:37,380
Use your imagination and also the facts that are in the case.

256
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:43,380
We don't expect you to do any outside research for this or to have any sort of like external knowledge.

257
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:51,810
So just based on whatever information you identify in the case, make sure that you use that to develop your hypothesis that you're missing.

258
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:56,800
Okay. All right, so the next section will be proof and action.

259
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,100
So proof is the evidence. You have to support your hypothesis.

260
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:10,090
So this is where you identify what the evidence is that actually shows that your hypothesis and your solution is valid.

261
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:18,490
Right. And also consider what other evidence you need to gather to show that your solution is actually going to be potentially successful.

262
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:26,440
If you want to look at paper towels, you can. And as far as actions go,

263
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:37,380
you would also need to discuss how you would actually implement your hypothesis and what that implementation would look like and proof in action,

264
00:27:37,390 --> 00:27:40,810
even though it's kind of two separate sections that we would like to see it on.

265
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:44,380
Just one slide, I'm just quickly into the point as possible.

266
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:58,239
So an example of a proof is. The stats on stats on opiate consumption, for example, would be a proof of whatever hypothesis you're proposing.

267
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,300
Right? Overdoses and deaths by race and economic status.

268
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:08,890
So this evidence would point to why your hypothesis, your hypothesis and your intervention is the right one for your specific situation.

269
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:16,900
And also, data on financial ties between manufacturers, physicians and advocacy groups could also be helpful.

270
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:26,290
Again, all of this data will be found within the case, and for any proof that's not in the case, you can just say that I would like to see this data.

271
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:35,790
But you don't actually have to go out and find it. And then as far as actions go, actions would just be.

272
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:39,609
How you would implement your hypothesis, right?

273
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:49,180
So whether that four opioid prescriptions making physicians follow revised guidelines doctor professional societies

274
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:58,480
whether it's the state health department and the FDA having a shared central system to monitor opioid prescription data,

275
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:07,240
or whether it's some federal health agencies working with state and county health officials to monitor the prescriptions and also overdoses,

276
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,540
rate and communicating risks related to operation functions.

277
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:16,900
So actions are just kind of, again, what you would do to actually implement your hypothesis.

278
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,830
All right. Any questions about that before we move on?

279
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,260
No. Right. So the last section is alternatives and weaknesses.

280
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:35,960
So alternatives are just identifying potential alternatives to your hypothesis or your solution.

281
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:43,310
You would have to identify two alternatives and then describe how they might be stronger or weaker responses to the case.

282
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:55,100
Right. And as far as weaknesses go, in addition to a number of alternatives, like, for example, the first one could be restricting the use of opioids.

283
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:01,180
Second could be strengthening regulatory oversight. It'll be just like alternative hypotheses, right?

284
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:05,510
So if you identify two or three of three hypotheses and you decide to go with one of them,

285
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:12,260
this is the section where you just show what the other ones are and what their strengths and weaknesses are.

286
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:22,100
Actually not their weaknesses, just their. We'll just discuss why they're stronger or weaker.

287
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,910
And then the actual weaknesses section. You state the weakness of your own hypothesis.

288
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:33,170
You don't have to state the weaknesses of your alternatives, just of the hypothesis that that you yourself are proposing.

289
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:40,630
And these could be potential weaknesses. All right.

290
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:47,230
And this is kind of just an outline of what the site would look like. So you have a cover side, including the names of your group members.

291
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:58,719
Then you have your situation questions and brainstorming, your hypothesis, your proof and action and your alternatives and weakness and alternatives.

292
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,730
But that would be both. As you can see, it's just six slides.

293
00:31:04,250 --> 00:31:08,390
Please keep it to that. We don't want you to like writing a book in 45 minutes.

294
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:17,500
Yeah. Any question? All right.

295
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:22,340
So that is basically all there is to the case presentations.

296
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:30,080
Now, I'm just going to go over the late word policy. Obviously do your best to submit all assignments on time.

297
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:37,700
But if you need an extension, please contact me. Each student is eligible for one extension for any reason.

298
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:46,000
For three days. Four days assignments. Right. So these are the assignments you'll have in addition to your policy logs.

299
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:53,030
And for one of these assignments, you can have a three day extension for any reason.

300
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,900
So if you like feeling sick one day or.

301
00:31:56,900 --> 00:32:04,710
I don't know. If you're feeling sick, but you don't actually think you're good after three days and you don't,

302
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,780
then tell me the reason why you can just ask for the extension for one assignment,

303
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,709
and then additional extensions will be available only in emergency situations.

304
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:23,300
So this is like if there's actually something happening. In the policy lab attendance.

305
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:29,320
Policy lab. You should really try to attend all of them if you can.

306
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:40,569
There are certain situations where for emergency reasons, for illness, for COVID or whatever, you will not be able to attend a discussion section.

307
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:42,910
And in that situation, please just email me.

308
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:50,560
Basically what you'll have to do is you'll have to make the sixth slide that by yourself for that topic for that week,

309
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:54,880
and you'll have to email it to me up to or you have to,

310
00:32:54,950 --> 00:33:04,180
you know, to meet at least a week afterwards and just contact me if that happens and you get that what I believe it's one want to say once.

311
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,150
It's too quiet. All right, well, there's two times you can do that this semester without penalty.

312
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:21,480
Okay. Office hours. Currently my office hours are 2 to 3 p.m. on Thursdays.

313
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:25,470
Does that work with all of your schedules? If not, I can change them.

314
00:33:27,050 --> 00:33:30,770
Anyway, of course, during that time. Yeah.

315
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:39,470
Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, normally we get all my class for the tuition.

316
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,290
Can you just raise your hand to give a class or anything? Okay.

317
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:46,440
But it's a lot of people. How about three or four?

318
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:51,760
On Thursday. I have cuts across the world.

319
00:33:54,010 --> 00:34:01,690
All right. For that, I'm just going to look at you real quick and.

320
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:07,640
I'll let you guys know whether it has them available. And we do this real quick to figure that out.

321
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:13,200
I think she's right.

322
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,770
No, I figured in that. I know. I didn't know.

323
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:30,260
But I said, well, I think you appreciate all of the things that happened this week about how on Monday Monday that for.

324
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:37,879
Her. I have left Catwoman.

325
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,230
Therefore, I can't, because we've still got, like, four people.

326
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:46,380
I mean, maybe we can have, like, personal if we want a special an appointment with you.

327
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:50,000
Is that possible? Yes. So it can work.

328
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,750
Okay. How about this? I'll. I can send out a poll to you guys.

329
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:00,890
And we'll go with the. Day.

330
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,750
That's like the day in the time that works for most people.

331
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:11,820
And whoever is not available during that time, just feel free to email me with any questions or you can meet me individually as I work.

332
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:22,470
All right. Okay. And then group signup. So can you guys get yourselves into groups of 4 to 5 people right now and just.

333
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,150
Write down who was in your group. And then just give it to me.

334
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:35,620
Well, I'm going to give you what I'm trying to say that they have heard, and I will take a good amount of time, like 20 minutes.

335
00:35:36,610 --> 00:35:39,700
Is that worth it? I don't know what it is.

336
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,960
Mix and mingle. All right.

337
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,599
Let me ask them. Who actually prefers to, like, choose their group members?

338
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,240
Like you guys know each other? Yeah. All right.

339
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:59,230
So in that case, I'll let you get to the group members, and I'm going to set a timer.

340
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,210
Is 20 minutes like a fair amount? Do you think that too little? That's fair.

341
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:10,160
Maybe like five, 10 minutes. All right, let's. Let's do the thing.

342
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:14,580
10 minutes for the timer for 10 minutes or something.

343
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,460
Oh, no. Oh, yeah. Oh, my God.

344
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,410
I know. I mean. Okay.

345
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,290
Oh, yeah. I believe you.

346
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:32,280
We celebrate. He sits with us.

347
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:37,570
I think in my life, I would definitely submit.

348
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:43,140
Yes, actually.

349
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,080
So, guys, real quick. I have a paper up here. When you guys have your group members, I'd have a pen to just come and write it down.

350
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:55,770
You guys are you wrote on this one.

351
00:36:56,630 --> 00:37:00,420
Started with us as a family.

352
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:11,550
So we're. Well, it doesn't have a guru.

353
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:18,640
Yeah, you're right. Yeah. Why don't we have anybody else who doesn't have to?

354
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:27,640
Congratulations. This is the group of us that we have.

355
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:39,730
What do you got today? I had no idea that I to take care of correctly.

356
00:37:39,850 --> 00:38:01,240
We're supposed to be rooting for because I think that's something think we all have in their mouth.

357
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:11,590
Okay, well, we're getting interesting notes right now.

358
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:28,870
I'll find out about it because doesn't know who we are.

359
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:46,400
That's right. I remember you. So you realize that he's not in general, right?

360
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,180
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

361
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:56,080
Yeah, I just. I didn't like it.

362
00:38:56,420 --> 00:39:01,740
Yeah, it was just more. I know it's like that, like.

363
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:15,110
But I was like. I'm just thinking, I guess, like, I think, oh, yeah, you're right.

364
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:24,490
It's a very, very dangerous thing because there's no.

365
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:28,430
Remember what you said.

366
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:43,070
Yeah. Yeah, I'm actually I want to be, like, a third year, and so it's like 380 degrees.

367
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:49,270
I don't know. It's just 1975, but it's going to get better.

368
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,460
I think it's more like they're going to get it.

369
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:59,229
Shouldn't be, too. Yeah, especially the first year.

370
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:02,710
And that's what happened last year. There were good, I guess like.

371
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:09,710
Yeah, it was okay cause I was just, like, you know, every year.

372
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:18,290
Yeah. Yeah. Entertainment for you don't know what I mean.

373
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:27,060
Here. We're coming back, and we are going to be like, you know, I'm okay.

374
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:33,110
I'm going to drive my [INAUDIBLE] nuts.

375
00:40:34,630 --> 00:41:05,580
All right, all right. Well, you know, I know I always out urging, mostly because it's going to be 3.3000000.

376
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,000
Well, that's what I was talking to the press also.

377
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:27,070
2317 that would let me know like it's going to be funny some Republicans have of your side.

378
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:34,000
Oh yeah. I was like, oh, obviously I wasn't here.

379
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:43,040
But as soon as I said to wait for you because now you have your groups.

380
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,360
Yes. All right. Um, if you have the name, you can just pass them up to me.

381
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:52,450
Oh, okay. All right.

382
00:41:55,370 --> 00:42:01,890
Yeah, yeah. Well, I heard.

383
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,950
Right, right, right. What about you?

384
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:12,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

385
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:21,290
And it's like, you know. Yeah, like the whole outside the body was like.

386
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:43,120
Yeah, I mean, or you talk about how you get to the point where, you know, I don't know how it's done.

387
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:58,300
And I really I try to bring them into its own format or, you know, why it's interesting from the Marvel Universe or over here.

388
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:03,940
And I always look, I think, I think and I was like, yeah, I really what is this?

389
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:15,900
You know, like sort of golden age for clinical microbiology as well.

390
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:25,910
That's what I wanted to ask my biggest question.

391
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:40,160
You know, I think we all wanted to be like, oh, that was just like personally required for me on this one.

392
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:49,810
But yeah, I was just thinking when I was about to raise your hand, if you haven't like joined the army, raise your hand if you haven't.

393
00:43:49,810 --> 00:44:03,910
You know, one thing I know I'm not sure about the last ones and the losers.

394
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:09,280
So these guys, just real quick, next week there's going to be a policy lab.

395
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:14,050
There's, of course, back on canvas that you need to purchase.

396
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:20,440
And then the case will be the guys in their case. So you'll see that it's one of the first cases in the quarterback.

397
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:24,130
Just make sure you read it beforehand. That's the required reading.

398
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:28,690
There's also a recommended reading on how to analyze the case.

399
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:33,790
You don't have to do it, but it'll be helpful. Yeah.

400
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:43,480
Thanks for coming guys I question are these are they will be also just sit tight for like.

401
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:50,570
2 minutes because I'm going to assign you two groups on canvas. I just want you guys to know, like, what group number your specific numbers.

402
00:44:51,950 --> 00:44:55,820
So should we set them up? Yes.

403
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:08,590
Or anything like that. Oh, well, why not?

404
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:15,950
It was because I was just really honest with you.

405
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:29,760
I don't know. And I really didn't like it when you were in.

406
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:34,760
I was passing around my laptop for networking purposes.

407
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:40,070
If you would like to join my network, read your email and.

408
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,240
Thank you. Thank you. Oh, you know, that's going to be the next step.

409
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:54,320
It was like, oh, no, this is only my personal.

410
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:58,540
Yeah. Yeah. I did not trust.

411
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,920
We just want to be friends with. Guess you. I say you're cute.

412
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:09,870
I was in group three. Oh, we are. You mind if I add a random person to your group?

413
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:13,470
There's one student who wasn't here today. So we know.

414
00:46:14,140 --> 00:46:18,330
It's just. That is the name. What's her name? And her name is Brooke Amir.

415
00:46:18,510 --> 00:46:27,250
Oh, you guys know her? I made a sounds like the Crusaders didn't know when they were opening open.

416
00:46:27,510 --> 00:46:36,010
And, you know, I think we have a.

417
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:45,230
Hey, you know, we took Brooklyn and we covered, you know, we're pretty well.

418
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,550
Okay. Okay. Yeah, that's. Yeah. Great advice.

419
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,360
Yeah. Oh, good idea. For the second straight, someone even a little bit nervous.

420
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,950
Are you sure? Yeah. 911, right?

421
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:05,760
Yeah. Well, I'm moving to your group, and then I like that.

422
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:19,080
I don't want to go like we are going out for this.

423
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:25,570
I mean, it's part of what we are. I know you said that.

424
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:38,420
Yeah, I agree. That's right. What's clear is that almost everyone is so nice, but, hey, you know what?

425
00:47:41,010 --> 00:47:44,060
Everybody. I didn't know.

426
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,910
I didn't know.

427
00:47:52,180 --> 00:48:00,630
You know, she said she said, I know, I know.

428
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:07,010
I was like, I just met someone.

429
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:22,540
Yeah. He's like, Oh. Everyone knows everything.

430
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:32,530
I know about that.

431
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:50,710
On the other side of it.

432
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:06,900
I just want to show you something.

433
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:41,470
What we've been talking about 100 0000000000000.

434
00:49:41,800 --> 00:50:15,550
That's okay. I wish I didn't like it, but I bet I know what I wanted to start to hear so much more looking at 1.36 130 miles point hour.

435
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:29,420
It's nothing like it is. You know what I'm saying?

436
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:36,670
That's in the thing. That's going to be a few minutes.

437
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:52,290
That's not what this is. Yes, I do.

438
00:50:54,690 --> 00:51:03,980
I think the clients realize that it was that was making them, she said.

439
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:11,030
You better begin to drop them off.

440
00:51:12,220 --> 00:51:27,710
Does that mean that you don't want to talk to me like I was yesterday?

441
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:32,450
We don't really want to let you go.

442
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:43,280
I realize. I think you're for more.

443
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:48,770
What's your name? My name?

444
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:53,090
You know. Yeah.

445
00:51:55,460 --> 00:51:59,440
So you're going to be in and ally.

446
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:10,610
And thus now I must be having this as an outpouring of love.

447
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:22,850
This one. I don't know why I.

448
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:34,440
I haven't. So I don't know.

449
00:52:35,870 --> 00:53:01,220
But I guess I think that's why I that like everybody else around the world, we're seeing some metrics in the past few days so that.

450
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:13,480
That is all I learned about this.

451
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,820
Well, you don't do anything like that.

452
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:34,980
Would you rather see one day we get a little more experience?

453
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:48,540
I want to know about them all.

454
00:53:56,110 --> 00:54:17,880
I mean, I love it when nine year olds are going to have like a certain amount of time.

455
00:54:18,430 --> 00:54:31,450
But now the time for me to do anything, it's just right right here in my family facility.

456
00:54:38,040 --> 00:55:04,100
For a long time. I'm like, Oh my God, I only know his father to be further developed for him.

457
00:55:04,130 --> 00:55:12,360
Because I was just wondering, oh my God.

458
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:21,799
I was like. So I see where you're going, really.

459
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:28,760
And that's really good for America.

460
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:36,920
All right, guys, just real quick before and kind to run through your group numbers before we all head out.

461
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:43,460
Five eight is Matthew, Audrey, Audra, Haley and Jordan.

462
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:48,540
Five be, is there? Or Zachary.

463
00:55:48,540 --> 00:56:04,250
What do you prefer? That's fine. I must be Jimmy and Amare faces and Eddie, Ariana and Anastasia.

464
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:07,650
And on we. If I pronounce anyone's name wrong, please correct me.

465
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:14,889
And the next group is Madeleine or Maddie.

466
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:18,040
Maddie. Mary. Maddie. Maddie.

467
00:56:18,460 --> 00:56:24,050
Okay. Are you guys both Maddie? Or is one of you. I go right now.

468
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:29,680
Goodbye, Madeleine. Madeleine. Maddie and Jessica.

469
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:34,780
And Maria. And then five and Aaron.

470
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:38,200
Scarlet and three are Grace and Brooke.

471
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:43,280
All right? Yeah. Yeah.

472
00:56:43,450 --> 00:56:47,919
Does everyone have that down? Okay. All right, guys.

473
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,140
Thanks for coming to class today. We're doing some fun stuff.
