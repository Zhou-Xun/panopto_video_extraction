1
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:06,330
Let's get started. I got called all of a sudden yesterday.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:16,559
Let's talk about in detail your final paper, because I want to put this on the forefront of your mind,

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,640
because pretty soon you'll have to turn an outline into me.

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:32,100
So again, the paper essentially is a culmination of all the learning objectives and knowledge that you'll obtain in this class.

5
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:39,870
So the paper is scaffolded in the same way that the modules or the course has been laid out,

6
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:51,329
where you kind of start out by picking a topic and providing some very basic, you know, either epidemiological or infectious disease data on it.

7
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,610
You'll talk about, you know,

8
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:03,510
social determinants of health inequities in that response and then potential solutions integrating in three levels of health care.

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,340
So, you know, in your course and your canvas, there are three commentary examples.

10
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,540
And this is about going to be about ten pages, double spaced, hundred points total.

11
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,570
So it is worth a good chunk of your grade.

12
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:31,409
So the criteria that you're graded on is that the commentary does need to explicitly address at least three levels of public health community,

13
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:39,210
local, state, federal, what have you. Your introduction and background sufficiently describes the scope of the problem.

14
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:46,230
Arguments and points are cohesive. Commentary is supported by discussion of social determinants of health.

15
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:56,380
Commentary is supported by discussion of how more equitable response could be achieved and then explicitly states action items or recommendations.

16
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,940
So with this commentary in the particular, in your conclusion,

17
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:07,410
you should have a very explicit list or bullet point list about what your specific takeaways that you want it to be.

18
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,499
Now can be, you know, it is a commentary,

19
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,820
so there isn't necessarily like right or wrong answers so long as it's supported by peer reviewed literature.

20
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,960
And I'll give you some examples of paper topics and then references,

21
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:28,800
at least ten references in APA format mostly try to focus on peer reviewed articles.

22
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:33,150
One of my students on my online class cited Wikipedia as one of their sources.

23
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,750
No, I don't mostly do websites.

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,200
And then about 2500 words. Just ballpark it.

25
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:50,490
I don't like look at the word count unless it's very obviously like three pages, double spaced and then clear organization.

26
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,499
So from my online class that just ended, you know,

27
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,160
people generally tend to pick topics on their commentary near and dear to their heart or something of great interest to them.

28
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,400
So again, I had students from all over the country.

29
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:14,430
So one student in particular talked more about equitable emergency response in black communities and Alabama.

30
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:23,160
Another student in particular talked about emergency response in Palestine because she's Palestinian.

31
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:31,500
Another student talked about, let's see what we think.

32
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:40,139
So that's another person picked the topic in Detroit. Another person who worked at the local county health department in Ottawa County.

33
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,860
Our Ottawa County here talked about a specific outbreak that happened there and how it could be more equitable.

34
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:57,540
Previous years, we've had students talk about, you know, infectious diseases and Middle Eastern North African populations in Dearborn.

35
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,430
You know, specific outbreaks in Native American reservations.

36
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:09,060
Let me just. Briefly let me turn off this.

37
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,180
What? The reporting will still see this code on how to sleep on cookies.

38
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,090
Okay. So let me just refresh myself really fast on what other people did.

39
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:37,390
Hmm. Oh, one person did it on Shiga toxin producing e coli.

40
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,049
That's another person. That was the Mississippi one.

41
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:51,610
Another person talked about Alabama. Another person who was a pediatric care nurse specifically talked about the need for encouraging vaccinations,

42
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:53,740
again, for vaccine preventable diseases.

43
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:03,490
And then oh, and then another person talked about infectious disease response for persons experiencing homelessness.

44
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:11,469
So these are kind of like the range of topics that, you know, you can start thinking about.

45
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:16,680
But essentially you'll have some some milestones here in that class needed peer review.

46
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:21,090
But since this class is a little bit different, there won't be peer review.

47
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:26,979
I'll be looking at your paper topic. So your your first assignment is to turn in an outline for me,

48
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:32,830
essentially that will be like it says specifically in the assignment, what is required for that first one.

49
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:37,690
But you're going to have to have decided on a topic and then start looking at some sources

50
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:44,140
on it and then provided like a very rough outline of how you want your commentary to go.

51
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:54,610
And then the second check in is you'll have fully written your introduction to your commentary and then have had a more detailed outline given,

52
00:05:54,610 --> 00:06:02,770
and then I'll provide you feedback on that. And then the final time I see it, which is Finals Week, will be the full commentary.

53
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,280
Highly, highly recommend you don't put this off until the last minute.

54
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:16,440
I had ten students in my online class and one student again.

55
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,980
Remember that class was six weeks, right? One student didn't turn that in, so it dropped her grade down from an H to a C.

56
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,200
Yeah. Yeah. So don't put this off. Don't put this off.

57
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:33,930
Do I have any questions yet about this final assignment?

58
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,530
Yes, it would be difficult doing it on another country since we have a.

59
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:47,440
Emergency response in the U.S.? I don't think so.

60
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,050
I feel like it because you spent your summer in Thailand, right?

61
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:58,580
So if you wanted to do Thailand, as long as you have enough sources and interests to, like, do the research to put that together, great.

62
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:06,999
Go ahead and do that. Most people do focus on the United States, but they I would say the more compelling commentaries that I've read,

63
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,399
focus either on a state or a specific situation or a county,

64
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:19,100
because one of my students did just like one wrote it very broadly and COVID response and another student wrote it very broadly.

65
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:28,209
I think, again, unlike COVID response, these are two different semesters and it's not that compelling of an argument because it is so broad.

66
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:37,780
It's really hard to hone in on what this specific action items or recommendations are that seem like really novel and thought out.

67
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:47,530
Does that make sense? Yeah. So, I mean, if you want to do another country, like by by all means, you don't have to like be an expert in it.

68
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:51,100
It just requires you to do a bit more research. Yeah. Yeah.

69
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:59,850
My other questions about the assignment. Okey dokey.

70
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,390
So just let's see where we are in the class.

71
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:14,630
Okay. So you do have quiz for coming up in a little bit.

72
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,890
Your paper outlines do the week after, then remember your homework number three where you have to interview somebody.

73
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:29,149
I hope by now you've started initiating contact or have thought about it again.

74
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:37,970
My on one of my online students. It is a six week course and I mentioned this week one for six weeks could not find anybody to interview.

75
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:47,540
So I ended up allowing him to do a modified assignment because he literally asked me the night before, Can you make me a new assignment?

76
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:51,080
And I was like, No, that is so much work on my part.

77
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:57,680
So he ended up doing his on Jon Snow, not the Game of Thrones one,

78
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:06,190
but like it was more like a historical interview and he wasn't able to answer a lot of the questions since they're kind of like modern day questions.

79
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:11,800
So obviously he did not get full credit for that. So that is due in like less than a month.

80
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:22,570
So just want to get that back on your radar. So you just have a couple quizzes left and then essentially your paper and homework theory.

81
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,970
So not too bad, right? I like that.

82
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:31,190
It's not too bad. Okay. All right.

83
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:36,170
Yeah. Bradley, the interview does have to be somebody who works in infectious diseases.

84
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,230
Emergency response. Or is it somebody we like their job?

85
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:47,510
Like, what is that? It can be somebody who works in infectious disease, only it can be somebody who works in emergency response only.

86
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:58,540
It can be somebody who does both. Just like not someone who works at, like, Kroger or like a restaurant or like something like that.

87
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:04,130
Yeah, I didn't know how. Like, broad of public health. Like somebody in another public health field.

88
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:07,610
Oh, yeah. Related to the class. Related to the class.

89
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:13,790
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So if you, like, interview, like, I don't know, like a dietitian.

90
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,070
I don't know. I mean, you could connect that somehow to the class, but I think it would be challenging.

91
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:29,290
So, I mean, most people end up like interviewing physician ID physicians, someone from like a local health department.

92
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:35,709
One of the students was able to get Doctor Saskia Pop askew,

93
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:41,890
and she's a pretty like well known infectious disease epidemiologist on the Twittersphere.

94
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:50,940
And he just contacted her like via Twitter and was like down to her and was able to get an interview that way.

95
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:58,959
So like Reach for the Stars say, I think Dr. Fauci is retiring now, but like she's tried like reach for the stars.

96
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,100
I don't you never know. People love like to talk about themselves.

97
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:09,100
So definitely like if you're emailing them or sending them a DM like put it as a for frat.

98
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:17,889
Like I'm a grad student in this class trying to learn more about what you do, super interested and give you over the phone.

99
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:24,700
It could be over zoom if you meet them here in real life, like maybe take them to coffee or something like that.

100
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:31,900
And then it's also acceptable. Some students weren't able to talk to the person directly because they're like super busy.

101
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:39,370
So the list of questions they have in the assignment, they just sent them the list of questions and then the person just like fill that out.

102
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,690
And then the student was able to like write the assignment from that.

103
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,780
So. Yes, yes. Other questions about the interview.

104
00:11:52,050 --> 00:12:02,880
Okay. So last lecture we ended on the exercise where you did your ecosystem mapping and then we kind of talked about downfalls.

105
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:11,670
We talked about social justice and environmental justice and what happens when there is downfalls in addressing those at the local,

106
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:17,219
state and federal level. So today we'll be talking about capabilities.

107
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,250
We as public health professionals have to be champions for equitable disease response.

108
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,600
And then we're going to talk a little bit about what we can do with advocacy.

109
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:32,730
And then we'll be specifically looking at this case study with the line three pipeline.

110
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:46,109
Right. So we as public health professionals, it's so important for us to acknowledge our history of where we've been.

111
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,870
So the American Public Health Association.

112
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:55,860
Oh, I'm sweating, but okay, I should have worn this jacket, but I'm wearing a white t shirt and I don't want to go.

113
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:03,330
Okay. So the American Medical Association has declared racism now as a public health threat.

114
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,830
So if we take a look at the history of our institutions,

115
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:15,299
both in contemporary in historical context, like APJ is definitely has not been perfect, right?

116
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:26,880
As well as the AMA. So we have to look within ourselves and ask how have we perpetuated potential harms and how are we trying to address them?

117
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:34,710
So for example, a couple of weeks ago I showed you that commentary that came out in the Journal of American Medicine.

118
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,939
That was a commentary where they're like, re physicians can't be racist.

119
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:47,040
Remember that one? And then recently I'm on academic Twitter, which is very like a wild show.

120
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,480
It's very toxic sometimes.

121
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:57,749
But there's recently been a whole like backlash at EPA, which historically has been a very respected institution in our field.

122
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:08,549
But they have every year their annual conference. And so as like the for most organization in public health initially for that annual

123
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:14,970
conference which usually has anywhere between 8 to 15000 attendees depending on the year,

124
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,720
they weren't going to require masking. Okay.

125
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,940
Which is like, oh, and I've already been to some professional conferences.

126
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:28,530
I went to the American Industrial Hygiene Association over the summer and I was like,

127
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:31,860
Oh, industrial hygiene is like, we all know about respiratory protection, right?

128
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,250
Like, I feel like I was one of the 5% actually wearing my mask.

129
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:40,399
And then, of course, after the event, they sent out an email saying, like, we've gotten notifications.

130
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,190
Some people have gotten like COVID from the conference.

131
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:48,629
They did ask us to, you know, do send in our vaccine information.

132
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:53,670
So we had like a screening chat society and toxicology was the same way.

133
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:57,930
I heard masks weren't required superspreader event as well.

134
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,860
All these conferences. But you'd expect APJ to be one of those places, right?

135
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:13,160
And then another splash is every year they have some like cool speaker, somebody who comes to talk.

136
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:22,480
And so, you know. The in previous years, as I mentioned, they had Dr. Camara Jones, who did the gardener's deal,

137
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,430
or they had the previous CEO of Planned Parenthood come and talk.

138
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:32,620
So this year they had a panel and one of them was Dr. Leana Wen.

139
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:39,910
She's Asian-American. She's like a she's a physician, but now like a pundit, you see sometimes on CNN.

140
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:50,259
And a lot of people don't like her because during the whole COVID pandemic, they kind of saw her as like a like a political cog,

141
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:56,889
where despite what she knows as a physician and a health care provider and a public health professional was very much like,

142
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:02,590
let people go back to work. It's good for the economy, blah, blah, blah, etc.

143
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:12,760
So a lot of people were are boycotting attending the conference this year and then was like, we're not going to take her off the panel, etc., etc.

144
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:18,100
So, you know, definitely these these institutions are not perfect.

145
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,410
I saw some of you in 510 this last week where I did the responsible research conduct talk,

146
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:30,070
talking about like, again, the different medical testing atrocities that have happened.

147
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:39,340
But the second is to try to address misunderstandings about why people are asked personal information,

148
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,830
especially when we're trying to do our research or help others in the community,

149
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:48,639
like asking questions about race or ethnicity or their contact information,

150
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,970
because this can stem from historical mistrust of public and health institutions.

151
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:03,070
So it's important that we leverage our skills and expertize.

152
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:10,810
Front camera motion. Okay. I don't know. Is there most of us have knowledge and health disparities and inequities.

153
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:16,900
How many of you have family members or friends who are predominantly outside of public health?

154
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:25,900
Okay. How many of you have like had to try to have conversations with them explaining social determinants of health?

155
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:36,150
Did it go well? I see head shakes make it too difficult a concept for them to grasp.

156
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:41,400
No, just resistant to it. Yeah, to an extent.

157
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:48,060
I come from a very rural area, very conservative. Okay. So there was, like, some pushback about it.

158
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:59,570
Okay, I see. I see. Mira. So my grandson's my grandpa, but he's a very sheltered mid-western, and he's like, whatever, your grandpa.

159
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:03,930
So I think he's so set in his ways. Nothing I could possibly say will change that.

160
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:11,670
I'm not trying to necessarily think it is different because I remember like you made a comment about Trump and I said,

161
00:18:11,670 --> 00:18:18,440
I know I'm going to talk about Trump interview with his own, obviously on the climate change and abortion and all those things.

162
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,610
I'm like, Oh yeah. But I mean, it's just they're so religious beliefs.

163
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:28,800
Everything is in the media reaffirms those beliefs that makes it really hard to those difficult conversations about.

164
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:37,020
Yeah, yeah. I feel like I will definitely say like I have not a person who enjoys conflict.

165
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,310
I guess most people don't. Right. Ah.

166
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:46,200
But you know, like sometimes you can have a healthy discourse, but I think we've reached a stage in our society where there's some people who,

167
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:53,910
you know, there's absolutely like nothing you can say to them that will change their mind about what their beliefs are.

168
00:18:53,910 --> 00:19:01,860
And in fact, some people will just like double that. One of my favorites that I like to watch is from The Daily Show.

169
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:10,530
One of the correspondents is Jordan KLEPPER, and he goes around to a lot of these conservative rallies and questions people.

170
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:14,819
And he's very sharp at like responding to people on the spot.

171
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:24,270
But it just when he interviews people, the the logic of what they're saying doesn't necessarily hold up,

172
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:27,270
but they can you can see the conviction is there. These are fun.

173
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:34,709
YouTube could go watch now and cause obviously but but then with some folks that I've talked to you know they

174
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:39,780
don't necessarily like it's not that they're trying to be like willfully ignorant or set in their ways,

175
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:46,080
but they truly don't see what the connections are between like the built environment,

176
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,110
you know, socioeconomic status, access to health care facilities and then these more, you know,

177
00:19:52,110 --> 00:20:03,239
like upstream outcomes like injury and mortality rates or fatality rates and also, you know, they are strengths in engaging with the community.

178
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:12,629
So as I briefly talked about before, like community based participatory research, this is a method of research where we're not working on communities,

179
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:20,760
we're working with them and engaging key stakeholders, whether that be individuals or organizations within the community,

180
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:28,620
to partake in our research to help develop the research questions, the study design, give input on the recruitment,

181
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,900
help with the recruitment, and then they partake in the dissemination of the findings as well.

182
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,860
Does this take longer? 100%.

183
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,020
It probably takes three, four or five times as long.

184
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:50,160
Right. And that's why people who do CV PR generally aren't, you know, as prolific or researchers as some other folks.

185
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:56,910
Right. But this is the kind of thing that we care about in terms of translational work that we're doing.

186
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:05,430
It's not about getting the most sites or putting your papers out there, but actually making that like on the ground impact.

187
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:12,629
And then in particular, learning how to build relationships between tribes, scientific organizations,

188
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:18,360
researchers, professional orgs, and racial and ethnic serving minority groups.

189
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:27,330
How many of you have had a chance to, like, do some work where you've built community based partnerships?

190
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:34,130
I'll say like half of the class. Did you find that fulfilling?

191
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:38,720
Yeah. Do you plan to continue in the future or hope to.

192
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,870
Okay. It takes them.

193
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:49,690
It takes a lot of time. I think it's just tricky as students, you know, because you're working on a project temporarily.

194
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:52,760
Right. You never know where the class ends.

195
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:57,860
Yeah. So then it's like, do I go and volunteer? How? Like, how do I stay involved?

196
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:09,320
Yeah. And it's really I would say that it falls heavily on the shoulders of like the faculty member, the person leading the initiative.

197
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:18,650
Right. Because you may come and go or sometimes some of you graduate and stay on as like research associates for projects like am I cares for example.

198
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:27,590
So for me, sometimes you may not actually ever find out the outcome of what you did.

199
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,670
Like when I said, like when we're in public health, we're in it for the long game.

200
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:35,350
You don't necessarily get to see what you do immediately.

201
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:43,880
So, you know, for my master's thesis, I was looking at like assessing mental health among Bhutanese refugees.

202
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:52,040
And I did focus groups with refugees from Bhutan, but I also did semi-structured interviews with providers at that clinic,

203
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:57,230
because how that clinic works is actually in Omaha, Nebraska.

204
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,240
They resettle a lot of refugees that come into the United States.

205
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:11,000
It's one of the main like Haven cities, just because there's a large Catholic Charities initiative there and the Catholic Charities hospital system.

206
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,150
And so with there's a few clinics throughout the city that the, you know,

207
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:24,980
new refugees come to to get their initial physical exam and all the vaccinations that they need that they might not have had yet.

208
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:34,580
And then this clinic so happens to be a patient centered medical home, which I think we've talked about that before in this class.

209
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,380
Was that at my other class? No. Okay. Not this fast.

210
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,630
How many of you have heard the term patient centered medical home? Okay.

211
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,470
Abby and Ian. Okay. I won't make you explain it.

212
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,899
I will explain it. So, you know, like. Yeah, generally how it works is like you're.

213
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:58,430
You don't feel good. Okay. So you go see your PCP or your general physician.

214
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:03,440
And then they are like, they either fix a problem or they're like, I can't fix this problem.

215
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:08,690
Go see a specialist. And then they like. And then you wait a few weeks, months, whatever.

216
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:13,420
And then they kick you off to a specialist and a specialist reads the records.

217
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:19,009
Or basically, like, sometimes you have to repeat yourself all over again, and then they either fix it or you don't,

218
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,890
and then you kind of get like punted around to these different providers.

219
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:27,770
So Patient-Centered Medical Home is this model of health care, which they use, in fact,

220
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:35,000
a lot of federally qualified health centers where you're assigned a T, a team that provides you care.

221
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:41,450
So in this particular clinic that I was interning at, they had like a green team, red team,

222
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:54,650
blue team that would consider consist of like a registered nurse, a caseworker, a resident physician, and then an attending or head physician.

223
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,350
And the team together would talk about patients in the morning huddle,

224
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:06,170
like who they were seeing that day and what their integrative solutions are for treating that patient.

225
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:12,350
But also, so everybody was aware and like on the same page as treating that patient.

226
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,490
So this clinic that I was at was at a patient center, medical home.

227
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:25,000
And so when I was interviewing providers, obviously they said very different things about the mental health among Bhutanese refugees.

228
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:36,140
Essentially what we found out was these refugees from Bhutan were coming and their twenties and thirties all having debilitating physical pain,

229
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:43,070
which they could not figure out the origin. Most of them had had CT scans, physical tests.

230
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:47,150
Nothing wrong with them physically. What was it?

231
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,899
It was psychosomatic trauma. Right.

232
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:55,310
So it was like mental health issues manifesting on the body.

233
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,129
So, you know, I did my. Blah, blah, blah. And then I gave them some recommendations.

234
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:07,090
And then I went away and graduated and moved to another state and whatever.

235
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:15,549
And at that time, there was no mental health care for these refugees who were coming from Bhutan,

236
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:25,270
because in Bhutanese, the language Bhutanese, there is no word equivalent to depression or even sadness or anxiety.

237
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:29,650
The only word they had for sadness was specifically meant.

238
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:36,310
You are sad when someone you knows dies, but in terms of like their actual language and vocabulary,

239
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:43,810
it did not have like the nuance or the depth that we do to describe like different forms of sadness,

240
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:51,760
like we have languishing, for example, apathy, existential crisis, whatever have you not.

241
00:26:52,510 --> 00:27:00,780
So two years later, I've been on Facebook, friends with one of my preceptors and she I say happy birthday to her.

242
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,319
And then because, you know, that's the only time you really interact with one Facebook anymore.

243
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:11,050
And then she messages me privately and she was like, Aurora, like, I forgot to tell you,

244
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:22,899
we now have an in-house mental health care provider that is provides multilingual services now, like based on your recommendations.

245
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,350
And I was like, I made a difference.

246
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:31,420
I was a master's student. Incredible. Right? But sometimes you honestly, like, never know.

247
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:37,720
So I think it is in public health. Yes, it is very frustrating to do what we do,

248
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:42,280
but we got to play the long game and got to keep in mind that sometimes these good things do actually happen.

249
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,970
And so in terms of the workforce, right, in diversity, there is beauty and there is strength.

250
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:52,330
This is a quote from Maya Angelou.

251
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:58,990
Now we're trying to encourage more black indigenous people of color individuals to join the public health workforce.

252
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:05,880
And this not only allows for the provision of culturally and linguistically appropriate resources like we were talking about yesterday.

253
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:16,719
KING But it can also improve public health messaging campaigns reach and then also putting bipoc individuals in leadership positions,

254
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:22,900
as we have known mostly historically, has been given to cisgender white males.

255
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:29,890
Women, interestingly, make up about 80% of the public health workforce,

256
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:36,610
but are paid less than their male counterparts and are less likely to hold leaderships of position.

257
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,330
So even if you take a look at all the schools of public health in the country and who the deans are of the school.

258
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,230
Right. More likely to be men than women.

259
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:55,900
We are moving, you know, further down the line where we have people of color, male people of color now in leadership positions.

260
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:00,670
But there's still that gender inequity there.

261
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:13,870
Data is super key. Like I mentioned in the previous class, there is a dearth of data that is collected specifically in these minority communities.

262
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:18,010
And if we don't understand, like what the picture of the situation is,

263
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:25,450
it's hard to justify that to other stakeholders to ask for funding, to get them to address that as a specific issue.

264
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:29,440
And obviously I'm biased because I'm a mixed methods researcher.

265
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,080
So I think there is there's value in both quantitative and qualitative data.

266
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,370
There are some people who are very much like one way or the other.

267
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:49,210
And I have found that generally quantitative data people will poo poo qualitative data because they think that it's soft science, right?

268
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:55,809
Or it's like not real. So I would say that there's certainly value in both.

269
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:03,340
Yes, we need things like odds ratios, case fatality rates, prevalence rates and incidence rates.

270
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:06,670
But there's only so much numbers can tell you.

271
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:09,670
Yes, you can extrapolate conclusions from it.

272
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:16,389
But what do you know actually about the experiences and the uptake of the services?

273
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:27,910
Right. So like we talked about previously, you know, with low vaccine receipt rates among black people for COVID 19,

274
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:35,680
you might look at your data and say, okay, we need to give black communities more access to COVID vaccines.

275
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:43,630
And you plop down a clinic at the county health department and you're like, No one came.

276
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:49,660
I guess this is why they just don't want the vaccines, right?

277
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:56,530
And that kind of in a way I don't know, is somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy.

278
00:30:56,530 --> 00:31:01,440
But if you. Had gone in and also done interviews, talked to people, collected qualitative data.

279
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:06,449
People are going to go to the county health department. People will go to the local church.

280
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:13,650
People will go to the local grocery store. People would prefer like a drive in mobile clinic to get it right.

281
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:21,890
Or did I tell you about my experience a couple months ago, talking to doing a train,

282
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:30,090
I did a training for Ypsilanti Community Utilities Authority and there and I was talking about infectious disease prevention.

283
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,600
And then I did a very brief part on COVID vaccines,

284
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,610
although the supervisors asked me to cut out a good chunk of it because they thought it would be

285
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:43,739
too controversial and spicy for their particular workforce because they know their own workers.

286
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:50,220
Right. Did I tell you about the story about the worker I talked to afterwards who was black?

287
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,100
So he was very nice and super polite.

288
00:31:54,120 --> 00:32:04,410
He is a black man who works at the Community Utilities Authority, kind of talking to me about why he doesn't want to get the vaccine,

289
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:11,700
about why [INAUDIBLE] never get the COVID vaccine and why he's not vaccinating his children either.

290
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:19,259
And so, like, you know, I'm trying to be receptive, like people have their legitimate reasons, right?

291
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:22,499
So, you know, he's kind of explaining to me his stance.

292
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:29,580
And I acknowledged to him, like I acknowledge I said to him, like I to you, that you as a black man in this society,

293
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:35,520
like I understand the historical foundations of you not trusting these public health institutions.

294
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,700
You're not trusting these medical institutions. And he was like, Yeah.

295
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:49,590
And he was like, I don't get it because I've had COVID already and it honestly wasn't that bad, so why would I get this vaccine?

296
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:57,270
And he said, It just seems so different because some people I know got really sick from the COVID vaccine,

297
00:32:58,170 --> 00:33:00,210
not from the COVID vaccine, but just from COVID.

298
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:07,049
And I said, you know, I was talking to him and I said, you know, like you work here at utilities, you're not you're a lineman.

299
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:16,440
You're not one of the people who works in the office. So for the last ten years, you've been working with untreated sewage water.

300
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,090
Right. So you've been essentially more or less microdosing yourself.

301
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:27,450
And you probably have a really robust immune system because you've been exposed to

302
00:33:27,450 --> 00:33:32,040
just so many pathogens and you've probably gotten sick a lot over the last ten years,

303
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:38,909
but now your immune system is really strong. And I asked him, who are the people you know, who have gotten really sick from COVID?

304
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,600
Do they have office jobs? And he was like, Oh, yeah, they do.

305
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:47,759
And I was like, Well, they're very different than you in terms of the kind of exposures they've had.

306
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:55,140
So I told him, like, I understand personally why you may not get it, but this is why it's important for other people to get it.

307
00:33:55,590 --> 00:34:04,709
But you know, like having these conversations or even collecting this kind of like informal qualitative data is useful for us as public health

308
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:12,240
professionals to better tackle these infectious disease emergency response issues because it helps you get the full picture.

309
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:13,840
Okay.

310
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:25,920
Lobbying for US public health funding has decreased in the last decade, and pre-COVID health departments have been losing personnel left and right.

311
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,339
Right. So when things go well, nobody remembers.

312
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:36,090
We exist. We're generally pretty quiet and in the background. And then when things go wrong, we are the bad guys.

313
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,579
Investment in primary care and public health infrastructure.

314
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,030
So what we saw with Ebola was when the issue was happening,

315
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:50,220
they threw hundreds of millions of dollars at like building up the infrastructure here in the United States.

316
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:53,670
And they let a lot of that funding expire in 2020.

317
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,989
And then same thing with COVID.

318
00:34:54,990 --> 00:35:02,969
Now we throw a bunch of money at it, but we were doing like essentially putting a Band-Aid on like a giant gaping wound.

319
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:07,170
We're not thinking about things like building the public health workforce,

320
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:14,010
even brick and mortar improvements of improving like physical infrastructure of our buildings.

321
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:25,380
So if any of you are interested in public health policy or getting into that realm, we definitely need folks that are willing to speak up.

322
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:34,500
Speak up. I would say, like I think especially I'm a millennial and I guess most of you are at Millennial or Gen Z.

323
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,709
I give its kudos because I feel like our generation does definitely does speak up more.

324
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:51,380
And in my department, I definitely speak up a lot, a lot more for someone who doesn't have tenure, but I don't care because I feel like I dare you me.

325
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,749
But like, you know, I feel like it is the right thing to do.

326
00:35:54,750 --> 00:36:03,059
And a lot of people in public health still. Even don't speak up on the issues or stay quiet because they don't want to deviate

327
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:08,280
from the status quo or this is making more work for me until I go this other way.

328
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,400
But if we don't do this, like, things are always going to stay the way they are.

329
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,800
So I just want, you know, to do like a think pair, share, like small group, whatever.

330
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:33,480
Just to get a pulse on what's going on. What conversations regarding the role of public health professionals are you hearing about right now?

331
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:39,300
Right. Thanksgiving is coming up. We're going to have some of these convos with our families.

332
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:45,540
And are you challenging anything like previously upheld notions or rhetoric?

333
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:50,129
What are some concrete examples about this?

334
00:36:50,130 --> 00:36:53,430
So I'm just going to have you like turn to whoever is near you.

335
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:57,780
What are people thinking about public health professionals at this time?

336
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,080
And then we will regroup. Okay.

337
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:18,530
I was like, you know what?

338
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:27,500
I knew that was like I responded with these elective surgeries that and if you like.

339
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:39,900
I thank you for joining us for a cause we need to underscore the vaccine is going to be a large meeting.

340
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:52,760
And hopefully, I think a lot of people I got to hear something before that.

341
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:05,460
I feel like it's basically yeah, like, yeah, I was nervous because I felt like I was up to something.

342
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:16,600
Not only did you feel that no communication there, any type of like it or not like.

343
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,750
Yeah, they're just. Maybe you could.

344
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,270
Yes, you did. I actually did.

345
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:35,820
The one and only one you think had a very well, if you were a young man, you have a greater interest because you started like.

346
00:38:38,430 --> 00:38:47,460
But you have to make it sound like really it was a drone strike, you know, like you know where to turn in your own case as.

347
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:55,130
The theory is that the idea that something that wasn't exactly right,

348
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:07,640
you don't think it is going to work for anyone in school like this one was there.

349
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:13,200
I do it and all I want is a I really like I don't have to worry about.

350
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,830
What if I don't like it?

351
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:24,240
Yeah. Yeah. Feel like I'd say.

352
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:30,230
Yeah. Just because you want to kick back if you like. Yeah.

353
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:50,160
And you don't like people that don't agree with you that gets in the way and the people are trying to like you just wait another year or two.

354
00:39:51,740 --> 00:40:03,200
Yeah, but yeah. Maybe I feel better. I can't say that I like but know I think there is.

355
00:40:03,650 --> 00:40:13,850
Yeah there is that. Well there are like cell phones like my dad is like like he's not like your health care insurance.

356
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,340
Like that doesn't help me. Yeah, I know it.

357
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:34,650
Yeah, yeah. And I. Yeah, you know, I mean, I'll take my insurance.

358
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:49,130
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

359
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,040
I was going to, you know, I think those various things.

360
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:58,740
There's a reason national chains are strong. Like, I'm not going to get exemption.

361
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:13,510
Och, you're in construction you're going to third grade some very lively can those would anyone care to share with the group what you discussed.

362
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:23,270
I'll start. I talked a lot about it depended on how close to the people are to health care.

363
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:29,720
And I think a lot to do with education level because like if I talk to friends and family there,

364
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:36,950
they have more of a distrust, I think, because of COVID and everything changing all of the time.

365
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,469
But then, like I told Burnley,

366
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:47,960
I went to my PCP and told him I was getting my master's in public health and he thanked me and said that we need more people in public health.

367
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:52,400
That's not right. So it's like I think it just depends on who you talk to.

368
00:41:52,400 --> 00:42:01,010
But like anyone really outside of health care, I think have more of like a negative outlook.

369
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,600
Okay. Other combos.

370
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:17,540
So we kind of talked about like our individual roles as public health professionals, the future professionals,

371
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:28,219
and how we kind of are presenting public health ideas to our family members and close friends that we're trying to counter misinformation that

372
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:36,470
they have and like they're forming echo chambers and just bouncing ideas off of each other when they're not really looking for reputable sources.

373
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:42,740
That's a challenge for sure. Anyone else want to share?

374
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:51,270
I feel like it's a really mixed bag right now as COVID did not help us.

375
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,400
Some people really like us right now. Some people really hate us right now.

376
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,180
And another big topic that's coming up, especially now that, you know,

377
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:05,310
the elections are coming up, is abortion because people say abortion is health care.

378
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:15,209
Right. Lots of opinions about this. Even in my own neighborhood, I saw some signs on people's lawn that says like no on Prop three.

379
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:23,250
Right, because it's confusing. Last night I was watching the latest episodes of Love is Blind Season three.

380
00:43:23,510 --> 00:43:26,339
I mean, who's anyone watching? Okay.

381
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:34,770
There is a real there is a conversation between this couple about abortion rights, but they are located in Dallas, Texas.

382
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:40,200
So, yes, yes, it is a difficult time for all of us.

383
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:50,760
I feel like depending on where you fall within like public health practice, some areas are less prickly than other areas, right?

384
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:59,520
So like maternal and child health, nutrition for children, healthy air quality for kids generally.

385
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:05,940
If it's with kids sans the vaccines part, right, you'll generally have most people on board.

386
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:10,590
But things like climate change, for example, they don't understand.

387
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:17,070
They think that climate change equals global warming and they're like, Well, it's snowing.

388
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:24,990
How can there be climate change? So it is an emotional labor for us to take on.

389
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:28,800
But it's, you know, what we signed up for, so.

390
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:33,660
Yeah. Thank you. All right.

391
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:42,540
So time back to last last lecture where we talked about a lack of environmental and social justice.

392
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,200
We're going to look at this case study here in the Great Lakes.

393
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,400
How many of you have heard of Keystone XL Pipeline?

394
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,320
Yes. Okay. That's like a big one, but it's not in the Great Lakes.

395
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:05,670
So that's our bottom line three is very similar where this is a oilsands pipeline owned by the Canadian corporation, Enbridge.

396
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,209
Now that I live in Michigan, I get targeted ads.

397
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:16,980
So I'm seeing a lot of like Gretchen Whitmer Tudor dicks in there's always on YouTube that injury

398
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:23,010
lawyer that's like driving on Michigan roads is more dangerous than driving on a speedway.

399
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:37,139
Have you seen that one? Yeah, that guy. And so I've now seen targeted ads that are from Enbridge where they're like providing Michigan clean energy.

400
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:43,469
It's like, yeah, this is oil, okay? But they are a Canadian corporation that has operated since.

401
00:45:43,470 --> 00:45:48,390
I also see ones too. But these years I'm a glassner.

402
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:59,639
They operated since 1968, and gas pipelines are indeed the most efficient way to transport oil.

403
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,790
Like we're talking interstate pipelines to transport oil.

404
00:46:02,790 --> 00:46:12,510
Right. Because if you try to transport their transport oil in barrels, you have to transport them on semis across state lines.

405
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:18,210
That's potentially hazardous materials that can catch fire, etc., etc.

406
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:22,620
So essentially you're just piping these things through very efficiently.

407
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,150
You're not costing extra gas to move the oil.

408
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:36,720
And so this pipeline in particular runs about a thousand miles from Hardisty, Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin.

409
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:45,330
But over time, this has been Enbridge has been the source of millions of gallons of oil spills.

410
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:50,310
So in 1991, in Grand Rapids, Minnesota, not Grand Rapids, Michigan,

411
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:56,490
this was considered the worst inland oil spill in U.S. history, and this was caused by Enbridge.

412
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:06,390
Okay. In 2014, they proposed this new construction of this pipeline segment along different routes in Minnesota

413
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:11,730
to try to increase the volume of oil that could be transported across the United States.

414
00:47:12,030 --> 00:47:18,419
And you remember in the last administration, they kept, you know, saying like, forget Russia, forget the Middle East,

415
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:29,940
forget vopak like we're going to harvest oil from here in the United States, either in Alaska, we're going to drill, you know, national forests.

416
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:39,300
Forget those. There's oil underneath there. So 337 miles of pipe that would run through Minnesota and then 14 miles through Wisconsin.

417
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:45,750
But some of the proposed paths run through Native American reservations existing.

418
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,380
Native American reservations.

419
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:58,810
So if you look here, there's a line five pipeline, line five tunnel, line three pipeline, and then the proposed replacement.

420
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:13,840
So currently the pipeline runs through this area where it is mostly avoiding larger chunks of the reservoir.

421
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:21,100
Well, it runs through the reservations right now, but the areas in yellow are part of the 1855 treaty that was established,

422
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,840
essentially saying this part of Minnesota is now considered Native American reservations.

423
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:32,440
So with the replacement project that they're proposing, they want to cut into this treaty area.

424
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:39,430
So what is the primary issue related to social and environmental justice with this?

425
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:45,100
It is that, again, the burden of environmental pollution falling on to communities of color.

426
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:55,780
So we don't necessarily just get ground or surface pollution from the oil spills, but there's also water pollution.

427
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:01,570
So the pipeline does cross a number of rivers and watersheds, including Lake Superior.

428
00:49:02,110 --> 00:49:09,520
And a lot of these indigenous populations on these reservations very much are about sourcing from the land.

429
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:13,510
So when there's water pollution, that also impacts food supply,

430
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:17,800
but it also impacts our food supply, too, because people fish in the Great Lakes all the time.

431
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:27,970
There's concerns over climate change. There is, again, a disregard for native and indigenous populations for these treaty violations,

432
00:49:28,510 --> 00:49:32,860
but feeding into historic and contemporary environmental racism.

433
00:49:33,310 --> 00:49:37,780
And there's additional issues accompanied with pipeline construction,

434
00:49:38,260 --> 00:49:45,820
first being pipeline abandonment, but the second big one being increase in drug and sex trafficking.

435
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:53,140
Does anyone understand what the immediate connection between pipelines and sex and drug trafficking are?

436
00:49:56,670 --> 00:49:59,940
Okay. I don't know if you all have HBO, Max.

437
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,139
There's a but. Okay, so there's an interesting you all know Lisa Ling.

438
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:08,550
She's a reporter, Asian-American reporter from Sacramento, my hometown.

439
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,710
But she has an interesting show, docuseries called Like This is Life with Lisa Ling.

440
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:17,549
And when I was first presented with this issue was like many,

441
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:27,150
many years ago where she was looking into drug and sex trafficking among mining towns and pipeline towns in particular.

442
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,270
Because when you're building pipelines, generally,

443
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:37,829
you're bringing in a lot of temporary or seasonal workers with contractors to mostly

444
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:44,580
isolated rural areas where a lot of them are there literally just for the work.

445
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:50,280
And they tend to live in like motels or extended stay situations.

446
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:59,160
And because how rural and isolated some of these places are, there's literally nothing to do but like go to bars.

447
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:09,720
So as a result, like the, I would say service industry along the pipeline routes, there's a lot of bars in particular.

448
00:51:10,590 --> 00:51:15,810
And these these contractors are predominantly male.

449
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:21,210
Right. So as a result, there happens to also be a lot of prostitution.

450
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:27,120
But then that leads into sex trafficking and also illicit drug use.

451
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:34,830
So if you think about it, like back in when they were in California in particular,

452
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:42,000
where there are a lot of laborers who were building the railroads and the infrastructure for the transcontinental railroad,

453
00:51:42,330 --> 00:51:48,150
and there were like, oh, there's all these men, there's too many men. And they like me to like be some women.

454
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,420
So they started bringing literally like mail order brides from Japan and China and abroad.

455
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:57,720
Right. To, like, marry these men. Yeah.

456
00:51:58,570 --> 00:52:05,600
In. In California. Right. So they wouldn't be as lonely when they're working these kinds of jobs.

457
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:11,090
So it's it's, you know, like a modern day version of that.

458
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:18,180
But most of the people who are victims of the sex trafficking tend to be from that community.

459
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:27,450
Yeah. Yeah. Bernie, you're just going to say it also reminds me of when U.S. soldiers went off to war and lived in places,

460
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:35,480
for instance, in Vietnam, and then they would kind of just trash the area or the area would have a lot of bars.

461
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:40,380
And they were young white men who felt like they had power.

462
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:43,560
And so I think that and so I feel like it was a similar thing. Yeah. Yeah.

463
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:51,870
And there's still a huge stigma about it. Like during the Vietnam War, there were so many soldiers who had children with Vietnamese women.

464
00:52:51,870 --> 00:52:58,530
And so if you're like a biracial child who's half white living in Vietnam,

465
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:03,600
like up until very recently, there's still that stigma that essentially your mom is like.

466
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:15,000
An unseemly woman. You know what I'm saying? And a lot of those children grew up very, like, stigmatized and marginalized in their communities.

467
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:20,760
Yeah. Yeah. But then, you know, like, as Americans coming in, they don't necessarily think about those implications.

468
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:24,660
So I do want to show you this. What is this piece?

469
00:53:25,690 --> 00:53:35,140
Yet. PBS This PBS clip regarding the pipeline in office, President Biden signed executive orders aimed at aggressively tackling the climate crisis,

470
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:42,579
including stopping construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. But now many people in the Great Lakes region are asking the administration to

471
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:47,080
halt a different pipeline project they believe poses an even greater threat.

472
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,460
30 years ago this week, the line three pipeline in northern Minnesota ruptured,

473
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:57,070
spilling 1.7 million gallons of crude oil into a frozen river near Grand Rapids, Minnesota.

474
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:05,290
If the river had not been frozen, the oil could have seeped into the Mississippi River and contaminated drinking water for millions downstream.

475
00:54:05,830 --> 00:54:10,780
Protests have been ongoing to stop construction, rerouting a section of the line three pipeline,

476
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:14,620
which could impact indigenous communities and local waterways.

477
00:54:14,890 --> 00:54:22,000
And as news our weekends have Feliciana reports some say it's time to stop oil pipeline projects in the US once and for all.

478
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:29,240
I've got. Facing freezing temperatures in January.

479
00:54:29,450 --> 00:54:35,329
Environmental and indigenous activists in Minnesota protested an oil pipeline project

480
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:40,280
underway in the Great Lakes region by Canadian owned energy company Enbridge.

481
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:48,880
We walked ourselves down inside of a pipe which is going to become the library pipeline, and we're here to stop them promoting this pipeline.

482
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:54,799
Whether they see the line three pipeline is bad for the environment and local communities and

483
00:54:54,800 --> 00:55:00,680
that projects like these set the US back in the transition away from burning fossil fuels.

484
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:09,350
Enbridge aims to replace an existing line three pipeline that is corroding and operating at a reduced capacity.

485
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:12,650
Mike Fernandez, a senior vice president at Enbridge.

486
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:20,660
It already exists, so it's unlikely the recent decision on the Keystone XL pipeline, which was a new pipeline,

487
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:28,010
but the replacement does involve building a new 337 mile pipe along a different route in Minnesota.

488
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:32,300
That will nearly double the amount of oil the current pipeline carries.

489
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:41,810
It crosses more than 200 waterbodies and 800 wetlands to carry tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada to Superior, Wisconsin.

490
00:55:41,990 --> 00:55:45,650
Fernandez says the pipeline replacement provides many benefits,

491
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:53,450
including more than 4000 jobs during construction and additional tax revenues to northern Minnesota in a slow economy.

492
00:55:53,690 --> 00:56:03,920
And it's everything from transportation, fuel heating homes that can be refined into plastics that are used for computers and television sets.

493
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:10,100
Right now, the economy very much depends on this, and I get people's concerns.

494
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:21,770
The reality is, is that pipelines are the most efficient and safest way and most environmentally sound way to transport this needed fuel.

495
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:29,750
The project, first proposed in 2014, got its final permit approval last November from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

496
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:36,410
Replacement work began in December. Since then, dozens of people have been arrested for protesting the project.

497
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:45,800
That includes Winona LaDuke of Indigenous Climate Justice Organization, Honor the Earth and member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota.

498
00:56:46,310 --> 00:56:50,510
You have women like myself. I'm a grandmother, you know, and we're standing out there.

499
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:53,720
I have six charges against me for this pipeline.

500
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:58,400
And there's a bunch of us that are facing charges for, you know, trying to be a water protector.

501
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:06,170
The Duke and others have been part of the seven year fight opposing the project throughout the state and federal review processes.

502
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:13,490
It is the largest tar sands pipeline in the world. This pipeline is the equivalent to 50 new coal fired power plants.

503
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:17,990
So, you know, if you're trying to save the planet, this is not the way to do it.

504
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:24,590
A report by Climate Justice Organization 350 Dawg and a physicist at Macalester College in Minnesota

505
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:31,040
found the line three expansion would increase the state's existing annual greenhouse gas emissions.

506
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:38,450
We don't need any more oil pipelines. You know, it's the end of the party who wants to be holding the last fossil fuels pipeline.

507
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,110
In its latest effort to stop line three. Last December,

508
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:50,720
honor the Earth joined the White Earth and Red Lake Nations and the Sierra Club in filing a federal lawsuit against the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

509
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:57,920
The lawsuit argues that the Army Corps didn't adequately assess the potential for exacerbating climate change when it approved the permit,

510
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:00,830
nor its impacts on indigenous treaty land rights.

511
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:07,580
Tara Houska is coaching First Nation Anishinaabe and the founder of the Indigenous led Canoe Collective.

512
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:12,470
Treaties are in the U.S. Constitution as the supreme law of the land. You know, it's time to to honor.

513
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:20,120
The Treaties in a different way. She says the replacement pipeline opens up new areas of the state to potential spills

514
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:25,340
that could pollute fragile waterways and other ecosystems in treaty territories.

515
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:28,430
We've got a president that maybe, maybe actually respects treaty rights,

516
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:35,270
that maybe actually respects the environment and is calling himself a climate president, isn't to call himself that.

517
00:58:35,270 --> 00:58:38,420
And we need action, not just the words, we need the action.

518
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:45,950
Beginning in 1979, the old line three pipeline caused several oil spills along its route in the Great Lakes region,

519
00:58:46,250 --> 00:58:55,820
including the largest inland oil spill in American history in 1991, and a fireball explosion in 2007 that killed two people.

520
00:58:55,850 --> 00:59:01,400
As a result, in 2008, Enbridge cut line three's operating capacity by nearly half.

521
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:09,050
Mike Fernandez says Enbridge understands the environmental concerns, which is exactly why a replacement project is underway.

522
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:14,540
It's been six years of study and scientific review and technical review and as

523
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:20,600
a consequence there are actually 320 route modifications that have been made.

524
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:29,450
This is viewed as essentially a modernization and a project to upgrade what's there so that it is safer.

525
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:32,690
So it does have less impact on the environment.

526
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:39,950
Fernandez believes protesters don't speak for everyone as Enbridge employs native people who are working on the pipeline expansion.

527
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,540
And at least one Ojibwe tribe has agreed not to oppose the project.

528
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:52,070
It's like people are just against pipelines because they fear anything that's fossil fuel.

529
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:57,790
But this is something we're already dependent upon. When I see protesters and we've had, you know,

530
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:05,750
for administrative law reviews and we've gone through all of this work with U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Indian Affairs.

531
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:14,630
It's a little bit like the election where we've gone through the entire process and still people want to not accept that legal process.

532
01:00:16,610 --> 01:00:22,040
But protesters in Minnesota say they don't want modifications to the old infrastructure.

533
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:25,580
They want oil pipelines like these to become obsolete.

534
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:30,380
They back under Enbridge's permit with Minnesota's Public Utilities Commission.

535
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:38,120
Enbridge must reimburse public safety agencies for expenses at worksites, especially costs for policing protests.

536
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:46,520
Last November, a minnesotan sheriff's office requested tens of thousands in reimbursements for additional riot gear and weapons.

537
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:53,360
Winona LaDuke says that funding should be a red flag for anyone who supports the project.

538
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:57,020
I am not a criminal. I'm a water protector. At a certain point,

539
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:07,400
someone has to ask what is right about a Canadian multinational financing the police force in your state to put in a pipeline with so much conflict?

540
01:01:07,610 --> 01:01:13,850
LaDuke says. A trial date of March 23rd has been set for the federal lawsuit that seeks to halt the project,

541
01:01:14,090 --> 01:01:20,900
which is on track to be completed by the end of the year. Yet opponents hope President Biden will intervene before then.

542
01:01:21,230 --> 01:01:26,720
More than 200,000 people have signed a petition asking him to stop line three.

543
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,410
In the meantime, the Duke says protests will continue.

544
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:37,580
Imagine if there are 50 or 200 people facing cops and it's ten below zero.

545
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:43,110
You know what's coming spring and more people come.

546
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:53,580
More water protectors will come. I guarantee you that. Okay.

547
01:01:53,600 --> 01:02:00,060
Thoughts and reactions to that video. All right.

548
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:05,110
Well, what are the connections then to infectious disease outcomes?

549
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:10,920
How does this environmental justice, social issue, justice issue relate to infectious disease outcomes?

550
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:20,580
Again, what we talked about before in previous weeks, tying it back to you again, tying this back to what we've discussed in the class.

551
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:29,790
Air pollution in particular makes individuals who live in these communities more vulnerable and susceptible to respiratory protection,

552
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:41,430
degrading and tearing up this land gambler's that barrier between vectors and diseases and the water pollution obviously

553
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:49,650
coming from subsequent oil spills and then accelerating climate change when you saw like the output if the pipeline goes in.

554
01:02:50,400 --> 01:03:01,469
So oil spills in health in particular, oil spill spills frequently release volatile organic compounds and viruses are very,

555
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:05,190
very small and so much so that they will go.

556
01:03:05,190 --> 01:03:09,899
They are essentially raspberry wolf actions that go into your alveoli that cause

557
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:15,450
lung irritation and for studies where they've looked at biomarkers like blood,

558
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:19,500
urine, etc., for people exposed to oil and gas spills,

559
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,950
they have found increased respiratory damage, liver damage, decreased immunity,

560
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:29,730
increased cancer risk because there's often things like benzene in their

561
01:03:30,270 --> 01:03:36,150
reproductive damage and then also higher exposure to hydrocarbons and heavy metals.

562
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:40,049
So I'll just, you know, know good things all around, right.

563
01:03:40,050 --> 01:03:51,300
It's not just like Don commercials with them washing ducts or whatever, but there are arguments for this pipeline in particular,

564
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:56,910
as I mentioned, the graphic designer who worked on this beautify my slides for the course.

565
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:05,339
She's Canadian and she comes from a town where she said, like people who she knows are relying on these jobs for the line through pipeline,

566
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:13,919
because a lot of these towns have been abandoned or their businesses have been slowly closing over the decades.

567
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:17,790
So the economy is just very stagnant and crippled.

568
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:23,910
So, again, like they showed in the video and that Enbridge, the oh, of course, was like this is job creation,

569
01:04:24,210 --> 01:04:33,750
tax revenue and then increased safety in terms of rail and oil industry as it's not being transported on these other means of transportation.

570
01:04:34,110 --> 01:04:40,890
But again, environmental injustice, social injustice and then higher disease burden.

571
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:44,310
So where are we finding the balance with this?

572
01:04:45,650 --> 01:04:54,050
What happened. Okay, now we're with ABC Nightline.

573
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:57,590
Oil and Water Battle four, line three continues.

574
01:04:57,770 --> 01:05:04,390
Here again, Byron Pitts. Said another carefully ready.

575
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:10,230
It's just after dawn. We are heading out today.

576
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:16,350
We're going to show up and, you know, utilize our voices in our bodies.

577
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:21,360
Tasha Martineau is leading a resistance to construction on the Enbridge Line three pipeline,

578
01:05:21,870 --> 01:05:28,020
which crisscross through her home tribal lands of the Fond du Lac Reservation in northern Minnesota.

579
01:05:29,980 --> 01:05:33,010
When we take to the front line, please remember why we are here.

580
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,920
Way when we go nowhere. We are not here to fight the police.

581
01:05:37,930 --> 01:05:41,230
We are not here to intimidate workers. We are here for that water.

582
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:47,520
I personally carry a lot of fear every time it actually happens.

583
01:05:49,350 --> 01:05:56,370
It's because, you know, I prioritize the safety of all of these amazing, beautiful people who are literally willing to run into battle.

584
01:05:59,970 --> 01:06:03,150
We're here at an enbridge water pump station.

585
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:15,270
We're blocking the gate. We're stopping this work because we are stopping this pipeline during violence that's out there on 97051.

586
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:21,159
Yet. What I see is rapists, murderers, killers.

587
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:28,690
A mother here and here. Are you at?

588
01:06:33,670 --> 01:06:39,080
You want to be wearing a uniform that you want to feel like.

589
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:51,650
Yeah. The resilience of our people lives within me.

590
01:06:55,360 --> 01:07:01,930
That's right. What? And it's this community that taught me to stare.

591
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:07,860
Fonda lack strong. Standing for something.

592
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:23,259
That's where our power lies. Despite one remaining tribal lawsuit this month.

593
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:31,240
The pipeline became operational shortly after Canadian oil shipments to the U.S. jumped to their highest volume this year.

594
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:36,880
So when you found out it goes online, what was your immediate reaction?

595
01:07:37,090 --> 01:07:42,880
How hard we all thought. But I did think about the disappointment and disgust and.

596
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:48,790
Minnesota's lawmakers and the Biden administration for not intervening.

597
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:53,980
President Biden Candidate Biden campaigned on the notion that he would be the climate president.

598
01:07:54,040 --> 01:08:01,570
He absolutely did. And what I've seen is a pattern of climate policy that is reflective of the status quo.

599
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:09,640
The Biden administration declined our interview request and did not respond to our request for comment.

600
01:08:11,810 --> 01:08:14,810
I sense this. You're burdened by something. What's. What's going on?

601
01:08:15,700 --> 01:08:26,900
We're coming to the end of the fight and. I'm trying to process and accept that the fight isn't over and we didn't lose.

602
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:35,820
I let the fight become me. And now I'm not sure where I sit in a better world where the Warriors are no longer needed.

603
01:08:39,620 --> 01:08:46,200
The women can see they lost this battle, but the war, they insist, is not over, they say.

604
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:50,870
I think we're that stubborn thorn that just won't go away.

605
01:08:51,410 --> 01:08:58,900
We are a new status quo they have to reckon with. We'll be right back.

606
01:09:02,470 --> 01:09:05,870
Hi, everyone. Okay.

607
01:09:06,230 --> 01:09:13,070
So with that, I just want you can like radiate or type this, take notes on your phone or whatever.

608
01:09:13,490 --> 01:09:20,060
Just to reflect on this case of the line through pipeline, what are your reactions to this like?

609
01:09:20,420 --> 01:09:26,899
Is the outcome what you thought it would be and then for future actions or changes?

610
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:34,760
Right, because there will always be the next pipeline. Maybe what actions can be taken for future events like this.

611
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:39,180
So just take a few minutes to reflect and I will check in with you.

612
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:44,420
Okay. So before I showed you that last video clip,

613
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:51,170
how many of you thought they were good in opening during just just how many of you thought they were going to stop the pipeline?

614
01:11:52,820 --> 01:11:56,960
Nobody. Okay, so we all kind of thought it was going to happen.

615
01:11:57,470 --> 01:12:01,040
All right. Surprise.

616
01:12:03,880 --> 01:12:09,900
I'm a little. I mean, I'm not surprised because the oil company oil has a big hand here in the U.S. government.

617
01:12:09,910 --> 01:12:18,610
But, you know, a little surprised at the disregard for the previously established treaties that they have with the Native Americans there.

618
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:27,160
Yeah, I don't remember what when they were interviewing like the lead guy for like Enbridge.

619
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:33,710
I don't know, like what program that was on, but there wasn't like also the they were interviewing someone,

620
01:12:33,730 --> 01:12:39,370
well, I guess they weren't from a community, but like he was contradicting himself and like no one addressed it.

621
01:12:39,370 --> 01:12:43,990
Like he said, it's already existing, but they're adding like 300 miles like that was not there.

622
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:47,110
Right. So it was kind of just like taking his side.

623
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:56,110
And then there were like some they didn't show like the other side, like people who were protesting it, but not like pointing out everything.

624
01:12:56,110 --> 01:13:02,860
He was, like saying that was like not correct. Yeah, it's very politicians like CEOs and XL kind of do like that politician speak.

625
01:13:03,160 --> 01:13:09,130
So I think what his intent was is that, yes, this is in 100% a brand new pipeline.

626
01:13:09,140 --> 01:13:15,490
It already exists. But the modification does add an additional 300 feet.

627
01:13:16,330 --> 01:13:23,530
Abby, I'm jumping on this like we don't like anything or, like, you know, just in general, like,

628
01:13:23,950 --> 01:13:30,639
he needs major training, but like, you, like, I don't love that he compared those that were protesting it.

629
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:36,790
To those that don't accept the election results, I was like, those are not those are not comparable analogies.

630
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:45,160
Like that's not something you should go. Yeah. So conveniently, you know, grasping at straws perhaps.

631
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:47,800
Yes. Oh, she was insane.

632
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:54,310
Oh, well, he was like saying like, well, we did all this work, so they have to accept it, like going to the army, like getting all the permits.

633
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:57,910
Like just cause you did all that work doesn't mean they have to accept anything like that.

634
01:13:57,910 --> 01:14:04,030
It probably wasn't there in the first place. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

635
01:14:04,030 --> 01:14:17,980
He was very CEO. Ask, So what can we actually do in the future then for this, you know, like pie and pie in the sky, what do you think can be done?

636
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:23,749
Nothing. Burnley. I was curious like who is paying for the pipeline?

637
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:32,060
Like is Canada paying or is the US Army Corps also is the because I know the US government when we have huge projects like the Keystone pipeline.

638
01:14:32,090 --> 01:14:36,770
Yeah, other stuff. There's like a NEPA process where if you're getting federal funds,

639
01:14:37,010 --> 01:14:43,819
you have to go through like an environmental impact assessment and that's like is that effective and and all that.

640
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:48,290
But in the environmental impact assessment, you have to consider other alternatives.

641
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:55,340
So for instance, like what would be the environmental impact of having it by rail or going through like another area?

642
01:14:55,670 --> 01:15:01,730
And watching that video is like, I wonder how much of a native land I mean, you showed the map about the treaty land,

643
01:15:02,390 --> 01:15:09,440
but there's other land that's yeah, that's not necessarily like in the greenspace of the Ojibwe tribes.

644
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:15,350
So I mean, just to say that there's there's another route you could take that probably wouldn't affect as many people.

645
01:15:15,410 --> 01:15:29,030
Yes, they do. They probably don't want to cut into this this bottom part here, because it's probably populated with people, mostly poor white people.

646
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:32,660
And then up here. Right. I don't know how.

647
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:43,649
Buildable that terrain is. But I mean, it's an international international project in particular.

648
01:15:43,650 --> 01:15:50,130
So the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sounds like they're part of doing the environmental impact assessment and providing the permits.

649
01:15:50,490 --> 01:15:54,840
The U.S. government bankrolls part of it, and bridge is also bankrolling part of it.

650
01:15:54,840 --> 01:16:00,270
They're shaking hands. Everybody wins except for like these communities.

651
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:05,700
Right. Like that case we watched in.

652
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:15,120
Missouri. Where was that? This guy's. Where they built the boom.

653
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:20,530
Were they built, though? Were they built? That does lie. This, this.

654
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:27,270
They stopped the gas line. Yeah. Yeah. This was this course where we stopped the gas at black community in Missouri.

655
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:33,419
Stopped the gas line from being put in. And they were like, why are you doing in this neighborhood and not like the adjacent white neighborhood?

656
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:37,980
Right. They stopped there. But this one, Enbridge, is huge.

657
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:45,750
Chloe, I was just going to say, since I live on Lake Superior and I was interested like and I felt the effects that would have and it said

658
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:52,560
that an environmental review released by the agency found no serious threat to the lake of crude oil.

659
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:58,770
Which doesn't make any sense to me. I kind of thought that could be like a threat.

660
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:09,309
Right. And the Environmental Impact Assessment doesn't take account again until like environmental justice issues,

661
01:17:09,310 --> 01:17:16,780
environmental racism issues where they're looking primarily at like if it were an allegiance to this oil, what would happen like these?

662
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:21,700
Are we going to like destroy biodiversity to a great extent, like those kinds of things?

663
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:27,940
But the the social aspects of this are not part of that environmental impact assessment.

664
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:32,830
Yes, the Keystone pipeline, there is an environmental justice section.

665
01:17:32,830 --> 01:17:41,080
It's like a little paragraph out of this huge document. And what they claim is that everybody along the pipeline will be consistently affected.

666
01:17:41,650 --> 01:17:47,920
So there's no environmental injustice, they quote, because everybody along the pipeline is equally affected.

667
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:54,070
But of course, like you choose to put it through native land, so therefore Native people are disproportionately affected.

668
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:58,470
So I mean, it's all yeah, so much of the wording.

669
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:03,540
We'll talk more on Tuesday.

670
01:18:03,590 --> 01:18:09,060
Well, I have my thoughts about what the solutions are, but I also have to be a real meeting intended.

671
01:18:09,090 --> 01:18:10,800
So we will continue this next week.
