1
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:40,680
What is going. Yeah.

2
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,600
Okay. So for today's lab, you will practice how to use the standardization of methods,

3
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:54,590
either direct or indirect standardization to, um, to remove confounding.

4
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,900
And we have printed copies here and you can feel free to grab one.

5
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:10,290
I will give you, I think around 20 to 25 minutes to do all five exercises before we go through all of them.

6
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:45,810
She? Okay.

7
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,070
Yeah. Okay. I was like.

8
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:37,530
I want to go. Maybe not.

9
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:50,250
I to be like. You.

10
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:16,330
I like to be. Yeah.

11
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:24,820
What? Okay.

12
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,980
My. So, you know, we're the.

13
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:43,670
I. Even.

14
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:14,620
I think someone might be like, look, look at this.

15
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:25,350
I think we're just like a. You have to tell.

16
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:52,430
Three weeks. This time.

17
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,230
It's not something that you can.

18
00:08:48,520 --> 00:10:09,020
So. You.

19
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:31,410
You know. So.

20
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,960
I. Some of these.

21
00:10:42,210 --> 00:11:01,480
They're not. Me too, I hear.

22
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,470
Do you know if that's the same for the three?

23
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:27,340
Here is your story. You're not. Well, if you look at an excerpt from my first.

24
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:41,800
3189565359.

25
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:54,390
But what's really. I.

26
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,110
Because they. Just.

27
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:41,560
Oh. There is a.

28
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,430
Yeah. Like, look, this is really.

29
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:57,670
So although we should just be quiet. We talk?

30
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:02,730
Yeah. Yeah. I don't.

31
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,709
I. Anything.

32
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:16,120
Anything. This critics.

33
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:50,050
Seven. Is it one?

34
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:16,010
But they say, okay, so you're saying it was. How many?

35
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,020
Also. You know, it's.

36
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,050
Yeah. She's one of.

37
00:14:38,930 --> 00:15:30,130
Then. In the last.

38
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:45,490
She claims that. We met with you.

39
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,970
We met with. That's just before.

40
00:15:51,050 --> 00:16:19,110
Just. Oh.

41
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:48,500
Yeah, I. It comes.

42
00:16:56,610 --> 00:17:01,360
And gone through. Here.

43
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:17,300
I wish you good luck. That surprised me.

44
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:46,460
Yeah. It's like basically.

45
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:59,130
Yeah. She went.

46
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:13,930
I've got. The idea. 511.

47
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:25,020
Because of. That was my question.

48
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:34,110
I still. She? I.

49
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:42,600
Yeah, we know.

50
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:52,570
You. No, I didn't like.

51
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:12,950
I mean. It's like I'm wondering.

52
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:20,700
Yeah. And then just the nature.

53
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:34,000
I was just going to say.

54
00:19:44,950 --> 00:19:48,280
As for specific. Yeah.

55
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:19,050
What is? It's the same thing every year.

56
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:23,690
It's just. No.

57
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:31,000
Me, it was just. This money.

58
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:47,070
Let me. I'm.

59
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:13,160
Yeah, I think. I've seen many.

60
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:21,770
You know. Yeah.

61
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:29,670
Yeah, he was scared, you know? Yeah.

62
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:34,990
Oh, nice. Well. People are.

63
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,630
I didn't say that. Your.

64
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:56,650
People. I didn't think about it.

65
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:04,210
I. But sometimes the.

66
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:13,950
But it's not like. You.

67
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:25,340
Changes. You know, I'm like.

68
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,520
Either they. She adds.

69
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:54,590
Said yes with friends like to play in the.

70
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:35,240
This. You know.

71
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:51,069
I sat next to. Okay.

72
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:59,470
I saw some of you have already finished this five questions, so I'll go through them together for the first question.

73
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:08,500
Any volunteer to provide your instance rate ratio?

74
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:28,620
This question should be pretty straightforward. Come on.

75
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:34,870
I know some of you calculate this. So can you please tell me your answers?

76
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:45,400
On the first question because I guess like the following ones are a little bit complicated.

77
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,570
Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Correct.

78
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:10,290
I think for the first one, it's just like we in Alaska, we get the here the incidence rate for Alaska equal to the number of deaths.

79
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,570
Divided by the total number of the population.

80
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,890
So it should be. This many.

81
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:36,740
Per person addendum. Similarly, you can guess the incidence rate for Florida and they should be the number here.

82
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:41,990
The number of deaths divided by.

83
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:50,650
Population size here. So we got.

84
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:59,860
This many per thousand. So the incidence rate ratio.

85
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:10,980
Will be. The incidence rate in Alaska, divided by incidence rate in Florida.

86
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:14,350
So finally we got 2.6 to.

87
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:28,540
And then interpretation means that the crude mortality rate in Alaska is point six, two times more than that of Florida.

88
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:36,210
Or you can also say is. 38% lower than that of Florida.

89
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:57,450
Any wall in here is for the second question. Do you think the incidence rate ratio calculated in one is confounded by the age structure?

90
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:27,060
We can see that among us. Alaska, like for each of the age strata, the I think the weights is like.

91
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:54,130
We can calculate the weights of each age strata among each population, like in Alaska.

92
00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:02,270
It should be like the this number divided by the total population size so we can get our weights of.

93
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:13,860
This many. And similarly, we can't get to all these for using this number divide divided by the total population size.

94
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:29,820
So it'd be .29 for these strata, .29 for these strata and .25 for this second strata and point one for those oldest.

95
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:41,219
And similarly, you can get the age distribution for Florida for each of the strata using the population size divided by the total population size,

96
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,020
a ma estrella divided by the whole population size.

97
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:55,140
So we can get 2.05 for the youngest age group and followed by .23 followed by

98
00:28:55,470 --> 00:29:01,830
blind to five followed by plain to seven and then followed by a point to nine.

99
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:13,590
So obviously from like the, from the numbers here, we can see that the age distribution of the two states are different.

100
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:24,840
Right? Like the, um, the age structure of these two states differs like in Florida, like the population is lean towards older population.

101
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:46,070
Right. So what did you get for question three?

102
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:49,360
What is your standardized incidence rate ratio?

103
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,020
I saw some of you calculate correctly.

104
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:08,560
So the just be brave.

105
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:48,660
Okay. I'll just go ahead. So the the does the third question asks us to standardize the rate using the US population as the standard.

106
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:56,379
And to recalculate incidence rates ratio. Which means that.

107
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,390
So we will use the US population, understand,

108
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:09,380
earn and then calculate the standardized incidence rate for each state and then divide them to get the standardized incidence incidence rates ratio.

109
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:15,740
So. So it means like actually we're calculating the.

110
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:24,340
For like, for example for Alaska where calculating the age.

111
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:28,660
Age specific rates.

112
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:42,569
Buried by the relative size of of the population like the the population sizing each strata in Alaska compared with the US population.

113
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:45,930
And similarly we will well calculate the.

114
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:59,499
Some of the age specialist age specific incidence rates vary by the population size of each strata in Florida compared to the standard population,

115
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:10,920
the whole U.S. population. So. First of all, we can we can have the.

116
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:22,479
Like among our standard stand, among our standard population for each age strata,

117
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:28,840
like the weight should be the number of the population divided by the total.

118
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:31,600
The total number of the population so we can get.

119
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:51,140
.06 year and 0.26 for the second strata and followed by point two or six in those third strata, and then followed still by .26.

120
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:58,070
And then for the oldest strata, we have a relative size 0.15.

121
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:07,550
And then we will like we have, we will calculate the end standardized R rate in for each state.

122
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:11,510
So it should be this number divided by this number.

123
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:21,590
So for each strata we use number of deaths divided by number of population size so we can get point one,

124
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:34,940
1.28 here and .68 here, followed by 1.79 followed by 6.59.

125
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:42,080
And then for the oldest group, we have 33.72.

126
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:52,040
So the so if we standardize the population of Alaska to the whole population, we can get.

127
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:58,770
Whole U.S. population. We have got a standardized incidence rate in Alaska.

128
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:07,430
Should a e cultural. The sum of the age specific.

129
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:16,590
Rates weighted like the age specific rates through rate be rated by the relative population size.

130
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:29,310
And then we get to some of that. So we.

131
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:37,970
Multiply these numbers, these corresponding numbers, and then gather some of these numbers.

132
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:29,910
So finally we got the standardized rates in Alaska should be 7.5 for nine per thousand.

133
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:42,830
Similarly, we can add standardized incidence rate in Florida using like this using the rate calculated in these.

134
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:49,150
In this population, like number of deaths divided by population sides.

135
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,960
For each strata so we can gauge the incidence rate for these strata.

136
00:35:53,980 --> 00:36:10,180
These many followed by these manning in the second strata, followed by 1.53 for the third strata and six five for the oldest two age group.

137
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:17,590
We have this manning and then we are we multiply the.

138
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,610
Incidence rate calculated among these population.

139
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:30,000
Weight incidence rate by the relative population size of the standard population.

140
00:36:54,680 --> 00:37:03,260
So finally we got. 7.79 per sound.

141
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:14,200
So the standardized incidence rate ratio should be the divide these two number.

142
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:20,030
So we can get to a point.

143
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:33,809
Nine six. So the interpretation of the standardized incidence rates ratio would be like, first of all,

144
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:41,540
the standard that the standardized mortality rate in Alaska is only 6% lower than that in Florida.

145
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:48,450
Right. Or you can see is a point nine, six times that in Florida.

146
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:54,690
If both states had the age distribution of the whole U.S. population as ours.

147
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:58,200
How we standardize, how we get the standardized rates right.

148
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:08,130
And obviously these standardized incidence rates ratio is closer to now compared with what we calculated in one.

149
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:20,659
And this is because the like in Florida,

150
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:30,590
the higher age among the oldest population is giving a much higher wage than the corresponding rates in Alaska.

151
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,710
So any volunteers for the.

152
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:56,250
Well, question for. Mm hmm.

153
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:05,470
Not one. Yes, exactly.

154
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:14,370
This is direct, direct standardization because our standard population is our whole U.S. population, and we can sing it as an expose groups,

155
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:23,500
which also means like our standardized population is is neither like the conditions in Alaska or the conditions in Florida.

156
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:38,370
For the last questions. What's the standardized mortality rate?

157
00:39:38,880 --> 00:40:13,800
Did you get. Okay.

158
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:27,390
I believe some you or some of you calculate correctly the final number should be point 98 and we can go over how we have this number here.

159
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:39,780
Um. So remember, like the equation for standardized the mortality rate should be.

160
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:52,640
The total number of observed the event divided by the total number of expected event,

161
00:40:53,000 --> 00:41:04,219
and we calculate the number of expected events by the sum of events among each strata.

162
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:10,190
So like the event of my strata should be the incidence rate.

163
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:24,810
The incidence rate multiplied by the relative weight or population size.

164
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:38,260
So the question is that like we are will well using Alaska represents the exposed group.

165
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:44,410
Right. And so the observed the number of days should be this manning array.

166
00:41:52,170 --> 00:42:03,540
And expect a number of days for the for the LAX Alaska population where it is the standard when it is served as a stand or should be the

167
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:13,440
should be had the population of Alaska experience the incidence rate in Florida but they remain the population sizing these population.

168
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:16,640
What will be the expected number of days?

169
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:25,000
Right. So basically you are calculating age.

170
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:33,610
Age specific incidence rate in the Florida population weighted by the population weighted by the.

171
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:41,360
The population weighted by the weights of each strata of the Alaska population.

172
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:48,620
So we have the denominator should be.

173
00:42:50,530 --> 00:42:55,420
The incidence rate in Florida multiplied by the.

174
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:01,760
Weights of each age strata among Alaska population.

175
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:07,670
So it should be, I think we calculate here to be this column of numbers.

176
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:20,160
So for the second strata, the seeds are incidence rates and corresponding weights.

177
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:25,540
In Alaska, population should be this many, these many.

178
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:30,970
Similarly, we use the rate incidence rates here.

179
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:39,120
Multiply by the weights of these age strata in Alaska population.

180
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:59,370
And because the rates are like Purcell's and here is the number of deaths,

181
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:05,100
also the observed number of cases per thousand soil multiplied by US thousand.

182
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:15,820
So I think I think for the denominators, the number we got is.

183
00:44:19,050 --> 00:44:26,750
4410. So finally, the standardized mortality.

184
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,960
The ratio should be 0.98.

185
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:52,210
So what type of standardization is? I guess this is the final question for you.

186
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:16,780
So this should be indirect standardization, right?

187
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:21,910
Because our standardized population needs are Alaska population.

188
00:45:24,890 --> 00:45:44,170
It's exposed a group. And it was like I.

189
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:56,300
So this is all I have for today's lab. And if you have any questions, I will stay here until 230.

190
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:06,050
Otherwise, feel free to leave. I'm sorry.

191
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:48,420
I was. For me.

192
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:20,980
I'm. My.

193
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:35,160
Thank you. I'm glad to be here with you.

194
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:43,540
I really am.

195
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:55,990
Yeah. This is definitely like.

196
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:12,090
My. I'm. I was.

197
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:19,590
I am so.

198
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:31,160
Like job distribution and.

199
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:35,250
Yeah. Stuff. It just doesn't look like it's.

200
00:48:41,370 --> 00:49:09,330
I don't know. Oh, I guess so.

201
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:32,150
And. I think it does.

202
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:39,500
I know it's impossible, but we can.

203
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:49,260
All right. First of all, I think we should check something.

204
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:57,130
He said saw was.

205
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:08,100
Whether you multiply this by.

206
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:16,000
By 10,000 rings. Otherwise you might see more.

207
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:24,470
I mean, they're saying that they they things. These are from a treasure trove.

208
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:34,750
So I did my. Yeah.

209
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:44,850
Well, and when I say closer to now, I mean like in the lab exercise, like for the first classroom,

210
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:56,670
we have interest rates ratio ..6 to right and before the third we have playing to nine, nine, six and which one is closer to one.

211
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:03,299
The now is license. Yes. Yeah. But like the now is like is this race racial equal to one?

212
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:06,500
So I say this one is closer to now compared to this one.

213
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:09,840
Which implies more. Which implies.

214
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:17,620
Which implies, like this crude mortality rate ratio is confounded by age structure.

215
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:24,230
So there is like. This that I want.

216
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:27,890
That is a true. Yes, yes, yes.

217
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,130
Yes. That's true. Yeah. And.

218
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:38,170
When this question is.

219
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:49,710
Now give me the same thing right here.

220
00:51:51,060 --> 00:52:11,320
But we woke up late to see Suzanne Rollins, and I just asked, what could you possibly personally you name using baby as the sample uses for a.

221
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:17,160
As long as we have these.

222
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:31,090
Playing bass would be very much like the play.

223
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:44,060
No, I, I don't think so because if you standardize this using your standard, like your standard TV guide,

224
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:49,200
try to, if you compare like the standard CC using video, the reference like.

225
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:56,810
Like Mexican TV. I think I'm going to have a different age structure compared to AA.

226
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:11,700
So I think in this case. I can, yes, but I can't compare it because like CC is using TV.

227
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,780
It's not the same as a. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

228
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:25,600
So that's what I have. So basically when I have like, let's say multiple channels and all of the my friends.

229
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:31,090
All of them I guess. Yeah. Like. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

230
00:53:31,190 --> 00:53:37,770
Just like, like the question. Like for the third question, we all standardize to the whole US population.

231
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:42,820
So you can compare Alaska with Florida. Alaska or like.

232
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:49,000
Yes, yes. That's.

233
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:20,510
His optimism. What ended up happening here.

234
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:30,490
I sometimes wonder why someone like George Soros.

235
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:39,180
Priyanka Chopra. Jonas, what would you like the next? Standardization.

236
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:45,379
All right. I'm going to go out on the rock and roll.

237
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:50,560
As mentioned, you guys will be. She was.

238
00:54:54,110 --> 00:55:03,660
And you go to someone else and continue to do what you want.

239
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:07,010
I'm sure it's not something I should be paying in Florida.

240
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:14,550
With the. I'll just.

241
00:55:29,370 --> 00:55:37,670
Makes me so sure. Something.

242
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:44,330
And I close my eyes and I want to hang around.

243
00:55:50,770 --> 00:55:56,140
Yeah. Now you got to help.

244
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:22,770
Actually. He said, you hear him here?

245
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:28,070
The last time we was Florida. So naturally.

246
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:41,040
Um. Have you got your time? I feel part time.

247
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:45,200
She got one time to read that. You know what I mean?

248
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:53,220
What's that? One more time. 38% of to.

249
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:28,990
Times. 27.

250
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:05,960
With this information, you ask.

251
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:12,050
You make initial standards to standardize standardized.

252
00:58:19,110 --> 00:58:23,770
Joshua had the operation and had the same age structure of a whole life.

253
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:40,420
Saying that you just can't turn on your. You keep.

254
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,320
I don't want to continue our.

255
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:20,080
Braxton. If you want to ask questions, identify your interpretation, and also have the population of the last guys here at the same rate as well.

256
00:59:24,500 --> 00:59:27,979
The ownership had a rate change it last year.

257
00:59:27,980 --> 00:59:37,400
We ensure interest. Lieutenant General and.

258
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:49,900
So. To make way for the standardized mortality rate of.

259
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:58,710
Alaska and many have today in this many times have they experienced.
