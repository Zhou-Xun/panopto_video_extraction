1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:09,809
Good morning, everybody. So one of the pleasures of American elections is no point in having elections washed up on, say,

2
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:16,620
the Thursday after the election because we still don't have results for half year, which is my schedule for today.

3
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:23,280
So and also this class, depending on election results, tend to have different functions.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:30,150
Some years it trends more towards therapy depending on the interaction of the election results with the people in the class.

5
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,540
Some years it trends more towards kind of political science or it's easy for me to assume my customary evenhanded role.

6
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:41,460
So what I'm going to do today is basically a live version of Ask Me Anything.

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,409
I know a lot of things.

8
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:51,059
I please don't ask me about individual California races or something, but I'm going to talk through what we expected, what actually happened,

9
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:58,799
and what seems to be shaping up as explanations for what actually happened and then what it's going to be going forward.

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,170
And by then, I hope I'm triggered some questions you've got because this is a in many ways a

11
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:09,030
very predictable election and in many other ways an extremely strange election.

12
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:15,180
And one of the things muddying the waters is that for reasons not entirely, I have theories, but for reasons not totally clear to me.

13
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:22,799
A lot of the media went off on sort of full narrative over the last month that was really not backed up by any obvious facts.

14
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:28,890
That's really confusing. And so what are your expectations in a midterm election?

15
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:36,120
In one of your articles, the White House is expected to lose because essentially most voters do not have the level

16
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,170
of sophistication and understanding of the American political system that you all do.

17
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:44,550
And they tend to overstate the power of the president.

18
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:51,959
So the president, even if the president is quite limited by all sorts of factors ranging from the does the president control the House and Senate?

19
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,660
Does the president has strong poll ratings, whatever, whatever.

20
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:01,260
Voters tend to look at whatever is bothering them and say that's attributable to the president's party.

21
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,090
What this means is that the president is a blame magnet as elections tend to go against the president's party.

22
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:17,010
And so Democrats down the line in particular do better. You expect on average since World War two that you're going to lose two senators and

23
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:23,660
about 40 odd members of the House from a midterm election when it comes to party.

24
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,750
There's a number of other hypotheses. One of them is simply that people are happier right there.

25
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,700
They're demobilized, sort of. They won the White House. They don't need to worry anymore.

26
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:36,360
Right? Obama's in the White House. They don't need to worry of 2010. Trump's in the White House.

27
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,650
They don't need to worry about Republicans in 2018.

28
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:48,100
Now there's also just ten generally reversion to the mean, which is the basic fact that like it's a triviality,

29
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:52,490
it's an apology, but as long as there is a bayonet, you're going to keep getting things that reinforce around it.

30
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,870
The problem is that doesn't give you a predictive variable. It's just two things. It happens.

31
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,440
And there's also what we call thermostatic analysis.

32
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,059
The THERMOSTATIC is that voters like to keep public policy around a given place.

33
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,020
So there are very, very long term consistent patterns in what American voters want.

34
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:14,110
But look, it's one of the paradoxes you find in public opinion that individual voters don't make a shred of sense.

35
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:21,760
Right? Their opinions aren't stable about anything, and they certainly don't fit coherent ideological categories like they might be quite passionate.

36
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,600
When you're about something to change sides, the next voters in the aggregate, however, really have quite stable preferences.

37
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,969
The variation in questions on should everybody have a right to a job or should everybody have a right to health care?

38
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,380
Or should we intervene in other countries like we had very, very stable results over decades?

39
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:45,970
On the big questions, what that means is it triggers this thermostatic thing typically in which voters perceive the.

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,290
Party in the White House to have gone too far and then react against it.

41
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,750
So there's at least three things that potentially are going on, right? One is that you'd mobilize you would expect to mobilize Democrats.

42
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:02,180
One is that you would expect people to mistakenly attribute everything going wrong in their lives to Biden,

43
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:08,540
even if he has nothing to do with their problems. And one is that they will look at Democrats and say, honestly, that looks like less great overreach.

44
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,000
I think it's time for some more conservatives in office, which.

45
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:20,170
All of those amount to difficult to test, but predictions that you would see the Democratic losses that most people were expecting.

46
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,630
Finally, there's economic variables.

47
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:29,960
By and large, one of the most powerful things to predict any election outcome is household income growth in the two quarters before the election.

48
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:37,350
Now, the problem is when we say things like that, the run of elections where we have reasonable data goes back to basically the sixties,

49
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:43,080
which as any statistician or economist will tell you, is a grotesquely underpowered equation to predict.

50
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:53,070
Furthermore, the American economy has not been behaving in a way that fits within anybody's predictive models, like ask the stock market.

51
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,440
That's the political science, because, for example, household income growth is doing great.

52
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,040
What else is higher than we've seen in our lifetimes, mostly?

53
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:13,810
Inflation. So on one hand, your income is going up, and other hand your expenses are going up, unemployment is going down.

54
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:21,420
We're having extremely strong labor market, which you're seeing from all the different sort of things that depend on your pay service sector workers.

55
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,530
It's not working anymore. Why do we have a cafe anymore?

56
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:28,350
They can't find anybody to work in a cafe so they can replace it with some sort of automat.

57
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,150
That's the American economy in a nutshell. First, the cafe would randomly close because the workers would show up.

58
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:38,940
So now they're going to eliminate the cafe entirely because they think for the long haul they would get on the price of coffee.

59
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:46,780
This results, though, in breaking models that basically took unemployment,

60
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,250
household income growth and said that's going to gauge people's happiness rates.

61
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,630
And the basic model was if your household income growth is going up, then you support the party in office.

62
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,680
First of all, your household income means something different in a time of inflation.

63
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:04,630
Secondly, the labor market has been contracting and expanding over the last couple of years like nobody gets.

64
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:09,900
So the economic models just kind of broke. We did not have a clear prediction.

65
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,910
And furthermore, bear in mind that there's a bit of a class dimension, because what does inflation do?

66
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,380
It erodes the value of capital.

67
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:23,650
That means that if you have capital, if you have wealth, you're very interested in inflation because it diminishes your wealth.

68
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,580
If you don't have any capital, you're much more likely to be interested in your income in a job.

69
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:37,810
So roaring labor market, which is pushing up incomes across the board while simultaneously diminishing the value of wealth.

70
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,410
Guess what?

71
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:46,100
That's actually going to systematically hurt people who already voted Republican and systematically benefit people who already voted Democrat.

72
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,330
So in other words, we have a number of nice political theories reversion to the mean or a static,

73
00:06:54,600 --> 00:07:00,720
demobilized Democrats, angry Republicans, all of which would say that you should expect to lose seats.

74
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:09,000
We also have that Biden should expect to lose seats. We also have economic theories which make perfect sense until 2020 or 2022,

75
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:13,590
at which point the American economy starts doing things to people that we've never seen before.

76
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,969
And oddly enough, the models start to kind of not give you any big prediction.

77
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:22,200
Right. We subtract the inflation rate from wage increases.

78
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,550
Maybe, maybe not. We're trying to understand how the economy works.

79
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,750
Anyway. That all amounted to a lot of case for the narrative the Democrats were going to lose.

80
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:39,260
And there's been one election, which was 1998, in which you actually saw an incumbent party,

81
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:45,380
White House incumbent party gain seats in a federal mid-term election. So history was with anybody who said the Democrats will lose.

82
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:52,440
What actually happened. But what was predicted.

83
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,470
So in the Senate, which was 5050. It is now, as you see, 5049 and it's gone to a runoff in Georgia.

84
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,990
Even if the Republicans candidate, Herschel Walker in Georgia wins.

85
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,890
That's just going to be the status quo in the Senate, which is 5050.

86
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:18,140
Now, this already matters a lot. If the Republicans try to impeach Biden, it's going to fail.

87
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,990
Meanwhile, the Biden administration can keep getting their judges approved so long as the Senate is 5050.

88
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:27,730
Furthermore, we don't really know what's going to happen. It happened in Georgia.

89
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,910
Georgia is kind of a newcomer to the national decisive election scene.

90
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:42,680
It's a single seat run off with is extremely Trumpian and frankly I would blood candidate Herschel Walker against Democratic incumbent.

91
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:47,959
We really don't know what this is going to do to turnout. We don't know what this is going to do to donor behavior, etc., etc.

92
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:55,280
Right. Walker is I don't know how to describe her, but she's sorry.

93
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:03,680
Anti-abortionists. Abortionist. Yeah. I mean, he he opposes abortion, except for the woman he's directly coerced into having one, I guess.

94
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,829
Anyway, he's a former University of Georgia football star,

95
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:11,870
so one of the meanest and most sophisticated ads I've seen in the cycle was a whole bunch of people with,

96
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:16,099
like, virtual locker jerseys inside University of Georgia for helmets and stuff.

97
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:21,470
Say that's where Herschel Walker belongs on my wall, in my memories, not in the Senate.

98
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,930
Such brutal ad, we genuinely don't know what's going to happen in Georgia.

99
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:34,340
What happens in Nebraska, is that an appointment or does that go to a special election because Sasse is leaving?

100
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,030
Yeah, I don't actually know. Probably.

101
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:41,930
I mean, you tend to assume this is going to be a special election. We're going to come to that in the case of the House.

102
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:48,260
And who's afraid to is that Senator Ben Sasse stepped down to become the university president, Florida.

103
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:56,060
I heard something saying that like the football game was going to have a big influence on the Georgia Senate election.

104
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,550
And I was like, I know that he played for during it, but I guess I was confused in the context of what that meant,

105
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:07,330
which football game some sort of Georgia like football game would influence.

106
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:12,750
I think the same thing. Yeah, I was just like really confused about like said, I'm a journalist struggling to come in.

107
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:18,349
There is a little bit of it, but it tends to be on kind of higher profile get into that.

108
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:22,340
So the best data we have about the influence of sporting events is that it's governments

109
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:26,750
in countries that care about soccer win when their team does well in the World Cup.

110
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,219
But it's only when they seem to see some sort of a boost over predictions.

111
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:38,690
But the problem is we need to manufacture a counterfactual election in which the country doesn't win the World Cup and otherwise is the same.

112
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:41,690
And by now we're getting very close to the real speculative fiction.

113
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,879
So and there's also just a question. Like, on one hand, the borders of a certain age.

114
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,100
No. Herschel Walker is a University of Georgia star.

115
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:58,980
But does that necessarily translate like if Tom Brady were running for Senate, would a University of Michigan victory today change his chances?

116
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,820
I mean, admittedly, Tom Brady achieved a lot of other things in a lot of other places since leaving Michigan.

117
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,740
But. Okay.

118
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:17,100
So it's down to Georgia on the Senate side, over on the House again, we would have expected something on the order of 30, 40 minimal losses.

119
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:25,020
And there have certainly been elections where we saw and instead, as you see, it's been a week and we're still not with the Republican majority.

120
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:34,080
Furthermore, realistically, a House majority of a couple doesn't really exist pretty much continuously.

121
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:43,560
So seat is empty in the house for some reason. Somebody dies, somebody resigns, somebody gets sick and resigns, etc. Somebody gets indicted, resigns.

122
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,090
So what we're looking at in the house is probably a slim Republican majority.

123
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,350
This is going to be absolute chaos, right?

124
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,780
The House does not work in the same way as the Senate.

125
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:01,770
So, first of all, that means the majority is going to be bobbing up and down, depending on who's in, who happens to be in the building that day.

126
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,320
Secondly, it means the majority is going to be very manipulable. Right.

127
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:10,890
So if a Democrat from Georgia, for example, suddenly dies or becomes capacitated,

128
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:17,340
that gives Governor Ron DeSantis incentive to simply not schedule an election to replace him, which DeSantis has already done.

129
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,299
So we've already had quite a narrow house over the last two years.

130
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,709
A lot of cases where governors were trying to manipulate their control over election

131
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:30,690
timing in order to try and shape the overall majority in the House of Representatives.

132
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,550
So first of all, the house result is not stable, but that everything is going to matter so much.

133
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,219
I can I'm pretty confident that we're going to see at least one episode when somebody is almost completely dead,

134
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:46,510
is being wheeled in in a wheelchair to vote one last time for whatever party is dominant.

135
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:54,130
The second thing is that the House is a combination. You find a lot in politics of a very top down organization.

136
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:03,730
You go along to get along. With centralized leadership, but the centralized leaders are really accountable to sort of huge factions of the caucus.

137
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:09,690
So here's the problem. The Democrats have been really, really unified under Nancy Pelosi.

138
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,800
I think a lot of people have been lulled into a sense that this is what American parties are like.

139
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:24,310
We're going to go back to what the Republicans look like under Obama, above all, where a large part of the Republican Party,

140
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:31,239
notably the Freedom Caucus, which is a minimum of 40 people, are going to be wielding their power in order to try to achieve their basic goals,

141
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:35,590
which, for example, include at the moment a threat to repeal Medicare, Medicare,

142
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:41,380
Medicaid and Social Security at the price of refusing to extend the debt limit, which would trash the world economy.

143
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:49,700
Are they going to actually do it? I don't know. Do they have the voting power to unseat the speaker of the House?

144
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,750
Unquestionably.

145
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:58,340
So, for example, what this means, first of all, that you could have an extraordinarily weak Republican speaker of the House is the likeliest outcome.

146
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,450
As you can see, it's not guaranteed you'll have a Republican speaker of the House.

147
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:10,070
But I would be quite surprised if you didn't. But this person is going to be extraordinarily weak because he or she cannot lose any votes.

148
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:17,630
And it's one thing if you need to lose 40 votes, that's a big rebellion. But it's another thing if two votes will do it.

149
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,840
And that's entirely likely. You're already seeing moderate Republicans coming out and saying, well, actually,

150
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,200
there was a set of things that the Freedom Caucus wants and I'll vote against it.

151
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:32,190
And so the Freedom Caucus votes against for it and I vote against it.

152
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:37,950
It falls just like that. The Freedom Caucus voted against it. Little by little, tiny margins mean a lot matters.

153
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,430
So you're going to have variable size majorities.

154
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:47,880
Every Republican in the House is going to be empowered individually in a group to pursue what they want.

155
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:51,420
This is a recipe for extremely weak leadership.

156
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,940
What this means. It's hard of the house is going to be a running embarrassment.

157
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,080
Now, the house would probably be a running embarrassment to Democrats if they were in charge of it.

158
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,580
But one, they're more unified. And two, it's not likely to be their problem.

159
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,760
So if you look at the demands coming out of the Freedom Caucus,

160
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,110
things like committees should get to elect their own chairs, which would be radically decentralized.

161
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:17,610
And what would happen is you would find people of a given ideological agenda flocking into one committee,

162
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:23,190
another, taking it over and doing all sorts of weird stuff which would grind the house to essentially motion.

163
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,890
Mr. Oakeshott I'd be very,

164
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:31,380
very surprised if you actually saw basic legislative functions coming out of the House of Representatives for the next two years.

165
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:37,020
I would be moderately surprised if putative Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy

166
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:41,310
actually makes it through all two years without serious damage to his political career.

167
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,630
And there's also a reasonable chance that they actually don't manage to elect the speaker of the House at all.

168
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:54,260
I could be. Because if you have a two vote majority and one person gets a migraine and one person

169
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:57,890
decides they're playing some complicated political game and want to vote for Mickey Mouse,

170
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:05,520
you don't even have a speaker of the House. Welcome to the majority, guys. So it's going to be chaos in the house.

171
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:12,690
Roll down the gutters. Michigan's a particularly exciting state.

172
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:19,799
We now have the first Democratic trifecta since 1983, which you would attribute to the end of gerrymandering in the state.

173
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,240
Basically, Michigan became a more competitive state in a year that was good for Democrats in Michigan,

174
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:31,350
and the result was the first time that you haven't had a Republican legislative majority in both houses since 1983.

175
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:35,570
Part of the reason Democrats had a good year was the other referendum,

176
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,180
in particular Proposition three, which essentially attracts Roe versus Wade of law.

177
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,760
It was very interesting to watch the last days of that campaign because the argument being made on television

178
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,700
by opponents of Prop three was that abortion is already constitutional in Michigan and Prop three is radical.

179
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,570
You think about how political rhetoric works. That was a very interesting thing to say.

180
00:16:55,640 --> 00:17:00,290
Afterword. The Bishop of Detroit came out and called for Catholics to have a day of fasting because

181
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:03,860
clearly they'd done something very wrong would be punished with this legislative outcome.

182
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:09,310
But beforehand, the main argument was actually this is like a radical entrenching trans rights.

183
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,700
And so it was kind of the patient was being made in the last days by the ads against corporate.

184
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,629
You see a number of other states which have flipped.

185
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,670
But the thing I want to draw your attention to is the extent to which there's a whole set of jobs,

186
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:29,490
notably secretary of state, but also governor, which are really crucial to holding a free and fair election.

187
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:36,420
This is this basically bananas American model in which you elect partizan officials to run elections.

188
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:44,879
And in 2020 what I'm not overstating the saved American democracy was a very, very large number of politicians,

189
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:49,050
of both parties who refused to accept Donald Trump's thesis that he'd actually won the election.

190
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:54,550
Well, we know what states are almost certainly going to be the knife edge states at the next one.

191
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:57,940
Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona.

192
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:08,150
Probably Nevada. In that listing, almost all of the jobs that would be have to be occupied by collaborators of Donald Trump.

193
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,969
The Republican candidate was clearly a denier of the 2020 election results and a collaborator of Donald Trump.

194
00:18:14,970 --> 00:18:18,470
And essentially each of these cases. Pennsylvania governor. Arizona governor.

195
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,730
Arizona Secretary of state.

196
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:28,690
Across these jobs, the only one that is held by a Republican and one who is not especially close, especially close collaborative.

197
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,570
Trump is the governor of Barbour.

198
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:41,650
It therefore just became radically harder for Republicans to effectively challenge the state level election results in 2024.

199
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:48,710
This is a very big deal. Because if you'd had, for example,

200
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:56,120
a secretary of state in Arizona who refused to certify the results from heavily Democratic areas on the grounds that there had been massive fraud,

201
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:03,680
that would be more or less teeing up exactly the circumstance under which you would be able to go to the House of Representatives and say,

202
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,590
let us actually certify a set of results for Arizona,

203
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:13,610
at which point you've started very clearly the road towards the House of Representatives, elected the president instead of the voters.

204
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:21,740
So that's why it matters a lot on that. I have no idea whether it's going to make it easier to get a driver's license in Arizona or we've

205
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:29,880
got to register a vote and all the other things Secretary Spitzer do in terms of the effect on I.

206
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,020
Therefore, he's going to have a far, far easier ride. I still wouldn't rule out an impeachment of the House.

207
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:43,730
But remember, the House is going to be pretty chaotic. So any impeachment process carried out in the House is going to look pretty awful on TV.

208
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,959
And as we learn now that we're getting into the habit of doing this on a regular basis,

209
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,520
an impeachment in the House simply means that the House says the president to the Senate for the trial.

210
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,620
The Senate then checks their party registration to check the president's party

211
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:03,059
registration available to acquit the president as the president is of the same party as,

212
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,770
let's say, Trump twice. So being impeached isn't a good outcome.

213
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:13,950
But it's also not the same things actually being removed from office because being removed from office is in the jurisdiction of the Senate.

214
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:21,330
Pass and be 5050 or 5149 Democratic Senate is not about to remove Joe Biden

215
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,810
actually requires a supermajority and I'm not retreat that many Republicans.

216
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,280
But it's going to get to keep nominating judges.

217
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:39,150
And Biden has been handed the comparatively easy problem of pointing to the House Republicans as an example of a total kindergarten, which.

218
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,840
They're going to look like a total kindergarten.

219
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:48,800
Mainly because, as I said, if you turn to House of Representatives, if you make every individual Pacific King of America,

220
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,950
which is what's about to happen, of course you're going to get a kindergarten.

221
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:56,450
It's not so much a part of the assembly as it is simply that's truth.

222
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,480
That a majority and too unstable. Four 2024.

223
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,920
Typically, you expect an incumbent president to win if the economy is in pretty good shape.

224
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,570
Again, go back to what I said about the economic explanations for this.

225
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:15,200
We have no idea what inflation is going to look like. We have no idea what household income growth is going to look like.

226
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:22,609
Those are things to watch. Still, for 2024, though, what this is suggesting is that you're going to get a free and fair election,

227
00:21:22,610 --> 00:21:26,270
which was by no means guaranteed when people started going to the polls on the go.

228
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:35,270
And it's going to be one that is substantially determined by the same old economic variables that explain most election of electoral outcomes,

229
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,880
which I would net out as a good outcome. You'll also have more Democrats on the defensive in the Senate.

230
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:44,120
But this fight doesn't have huge coattails.

231
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,690
But he has some. So why?

232
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,490
What seems to have happened? Well, there's a couple of them.

233
00:21:54,850 --> 00:22:01,130
First of all, there's candidate quality. This is what you're seeing now as a lot of the political debates going on.

234
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:07,260
Candidate quality is a term for well, they really follow what happened in the Michigan governor's race.

235
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:13,040
There were a couple of established, quote unquote, quality candidates, meaning they had name recognition.

236
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:17,600
They didn't have any particularly obvious skeletons in the closet. You know, they were pretty good on the stump.

237
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,299
They had some practice in politics, you know,

238
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:26,780
and they both hired the same canvasing firm to get the requisite number of signatures to be on the ballot.

239
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:34,550
And in both cases, the canvasing took their turn, took turns, canvasing firm, took their money and then faked the signatures.

240
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:41,840
And then they got caught, which ruled out the two highest quality Republican candidates in the state of Michigan,

241
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,310
which then led to this ridiculous primary which eventually ended in two takes.

242
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:49,160
It was essentially zero experience on the stump at this point.

243
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:54,229
Donors looked at her and said no, which is how it was that six weeks out from the election,

244
00:22:54,230 --> 00:23:01,340
she had a staff of two at 26 times less money than Gretchen Whitmer, that's called the party, looked at her and said, this is a bad investment.

245
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,849
We're out. We're going to go sharp. J.D. Vance in Ohio with our money.

246
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:10,130
We're not going to spend money on this candidate. Same thing with I don't know quite how.

247
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:16,729
Describe the Republican secretary of state candidate. But again, it she was not what you would call a high quality candidate, practice, fit skills.

248
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:21,580
They were very, very experienced. And it showed. We saw this across a bunch of races.

249
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:26,050
Herschel Walker is a really weak candidate. The guy lies all the time.

250
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:30,640
He's I think I think his helmet wasn't good enough.

251
00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:38,290
Something is wrong with this man. And furthermore, he has a lot of views that turn off a lot of the swing voters in Georgia.

252
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,920
So you're voting for Herschel Walker as a proxy for Donald Trump in Georgia,

253
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,420
has a record of showing that that's not actually enough to necessarily cruised to victory in elections.

254
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:51,820
So what's the candidate quality problem? It's being primarily blamed on Donald Trump in two ways.

255
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:55,630
The first is that Donald Trump would sort of choose candidates based on what works for him,

256
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,740
and those candidates weren't necessarily the best fit for the most competent.

257
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:03,339
They were the ones who were convinced Trump that they were a good combination of likely

258
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:07,569
to win and likely to support Donald Trump in whatever Donald Trump is trying to do.

259
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:14,380
It is a back up problem, though, which is that take, for example, Pennsylvania,

260
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:21,550
where you had Dr. Oz, who, as I think everybody in Pennsylvania learned in Pennsylvania,

261
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:28,810
one of the great things the Fetterman campaign did was they actually got him nominated to the New Jersey Hall of Fame.

262
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:33,669
Watching what Fetterman did on social media probably didn't change the race,

263
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:37,270
but it was certainly very enjoyable in terms of modern campaigning either.

264
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,850
Versus a hedge fund dude who had been a very effective financier.

265
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:50,240
AB And really went full. MAGA And, you know, made the cover of Bloomberg as an example of, you know, how to go for.

266
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:57,630
And Trump chose for reasons best known to Trump. Dr. Oz was in many ways a highly experienced candidate.

267
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:03,140
You know, he went to a supermarket and held up a veggie tray, called it preview day,

268
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:09,890
and he went to a Penn State tailgate and had a nice glass of red wine surrounded by all these rowdies with beer at 11:00 in the morning.

269
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:14,750
But he just kept on doing things that said, you have not through how to cut through how you're supposed to campaign.

270
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,560
In other words, poor candidate quality, even if he's very good at it, selling quackery on television.

271
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:31,720
So. The deeper problem, though, is that you run for a significant office by this point in a lot of states that need state senate or state legislature,

272
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:37,000
it's going to take at least a year of your life. Right. If you want to run in 2024.

273
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:41,680
You you put on your gown, you get your clothes actually into it.

274
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:46,690
If the second year want to run in 2024, like they graduate and they start campaigning,

275
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:51,519
that they start fundraising, they started meeting influentials, they start talking to relative religious leaders.

276
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,010
They start by your appetite to get to the media.

277
00:25:54,700 --> 00:26:00,490
It's at least a year of full time activity, which, among other things, involve people being rude to you consistently.

278
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,030
Okay. That's not that much fun. But you do it because you think you might win, right?

279
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,010
Do you do it?

280
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:20,200
If you are fully aware that Donald Trump could come in and completely destroy the effects of your entire year's worth of hard work with one sense.

281
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:31,530
No, you do not. So what's driving down the candidate quality is that unless you're 100% confident that Donald Trump is going to be your supporter,

282
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:35,560
and I don't recommend being that confident about Donald Trump's political strategies,

283
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:39,999
you could waste an incredibly expensive and unpleasant year and have it all be

284
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,630
destroyed in October by Donald Trump deciding that you might still turn it over to you.

285
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,190
That's the thing undermining candidate quality. It's not just directly, but Oz was not a good candidate.

286
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:55,819
It's also that a system in which Donald Trump can push us over the top is a system in which so much

287
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,570
power is concentrated at Donald Trump that a lot of people who could win the game normally say,

288
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,570
I'm not going to try to win that game. Right with you.

289
00:27:02,570 --> 00:27:06,559
Try to be a professional sports player if you are fully aware that the referees

290
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,820
could decide to add 15 or 20 points to the game based on who you would not.

291
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:19,920
What do you think the odds are of having somebody become the Democratic nominee is Biden's.

292
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,820
What are the odds of somebody becoming the nominee who's got Biden has a lot.

293
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,290
I think we honestly don't know.

294
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:31,799
So, first of all, Joe Biden is good at politics and I am one of the many political scientists who has sort of soul searching,

295
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,220
which is how this guy was literally in elected office my entire life.

296
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:43,950
How we managed to underestimate him and like I could explain the electoral coalition that put into office.

297
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,720
But underestimating Biden's skill of politics has turned out to be an extraordinarily bad bet.

298
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:56,050
Like take the student loan forgiveness. All of the economists who drove the Obama administration's thinking said it was a terrible idea.

299
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,020
Right. What is anyone going to do? $10,000. You don't have the rich. That was basically the economic thesis.

300
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:08,260
You might not agree with it. Discuss it with Jason Furman. I went ahead, did it.

301
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:15,520
A lot of people noticed and they were specifically people who in many ways it was younger voters who were directly targeted by that,

302
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,680
who pushed by the Democrats all the time. He's an extremely old president.

303
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,160
We know that. He looks fragile.

304
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,510
There is a sort of a gigantic meme about Biden being, you know, sort of old, not really remembering where he is.

305
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,950
It doesn't help that he's a stutterer,

306
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,550
which means that he has a kind of particular way of speaking that you adopt if what you're doing is controlling, stuttering.

307
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:45,370
That is a part of like the broad that you'd say is that if you have an incumbent president who can actually campaign at all,

308
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,920
as you expect that incumbent president to stay.

309
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,670
Furthermore, it's not entirely clear what would happen if the Democrats assumed Biden could try to run.

310
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:59,940
He'd be wounded by a primary campaign against him.

311
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:05,730
So let's say Harris resigns as vice president, runs against him as vice first to the presidency.

312
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,680
She almost certainly loses because he's the incumbent. You don't need any more facts, although you wish.

313
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:18,300
If you wish to add facts to that, you can add her political career is over because if she loses, if he loses, she's going to take the blame.

314
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:25,760
If she wins and she loses, she's also going to take the blame for passing the United States back over to Donald Trump.

315
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,770
Do you want to take that risk? I'd say if I gave up 20, 28.

316
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:40,240
So let's say unless Biden has something seriously bad happen to his health, in which case Harris is the presumptive Democratic candidate.

317
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,660
You're not likely to see a challenge. I think you might very well see no challenge at all,

318
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:50,120
because one of the striking things about Democrats compared to 20 years ago is it's a really, really unified party.

319
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:58,919
I close. I remember I just told you the House of Representatives are going to be complete kindergarten with five or six Republican majority.

320
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:04,590
Pelosi has run the House for two years on a five majority. She has a much more unified party.

321
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,319
So I would be surprised.

322
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:14,219
But again, I'm capable of looking at actuarial tables, which is why I don't want to say with certainty if I were 20 years younger,

323
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:25,030
I'd say with certainty it's not going to be challenged. Other explanations again.

324
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:30,760
The economy. And remember, inflation hurts people who tend to vote Republican anyway because they have wealth.

325
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:39,490
Whereas jobs, both low unemployment and increases of the hourly wage tend to help people who are inclined to vote Democratic make them happy.

326
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,540
And then, of course, stops.

327
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:52,450
The dog's decision made something concrete that had been essentially an abstract conversation was relatively easy to avoid.

328
00:30:54,040 --> 00:31:00,670
And what Dobbs did is it suddenly brought home very suddenly and abruptly what abortion rights actually means.

329
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:05,440
It had been primarily conversation around sexual and bodily autonomy, which is.

330
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:10,190
But back then got framed. It just sort of what's your stance on Loose Women?

331
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:16,729
Like that's what a lot of the conversation about it, too. And the problem is, it never was a debate about that, but it got framed as that with Dobbs.

332
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,870
Suddenly, it's not that anymore. Something we're talking about a topic pregnancy, something we're talking about rape.

333
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,350
Suddenly we're talking about a very large number of cases that had not been frank as the core of the abortion issue.

334
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,079
So this is wobbly because I've only seen two studies on it,

335
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:40,320
but the single American demographic that appears to have swung hardest in favor of Roe versus Wade after Dobbs was.

336
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:48,809
Others. I don't think you need a sophisticated theory of human nature.

337
00:31:48,810 --> 00:31:52,700
Right. If you're the father of a daughter. Okay.

338
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:00,110
And if you're father, a son, great. So he does something stupid and the result lasts forever.

339
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:05,290
Also not so attractive. So that's in a sense, a nice example insofar as it bears out.

340
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:13,490
Like I said, today is a little squishy. It suggests that that's kind of bringing home a lot of micro behavior.

341
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,980
And you see that in increased turnout relative to the midterm normal function that about six different groups.

342
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:25,880
So anyway, expectations were bad for Democrats with the districts, with the economic variables, didn't point in a clear direction.

343
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:35,390
The results are really good for Democrats. The effects, apart from, you know, changing Michigan and Seismically and a couple of other states,

344
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,510
is that Biden is in much better shape to both get things done and run.

345
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:43,310
The House of Representatives is likely to be a nominally Republican led embarrassment.

346
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:50,630
The Senate is going to continue much as before, but possibly with a reduced role for Senator Joe Manchin, depending on the Georgia runoffs.

347
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:59,569
We can't predict the Georgia runoffs because a single race between a Democratic senator and an explicit Trump proxy with a lot of baggage is very,

348
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:04,090
very hard to predict. Explanations seem to be a combination of.

349
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:08,210
There is a limit to how well Trump endorsed candidates do.

350
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,530
A lot of them ran significantly below other Republicans who didn't have Trump endorsements.

351
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:20,280
Trump himself in 2016 frequently ran below other Republicans, meaning there were a lot of Republicans who are turned off by Trump because of that.

352
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:28,609
And that combined with the fact that the economic variables were not unquestionably bad,

353
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,939
despite the big media narrative and the fact that jobs really,

354
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:38,280
really hit the American electorate very dramatically and made a lot of people angry and also made a lot of people reconsider their party.

355
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:48,970
That's my short summary of what happened. Ask questions. I have.

356
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:56,300
This might be a dumb question, but there are hundreds questions what can happen during the lame duck session?

357
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:09,639
So I don't like any policy that gets passed in one House, in the House or the Senate kind of get wiped clean when the new session starts,

358
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:17,690
or at least theoretically, the lame duck House Democrats pass something that gets passed by the Senate later this year.

359
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:23,830
When the House passed something before we have the inauguration of the next House, the Senate.

360
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:27,819
Remember that on the Senate race. And then it gets picked up. The answer is basically no.

361
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:33,100
But the lame duck is always a really intense session. I think the Democrats had all made their holiday plans with this in mind.

362
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:38,800
So essentially, if it's a Republican House, it's not going to do anything.

363
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:43,960
They don't have the time to do something like a whole budget. But for example, they can change the debt limit.

364
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:50,860
Which is this kind of nuclear weapon that the Freedom Caucus is trying to persuade Republican leadership to use.

365
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:58,040
They can insofar as they're worried that the House Republicans are not committed to Ukraine, they could send it.

366
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:00,940
They can legislate a gigantic new package of arms for Ukraine.

367
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:05,080
These are all things that you could get through the House and the Senate in a couple of months.

368
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:11,380
I don't think that our elected representatives are going to be seeing a whole lot of their families this Christmas and New Year's.

369
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,989
Like I said, the two things that are probably highest on the agenda,

370
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:23,220
because they're the things where Democrats can't lock it in and assume that the next two years will just be a comedy,

371
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:27,540
are going to be arms for Ukraine. So I wouldn't be surprised if you saw a very,

372
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:33,150
very large package authorizing expenditures on support for Ukraine and the debt limit, as everyone knows, the debt limit is.

373
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,630
Okay. So let's say that fast forward a month or two.

374
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,030
You know, you have the holidays. You know, you look after yourself a little bit.

375
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:49,530
You give people nice gifts, flu somewhere. You come on, you see the credit card bill and you're like, man, I got to get control of my finances.

376
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:55,520
This spending is excessive. I'm not going to pay the credit card company.

377
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:02,060
You can see the flaw in this logic. It's the flaw deduction.

378
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,060
Basically, Congress, as you know, authorizes and then appropriates money.

379
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:12,919
The money is then spent insofar as the money doesn't come out of taxes.

380
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,680
The money being spent has to come out of somewhere.

381
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:21,030
And that is the issuance of Treasury bills, which one of the most important financial things in the world economy today.

382
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:24,230
They're basically the equivalent of gold in the real world economy.

383
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,790
The debt limit is has been created by Newt Gingrich for a specific political purpose.

384
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,550
Before I tell you what the specific political purpose Gingrich was thinking about is.

385
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:43,430
What it does is it's Congress authorizes the Treasury to issue enough debt to cover the expenditures that have already been made.

386
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:48,320
That's why I made the credit card analogy. The United States has already spent the money.

387
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:51,830
Now we need to issue debt in order to balance the books.

388
00:36:52,820 --> 00:37:02,160
And the debt will be sold. Don't worry. This vote, therefore, means that Congress has to say explicitly, we want the debt to be this big.

389
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,870
If Congress does not vote to renew the debt limit expires.

390
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,250
And the first thing that happens is that federal treasuries start rolling over because there's a constant

391
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:17,680
kind of vast amount of treasuries they have that they get paid off and new treasuries are issued.

392
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:24,760
If the debt limit is not raised, basically federal treasuries lose their credibility and we have no idea what would happen.

393
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:28,870
But it is not remotely unreasonable to say this would destroy the world economy.

394
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:34,900
As in, like my honest advice to you is that, step one, if it looks like we're going to review the debt limit,

395
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:39,420
go to an ETF and get as much cash as you possibly can. Followed by go to a grocery store.

396
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:45,580
Gas up your car. I'm not joking here. This would be a financial cataclysm that we have not seen before.

397
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:51,290
Read The Financial Times. If you want to find out some of the hair raising scenario planning,

398
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:55,250
the banks and other industries are doing it because it basically sees the entire global monetary system.

399
00:37:56,370 --> 00:38:01,259
So why do we have this vote? It doesn't change government expenditure because the expenditure was authorized.

400
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:01,800
It expanded.

401
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:11,040
The purpose of the vote was to allow Newt Gingrich to force Democrats to vote regularly in an embarrassing way for a very large federal deficit.

402
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:18,510
It was a way to force Democrats to go run attack ads say Democrat so-and-so voted for a very high debt limit.

403
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,590
This is a brilliant idea if you're Newt Gingrich and you're in opposition, right.

404
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:27,740
Because now what you're doing is you're forcing the Democrats to take regular symbolic votes for an enormous national debt,

405
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,900
and then you cut the odds against them. What happens when you're in power?

406
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,300
Well, when you're in power, you get people like the Freedom Caucus who say, actually, this is brilliant.

407
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:43,540
All we have to do is to vote against the debt limit and therefore destroy the world economy.

408
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:48,820
And if we don't get our way. So if you will chip like that, you get anything, right?

409
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,440
So you had this very,

410
00:38:52,440 --> 00:39:01,020
very unstable problem in which the Republicans would frequently have this very large faction who wanted to use the debt limit as a bargaining chip.

411
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:07,590
And you kept on getting some combination of Democrats and non rebel Republicans pushing this through.

412
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:13,740
You had all these hair raising votes, and each time there was a genuine chance that the result would be the destruction of the world economy.

413
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:20,040
So one of the things that they might very well do in the lame duck session is take the hit and pass a

414
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,380
high or extraordinarily mind bogglingly high debt limit simply in order to get this off the table.

415
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:34,919
Because I don't think anybody fully knows or appreciates just how bad it could be if you wreck the treasuries market overnight,

416
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:44,729
if the United States defaults on its debt. But there are people who are very aware of Grover Norquist and Bill Kristol,

417
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:49,350
the most associated with the strategy that since the public blames the president for disastrous.

418
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:55,050
If you create an absolutely stupendously large economic disaster, that means the Democrats probably lose the next election.

419
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:03,590
The problem is the disaster would be of such a scale that that calculation probably wouldn't work and B would be extremely questionable,

420
00:40:03,590 --> 00:40:07,280
unethical, unpatriotic grounds. So probably do the limit.

421
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:12,639
Is it a duck? And they're going to set a debt limit, which is not likely to be hit again,

422
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,820
which means that the House of Representatives is not going to be tasked with the

423
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,240
jobs of being grown ups and maintaining the basic structure of the world economy,

424
00:40:19,570 --> 00:40:23,270
because the amount of chaos that we see is dysfunctional.

425
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:29,320
So they're going to do I don't know, because what this suggests is simply a.

426
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:34,220
A House of Representatives that does not legislated, therefore, and everything but does not legislate.

427
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:40,430
So people who follow any political newsletters like the health of the health to or to I think it's called from the Post is very good.

428
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:45,500
Everybody affiliated with the Democrats and everybody who's trying to avoid partizan affiliation

429
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:50,230
like medical societies is racing to try and get their priorities stuck into anything passing.

430
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:56,780
Because they recognize that the odds of anything whatsoever passed, regardless of your preferences, are extremely slim.

431
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:06,790
Assuming that the Republican Party does control the House and Senate 2017, I recognize this is a little more of a speculative question,

432
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:09,849
but their strategy for a long time they've been talking about all the investigations

433
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:13,809
they're going to do and divide and assign and to the origins of COVID,

434
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,340
which I don't even know what the purpose of that is.

435
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:24,940
But if it's as it seems like, they might have trouble even having this be Speaker of the House with Kevin McCarthy because he's lost a lot of support.

436
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:30,070
How does that affect all of those planned investigations with a decentralized leadership?

437
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,010
Basically, Benghazi, the Benghazi strategy,

438
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:39,860
which is to constantly investigate Hillary Clinton wants to do she is the Democratic presumptive nominee and they're going to do it again.

439
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,970
Obviously, Hunter Biden is lined up. And, you know, if this if this had been a typical election and you were you know, we were looking at,

440
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:54,580
say, 53 vote Senate and Republican Senate and a, you know, 260 Republicans in the House.

441
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,330
I would have said all, but if you watch that, it's going to be impeached.

442
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:02,080
So Survivor, [INAUDIBLE] be impeached. Like I would have just taken that as given.

443
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:07,810
Instead, what they going to try and do is investigate on the theory that if you generated enough smoke, the voters will assume that there's fire.

444
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:14,730
First of all, it seems to be working less well. But secondly, that depends on the House functioning, right.

445
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:22,990
And if you have a weak enough leader of the House, then for example, what the Freedom Caucus is asking for is extremely decentralized committees,

446
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:26,110
and then they'll take over the committee on specifications and just to get the

447
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:31,180
heck out of Hunter Biden and try to get media attention and so forth for that.

448
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:36,680
Is it going to work? Frankly, this stuff is working less and less well.

449
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:44,030
They're running essentially the Whitewater Clinton playbook, but it's against first of all, the public has become jaded.

450
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,870
Second, a lot of this stuff, even if it's a real problem, comes off as tinfoil hat.

451
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,420
Like, really weird. What are you talking about?

452
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:58,430
And so, you know, people who talk about Benghazi break down Benghazi, the electorate breaks down into very,

453
00:42:58,430 --> 00:43:05,200
very hard core Republicans who follow every twist and turn very, very hard core Democrats who insult Republicans for doing that.

454
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:08,360
And a vast amount of the population has no idea what this whole thing is about.

455
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:15,079
It's barely heard. So the more you decentralize the house, which is what the Freedom Caucus is asking for,

456
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:19,190
the more you're going to get committees clashing with each other and doing all sorts of other things.

457
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:25,489
I would also add that to a degree that is unusual in world politics or American history,

458
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:31,550
the connection between the entertainment industry and the Republican Party is extremely intimate and they don't have the same incentives.

459
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:37,880
Foxes incentives are not necessarily Republican victories. Foxes incentives are things that make people watch television.

460
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,770
And fear and anger are best produced in opposition.

461
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:49,940
This is why fundraising for pro and anti abortion organizations always varies exactly with who's in the White House.

462
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:55,249
So it's not really clear that the media machine that is necessary to turn an investigation

463
00:43:55,250 --> 00:44:00,260
into a scandal is actually aligned with what the House Republicans would be doing.

464
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:05,420
And it's also not clear that the House Republicans have the party discipline to keep

465
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:09,290
their investigations from falling on top of each other by tripping over each other.

466
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:15,470
So we don't know whether we're having a hunt by our provide story or a story about eldercare territory, COVID 19 or something.

467
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:28,810
I was curious what your thoughts were on Trump's planning, his candidacy announcement soon, and the implications of that given what we saw last week.

468
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:33,219
The latest rumors tonight? Yeah. Okay. Blanket.

469
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:41,390
Thesis. I don't know what's in Donald Trump's head, but the guys aren't. As it afterword, you can figure out why what he did was smart ahead of time.

470
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:51,040
I at least usually capable of anticipating the Republican basically the Republican way to model the Republican Party,

471
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:55,669
I would say, is that there's one plurality faction.

472
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:59,740
Remember, Trump won a plurality, not a majority of Republican voters in 2016.

473
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:07,660
They didn't really have a primary in 2020. So there's never been any particular evidence that Trump is actually a particularly strong candidate.

474
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:12,340
Right. Trumpian candidates and Donald Trump regularly run below.

475
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:20,800
I can't underline this enough. More normal Republicans that you've never heard of election after election 2016, 2018, 2020.

476
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:27,190
There's literally a Trump penalty in general election outcomes for a whole lot of candidates, including Donald Trump.

477
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:36,840
Including, if not clear, that for a variety of reasons, Hillary Clinton has been one of the most mind bogglingly unpopular candidates ever.

478
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,329
While Trump was the other most mind bogglingly popular candidate to stand out

479
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:45,770
if he tweeted like American public credit history for being unpopular people.

480
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,640
I'll leave it to you to figure out why she had a few chats about that last few years.

481
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:56,320
So Trump. And his candidates frequently look like electoral liabilities.

482
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,419
Ohio should have been a slam dunk, and instead they had to put all the money into Ohio that could have gone to, you know,

483
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:06,340
saving Michigan or whatever because they had this guy bounce who they had to work hard

484
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:11,350
to save and they couldn't save us and they couldn't save the Masters in Arizona,

485
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:12,100
etc., etc.

486
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:21,550
Furthermore, Trump has had one straightforward electoral competition, which was 2016, and he did not win a majority of Republican primary voters.

487
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:29,139
So what this adds up to is that you have a weak general election candidate with support of a plurality,

488
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:31,420
but not a minority of voters within his own party.

489
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:36,670
So the question is how does Trump become such an immensely important figure in the Republican Party?

490
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:43,390
And it's two things. One is that there's no alternative set of Republican actions that can coalesce into a coalition against him.

491
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:48,430
There's no other set of actors with an identity who has figured out and articulated.

492
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:56,020
The best that we saw was Ted Cruz, which was the classic if you're not a conservatives Republican and a Republican is a conservative syllogism.

493
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:01,800
And the attack was Trump isn't conservative enough. And that persuaded some voters in 2016.

494
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:05,290
But again, not a majority, not a large enough majority to block Trump.

495
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:14,629
So the way to think about it is that Trump sits on 40, 45% of the party and the party sits on 40,

496
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:21,950
45% automatically of the nation, as if both of the parties have a Florida 4340 5%.

497
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:29,430
And that's enough for him to be more or less unopposed leader of the Republican Party,

498
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:33,360
despite the fact that he's not that popular within the party and he's not actually that popular in

499
00:47:33,370 --> 00:47:39,570
the country at this candidates is even less popular that he is side states that will be Christian.

500
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:47,100
Right. I think it's still his party like Ron DeSantis is being talked up and the whole Murdoch media machine is turned against him.

501
00:47:47,110 --> 00:47:53,320
First is the New York Post and its Fox Wall Street Journal. Murdoch is clearly shorting Donald Trump, but he's got to snap.

502
00:47:54,240 --> 00:48:00,780
First of all, DeSantis, I can't describe this, but you've all seen I'm sure lots of he's the governor of Florida, right.

503
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:05,730
If he just had a thumping reelection. Not the media narrative.

504
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,260
He ran 1.8% points ahead of Marco Rubio, who nobody thinks is Trumpian.

505
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:17,060
The deal is fractionally more popular in a red trending state.

506
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:21,710
It's somebody who is not affiliated with Trump. It is not being discussed as the future of the Republican Party.

507
00:48:22,220 --> 00:48:26,800
So we don't have a lot of evidence that DeSantis is a particularly strong candidate when he goes national.

508
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:31,030
I think we might be surprised. Maybe he will excel and maybe he will come off as weird.

509
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,190
But one of the points I make is that the current alternative to Trump.

510
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:40,600
Watch the. He's stolen Trump's own gestures.

511
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:44,530
It's going to be the weirdest debate in history because DeSantis mirrors Trump.

512
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:50,280
So pull up DeSantis campaign ads. He's using exactly Trump's hand gestures.

513
00:48:50,290 --> 00:48:53,530
I'm trying to remember a Trump hand gesture, but somehow behind his back, which is my way.

514
00:48:54,490 --> 00:49:04,720
I'm like, Oh, right. So it's the best you've got is a governor who is not doing stupendously well in his own election campaign,

515
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:14,000
who in many ways has pitches that he's Trump the more competent and whose literal public persona is modeled on Donald Trump.

516
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:21,230
You feel all that you feel how lucky you feel. You ought to take that to the casino people.

517
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:28,310
So it's probably trumps you could very well see a 2024 rematch.

518
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:34,510
Which is why I went on to such lengths that.

519
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:39,580
Because if it's a rematch, it's going to be a 2020 grudge match.

520
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:45,080
And it's going to be a situation in which a lot of things are slowly but steadily getting worse.

521
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:48,260
Right. The Trump electorate is very clearly defined.

522
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,400
Probably the single largest bloc of voters in U.S. politics. But on the other hand,

523
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:57,919
they're also about a voting bloc of voters whose policy and cultural preferences

524
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,070
turn off a lot of other blocs of voters who could theoretically be quite gettable.

525
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:17,430
But how significant how significant is the difference between a 5050 Senate Democratic majority?

526
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,150
The difference between a 5050 and a 5549.

527
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:28,590
So has we had the country run for two years? 5050 means that the table is cast by the Vice President, Kamala Harris.

528
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:35,340
What this means is that to do anything, the Democrats have to have a consensus of all the Democratic senators.

529
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:40,620
So, you know, the liberals and progressives among you have aneurysms.

530
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:44,999
When I say the words mansion sentiment, because you have these two senators in the Democratic side.

531
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:50,910
Joe Manchin is from West Virginia. He's a remarkably coherent politician.

532
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:58,680
If you liked Michigan football long ago, we hired Richard Regas from West Virginia and Manchin launched an all fronts publicity at the time,

533
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,100
governor of West Virginia, watching all fronts publicity war on Regas,

534
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:09,839
which really spoiled his arrival in Ann Arbor because Manchin apparently believed that it was appropriate

535
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,629
for the West Virginia coach to leave West Virginia without the say so if the governor of West Virginia.

536
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:19,290
Now, that's not actually the Constitution of West Virginia, but Manchin really to extract itself from energy anyway,

537
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:23,790
Manchin gets elected in West Virginia, which no other Democratic could be doing for a lifetime, is probably.

538
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:30,010
So he and he also makes a certain kind of sense. Crystal Cinema is busy trying to become the next John McCain.

539
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:31,850
Nobody really knows what she's trying to do.

540
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:41,760
Like nobody like nobody understands the strategy because she currently runs far better with Republicans in Arizona than she does with Democrats.

541
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,850
This is a formula for electoral destruction because what it means is the Democrats will support a

542
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:52,319
primary against her and Republicans are not going to turn out to Democrats just to vote for Kristen.

543
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:55,680
So they will thank her for her service and then vote for a Republican.

544
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:00,120
What you expect them to do. So it's anybody's guess what senator thinks she's doing,

545
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,500
but her political career is going to end after one term in the Senate is by far the likeliest outcome.

546
00:52:05,250 --> 00:52:09,380
So those two basically exerted tremendous control over everything.

547
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:14,520
The past, like the final structure of all the by era legislation of voting rules,

548
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,600
had to include every preference of sentiment actually matter, not nonsensical.

549
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:24,250
And the whole theater of it was designed in particular for Joe Manchin, its preferences,

550
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:28,389
because I think Manchin has decided to run for reelection and his classic way to do it is to say,

551
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:32,710
I'm with you on the issues, but I'm going to keep the crazy left wing national Democrats for doing something stupid.

552
00:52:33,950 --> 00:52:39,290
Admirably in terms of optics, I suppose in 2014, anyway, he ran for reelection.

553
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:45,590
He ran for election. West Virginia senator, having been governor by shooting a rifle into a copy of the Affordable Care Act.

554
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,660
Can you get clear optics for that? You know, of course.

555
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:58,710
Fights to defend the. So these two have been driving Democrats crazy because the whole rest of the party is unified.

556
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,350
If you go to 51. You can draw one.

557
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:10,569
So, for example, one of the big fights over the near expenditures was that mansion wanted everything paid for.

558
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:15,420
Mansion cares deeply about the deficit. Cinema didn't want to raise taxes on their donors.

559
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:23,250
So Manchin would say I could agree to this, which includes tax rises on rich people and of would say, no, don't raise taxes on rich people.

560
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:26,280
And this is just kind of idealistic. Right.

561
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:32,040
Well, you drop one of them, you can either go with Joe Manchin and spend more money on things people like and tax the rich.

562
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:38,370
Or you could go with cinema and not tax the rich, you know, spend less money on things people like, but you get the flexibility.

563
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:43,290
And Walker is a very smart politician in terms of what he's attached his name to.

564
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:51,210
So he's probably a contribution to the thinking of enough caucus. Actually he is a contribution despite being extremely generous.

565
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:57,380
I was going to ask just in discussion about Ron DeSantis,

566
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:02,670
have you seen any evidence in this election of Republicans winning the culture war is for might be

567
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:08,430
around a stand off as to issues the leftist things in our kids and critical race theory of America.

568
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:12,360
I don't see any evidence that either of those perspectives.

569
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:16,680
Is that all persuadable? In Michigan, Arizona, Nevada.

570
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:22,860
Even Ohio. And sponsors. It's was service like think in terms of that.

571
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:28,710
Here's a little thing. I matter. So here's one axis.

572
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:33,000
Left to right. So here's AOC or whatever.

573
00:54:33,450 --> 00:54:37,170
And here's my next segment in 2016.

574
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:44,100
Unexpectedly our national political elite, especially the people who are rightfully so,

575
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:48,870
traumatized because they thought were going to end up around here with Hillary and suddenly we want him.

576
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:51,900
They drew the inference the real America is here,

577
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:58,080
which is why the New York Times has been more or less nonstop resident in a diner in Ohio talking to three Trump voters since 2016.

578
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,569
Like every Obama two Trump voter, I swear, has his own private New York Times.

579
00:55:03,570 --> 00:55:11,100
The Washington Post reports that today in a sign of bipartisan company, but then afterward he had barbecue for lunch,

580
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:17,429
which is a sign the barbecue is ceasing to be a Brooklyn preoccupation and regaining its status as the sign of a confederacy of America.

581
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:22,530
Working class politics, stupid. Here's the other axis.

582
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:31,880
I care versus to what? Here's the problem.

583
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:46,320
If you're me or a Washington Post political reporter, your world is this and people who care deeply about politics.

584
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:52,020
Most of America actually lives further down here.

585
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:59,820
So if you're into politics, what you always need to remember is that politics is like a professional sport you don't really follow.

586
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:06,589
So think of a sport that you know exists of people around you, but you really don't care about care what?

587
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:11,629
Tennis, hockey, football, whatever. You just don't follow. But you know, some things, right?

588
00:56:11,630 --> 00:56:18,800
You know what team pertains to the city. And you generally have some inkling of if they're doing well and if they go to the playoffs,

589
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:21,080
you generally have some clue that they'd gone to the playoffs,

590
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:25,400
at which point you switch off long enough to learn the name of the coach and a couple of players or something, and then you switch off again.

591
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:30,950
That's politics for most Americans. What the Republicans have fallen into it.

592
00:56:30,950 --> 00:56:36,290
This is partly because they're so tightly linked to Fox, to the conservative media ecology, I would hypothesize,

593
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:44,420
is that they spend a lot of time up here and basically an argument talk, political Twitter or, you know, arguments on Tucker Carlson or whatever.

594
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:50,820
And things that work up here don't have the same logic as things that work all over here.

595
00:56:51,750 --> 00:57:00,479
So, for example, have you come across the litter boxes in classrooms that you don't destroy the box?

596
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:11,940
Or should I just say, like people were claiming that teachers were allowing letter boxes in classrooms because certain students,

597
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:16,410
like identified as cats and people are basically like knocking that.

598
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:20,370
Exactly. It was it was the statement that in all seriousness,

599
00:57:20,460 --> 00:57:25,240
Hartlepool school boards were putting litter boxes in in classrooms for children

600
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:30,180
to identify as cats and a sign of what you'd call the locus of rubbish.

601
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:33,090
Now, the actual story, when you trace it back,

602
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:40,050
was that the kids that you keep in classrooms in play in case of mass shootings include kitty litter because you needed to mop up blood.

603
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:46,900
So it's actually a reflection of American culture and politics, but in a slightly different sense.

604
00:57:47,610 --> 00:57:51,450
And you find this in a lot of schools, right? Sort of. It's kind of a little kitsch involving things you need.

605
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:56,340
If somebody starts shooting children in your classroom and I quote some cat litter, Kettler is great for mopping stuff up.

606
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:05,750
This somehow gets turned into local school districts are persuading our children that they're calves and that if Floyd's on to the bathroom, maybe.

607
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:11,450
Okay. So first of all, you're actually in the upper, let's say, collectively docile of American political.

608
00:58:11,810 --> 00:58:16,760
How many of you had any idea what I was just talking about? Great.

609
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:24,340
So if you're up here screaming back and forth about litter boxes in classrooms.

610
00:58:25,490 --> 00:58:28,760
How well. Where are you that everyone else here thinks you're nuts?

611
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:41,840
Getting too caught up in your own media environment isn't really hazardous. So the culture wars were what they chose to run on.

612
00:58:42,650 --> 00:58:46,970
And, you know, I mean, that certainly made working in elementary schools a great deal less fun than I think it used to be.

613
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:50,960
But in terms of actually winning elections, it's not doing well. Right.

614
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:56,060
Go back to Ron DeSantis for all the culture wars, around 1.8 points ahead of Marco Rubio in a red state.

615
00:58:56,630 --> 00:59:02,660
That's not great. And a lot of the really weird stuff just fell flat.

616
00:59:03,260 --> 00:59:06,680
Because, remember, Fox's incentives aren't necessarily for Republicans to win.

617
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:19,659
Apropos of that, by the way, there's a lot of research that suggests that a homogeneous organization made up of smart

618
00:59:19,660 --> 00:59:23,640
people will make worse decisions and a diverse organization made up of less smart people.

619
00:59:23,650 --> 00:59:31,139
It's modeling so you can insert any intelligence you want. And you could argue that one of the Republicans problems is that they're much less able to

620
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:36,960
anticipate the effect of their electoral ideas because they're a much less diverse organization.

621
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:42,450
Democrats have a lot more people who come from different parts of American society and are

622
00:59:42,450 --> 00:59:46,260
able to anticipate what is it is not a good basis on which to run a political campaign.

623
00:59:46,830 --> 00:59:50,909
Republicans have had an extremely pronounced tendency to talk to themselves over the last couple of years.

624
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:56,300
And it's very. Yeah. I mean, like Benghazi and letterboxes and stuff.

625
00:59:56,570 --> 01:00:03,860
Like a lot of people don't really care. And the more you talk about something weird that other people haven't heard of don't care about,

626
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:05,900
the more they start to think you were actually tinfoil hat.

627
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:13,130
And it really spoils the message because you have people like Christie Campbell, the Michigan secretary of state,

628
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:16,850
going on about satanic thoughts and yoga as a satanic recruitment thing and people

629
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:19,700
like the secretary of state as if that were I get my driver's license renewed.

630
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:28,160
Why do you care about the opinion of yoga and the satanic Satanism yoga link, which is, to my knowledge, unproven.

631
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:32,900
It's somebody who you think of as the goddess, the people who register your book, like, what are we doing here?

632
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:40,480
And it doesn't play well. I was just curious what your thoughts are for when they're like, Oh, the runway is going to happen.

633
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:43,780
So they were talking about banning like abortion on a national level.

634
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:50,470
Like, what's the strategy now? Put it on the backburner or like in like try it, because obviously you're not going to get through the Senate race.

635
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:53,290
So Biden apparently has,

636
01:00:53,290 --> 01:01:00,300
as of today said he doesn't think that we're going to codify Roe versus Wade because it's not going to get through the Senate.

637
01:01:00,310 --> 01:01:07,360
Furthermore. Well, the House is going to be ungovernable. I think the odds of the House as it is in the hands of Nancy Pelosi are pretty much zero.

638
01:01:07,990 --> 01:01:13,390
So I think you're not likely to see any more national abortion legislation either way.

639
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:16,420
The issue is totally not going to go away, though,

640
01:01:16,930 --> 01:01:21,760
because you still have a bunch of states where Roe versus Wade has been struck down and they have previous legislation.

641
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:28,720
And this is going to not just produce. A whole lot of cases in the media of ten year olds who've been raped.

642
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:35,370
Can't get anybody to help them. It's also still we haven't stopped the arms race to come up with more and more penalties for abortion.

643
01:01:36,090 --> 01:01:41,459
And tapping that down is going to require that you change the political calculus of every Republican state legislator advisory,

644
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:45,840
and that might take some time. So I think abortion is absolutely not off the agenda.

645
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:50,280
It's just that we're not used to a world in which the Republicans are primarily defense.

646
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:54,570
And the way the issue gets framed and discussed by all the different politicians and media has changed a lot.

647
01:01:55,890 --> 01:02:02,700
I think you might very well see elite media say the debate's over and I think they'll be quite wrong because abortion is very,

648
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:06,389
very deeply woven into American life on both sides.

649
01:02:06,390 --> 01:02:10,920
Right. Should a Catholic bishop of Detroit. We have every Catholic fasting today.

650
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:19,280
In penance. I mean, well, there's a lot of people who can't get a basic standard of care.

651
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:24,860
I mean, my money is on the Cleveland Clinic opening up basically all their reproductive health services, if you like.

652
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:32,570
I would not be remotely surprised if we don't see an announcement of some fairly significant investments in health care in southeastern

653
01:02:32,570 --> 01:02:40,220
Michigan because people do not get jobs practicing OBGYN and MFM and so forth for the Cleveland Clinic to prescribe bed rest.

654
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:44,540
And that's what they're doing right now because they can't do anything else in Ohio.

655
01:02:46,350 --> 01:02:51,450
And so, you know, you sit down with map and you sort of say, all right, if I can't practice in Cleveland, where do I hope to?

656
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:59,200
So stuff like that's going to take a while to filter through. Any last question?

657
01:03:01,870 --> 01:03:04,629
By the way, don't let all of this make you sleep on what's going on in crypto,

658
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:08,650
which is so wildly funny that I just hysterically whenever I think of the topic.

659
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:14,490
It was really fun this week to do too.

660
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:22,090
Do you think the value you were talking earlier about how Donald Trump is smart?

661
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:26,350
Do you think that just by being the first person to announce right after the elections,

662
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:31,690
which is something I've never seen before, he's trying to crowd out anybody else that might potentially run against him.

663
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:39,850
Almost certainly. I mean, as far as I could tell, Trump has decided DeSantis is the enemy in trying to Santa says his nickname the sanctimonious now.

664
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:48,030
So you know the Trump's out to get you when you get your degree. And I think he's trying to spoil DeSantis his party.

665
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:52,749
There's also issues like the hypothesis that the Justice Department and various other

666
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:56,230
authorities are less likely to file criminal charges against him if he's running for president.

667
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,390
So he also has an incentive to act quickly. But I think.

668
01:03:59,910 --> 01:04:07,500
Forestalling the Santas is always probable is would certainly be a rational strategy for Trump combined with the fact that once he's a candidate,

669
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,430
he gets to hog the national media spotlight. And it's very hard to keep away from Trump.

670
01:04:12,210 --> 01:04:16,950
The effect of this, by the way, I'm not sure. I think the act might be getting a little bit old.

671
01:04:16,950 --> 01:04:21,960
It might be losing the entertainment value. Because the ultimate place for Trump to go is to get more extreme.

672
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:26,400
And the problem with extremism is after a while, it's out to everybody's taste.

673
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,960
So actually, I'm not sure that to your campaign is going to help Donald Trump.

674
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:42,920
Okay. Well, I hope this was useful to you. Thanks for coming.
