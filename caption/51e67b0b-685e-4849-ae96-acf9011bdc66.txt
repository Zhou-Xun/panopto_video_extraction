00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,120
Hi, welcome back.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:10,010
It's Krystal again, as a reminder, I use she/her pronouns and I'm one of the Career Services advisers at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:16,430
We've been talking about stand out resumes and we just reviewed the structure that can really help you to make a scannable,

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,250
well-organized, consistent document.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:27,140
The next thing we're going to look at is how do you make the content really shine and polished to fulfill those requirements of your resume,

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:32,970
those skills and qualifications that you have to do the job. So let's do some exploring.

7
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:38,110
First, we're going to think about what does customized content even mean?

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,190
So we're going to start with not even thinking about the resume as a whole.

9
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:46,480
We want to start with you, because you are going to be the center of your application process.

10
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,650
What are your unique selling points? What experiences have you had?

11
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:56,680
These can be jobs that were paid, unpaid, volunteer type things, or maybe even student organizations

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:02,260
that you were part of on campus, or activities that you've done outside of school altogether.

13
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:07,840
At this point in your career and really any point in your career, any experience is good experience.

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,060
If you feel like you've done something that shows a transferable skill based on the task that you've done,

15
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:19,720
you can include it on your resume. Employers really don't care if there's a differentiation between the paid and unpaid work,

16
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,820
as long as you have the skills and qualifications to do the job that they're asking.

17
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:31,750
One of the ways that we can help make this experience really clear to the reader is what we talked and hinted at in the last section,

18
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:35,710
which is tailoring the sections by different types of groupings.

19
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:43,960
This means really straying away from titles like professional experience, work experience or volunteer experience.

20
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,610
You'll note that all of those have really only descriptors that are based on paid or unpaid,

21
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:52,240
and again, me, if I'm an employer, I don't really care.

22
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,910
And so we'll be exploring ways to include additional or different adjectives to draw attention to the skills.

23
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:05,620
You'll remember from our past example, we had a section called Project Based Experience or Research Experience.

24
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,120
Think about how easy it would be, for you as a reader, if you had a job where it required

25
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,920
you have research experience, project management experience and for you to be a leader.

26
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:22,330
And then, an applicant turned into a section that had research experience, project management experience and leadership experience.

27
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,120
I don't even have to know any work to know that this person is qualified to see that they have what it is that I'm looking forward to,

28
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,420
at least, accept an interview into the next round.

29
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:38,840
Within these sections, we want to think about what those experiences are that most relate to the job at hand.

30
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:48,110
We want to think about similar type of job placements, tasks, or even the type of organization that it is. Of important note,

31
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:52,310
the order of a bullet point in the section is pretty important.

32
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,670
Most often we see that students will list their bullet points from

33
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:01,100
"I started with this" and "I ended with this", and maybe there's four different bullet points in between.

34
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:07,310
As your tailoring, you want to make sure to reorder your bullets to show the emphasis is placed by the employer.

35
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:11,060
So whatever their priorities are, are now your priorities.

36
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:18,980
Reordering the bullets is an easy way to show that you have read the job description and are really tailoring your document for any type of reader.

37
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,630
So some more practical advice on how to do this. When you're tailoring,

38
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:29,070
we are not recommending that you write a different resume for each and every job description.

39
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,020
Oh. Sorry about that. I skipped the hit.

40
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:40,020
So we want to make sure that we are creating a master document that has all of our experiences already written out.

41
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:44,240
Future you will thank you for this document, because you don't have to do the work in the heat of the moment

42
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:50,070
in the midst of projects that are due for school and applying for positions. As you're looking at positions,

43
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:54,540
you're going to review those job descriptions and do research on the company.

44
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,060
You'll want to note key words about how they describe themselves, the action that the position will be doing,

45
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,530
and the desired results for either the organization or the specific position.

46
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:08,430
You'll then, take your master document and highlight the relevant experience

47
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:12,660
that is a part of what you already have and how that relates to the position.

48
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:17,760
Remember, experience is not just about paid work. We're then going to reorder to focus on

49
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:23,430
our strongest information and infuse this with the keywords from our research.

50
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:28,200
Now, I'm not quite sure why this is a different bullet or a different page, but here we go.

51
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,140
So we're just going to keep on going.

52
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:39,760
So now that you've done the thought process about building this content that is related and tailored to the position itself,

53
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,700
how do you go about building that master document?

54
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:49,540
It begins with thinking about how to write really strong bullet points. And the way that our office recommends this,

55
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:57,730
and you'll probably find something similar at different types of career services offices or institutions, is something called the ACR format.

56
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:02,800
ACR stands for action, context, results, and it is a really easy way,

57
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:11,230
with questions considered to take the task that you've done as a part of your experiences and transform them into transferable skills.

58
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:20,540
So let's do a little bit more digging. We can begin with the action, where we think about what is it that you did for this task?

59
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,020
Oftentimes this is a very strong verb,

60
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,060
and there, let me tell you, there are hundreds of verbs that you can find on the internet with good old Dr. Google.

61
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,470
So if you do a search for strong resume verbs,

62
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:41,000
we can think about giving it a good scan and maybe that can trigger your brainstorming process or how you're going to

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,890
describe the task itself. Oftentimes, this is the easiest way to do a tailoring of a document for what the reader is looking for.

64
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:54,680
One of my favorite examples is the difference between created and developed.

65
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:02,090
Not really a difference there, but if the employer is thinking about what using the word created as opposed to the word developed,

66
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:11,060
you want to make sure that you are always hitting the opportunity to hit that key word by changing that small detail in your resume.

67
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:15,020
And of note, while we're thinking about these, the dates are important.

68
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:20,210
So any type of work that is ongoing or current, you're going to use present tense verbs.

69
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:26,240
And what we mean by that, even though it's a small detail, is not using the present participle verb, which is the -ing verb.

70
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:33,920
So if we think about like data analysis, you analyze the data in the present tense or if it is something that is completed in the past,

71
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,590
you have analyzed the data, because it's finished.

72
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:44,750
If there are tasks that you've completed as a part of a current position that are done,

73
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:52,070
you'll still want to make sure, because the roll is ongoing, to list them as present tense action verbs.

74
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:59,940
So next is the context, and the context is where we often see how something was done or the skills that are shown. To me,

75
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:07,380
this is the most nebulous part of a bullet point because it can vary so differently based from position to position.

76
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:14,160
So a few things to consider, would be the significance of the role, the constraints, and the scope.

77
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,560
The hard part is to think about the significance might overlap with the result section that we're looking at next.

78
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,840
But we do want to think, as we continue to frame it, again, that question of "how"?

79
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:30,750
Here, it can take a lot of different forms. Sometimes it means listing the different components of a larger skill.

80
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:40,560
So if I think about, for example, managing a dataset, that could be an example of through collecting, entering, and cleaning the data.

81
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,950
So managing the data set would be an option for the action, and then the cleaning, collecting, entering, etc.,

82
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:53,160
would be the context; because that gives me an idea of the steps that went into the role.

83
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,790
Oftentimes in the context we can see these -ing verbs show up,

84
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:01,200
and it's also, sometimes, an easy way to work in soft skills as a part of a job

85
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:07,770
description, like communication or problem solving or maybe even specific types

86
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:11,670
details like the population that you're working with or the scope of the work.

87
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:17,640
So, again, it's an opportunity to tailor your materials to what the reader is looking for.

88
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,700
The last step is the result, where "why the task was important"

89
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:33,240
is our main question. We want to ask ourselves what happened, or what improved, or what was the general end thing that came about as a part of the task.

90
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,940
There are often two types of results where it's quantitative,

91
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:42,060
where we know how much change happened or the specific, precise thing that happened as a result.

92
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:48,090
There's also qualitative ones which are much less able to measure,

93
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:57,120
and we want to think about what was the goal or purpose? And that will often lead to our qualitative component. For current tasks that are ongoing,

94
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,300
we could think about what is the expected or anticipated result to add this component to those items.

95
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,810
And we also want to make sure that is as accurate as possible.

96
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:13,530
Oftentimes, we see results as a way to show the value in the work that you've done to the future employer.

97
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:18,690
As a side note, the ACR method is definitely parts of different things that you've done.

98
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:27,240
Not all bullet points will have every single component, though we do recommend that students strive to have as many complete bullets as possible.

99
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:34,530
They also might not always come in the ACR order. Sometimes the results are so much more important or so much more powerful,

100
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:41,640
and so we want to lead in with those. If you have questions, I recommend reading your bullet point out loud and seeing if it makes sense.

101
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,660
We also want to remember that people do read from start to finish or left to right,

102
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,900
and so whatever the information is at the beginning of the bullet point,

103
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:55,680
we want to make sure that that is the most important and relatable component for the job that you're applying for.

104
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,950
Here's just a quick example of how we can use the ACR method to really flush out a bullet point itself.

105
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:06,360
You'll notice the difference between the weak and the best examples, are that there are a lot

106
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,670
more numbers and there's a lot more detail that is related to the words that we're using.

107
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,930
Oftentimes, if we don't have a number, we can include things like the,

108
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,710
again, the approach that we use or the soft skills that we have.

109
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:26,250
Also of note, is that in each of these cases, in the best example, "5", "175" and "95%",

110
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,170
these are definitive numbers.

111
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:37,290
We want to try to avoid things like "5+" or the little tilde for approximately 175 prospective members. In a resume,

112
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:44,250
it's very important to have concrete numbers and items to show that you are a reliable, consistent candidate.

113
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:49,320
Even though it might be better to have "5+", because "5+" indicates a larger number,

114
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,370
it shows that we don't have the exact item in front of us,

115
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:57,330
and so sometimes it's important to make an estimate and to go with it.

116
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:03,420
The likelihood of someone checking down to the detail for every bullet point and every specific number is very low.

117
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:12,430
So you want to do your best in estimating that number and giving us something that is really hard and firm to hold on to.

118
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:18,220
Outside of our experience sections, there are a number of options that we can include in a resume.

119
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:25,570
Some of these include our leadership activities, which we would recommend following the ACR format, to again, fill out those tasks that you've

120
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:31,240
done as a part of your leadership experiences to really demonstrate the skills. In these cases,

121
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,350
we would encourage you to make sure that you have included every position that

122
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:40,880
you can to maybe have the potential to show promotion within an organization,

123
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,780
for example, if you went from treasurer to president in your student organization.

124
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:53,770
We also want to continue to consider how these leadership activities are reflective of the position that we're going to apply for.

125
00:11:53,770 --> 00:12:00,880
So we want to try to, even if it's an unrelated experience, which has this I know I hate the idea of unrelated,

126
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,510
there's always some kind of related skill that you can show. The way that we do that, in these leadership experiences

127
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:15,670
and throughout your experience sections in general, is to use those keywords and tasks that the position is looking for.

128
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:21,160
The next section that is becoming particularly popular amongst our research populations or our

129
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,600
folks that are applying to grad school is the publications and presentations section.

130
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,580
Here, you have two different ideas. One of them is shown here where we have a different section of our resume called publications and presentations.

131
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,000
You'll note, that it is included in this section,

132
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:44,520
just like you would add a citation in a work cited page. The formatting styles such as MLA, APA, Chicago, etc.,

133
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,660
doesn't matter, as long as it's consistent throughout the section and within the document.

134
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:55,180
Another way to add a publication or a presentation is to add it as a bullet point, either underneath your degree,

135
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:02,380
for example, if you've published your thesis or planning on publishing that, or if it was a part of a job that you had. For example,

136
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,250
if you saw the research experience and you have a publication in process,

137
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:11,900
you could note that as a bullet point underneath the research experience that it was a part of.

138
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:17,990
Finally, we have our skills section. We definitely recommend that students include this whenever possible.

139
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:23,810
It's an easy way to summarize your skills, especially if they are not listed in the areas above

140
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:30,570
in your experience section. A good way to organize them is to base them on different types of groups of skills,

141
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:39,050
for example, software, programing and languages. In most cases, you'll want to include a proficiency marker, particularly with language,

142
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:45,050
as it indicates to the reader how well you could perform this skill in the job context.

143
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:48,410
We find that the languages section is particularly important for the proficiency

144
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:52,580
marker because you wouldn't want to overstate your skills or understate them.

145
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:57,980
So, for example, if I have included, Krystal is written-fluent in Spanish,

146
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:04,820
but if I entered an interview and they started speaking in Spanish to me, I would not be able to respond in a competent, professional manner.

147
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:18,220
And so if I were included in this on my resume, I might say, "Spanish: written proficiency" as opposed to native or advanced in my proficiency level.

148
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:25,330
And then finally, a note about hobbies. Hobbies are something that are very common in particularly business oriented fields.

149
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:29,650
This can help us make connections to recruiters or to hiring managers.

150
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:34,390
In most cases, our office would advise against including hobbies.

151
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:39,850
The primary reason for this is because then the students take away an opportunity to have a line that

152
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:44,980
is specifically related to the skills and qualifications that they have to do the job. Remembering,

153
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,300
that is the primary purpose of a resume. However,

154
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:54,640
in some cases we see that students need just one more line to fill up the page and they don't have

155
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:59,740
anything more that they could add or flesh out any more bullet points to make them a little bit longer.

156
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:07,480
In these cases, hobbies can be really helpful to help finish up that page or document. Another case when hobbies can be particularly important,

157
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:14,050
is if you know the person that you're going to be interviewing in, and you share something profound or interesting in common.

158
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:21,130
On a personal note, for me, this means marching band. I've coached university level college marching band for the last six years,

159
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:25,030
and if I knew that my interviewer is someone who is really passionate about the

160
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:29,350
marching arts or color guard or they've even been involved in the winter component,

161
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:34,150
I might include that as a way to help stand out among a competitive applicant pool.

162
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,250
But again, this is an exception to the rule

163
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:47,190
and in most cases we would not include hobbies, because it takes up space to show those skills and qualifications which are the primary purpose of the resume.

164
00:15:47,190 --> 00:18:30,690
Here, we're going to show a quick video about writing resume bullet points to sum up what we have just talked about.

165
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,840
All right, welcome back. So glad that you got to see that. Again,

166
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,210
I'm very happy with our animated videos and I hope that you could use it as a resource in the future as a quick reminder of the ways to help

167
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:48,320
write really stand out, excellent bullet points for your resume.

168
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,180
So now you've looked at the structure and you've fleshed out the different types of content and bullet

169
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:57,500
points that you want for your experience sections or any of the other sections in your resume,

170
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:03,620
let's do a final check. We want to make sure that primarily we begin with the formatting.

171
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,820
Is it easy to scan? Is it consistent? Have you maintained the white space to help the reader feel invited

172
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:17,260
and welcomed to look at your document? Have you only included relevant information or prioritized the items that are going

173
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:22,240
to help you to show those skills and qualifications that you have to do the job?

174
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:29,150
Furthermore, we want to think about have you infused the buzz words that are listed in the posting? This could be those value statements,

175
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:38,180
it could be the goals, how the project will be considered successful, and even the action verbs that are used to describe the tasks of each position.

176
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:46,490
Next, we want to consider have you used the ACR method to really draw the connection between the skills that you have and what they are looking for.

177
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:50,900
And finally, we want to make sure that we're making sure to show that we

178
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,010
are going to be a valuable employee to each of the positions we apply for.

179
00:19:55,010 --> 00:20:03,920
One of the ways that we do this is really focusing on the results that we've had, and show that we can do the things that the employer is asking.

180
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:09,300
Finally, just like any document, you want to make sure it's error free, concise and well written.

181
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:16,250
My favorite joke in career services. You always want to edit to make sure that there's not two T's on your butt, but only one.

182
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:23,780
Don't be that person. We also, in this case, want to make sure that all of our public health's have the L in them, because that's embarrassing.

183
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:32,480
So give it a good scan knowing that Gramarly and other word-like editing software may not catch all of our mistakes.

184
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:37,940
And so a good way to do this is to read it out loud to yourself, as silly as it might sound,

185
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:46,110
it's a good way to catch some of those mistakes that we might otherwise skim over, because we've looked at the document a number of times.

186
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:51,390
So that's it for me. Thank you for joining us on Stand Out Resumes and I hope that you're able to apply

187
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:57,521
much of this information to stand out as an applicant in your future job searches.
